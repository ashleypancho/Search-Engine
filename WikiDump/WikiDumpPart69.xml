      <text xml:space="preserve">== git and mercurial ==
Hi, this is really a right use case for collaborative writing. However, now Subversion isn't the most innovative tool for this. I am currently holding an SVN repository for whole my scientific work (articles, PhD Thesis, F77 codes, calculation results, etc.) One major issue really annoying with SVN is the requirement to work online. You can't commit/diff/log/etc while being offline (unless you are taking your repository with you). This is not an issue in the next generation version control systems - distributed version control systems. As examples, see GIT, Bazaar. I think that it at least can be mentioned in this article.
:Yeah, I'd be interested to see an article about using LaTeX with Git. Wouldn't hurt to diversify this article--[[User:Snaip|Snaip]] ([[User talk:Snaip|talk]]) 20:59, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
::I am about to write my PhD thesis (energy modeling) using [[w:Git_%28software%29|git]].  I used subversion for my MSc thesis.  Some material on LaTeX + git would be great.  However the current page looks very polished so I would suggest a new page.  Would be useful to include [[w:Mercurial|mercurial]] (hg) too. [[User:Robbiemorrison|Robbiemorrison]] ([[User talk:Robbiemorrison|talk]]) 17:30, 13 December 2010 (UTC)
:::I think the current page can be made much more encompassing without loss of precision. There really isn't a difference between any of these systems (git, hg, or svn) in how they ''track'' changes, more in how the user accesses those changes. Most (if not all) of the 'rules' presented about how to use LaTeX with SVN apply equally to either of the other systems. I feel a specific manual of how to use each system (how to commit, patch, diff etc.) is best left as a link to another resource. [[User:Glosser.ca|Glosser.ca]] ([[User talk:Glosser.ca|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Glosser.ca|contribs]]) 14:43, 28 July 2011 (UTC)
::::Regarding git, I would put in a strong recommendation for the &lt;code&gt;gitinfo&lt;/code&gt; package to integrate git and LaTeX. [[User:Robbiemorrison|Robbiemorrison]] ([[User talk:Robbiemorrison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Robbiemorrison|contribs]]) 06:44, 24 July 2012 (UTC)
:::::I definitely agree with a more neutral documentation of VCS. This whole page sounds like an ad for SVN. It's not really in favor of the book, especially in these times where SVN popularity is collapsing. And yes, this is no place for a VCS tutorial, only the basic commands for syncing and diffing should bo pointed out. It is really time for big changes in this document. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 18:23, 21 December 2012 (UTC)

== recommendations ==
We should mention [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexdiff/ latexdiff] somewhere.

The recommendations for line-length seem conflicting and unjustified. Why would you want to have everyone breaking lines at 80 characters? Works best to have paragraphs as single lines, then the user's editor (whatever it is - vim/kile etc) can visually break the lines appropriately for display only.
:The reason for that is that it simplifies the conflict handling when using revision control that's based on diff. However I personally don't see this as a problem, if two people have a conflict in a paragraph, I think it's best that the whole paragraph gets reviewed anyway. Line-only conflicts might cause structure errors more easily. Well, just a personal opinion. --[[User:Snaip|Snaip]] ([[User talk:Snaip|talk]]) 20:59, 27 October 2010 (UTC)

==noosphere and planetmath ==
I would recommend to mention noosphere which is the underlying software of the planetmath project. [http://planetmath.org/]. [[User:Oub|Oub]] ([[User talk:Oub|talk]]) 13:35, 27 April 2010 (UTC):

==Etherpad service==
Although the original service has been discontinued, a number of equivalent sites have been created - see [http://etherpad.org/ http://etherpad.org/] for details. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 18:22, 11 October 2010 (UTC)

== trackchanges ==

Anyone using [http://trackchanges.sourceforge.net/ trackchanges]?  I just started and it seems handy for collaborative work, especially with svn. [[User:68omalley|68omalley]] ([[User talk:68omalley|talk]]) 15:08, 4 November 2010 (UTC)

== WorkingWiki ==

I would like to mention [http://lalashan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/projects/index.php/WorkingWiki WorkingWiki], a free software package that implements collaborative editing of LaTeX documents in MediaWiki wikis, including full previewing and use of multiple interdependent source files.  - (WorkingWiki author) [[User:Worden.lee|Worden.lee]] ([[User talk:Worden.lee|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Worden.lee|contribs]]) 06:27, 6 March 2012 (UTC)

== Updating article for PracTeX ==

The editor of the PracTeX journal, Lance Carnes, asked me whether I am interested in updating my PracTeX article (on which this wikibook is based on) for a new special issue of the PracTeX journal. Is anyone interested in doing this together with me? If yes, please send me an e-mail (see http://www.arne-henningsen.name/). Cheers, Arne.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scene I==


The scene opens with LEONATO, ANTONIO, BEATRICE and HERO talking about men. They observe that DON JOHN was not present at dinner and how melancholy he looks. BEATRICE then introduces her favourite subject, BENEDICK, saying that if she were ever to find an ideal man he would have to be a mix between the two; either a more sedate BENEDICK or a more talkative DON JOHN. ANTONIO and LEONATO despair of her, saying that with her sharp tongue and fussiness she will never find a husband. The men have evidently told the women that DON PEDRO intends to woo HERO.


DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others arrive for the costume ball, all wearing disguises. DON PEDRO leads HERO away to woo her. Servant BALTHASAR and MARGARET flirt, which will become important later in DON JOHN's mischief. URSULA and ANTONIO have a joke. BEATRICE pretends not to know she is speaking to BENEDICK and takes the opportunity to insult him again, knowing that he would have to break disguise if he wanted to insult her back. The others all leave but for DON JOHN, BORACHIO and CLAUDIO. DON JOHN begins his mischief; he pretends to think that CLAUDIO is BENEDICK and tells him that he has overheard DON PEDRO seducing HERO for himself. Naive CLAUDIO is taken in by this and in soliloquy vows not to trust the beauty of women or his friends in matters of love again.


BENEDICK finds CLAUDIO to tell him that the prince has wooed HERO and everything is set. Still being upset and in no mood for BENEDICK's playfulness, CLAUDIO leaves. BENEDICK is not bothered, more interested in himself and how BEATRICE had not recognised him, showing both his pride and how much he wants BEATRICE to notice him.

      <comment>Changed &quot;./ultrasound left front right&quot; in &quot;./ultrasound_enable left front right&quot; at == Measuring Distances with the Ultrasound Sensors ==</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Khepera III robot runs an embedded Linux (kernel 2.6) with all of the most common Linux tools, except for program compilation. Hence, programs have to be cross-compiled on another computer with a arm-linux toolchain, and can then be copied using SCP and launched over an SSH connection. This is in principle quite straightforward for a Linux adept, but can be quite cumbersome when starting from scratch.

This is where the Khepera III toolbox comes into play. The toolbox can be understood as a Swiss Army Knife for the Khepera III robot, offering three different types of tools:
* '''[[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Scripts|Scripts to interact with the robot(s)]]''': A series of scripts are available to copy files on your robots, remotely execute programs, and do a number of administrative things. These scripts can deal with many robots in parallel, e.g. to copy a file onto a whole fleet of robots.
* '''[[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Programs|Programs for the Khepera III robot]]''': A number of small programs are available to play with the sensors and actuators of the robot.
* '''[[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Modules|Modules with standard functionality]]''': A couple of modules provide basic functionality that you can easily integrate in your own programs that you write for the Khepera III robot. Besides functions to read the sensors and configure actuators, there are also modules to parse command line arguments, simple odometry tracking, and so on.

The remainder of this chapter shows in a tutorial-like style how to do a couple of fancy things with the robot, using the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Scripts|scripts]] and the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Programs|programs]]. The [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Modules|modules]] are discussed in a later chapter.

== Preparing the Computer and the Robot ==

We assume that you installed the Khepera III Toolbox as explained in [[Khepera III Toolbox/Download and Installation|Download and Installation]] and that you are using a bash shell on a recent Linux system.

Switch on your Khepera III robot and [[Khepera III Toolbox/Network Setup|connect it]] to your computer. For the remainder of this introduction, we will assume that your robot is connected with a USB cable. If you are using a WLAN connection, simply replace the &quot;+usb&quot; with &quot;+ROBOTID&quot; (where ROBOTID is the number of your robot).

To check if everything is all right, type
 k3ping +usb
which will execute &lt;tt&gt;ping 192.168.1.2&lt;/tt&gt; for you.

Both your computer and the robot should be ready now - time to play with the robot!

== Remote Control with a Keyboard ==

Type
 cd Programs
 k3put +usb motor_initialize motor_stop motion_arrowkeys
to copy three of the motor programs to your robot. (Note that you will need to type the root password of the robot 4 times. This password is &quot;rootme&quot; by default.) As you can see in the terminal, this just launches ''scp'' commands.

Now type
 k3go +usb
and type the root password again to log onto the robot. If you now type &lt;tt&gt;ls&lt;/tt&gt; (on the robot), you will notice that a directory with your username has been created. This is a convenient way to avoid overwriting each others files if your fellows are using the same robot as well. Hence, cd into this directory and type:
 ./motor_initialize
 ./motion_arrowkeys
The first program will initialize the motors (e.g. set PID values) and then quit. The second program keeps running until you press Ctrl-C, and allows you to steer the robot with the keys '''W''' (increase speed), '''A''' (turn left), '''S''' (stop), '''D''' (turn right) and '''X''' (decrease speed) on the keyboard.

Note that when you quit this program with Ctrl-C, the motors will keep the last speed they were told. This is a general rule for all programs of this toolbox, and should be seen as a feature - not a bug. A program which comes in handy sometimes is &quot;motor_stop&quot;, which immediately stops the motors.

Once you have played enough with the robot, you can log out by typing
 exit
on the command line. This brings you back on the computer, to the place where you were before the &lt;tt&gt;k3go&lt;/tt&gt; command.

== Fun with the Infrared Sensors ==

Two programs are available to query the infrared sensors: ''infrared_ambient'' and ''infrared_proximity''. While the former simply reads all infrared receivers, the latter takes two consecutive measurements (once with the IR LED off and once with the IR LED on) with each sensor to estimate its distance to an obstacle.

Again, we first need to copy the necessary programs onto the robot. Assuming that you are still in the ''Programs'' directory, type
 k3put +usb infrared_ambient infrared_proximity
Then, log on to the robot (&lt;tt&gt;k3go +usb&lt;/tt&gt;) and cd to your directory.

Get an ambient IR measurement by typing 
 ./infrared_ambient
This will give you something like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$IRAMBIENT,0,31887,4080,4073,4080,4081,4093,4093,4094,4077,4094,4081,4094
&lt;/source&gt;
The first two values denote the sample number (starting at 0) and the current timestamp of the main microcontroller. All other values are in the range 0 - 4096 and correspond to one sensor on the robot. The sensors are numbered clockwise (when looking from the top) from 0 (back left sensor) to 8 (back sensor). Sensors 9 and 10 are the right and left floor sensors, respectively. On a sunny day, you can cover one sensor with a finger while taking another measurement, and you should see a clear difference between the values. Similar experiments can be made in proximity mode (&lt;tt&gt;./infrared_proximity&lt;/tt&gt;).

Instead of launching the command several times, you can tell the program to take several (here: 10) measurements in a row
 ./infrared_ambient -r 10
or to take measurements until pressing Ctrl-C
 ./infrared_ambient -r

=== Output Format ===

At this point, you may be wondering about the output format, notably the $IRAMBIENT the beginning of all lines. This is NMEA 0183, a very simple text-based communication format which has become widespread through GPS devices (which almost always use this format). More information about this format is written in the chapter [[Khepera III Toolbox/Parsing Program Output|Parsing Program Output]].

== Measuring Distances with the Ultrasound Sensors ==

The Khepera III robot is equipped with 5 ultrasound sensors which can be used to detect obstacles. When switched on, these sensors send out an ultrasound pulse and record its echo. Since the propagation of acoustic waves in the air is almost constant, this technique can be used to measure distances to objects in the environment.
Note that the story is slightly more complicated, though. What you record when sending out a pulse is a combination of a whole series of echos, reflected by various objects in the environment. Fortunately, the robot processes the signal for you and provides you the most prominent echos in the received signal.

Type
 cd Programs
 k3put +usb ultrasound ultrasound_enable
to copy these two programs onto your robot. Now log on to the robot (&lt;tt&gt;k3go +usb&lt;/tt&gt;) and cd to your directory.

Point your robot towards a wall and type
 ./ultrasound front
You will get something like this
 TODO
Each line corresponds to one received echo and contains its amplitude as well as the estimated object distance. In our example, we got a very strong echo  from an object at a distance of 0.98 m, and two less strong echos from objects at 0.45 m and 1.22 m distance. Note that the accuracy is in the order of a few centimeters, and you may get slightly different values each time.

By default, only the front sensor is enabled. To activate the left and the right sensor as well, type
 ./ultrasound_enable left front right
This program will configures the robot accordingly reports the active sensors. Now, you can also take measurements with the sensors on the left and on the right:
 ./ultrasound left
 ./ultrasound right

== Getting Help ==

To get help about one of the standard programs, simply invoke the program with the '''-h''' option:
 ./battery -h
Reading this help and a little bit of imagination should make the use of all standard programs straightforward.

== More Tutorials and Hands-On Exercises ==

For more tutorials, have a look at the [[Khepera III Toolbox/Examples|Examples]] section. These examples are written in such a way that you can reproduce them with your own Khepera III robot, and gradually learn more about it.

I thought the mayonnaise was a mixture of egg white with oil. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:190.166.29.142|190.166.29.142]] ([[User talk:190.166.29.142|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/190.166.29.142|contribs]]) 2008-01-24T09:09:42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:A classic mayonnaise is made with oil, egg yolk, and acid (e.g. vinegar, lemon juice). There are egg white versions, probably made from some irrational fear of nutrition or some such, but they don't stack up against a good yolk-based mayonnaise IMHO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note:''' Some illustrative figures still have to be added.

In general, a rigid body in three-dimensional space has '''six degrees of freedom''': three rotational and three translational.

[[Image:Rigid body attached frame.svg|frame|right|The position and orientation of a rigid body can be described by attaching a frame to it.]]
A conventional way to describe the position and orientation of a rigid body is to attach a frame to it. After defining a reference coordinate system, the position and orientation of the rigid body are fully described by the position of the frame's origin and the orientation of its axes, relative to the reference frame.

==Rotation Matrix==
A '''rotation matrix''' describes the relative orientation of two such frames. The columns of this 3 &amp;#215; 3 matrix consist of the unit vectors along the axes of one frame, relative to the other, reference frame. Thus, the relative orientation of a frame &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a reference frame &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;^{b}_{a} R \,&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
^{b}_{a} R =
\begin{pmatrix}
_{a}x^{b} &amp; _{a}y^{b} &amp; _{a}z^{b}
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
x^{b} \cdot x^{a} &amp; y^{b} \cdot x^{a} &amp; z^{b} \cdot x^{a} \\
x^{b} \cdot y^{a} &amp; y^{b} \cdot y^{a} &amp; z^{b} \cdot y^{a} \\
x^{b} \cdot z^{a} &amp; y^{b} \cdot z^{a} &amp; z^{b} \cdot z^{a}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Rotation matrices can be '''interpreted in two ways''':
# As the representation of the '''rotation''' of the first frame into the second ('''active''' interpretation).
# As the representation of the mutual '''orientation''' between two coordinate systems ('''passive''' interpretation).

The coordinates, relative to the reference frame &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, of a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, of which the coordinates are known with respect to a frame &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; with the same origin, can then be calculated as follows: &lt;math&gt;_{a} p = \, ^{b}_{a} R \, _{b} p&lt;/math&gt;.

===Properties===
Some of the properties of the rotation matrix that may be of practical value, are:
# The column vectors of &lt;math&gt;^{b}_{a} R \,&lt;/math&gt; are normal to each other.
# The length of the column vectors of &lt;math&gt;^{b}_{a} R \,&lt;/math&gt; equals 1.
# A rotation matrix is a non-minimal description of a rigid body's orientation. That is, it uses nine numbers to represent an orientation instead of just three. (The two above properties correspond to six relations between the nine matrix elements. Hence, only three of them are independent.) Non-minimal representations often have some numerical advantages, though, as they do not exhibit coordinate singularities.
# Since &lt;math&gt;^{b}_{a} R \,&lt;/math&gt; is orthonormal, &lt;math&gt;^{a}_{b} R = \, ^{b}_{a} R^{-1} = \, ^{b}_{a} R^{T}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Elementary Rotations about Frame Axes===
[[Image:Rotation about z-axis.png|frame|right|Rotation by an angle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; about the z-axis.]]
The expressions for elementary rotations about frame axes can easily be derived. From the figure on the right, it can be seen that the rotation of a frame by an angle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; about the z-axis, is described by:
:&lt;math&gt;
R_{z}(\gamma) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\gamma) &amp; -\sin(\gamma) &amp; 0 \\
\sin(\gamma) &amp; \cos(\gamma) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, it can be shown that the rotation of a frame by an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; about the x-axis, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
R_{x}(\alpha) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos(\alpha) &amp; -\sin(\alpha) \\
0 &amp; \sin(\alpha) &amp; \cos(\alpha)
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Derived in exactly the same manner, the rotation of a frame by an angle &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; about the y-axis, is described by:
:&lt;math&gt;
R_{y}(\beta) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\beta) &amp; 0 &amp; \sin(\beta) \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin(\beta) &amp; 0 &amp; \cos(\beta)
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Compound Rotations===
Compound rotations are found by multiplication of the different elementary rotation matrices.

The matrix corresponding to a set of rotations about '''moving''' axes can be found by '''postmultiplying''' the rotation matrices, thus multiplying them in the the same order in which the rotations take place. The rotation matrix formed by a rotation by an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; about the z-axis followed by a rotation by an angle  &lt;math&gt;-\beta&lt;/math&gt; about the '''moved''' y-axis, is then given by:
:&lt;math&gt;R(zy, \alpha, -\beta) = R(z, \alpha) R(y, -\beta)&lt;/math&gt;

The composition of rotations about '''fixed''' axes, on the other hand, is found by '''premultiplying''' the different elementary rotation matrices.

===Inverse Rotations===
The inverse of a '''single''' rotation about a frame axis is a rotation by the negative of the rotation angle about the same axis:
:&lt;math&gt;R^{-1}(z, \alpha) = R(z, -\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of a compound rotation follows from the inverse of the matrix product:
:&lt;math&gt;R^{-1}(zy, \alpha, -\beta) = R^{-1}(y, -\beta) R^{-1}(z, \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;


===MATLAB Example===
'''Note''': These examples require the Robotics Toolbox to be properly installed.
&lt;pre&gt;
theta = pi/2;
T_x = rotx(theta); % Returns a 4x4 pose matrix. The upper-left 3x3 submatrix is the
                   % rotation matrix representing a rotation by theta about the x-axis.
R_x = tr2rot(T_x); % Returns the 3x3 rotation matrix corresponding with T_x.
T_y = roty(theta); % A rotation about the y-axis.
T_z = rotz(theta); % A rotation about the z-axis.
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Euler Angles==
Contrary to the rotation matrix, '''[[Wikipedia:Euler angles|Euler angles]]''' are a minimal representation (a set of just '''three''' numbers, that is) of relative orientation. This set of three angles describes a sequence of rotations about the axes of a moving reference frame. There are, however, many (12, to be exact) sets that describe the same orientation: different combinations of axes (e.g. ZXZ, ZYZ, and so on) lead to different Euler angles. Euler angles are often used for the description of the orientation of the wrist-like end-effectors of many serial manipulator robots.

'''Note''': Identical axes should not be in consecutive places (e.g. ZZX). Also, the range of the Euler angles should be limited in order to avoid different angles for the same orientation. E.g.: for the case of ZYZ Euler angles, the first rotation about the z-axis should be within &lt;math&gt;[-\pi, \pi]&lt;/math&gt;. The second rotation, about the moved y-axis, has a range of &lt;math&gt;[-\pi/2, \pi/2]&lt;/math&gt;. The last rotation, about the moved z-axis, has a range of &lt;math&gt;[-\pi, \pi]&lt;/math&gt;.

===Forward Mapping===
Forward mapping, or finding the orientation of the end-effector with respect to the base frame, follows from the composition of rotations about moving axes. For a rotation by an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; about the z-axis, followed by a rotation by an angle &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; about the moved x-axis, and a final rotation by an angle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; about the moved z-axis, the resulting rotation matrix is:
:&lt;math&gt;^{ee}_{bs}R \, = R(zxz, \alpha,\beta,\gamma) = R(z, \alpha) R(x, \beta) R(z, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

After writing out:
:&lt;math&gt;
R(zxz, \alpha,\beta,\gamma) =
\begin{pmatrix}
c_\gamma c_\alpha - s_\gamma c_\beta s_\alpha &amp; -s_\gamma c_\alpha - c_\gamma c_\beta s_\alpha &amp; s_\beta s_\alpha \\
c_\gamma s_\alpha + s_\gamma c_\beta c_\alpha &amp; -s_\gamma s_\alpha - c_\gamma c_\beta c_\alpha &amp; -s_\beta c_\alpha \\
s_\gamma s_\beta &amp; c_\gamma s_\beta &amp; c_\beta
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note:''' Notice the shorthand notation: &lt;math&gt;s_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; stands for &lt;math&gt;\sin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; stands for &lt;math&gt;\cos \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.

===Inverse  Mapping===
In order to drive the end-effector, the inverse problem must be solved: given a certain orientation matrix, which are the Euler angles that accomplish this orientation?

For the above case, the Euler angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are found by inspection of the rotation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \textrm{atan2}(R_{13}, -R_{23})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \textrm{atan2}(-R_{23} c_\alpha + R_{13} s_\alpha, R_{33})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \textrm{atan2}(R_{31}, R_{32})&lt;/math&gt;

===Coordinate Singularities===
In the above example, a coordinate singularity exists for &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The above equations are badly numerically conditioned for small values of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;: the first and last equaton become undefined. This corresponds with an alignment of the first and last axes of the end-effector. The occurrence of a coordinate singularity involves the '''loss of a degree of freedom''': in the case of the above example, small rotations about the y-axis require impossibly large rotations about the x- and z-axes.

No minimal representation of orientation can globally describe all orientations without coordinate singularities occurring.

===Roll-Pitch-Yaw Angles===
The orientation of a rigid body can equally well be described by three consecutive rotations about fixed axes. This leads to a notation with '''Roll-Pitch-Yaw''' (RPY) angles.

====Forward Mapping====
The forward mapping of RPY angles to a rotation matrix similar to that of Euler angles. Since the frame now rotates about fixed axes instead of moving axes, the order in which the different rotation matrices are multiplied is inversed:
:&lt;math&gt;R(RPY, r, p, y) = R(z, y) R(y, p) R(x, r)&lt;/math&gt;

After writing out:
:&lt;math&gt;
R(RPY, r, p, y) =
\begin{pmatrix}
c_y c_p &amp; c_y s_p s_r - s_y c_r &amp; c_y s_p c_r + s_y s_r \\
s_y c_p &amp; s_y s_p s_r + c_y c_r &amp; s_y s_p c_r - c_y s_r \\
-s_p &amp; c_p s_r &amp; c_p c_r
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Inverse Mapping====
The inverse relationships are found from inspection of the rotation matrix above:
:&lt;math&gt;r = \textrm{atan2}(R_{32}, R_{33})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \textrm{atan2}(R_{21}, R_{11})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p = \textrm{atan2}(-R_{31}, c_{y} R_{11} + s_{y} R_{21})&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note:''' The above equations are badly numerically conditioned for values of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Unit Quaternions==
Unit quaternions ([[wikipedia:Quaternion|quaternions]] of which the absolute value equals 1) are another representation of orientation. They can be seen as a compromise between the advantages and disadvantages of rotation matrices and Euler angle sets.

==Homogeneous Transform==
The notations above describe only relative orientation. The coordinates of a point, relative to a frame &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;, rotated and translated with respect to a reference frame &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;_{a} p = \, ^{b}_{a} R \, _{b} p + _{a} p ^{a,b}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be compacted into the form of a '''homogeneous transformation matrix''' or '''pose (matrix)'''. It is defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;^{b}_{a}T = \left(\begin{array}{cc} ^{b}_{a} R &amp; _{a} p^{a,b} \\ 0_{1 \times 3} &amp; 1 \end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This matrix represents the position and orientation of a frame &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; whose origin, relative to a reference frame &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, is described by &lt;math&gt;_{a} p^{a,b}&lt;/math&gt;, and whose orientation, relative to the same reference frame &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, is described by the rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;^{b}_{a}R \,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;^{b}_{a}T \,&lt;/math&gt; is, thus, the representation of a frame in three-dimensional space. If the coordinates of a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; are known with respect to a frame &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;, then its coordinates, relative to &lt;math&gt;{a}&lt;/math&gt; are found by:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
_{a} p \\
1
\end{pmatrix} = \, ^{b}_{a} T
\begin{pmatrix}
_{b} p \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same as writing:
:&lt;math&gt;_{a} p = \, ^{b}_{a} R \, _{b} p + _{a} p ^{a,b}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the above vectors are extended with a fourth coordinate equal to one: they're made '''[[Wikipedia:Homogeneous coordinates|homogeneous]]'''.

As was the case with rotation matrices, homogeneous transformation matrices can be interpreted in an '''active''' (&quot;'''displacement'''&quot;), and a '''passive''' (&quot;'''pose'''&quot;) manner. It is also a '''non-minimal''' representation of a pose, that does not suffer from coordinate singularities.

===Compound Poses===
If the pose of a frame &lt;math&gt;\{c\}&lt;/math&gt; is known, relative to &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;, whose pose is known with respect to a third frame &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, the resulting pose &lt;math&gt;^{c}_{a}T \,&lt;/math&gt; is found as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;^{c}_{a}T = \, ^{b}_{a}T \, ^{c}_{b}T&lt;/math&gt;

===MATLAB Example===
&lt;pre&gt;
x = 1;
y = 1.3;
z = 0.4;
T = transl(x,y,z); % Returns the pose matrix corresponding with a translation over
                   % the vector (x, y, z)'.
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Finite Displacement Twist==
A pose matrix is a non-minimal way of describing a pose. A frequently used '''minimal''' alternative is the '''finite displacement twist''':
:&lt;math&gt;
t =
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha \\
\beta \\
\gamma \\
x \\
y \\
z
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are a valid set (any) of Euler angles, while &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates of a reference point on the rigid body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plate tectonics (from Greek τέκτων, tektōn &quot;builder&quot; or &quot;mason&quot;) is a theory of geology that has been developed to explain the observed evidence for large scale motions of the Earth's lithosphere. The theory encompassed and superseded the older theory of continental drift from the first half of the 20th century and the concept of seafloor spreading developed during the 1960s.

The outermost part of the Earth's interior is made up of two layers: above is the lithosphere, comprising the crust and the rigid uppermost part of the mantle. Below the lithosphere lies the asthenosphere. Although solid, the asthenosphere has relatively low viscosity and shear strength and can flow like a liquid on geological time scales. The deeper mantle below the asthenosphere is more rigid again. This is, however, not because of cooler temperatures but due to high pressure.

The lithosphere is broken up into what are called tectonic plates — in the case of Earth, there are seven major and many minor plates (see list below). The lithospheric plates ride on the asthenosphere. These plates move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent or collision boundaries, divergent or spreading boundaries, and transform boundaries. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries. The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of 5 - 10 cm/yr.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Preface by Ruth Lawson==

This WikiBook &quot;The Anatomy and Physiology of Animals' is designed to meet the needs of students studying for New Zealand certificate level qualifications in Veterinary Nursing, Animal Care and Rural Animal Technology under the [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/units/pdf/5180.pdf New Zealand Qualifications Unit Standard 5180]. It may also be useful for anyone studying for preliminary qualifications in veterinary nursing or biology. It is intended for use by students with little previous biological knowledge. 

The WikiBook has been divided into 16 chapters covering fundamental concepts like organic chemistry, body organisation and the cell and then the systems of the body.  Within each chapter are lists of Websites that provide additional information including animations. There is a comprehensive Glossary which can be accessed through links in each chapter. To help the student understand and learn the information within each chapter there are links to Worksheets in WikiEducator and a &quot;Test Yourself&quot; exercise. 

The present text has evolved over many years. Terry Marler BVSC first conceived it as 8 separate modules for students at the Otago Polytechnic in what was then known as Animal Technology. Since then he and I have given it several major and minor overhauls. The present incarnation for this WikiBook has been rewritten and the diagrams redrawn by myself with advice and proofreading by Terry.

This is a simple dish to throw together with leftover meat. I use frozen vegetarian steak strips, though sliced seitan, seared flank steak or any other protein would probably work.

==Ingredients==

*&amp;frac12; large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced
*2 large [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], sliced
*2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]]s [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*12 ounces [[Cookbook:steak|steak]] strips
*12 ounces crushed [[Cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Caper|caper]]s
*7-10 leaves fresh [[Cookbook:basil|basil]]
*&amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 pinch [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]] flakes

==Procedure==
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Sear steak strips, bell peppers and onion together with salt and red pepper flakes for a few minutes, then turn heat down and add crushed tomatoes and capers. Simmer, covered, for ten minutes or until steak is cooked through and tender. [[Cookbook:Chiffonade|Chiffonade]] the basil and add, simmer for another couple of minutes.

Serves four. Good as a main dish with spinach and garlic and risotto.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many thanks to Terry Marler (B.V.S.C.) for his guiding vision, wisdom, experience and patience. His advice throughout the writing of this WikiBook has been invaluable. I would also like to thank Bronwyn Hegarty,  for  gently shepherding the project through the many hurdles encountered and Leigh Blackall, also in the Education Development Unit at the Otago Polytechnic, for helpful discussions and advice. Many, many thanks also to Sunshine Blackall for her skills in formatting the diagrams and designing the artwork accompanying each chapter. The high quality of this work would not have been possible without the financial assistance of the Otago Polytechnic CAPEX fund. Thanks are also due to Jeanette O'Fee,  my Head of School, for encouragement throughout the project and to Keith Allnatt and Jan Bedford for proofreading and reviewing. Finally I would like thank Peter and Kate who have patiently suffered my &quot;unavailability&quot; as I tapped my evenings and weekends away on the computer.  ''Ruth Lawson''

6. Be2 is not played as often in response to black pushing 5. ...a6 as is [[../6. Bg5/]] or [[../6. Be3/]], but it is a solid move. White's bishop at e2 can keep an eye on g4 while allowing for a king side castle.

      <comment>/* Algebraic solution of a LP */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We can solve two variables&lt;math&gt;(x_2,s_2)&lt;/math&gt; LP models easily using the graphical method outlined in the previous section but what should we do in case of three variable problems, i.e. when our company makes three products we have to make decisions about. What about four or five variable problems? This is where the simplex method comes in. It is an iterative method which by repeated use gives us the solution to any n variable LP model. 

==Standard form of a LP model==

Let us define an LP model as being in standard form if it satisfies the following two conditions:

* All the constraints with the exception of the non-negativity restrictions are equations with non-negative right hand side.

* All the variables are non-negative.

For example,

: Maximize &lt;math&gt;z = 5x_1+4x_2&lt;/math&gt;

: subject to,

: &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2+s_1= 24&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2+s_2= 6&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;x_2-x_1+s_3= 1&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;x_2+s_4= 2&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

is an LP model in standard form. Note that the usual &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; signs have been equivalently replaced by both &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; variables (s as in '''s'''lack) and the &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; sign.

How do we convert a given model into a standard model while retaining its sense? This is done as follows: 

* If there is a constraint of the type &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2\le 24&lt;/math&gt; then the right hand side usually represents some limit on the resource (for example the amount of the raw material available) and the left hand side the usage of that resource (i.e. how much raw material is actually used) and so their difference represents the ''slack'' or unused amount of the resource. So to convert into an equality we must add a variable representing the slack amount on the left hand side. This variable is known as the ''slack variable'' and is obviously also non-negative. If we represent it by &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; our constraint is converted into the equation &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2+s_1=24&lt;/math&gt;. A similar thing is done in case of a constraint of the type &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2\ge 24&lt;/math&gt;. Here the left hand side has a ''surplus'' or extra amount then the right hand side and so a non-negative ''surplus variable'' say &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; must be subtracted to get the equation &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2-s_2=24&lt;/math&gt;.

* If the given variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is given to be non-positive then its negative &lt;math&gt;y_i=-x_i&lt;/math&gt; is obviously non-negative and can be substituted in the problem. The real problem comes in the case when the variable is allowed to take on any sign. Then it is called an ''unrestricted variable''. This is overcome by using the substitution &lt;math&gt;x_i=x_i^--x_i^+&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_i^-,x_i^+&lt;/math&gt; are both non-negative. Intuitively if the variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is positive then &lt;math&gt;x_i^-&lt;/math&gt; is positive and &lt;math&gt;x_i^+&lt;/math&gt; is zero, while if the variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is negative then &lt;math&gt;x_i^-&lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt;x_i^+&lt;/math&gt; is positive. If &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is zero then obviously &lt;math&gt;x_i^-,x_i^+&lt;/math&gt; are both zero.

A point to note is that the objective function in the original LP model and the standard model is the same.

==Algebraic solution of a LP==

Let us now try to analyze a LP model algebraically. A solution of the standard LP model will be a solution for the original model (since the slack and surplus variables once removed would make the equations regain their old imbalance) and due to a similar reasoning a solution for the original model will also correspond to a solution for the standard model. Since the objective function is the same for both models so an optimal solution for the standard model will be optimal for the original model as well. Therefore we need to bother only about the standard model. 

Now what are the candidates for the optimal solution? They are the solutions of the equality constraints. All we need to do is to find out the solutions and check which of those give the optimal value when put in the objective function. Now usually in the LP model the number of constraints, say m, is outnumbered by the number of variables, say n, and so there are infinitely many solutions to the system of constraints. We can't possibly examine the complete set of infinite solutions. However due to a mathematical result our work is shortened. The result is that if out of the n variables, n-m variables are put to zero, and then if the constraint system can be solved then the solution will correspond to a corner point in the n-space. Such a solution is called a ''basic solution (Initial Solution)''. If in addition to being basic it happens to be feasible to the original problem, then it is called a ''basic feasible solution'' (often abbreviated as BFS). Since the optimal solution is obtained on a corner point (as we observed graphically) so all we need to do is to examine all the basic feasible solutions (which are at most &lt;math&gt;{n \choose m}&lt;/math&gt; in number, reflective of the number of ways n-m variables can be chosen among the total n to be zero) and then decide which one gives the maximum value for the objective function.

Let us consider an example:

Consider the following LP model:


Maximize z = &lt;math&gt;2x_1+3x_2&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;2x_1+x_2\le 4&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2\le 5&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.


We first convert it into standard form:

Maximize z = &lt;math&gt;2x_1+3x_2&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;2x_1+x_2+s_1=4&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2+s_2=5&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,s_1,s_2\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The constraint system has m=2 constraints and n=4 variables. Thus we need to set 4-2=2 variables equal to zero to get a basic solution. For example putting &lt;math&gt;x_1=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2=0&lt;/math&gt; we get a solution &lt;math&gt;s_1=4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2=5&lt;/math&gt;. This is also clearly feasible and so is a basic feasible solution. The variables being put to zero, that are &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2&lt;/math&gt; are called ''nonbasic variables'' and &lt;math&gt;s_1,s_2&lt;/math&gt; are called ''basic variables''. The ''objective value'' (the value that is obtained by putting the solution in the objective function) that these solutions (both basic and non basic) give on substitution in the objective function is zero.  

The following table summarizes all the basic solutions to the problem:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

| &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

| (4,5)

| Yes

|-

| &lt;math&gt;(x_1,s_1)&lt;/math&gt;

| Yes

| 7.5

|-

| &lt;math&gt;(x_2,s_1)&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;(x_1,s_2)&lt;/math&gt;

| (2,3)

| Yes

| &lt;math&gt;(x_2,s_2)&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;(x_1,s_1)&lt;/math&gt;

|-

| &lt;math&gt;(s_1,s_2)&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

| (1,2)

| Yes

| 8

|}

Note that we have not bothered to calculate the objective value for infeasible solutions. The optimal solution is the one which yields the highest objective value i.e. &lt;math&gt;x_1=1,x_2=2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we have solved the LP model algebraically.

This procedure of solving LP models works for any number of variables but is very difficult to employ when there are a large number of constraints and variables. For example, for m = 10 and n = 20 it is necessary to solve &lt;math&gt;{20 \choose 10} = 184756 &lt;/math&gt; sets of equations, which is clearly a staggering task. With the simplex method, you need only solve a few of these sets of equations, concentrating on those which give improving objective values.

==The Simplex method==

The method in a nutshell is this. You start with a basic feasible solution of an LP in standard form (usually the one where all the slack variables are equal to the corresponding right hand sides and all other variables are zero) and replace one basic variable with one which is currently non-basic to get a new basic solution (since n-m variables remain zero). This is done in a fashion which ensures that the new basic solution is feasible and its objective value is at least as much as that of the previous BFS. This is repeated until it is clear that the current BFS can't be improved for a better objective value. In this way the optimal solution is achieved. 

It is clear that one factor is crucial to the method: which variable should replace which. The variable which is replaced is called the ''leaving variable'' and the variable which replaces it is known as the ''entering variable''. The design of the simplex method is such so that the process of choosing these two variables allows two things to happen. Firstly, the new objective value is an improvement(or at least equals) on the current one and secondly the new solution is feasible.

Let us now explain the method through an example. Consider our old chemical company problem in standard form:

Maximize z = &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2+s_1= 24&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2+s_2= 6&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_2-x_1+s_3= 1&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_2+s_4= 2&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Now an immediate BFS is obtained by putting all the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero. (Clearly the solution thus obtained will be feasible to the original problem as the right hand sides are all non-negative which is precisely our solution.) If we consider our objective function z = &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2&lt;/math&gt; then it is evident that an increase in &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; will increase our objective value. (Note that currently both are zero being non-basic). A unit increase in &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; will give a 5-fold increase in the objective value while a unit increase in &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; will give a 4-fold increase. It is logical that we elect to make the entering variable &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; in the next iteration.

In the tabular form of the simplex method the objective function is usually represented as &lt;math&gt;z-5x_1-4x_2=0&lt;/math&gt;. Also the table contains the system of constraints along with the BFS that is obtained. Only the coefficients are written as is usual when handling linear systems.

Now for the next iteration we have to decide the entering and the leaving variables. The entering variable is &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; as we discussed. In fact, due to our realignment of the objective function, the most negative value in the z-row of the simplex table will always be the entering variable for the next iteration. This is known as the ''optimality condition''. What about the leaving variable? We have to account for the fact that our next basic solution is feasible. So our leaving variable must be chosen with this thought in mind.

To decide the leaving variable we apply what is sometimes called as the ''feasibility condition''. That is as follows: we compute the quotient of the solution coordinates (that are 24, 6, 1 and 2) with the constraint coefficients of the entering variable &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; (that are 6, 1, -1 and 0). The following ratios are obtained: 24/6 = 4, 6/1 = 6, 1/-1 = -1 and 2/0 = undefined. Ignoring the negative and the undefined ratio we now proceed to select the minimum of the other two ratios which is 4, obtained from dividing 24(the value of &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt;) by 6. Since the minimum involved the division by &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt;'s current value we take the leaving variable as &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt;.

What is the justification behind this procedure? It is this. The minimum ratios actually represent the intercepts made by the constraints on the &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; axis. To see this look at the following graph:

[[Image:Minimum ratio.jpg]]

Since currently all &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are 0 we are considering the BFS corresponding to the origin. Now, in the next iteration according to the simplex method we should get a new BFS i.e  move to a new corner point on the graph. We can induce an increase in the value of only one variable at a time by making it an entering variable, and since &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is our entering variable our plan is to increase the value of &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;. From the graph we can see that the value of &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; must be increased to 4 at the point (4,0), which is the smallest non-negative intercept with the &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; axis. An increase beyond that point is infeasible. Also at (4,0) the slack variable &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; assumes a zero value as the first constraint is satisfied as an equality there and so &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; becomes the leaving variable. 

Now the problem is to determine the new solution. Although any procedure of solving a linear system can be applied at this stage, usually ''Gauss Jordan elimination'' is applied. It is based on a result in linear algebra that the elementary row transformations on a system [A|b] to [H|c] do not alter the solutions of the system. According to it the columns corresponding to the basic-variables in the table are given the shape of an identity matrix. (Readers familiar with linear algebra will recognize that it means that the matrix formed with the basis variable columns is transformed into reduced row echelon form.) The solution can then be simply read off from the right most solution column (as n-m of the variables are put to zero and the rest including z have coefficient 1 in one constraint each). Since z is also a variable it's row is treated as one among the constraints comprising the linear system.

The entering variable column is called the ''pivot column'' and the leaving variable row is called the ''pivot row''. The intersection of the pivot column and the leaving variable column is called the ''pivot element''. In our example the second row (of &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt;) is the pivot row and the second column(of &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;) is the pivot column. 

The computations needed to produce the new basic solution are:

* Replace the leaving variable in the 'Basic' column with the entering variable.
* New pivot row = Current pivot row &amp;divide; Pivot element

For other rows, including the z row:

* New row = Current row - (Its pivot column coefficient)×(New pivot row)

In our case the computations proceed as follows:

* Replace &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; in the 'Basic' column with &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;
* New pivot &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; row = Current &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; row &amp;divide; 6 = &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1 &amp; \frac{2}{3} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
* New z row = Current z row - (-5)×New &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; row = &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{-2}{3} &amp; \frac{5}{6} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 20\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
* New &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; row = Current &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; row - (1)×New &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; row = &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{4}{3} &amp; \frac{-1}{6} &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
* New &lt;math&gt;s_3&lt;/math&gt; row = Current &lt;math&gt;s_3&lt;/math&gt; row - (-1)×New &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; row = &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{5}{3} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 5\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
* New &lt;math&gt;s_4&lt;/math&gt; row = Current &lt;math&gt;s_4&lt;/math&gt; row - (0)×New &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; row = &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus our new table is:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

The optimality condition now shows that &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; is the entering variable. The feasiblity condition produces the ratios: 4/(2/3) = 6, 2/(4/3) = 1.5, 5/(5/3) = 3 and 2/1 = 2 of which the minimum is 1.5 produced by dividing the coefficient in the &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; row (i.e. the row in which the basic variable &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; has coefficient 1). So &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; becomes the leaving variable. The Gauss Jordan elimination process is applied again to get the following table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

! &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;

Based on the optimality condition none of the z-row coefficients associated with the non-basic variables &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; are negative. Hence the last table is optimal. The optimal solution can thus be read off as &lt;math&gt;x_1=3,x_2=\frac{3}{2},s_3=\frac{5}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_4=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the optimal value as z = 21. Obviously the variables &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; are zero. Our original problem involving only &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; also clearly has the same solution (just disregard the slacks).

We have dealt with a maximization problem. If the minimization case, since min z = max (-z) (if z is a linear function, which it is) so we can either convert the problem into a maximization one or reverse the optimality condition. Instead of selecting the entering variable as the one with the most negative coefficient in the z row we can select the one with the most positive coefficient. The rest of the steps are the same.

== Exercise Problem: ==

1. A company involved in the assembly and distribution of printers is concerned with two types – laser and inkjet. Assembly of each laser printer takes two hours, while each inkjet printer takes one hour to assemble, and the staff can provide a total of 40 person-hours of assembly time per day. In addition, warehouse space must be available for the assembly and distribution of the printers, 1 square meter for each laser printer and 3 square meters for each inkjet printer; the company has a total of 45 square meters of storage space available for assembled printers each day. Laser printers can be sold for a profit of €30 per unit and inkjet printers earn a profit of €25 each, but the market in which the company is operating can absorb a maximum of 12 laser printers per day. (There is no such limitation on the market for inkjet printers). Formulate this as a linear programming problem and determine, using the simplex method, the number of each type of printer the company should assemble and distribute in order to maximize daily profit.

== Artificial Starting Solution ==

In the previous problem we had a convenient initial basic feasible solution to apply the simplex method which comprised of the slack variables. If the problem however includes surplus variables the solution obtained by putting all the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; zero will be basic but not feasible (Why?). In that case instead of arbitrarily searching for an initial basic feasible solution, variables known as ''artificial variables'' are used. They play the role of slacks in the first iteration and being external to the problem are disposed of (by being driven to zero) at a later iteration. We will discuss a method known as the ''two-phase method'' which is usually used to handle artificial variable problems.

Let us consider the following problem:

Minimize z = &lt;math&gt;4x_1+x_2&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;3x_1+x_2 = 3&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;4x_1+3x_2\ge 6&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2\le 4&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Now after converting the problem into standard form we have:

Minimize z = &lt;math&gt;4x_1+x_2&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;3x_1+x_2 = 3&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;4x_1+3x_2 - Sx_3 = 6&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2+sx_6= 4&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,Sx_3,sx_6\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Now the first and second constraints do not have any slack variable associated with them. This means that we don't have a convenient initial basic feasible solution available with us. Thus we must introduce artificial variables &lt;math&gt;Rx_4,Rx_5&lt;/math&gt; in the problem to get an initial BFS.

&lt;math&gt;3x_1+x_2 +Rx_4= 3&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;4x_1+3x_2 - Sx_3 +Rx_5= 6&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2+sx_6= 4&lt;/math&gt;.

What exactly is the two-phase method? As the name suggests, it consists of two phases: In the first phase we start with an initial basic feasible solution (obtained using the slack and the artificial variables equal to the right hand side and other variables equal to zero) and work to eliminate the artificial variables. To do this we must minimize the sum of the artificial variables. So we change our objective function to Minimize &lt;math&gt;z=Rx_4+Rx_5&lt;/math&gt;. Hence our problem becomes:

Minimize &lt;math&gt;z=Rx_4+Rx_5&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;3x_1+x_2 +Rx_4= 3&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;4x_1+3x_2 - Sx_3 +Rx_5= 6&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2+sx_6= 4&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,Sx_3,sx_6,Rx_4,Rx_5\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Our initial BFS is of course obtained by putting all the original variables and the surplus variable equal to zero. A problem though crops up at this point. The z row in the simplex method is given by &lt;math&gt;z-Rx_4-Rx_5=0&lt;/math&gt; and so the whole system in matrix form is:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1   
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
 z\\
 x_1\\
 x_2\\
 Sx_3\\
 Rx_4\\
 Rx_5\\
 sx_6
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}
 0\\
 3\\
 6\\
 4
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 

Clearly if we put the surplus and the original variables to zero the solution to the system will not be the convenient right hand side because the first row has non zero coefficients of &lt;math&gt;Rx_4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Rx_5&lt;/math&gt; in it. To be more precise write the above system in the following form:
&lt;math&gt;\Bigg\{z\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}+x_1\begin{pmatrix}0\\3\\4\\1\end{pmatrix}+x_2\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\3\\2\end{pmatrix}+Sx_3\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\-1\\0\end{pmatrix}+Rx_4\begin{pmatrix}-1\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}+Rx_5\begin{pmatrix}-1\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}+sx_6\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}\Bigg\}\begin{pmatrix}
 z\\
 x_1\\
 x_2\\
 Sx_3\\
 Rx_4\\
 Rx_5\\
 sx_6
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}
 0\\
 3\\
 6\\
 4
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now putting the variables &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,Sx_3&lt;/math&gt; to be zero our solution changes to:

&lt;math&gt;\Bigg\{z\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}+Rx_4\begin{pmatrix}-1\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}+Rx_5\begin{pmatrix}-1\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}+sx_6\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}\Bigg\}\begin{pmatrix}
 z\\
 Rx_4\\
 Rx_5\\
 sx_6
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}
 0\\
 3\\
 6\\
 4
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 

or in the form:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1   
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
 z\\
 Rx_4\\
 Rx_5\\
 sx_6
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}
 0\\
 3\\
 6\\
 4
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 

Now this is not in reduced row echelon form and therefore the right hand side does not directly provide the basic feasible solution. In the simplex table the last column should contain the solution. Therefore before we can start the simplex method some modification is necessary in the first row so that the system gets the reduced row echelon form. The obvious required elementary transformation is:

New z row = Old z row (i.e. &lt;math&gt;z-Rx_4-Rx_5=0&lt;/math&gt;) + (1×&lt;math&gt;Rx_4&lt;/math&gt; row + 1×&lt;math&gt;Rx_5&lt;/math&gt;)

Now the first equation becomes &lt;math&gt;z+7x_1+4x_2-Sx_3=9&lt;/math&gt; and on putting the requisite variables to zero we find that the right hand side provides a convenient initial BFS.

Note that we have not bothered to write the column of z in the above table. This is because the nature of the elementary row transformations is such that the z column will always be of the form &lt;math&gt;(1,0,\cdots 0)^T&lt;/math&gt; and so that column can be assumed in every iteration. 

The simplex method is now applied to get the solution &lt;math&gt;z=0,x_1=0.6,x_2=1.2,sx_6=1&lt;/math&gt;. The final table obtained will be:

Since the artificial variables are zero so we have reached the end of phase 1. If the value of objective function at the end of stage one is not zero, it means that the artificial variables can not be eliminated, meaning the problem is infeasible.

Phase 2 involves using the basic feasible solution currently available as a starting basic feasible solution for the original problem. The objective function is therefore changed and the z-row is made to reflect that. Since the artificial variables have completed their mission of providing us with an initial BFS they should never be made the entering variables now. In fact, they can be totally eliminated from the problem. So our original problem can now be restated as:

Minimize z = &lt;math&gt;4x_1+x_2&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;x_1+\frac{1}{5}Sx_3 = \frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;x_2 - \frac{3}{5}Sx_3 = \frac{6}{5}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;Sx_3+sx_6= 1&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,Sx_3,sx_6\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The table can now be written as:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

! Basic

! &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;Sx_3&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;sx_6&lt;/math&gt;

! BFS

|-

| &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

|-

| &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| 1

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{-3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

|-

| &lt;math&gt;sx_6&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| 0

| 1

| 1

| 1

|}

A similar problem which cropped up in the begining of phase 1 is now evident. Since the basic variables &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; have nonzero coefficients in the z-row, the system is not in reduced row echelon form. So we must first apply an elementary row transformation to make these coefficients zero. The evident row transformation is: 

New z row = Old z row + (4×&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; row + 1×&lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;)

The table thus becomes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

! Basic

! &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;Sx_3&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;sx_6&lt;/math&gt;

! BFS

|-

| z

| 0

| 0

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{18}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

|-

| &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;

| 1

| 0

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

|-

| &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| 1

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{-3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

|-

| &lt;math&gt;Sx_3&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| 0

| 1

| 1

| 1

|}

Now the simplex method can be applied. The final solution is: &lt;math&gt;z=3.4,x_1=0.4,x_2=1.8,Sx_3=1&lt;/math&gt;. 

All the tables of the problem are listed below:

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Hierarchical Queries ===

Hierarchical queries are a way to extract information from a table that is linked with itself. 

Let's say we have the following table: 

&lt;pre&gt;

My example table: 

id     of type numeric 
father of type numeric, that references an id of other register of the same table 
data   rest of fields, etc

&lt;/pre&gt;

If we have the following values: 

&lt;pre&gt;

id     father        data 
50     null          The boss
51     50            The well positioned manager
52     50            Another well positioned manager 
53     51            The worker
54     52            Another worker
5      null          Other node 
10     5             The son of Other node
&lt;/pre&gt;

The values that &quot;hang&quot; from node 50 are the values 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 but not 5 nor 10. 

* DB2
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
or
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
* Firebird / InterBase
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
* Ingres, MySQL, MSSQL&lt;ref name=ms-recursive&gt;MS SQL does '''not''' allow the RECURSIVE keyword&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
* PostgreSQL
&lt;pre&gt;WITH RECURSIVE t AS (
    SELECT id, father FROM &quot;table&quot; WHERE id = 50 AND father IS NULL
UNION ALL
    SELECT t1.id, t1.father FROM t JOIN &quot;table&quot; t1 ON (t1.father = t.id)
)
SELECT * FROM t;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Oracle, Linter
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT * FROM table CONNECT BY id = PRIOR father START WITH id = 50&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''True-Believer Syndrome'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
'''[[w:True-believer syndrome|True-believer syndrome]]''' is a common occurrence in parapsychology. It is, broadly, a belief without logical foundations. Frequently, this translates to someone believing so strongly in the truth of something, that they refuse to accept when it is proven wrong, even if this proof is irrefutable. Just as skeptics are often too quick to dismiss, supporters often take the other route, and refuse to dismiss in light of evidence.

This occurs frequently in paranormal phenomenon with the staging of events. Someone may become so convinced that an encounter with a UFO, apparition, or cryptozoological figure is real, that they tend not to believe it to be a hoax, '''even if the original author of the evidence makes the statement'''.

This concept also occurs completely outside of parapsychology. For example, when a fraud is committed, many victims continue to profess the good faith of the scammer. The term is, however, rarely used outside of parapsychology.

The term was coined by [[w:M. Lamar Keene|M. Lamar Keene]] in 1976, in Keene's ''The Psychic Mafia''. Keene attributed the success of many mediums to this. Ironically, people apparently suffering from true-believer syndrome were Keene's downfall. He had originally been a psychic, and in ''The Psychic Mafia'', stated that his practice was fake. The book caused such a firestorm that Keene left the psychic business. However, death threats continued to follow, culminating in a drive-by shooting. Keene subsequently changed his name and relocated, and his whereabouts are unknown.

----


&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:140%&quot;&gt;'''Comparing the Ideas behind Relaxation and LC Oscillators'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


== A relaxation oscillator ==

'''The basic idea.''' The simpler and more intuitive '''relaxation oscillator''' consists of (Fig. 1) a flow (current) source, an accumulator of potential energy (a capacitor), a switch SW and a load (a resistor)&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle|How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle]] (creating a philosophy of the relaxation oscillator)&lt;/ref&gt;. Such an arrangement operates in two stages as follows: in the first stage, we connect the current source to the accumulator and begin charging it; in the second stage, we connect the accumulator to the load (turn on the switch SW) and discharge it. Let's repeat it in other words: in a period of a relaxation oscillation, we first draw a kind of energy (usually, potential) from the flow source to fill the accumulator, then &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator and just &quot;throw out&quot; it to the environment. Thus, in the first stage of every period the source has to restore the energy in the accumulator.

[[Image:Relaxation_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. A relaxation oscillator has only one accumulating element; the energy moves only in one direction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Features.''' Note that the relaxation arrangement needs only one accumulator. It lies on the way of energy and serves as a buffer that interrupts temporarily the flow (only, the average flow remains constant). In this way, it intermits, tears to &quot;pieces&quot; the energy flow. It is interesting fact that a continuous current enters the accumulator while an intermittent current leaves it; so, we might say that a relaxation oscillator &quot;discretisizes&quot;, &quot;portens&quot;, &quot;doses&quot; the unceasing input flow of energy. At the same time, the accumulator's contents increases and decreases periodically. The shape of the curve is not sinusoidal because at the points of switching (at the peaks) the &quot;flow-creating&quot; quantity has a maximum magnitude. Note also that increase and decrease can have different durations. Examples of this possibility are a photoflash (slow charging, fast discharging), a toilet tank, a husband that fills slowly and continuously a family money deposit while his wife empties rapidly and regularly it:)

== An LC oscillator ==

'''The basic idea.''' Contrary, in order to create an ideal LC oscillation (assume an LC tank without losses), we charge the accumulator only once in the beginning (by turning on the switch SW on the bottom of the figure). Then, we &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator but do not &quot;throw it away&quot;; instead, we convert it into an opposite kind (''kinetic to potential'' or ''potential to kinetic'') and store the converted energy in another accumulator. We move, transfer, convey the energy from the one accumulator to the other. After, we use this energy to restore the energy of the first accumulator instead to &quot;suck&quot; energy from the source (we move back the energy).

[[Image:LC_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. An LC oscillator has two accumulating elements; the energy circulates between them.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Implementation.''' For this purpose, the LC arrangement consists of two heterogeneous (regarding to the two kinds of energy) accumulating elements (Fig. 2). Each of them can either provide energy (when it serves as a source) or store the energy (when it serves as a load). When act as a source, it is a weakening, depleting, exhausting source because the other (accumulating) element &quot;sucks out&quot; the source's energy. The energy moves from the source to the accumulator and the source's output quantity decreases.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Relaxation versus LC oscillators ==

=== Similarities ===

#Both the oscillating circuits contain at least one accumulating element that acts either as a source or as an integrator.


=== Differences ===

#A relaxation oscillator consists of only one accumulating element while an LC oscillator consists of two accumulating elements.
#The relaxation accumulator is ''flow'' or ''pressure'' like; the LC accumulators are heterogeneous (the one is ''flow-like'' and the other is ''pressure-like'').
#A relaxation oscillator stores only one kind of energy (usually potential) in the accumulator while an LC oscillator stores two opposite kinds of energy (''kinetic'' and ''potential'') in the two accumulators.
#In a relaxation oscillator we &quot;throw away&quot; the energy while in an LC oscillator we treasure it temporarily in an additional accumulator with the purpose of future usage. That's why, LC oscillators are more economical than relaxation ones.
#Resonance phenomenon does not exist in a relaxation circuit; it can be observed only in the LC tank.
#In a relaxation oscillator the energy moves only in one direction (source -&gt; accumulator -&gt; load) while in an LC oscillator the energy changes periodically its direction (it circulates between the two elements).
#The shape of a relaxation oscillation is peaked, angular while the shape of an LC oscillation is rounded (sinusoidal). The reason of that is that at the peaks the source of a relaxation oscillator changes its output quantity with the maximum magnitude while the &quot;source&quot; of an LC oscillator (charged accumulator) does not change its output quantity.
#The shape of the relaxation oscillation can be asymmetrical (the increase and the decrease can have different durations) while the shape of the LC oscillation is precisely symmetrical.

&lt;center&gt;'''Street Light Interference'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
'''Street light interference''', or '''SLI''', is a phenomenon where people inadvertantly trip the daylight sensors on daylight-sensing light fixtures. People who experience this phenomenon notice it occurring on certain lights- for example, in a parking lot with over a dozen light fixtures, there may be one that will turn on and off when the subject is close to it. This particular light fixture will act strangley, while every other one in the parking lot will remain on.

This phenomenon is similar to psychokenisis, however, one major tenent of it is that the subject cannot control it. Many SLIders (as the subjects are called) do report that the phenomenon occurs more frequently when they are in a heightened emotional state.

Much of the research in this area can be attributed to Hilary Evans, who authored a book, [http://www.assap.org/newsite/Docs/sli.pdf The SLI Effect]. The causes of this phenomenon have yet to be determined; however, surveying has created a statistical analysis of what the phenomenon encompasses.

Critics usually attribute the phenomenon to two things. First, the lights are simply shutting off for explainable reasons- for example, sodium vapor type lamps will blink on and off when they start to fail, as they have experience voltage spikes. Second, due to observer bias, the SLIder notices the light turning off (or on), while they pay no attention to lights that are operating normally. SLIders have attempted to rebuke these through demonstration; however, as yet, no one has been able to cause interference during a demonstration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''(I would like to start the discussion about relaxation oscillations by moving here the text below from the [[Circuit Idea/How do We Create Sinusoidal Oscillations?|page about LC tank]])'' [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 18:31, 24 January 2008 (UTC) 

== What the secret of relaxation oscillations is ==

Maybe, we have first to say here ''what the truth about relaxation oscillation is'' and then to discuss how to present this wisdom to visitors (these are different things). Well, let's begin with the first.

=== The initial point: ''A steady quantity'' ===

At the starting point we need a steady quantity. Where to get it from? As usual in this world, we need energy to create a quantity. We can get this energy from some power source. So, the first thing what we need (in this world) is a power source.

=== The problem: ''How to make it oscillate?'' ===

Then, we ask yourself, &quot;How do we make the steady quantity oscillate?&quot; But what does mean &quot;to oscillate&quot;? Simply speaking, to oscillate means just to make the quantity increase and decrease consecutively and regularly. How do we do this magic?

=== Preparing a steady quantity to be changed ===

It seems it's too difficult to make the very power source oscillate (power sources keep up constant their output quantities). Then, what do we do? We can act like in many situations of routine: instead to change the whole source energy we get some amount of energy from the source and store it in some &quot;place&quot; with the purpose to change it. As there are two kinds of energy - kinetic and potential, we can store energy in two kinds of energy accumulators (integrators). Let's do it; we have got the initial steady quantity. Examples: if we have stored a kinetic energy in an inductor, we obtain a constant current; if we have stored a potential energy in a capacitor, we obtain a constant voltage.

=== Changing the accumulated quantity ===

Now, we can begin doing the &quot;veritable work&quot; - to increase and decrase the steady quantity, in order to make it oscillate. How can we make it increase? Of course, by adding continuosly energy to the accumulator. And how can we make it decrease? Contrary, by subtracting continuosly energy from the accumulator. In both the cases we move, transport, transfer energy from one place to other - from the source to the accumulator and v.v.

==== Relaxation oscillations ====

''(...We might explain what an LC oscillation is, if we say what it is not. Here, we might say that an LC oscillation is not a '''relaxation''' one. Only, we would explain what a &quot;relaxation oscillation&quot; is. This phenomenon is no less vague and mystic than the LC phenomenon (I have never met good resources about it). Now, we have opportunity to reveal the secret behind relaxation phenomenon by comparing it with LC one. After that, we may move these thoughts to the future [[Circuit Idea/How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle|story]] about relaxation oscillations...)''

[[Image:Relaxation_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt; A relaxation oscillator has only one accumulating element; the energy moves only in one direction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''The basic idea.''' According to the powerful idea [[#Changing the accumulated quantity|above]], we might first build the simpler and more intuitive ''relaxation oscillator'' by using three elements: a flow (current) source, an accumulator of potential energy (a capacitor) and a load (a resistor). Such an arrangement operates in two stages as follows: in the first stage, we connect the current source to the accumulator and begin charging it; in the second stage, we connect the accumulator to the load (turn on the switch SW) and discharge it. Let's repeat it in other words: in a period of a relaxation oscillation, we first draw a kind of energy (usually, potential) from the flow source to fill the accumulator, then &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator and just &quot;throw out&quot; it to the environment. Thus, in the first stage of every period the source has to restore the energy in the accumulator.

'''Features.''' Note that the relaxation arrangement needs only one accumulator. It lies on the way of energy and serves as a buffer that interrupts temporarily the flow (only, the average flow remains constant). In this way, it intermits, tears to &quot;pieces&quot; the energy flow. It is interesting fact that a continuous current enters the accumulator while an intermittent current leaves it; so, we might say that a relaxation oscillator &quot;discretisizes&quot;, &quot;portens&quot;, &quot;doses&quot; the unceasing input flow of energy. At the same time, the accumulator's contents increases and decreases periodically. The shape of the curve is not sinusoidal because at the points of switching (at the peaks) the &quot;flow-creating&quot; quantity has a maximum magnitude. Note also that increase and decrease can have different durations. Examples of this possibility (see the analogies below) are a photoflash (slow charging, fast discharging), a toilet tank, a husband that fills slowly and continuously a family money deposit while his wife empties rapidly and regularly it:)

'''What does &quot;relaxation oscillation&quot; mean?''' I have been asking myself many times what the word &quot;relaxation&quot; means in this context. What does &quot;relax&quot; here? Maybe, the capacitor? If yes, when does the capacitor relax? Maybe, when we charge it (in this case, &quot;relaxation&quot; would mean restoring, retrieving, recreating the content of the accumulating element). Or maybe, the capacitor relaxes (returns to its initial &quot;zero energy&quot; state of equilibrium) when we discharge it...

'''Relaxation analogies.''' We can see many manifestations of this phenomenon in nature, routine, engineering and finally, in electronics. For example, I have a remembrance from my childhood how sometimes faulty toilet tanks began working intermittently (filling -&gt; emptying -&gt; filling -&gt; emptying... up to infinity:) Similarly, imagine you were foolish enough to make a common money deposit with your wife:) Then, you begin working hard to feed up continuously the deposit. As a result, the amount of money increases continuously through time. Only, at some point your wife decides that's enough and draw out all the money accumulated. You begin working again... and she empties the deposit again... and this repeats again... and again... and again...:) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 20:06, 18 January 2008 (UTC)

==== LC oscillations ====

[[Image:LC_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt;An LC oscillator has two accumulating elements; the energy circulates between them.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''The basic idea.''' Contrary, in order to create an ideal LC oscillation (assume an LC tank without losses), we charge the accumulator only once in the beginning (by turning on the switch SW on the bottom of the figure). Then, we &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator but do not &quot;throw it away&quot;; instead, we convert it into an opposite kind (''kinetic to potential'' or ''potential to kinetic'') and store the converted energy in another accumulator. We move, transfer, convey the energy from the one accumulator to the other. After, we use this energy to restore the energy of the first accumulator instead to &quot;suck&quot; energy from the source (we move back the energy). By the way, maybe is more correctly to say &quot;energy moves&quot; rather than &quot;we move the energy&quot;. But why the energy moves by itself? What make it move? What make it move to and fro without end? Don't you think there is something mystic in this endless &quot;ping-pong&quot; movement?

'''Implementation.''' For this purpose, the LC arrangement consists of two heterogenious (regarding to the two kinds of energy) accumulating elements. Each of them can either provide energy (when it serves as a source) or store the energy (when it serves as a load). When act as a source, it is a weakening, depleting, exhausting source because the other (accumulating) element &quot;sucks out&quot; the source's energy. The energy moves from the source to the accumulator and the source's output quantity decreases.

==== Relaxation versus LC oscillations ====

===== Similarities =====

#Both the oscillating circuits contain at least one accumulating element that acts either as a source or as an integrator.


===== Differences =====

#An relaxation oscillator consists of only one accumulating element while an LC oscillator consists of two accumulating elements.
#The relaxation accumulator is ''flow'' or ''pressure'' like; the LC accumulators are heterogenious (the one is ''flow-like'' and the other is ''pressure-like'').
#An relaxation oscillator stores only one kind of energy (usually potential) in the accumulator while an LC oscillator stores two opposite kinds of energy (''kinetic'' and ''potential'') in the two accumulators.
#In an relaxation oscillator we &quot;throw away&quot; the energy while in an LC oscillator we treasure it temporarily in an additional accumulator with the purpose of future usage. That's why, LC oscillators are more economical than relaxation ones.
#Resonance phenomenon does not exist in relaxation circuit; it can be observed only in LC tank.
#In an relaxation oscillator the energy moves only in one direction (source -&gt; accumulator -&gt; load) while in an LC oscillator the energy changes periodically its direction (it circulates between the two elements).
#The shape of a relaxation oscillation is peaked, angular while the shape of an LC oscillation is rounded (sinusoidal). The reason of that is that at the peaks the source of a relaxation oscillator changes its output quantity with the maximum magnitude while the &quot;source&quot; of an LC oscillator (charged accumulator) does not change its output quantity.
#The shape of the relaxation oscillation can be asymmetrical (the increase and the decrease can have different durations) while the shape of the LC oscillation is precisely symmetrical.

      <comment>[[Wikijunior talk:Languages/Bangla]] moved to [[Wikijunior talk:Languages/Bengali]]: Bengali is the more common name for this language. See ethnolouge and wikipedia.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I have made some significant edits to the numbers in the &quot;How many people speak this language&quot; section. I took my data from the Ethnologue (http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ben). The ethnologue also says that the language's primary name is Bengali and not Bangla. I think that it might be appropriate to change this as well unless there's some compelling reason to leave it the way that it is.[[User:Rmawhorter|Rmawhorter]] ([[User talk:Rmawhorter|talk]]) 00:38, 25 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Forward Position Kinematics==

The forward position kinematics problem can be stated as follows: given the different joint angles, what is the the position of the end-effector?
With the previous sections in mind, the answer is rather simple: construct the different transformation matrices and combine them in the right way, the result being &lt;math&gt;^{ee}_{bs}T \,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\{bs\}&lt;/math&gt; is the base frame of the robot manipulator.

===Solution===
Suppose the mutual orientation matrices between adjacent links are known. (As the fixed parameters of each link are known, and the joint angles are a given to the problem, these can be calculated. One possible way to do this would be to make use of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention.) The transformation that relates the last and first frames in a serial manipulator arm, and thus, the solution to the forward kinematics problem, is then represented by the compound homogeneous transformation matrix. The axes are moving, thus, the compound homogeneous transformation matrix is found by premultiplying the individual transformation matrices:
:&lt;math&gt;^{ee}_{bs}T = \, ^{N}_{0}T = \, ^{1}_{0}T \, ^{2}_{1}T \ldots \, ^{N-1}_{N-2}T \,^{N}_{N-1}T&lt;/math&gt;

===Examples===

====The Planar Three-Link Manipulator====
[[Image:Planar-three-link-manipulator.svg|frame|right|A planar three link manipulator. Each &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;-axis lies along the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th link. Each &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt;-axis lies perpendicular to the corresponding &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;-axis in such a way that a positive &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; corresponds with a rotation from &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The equations below use 3 &amp;times; 3 pose matrices, as this is just a 2-dimensional case (cf. the figure on the right).

The pose of the first link, relative to the reference frame, is given by (recall the elementary rotation about the z-axis from the previous section):
:&lt;math&gt;
T_1(\theta_1) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta_1) &amp; -\sin(\theta_1) &amp; 0 \\
\sin(\theta_1) &amp; \cos(\theta_1) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The pose of the second link, relative to the first link, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
T_2(\theta_2) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta_2) &amp; -\sin(\theta_2) &amp; l_1 \\
\sin(\theta_2) &amp; \cos(\theta_2) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This corresponds to a rotation by an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; and a translation by a distance &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the first link.

The pose of the third link, relative to the second link, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
T_3(\theta_3) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta_3) &amp; -\sin(\theta_3) &amp; l_2 \\
\sin(\theta_3) &amp; \cos(\theta_3) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The pose of the end effector, relative to the third link, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
T_4 =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; l_3 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to the forward kinematics problem is then:
:&lt;math&gt;^{ee}_{bs}T = \, ^4_0T(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3) =
\begin{pmatrix}
c_{123} &amp; -s_{123} &amp; l_1 c_1 + l_2 c_{12} + l_3 c_{123} \\
s_{123} &amp; c_{123} &amp; l_1 s_1 + l_2 s_{12} + l_3 s_{123} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y \\
1
\end{pmatrix} = T
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting '''kinematic equations''' are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}
x = l_1 \cos \theta_1 + l_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + l_3 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3) \\
y = l_1 \sin \theta_1 + l_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + l_3 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Inverse Position Kinematics==

The inverse kinematics problem is the opposite of the forward kinematics problem and can be summarized as follows: given the desired position of the end effector, what combinations of the joint angles can be used to achieve this position?

[[Image:Inverse-kinematics-multiple-solutions.svg|frame|right|An example of two different solutions for the inverse kinematics problem leading to the same end-effector position and orientation.]]

Two types of solutions can be considered: a closed-form solution and a numerical solution. Closed-form or analytical solutions are sets of equations that fully describe the connection between the end-effector position and the joint angles. Numerical solutions are found through the use of numerical algorithms, and can exist even when no closed-form solution is available. There may also be multiple solutions, or no solution at all.

===Example: Planar Three-Link Manipulator===
The inverse kinematics problem for this 2D manipulator can quite easily be solved algebraically.

From the earlier results (for simplicity, the displacement over the distance &lt;math&gt;l_3&lt;/math&gt; shall be omitted here):
:&lt;math&gt;
^3_0 T = \begin{pmatrix}
c_{123} &amp; -s_{123} &amp; 0 &amp; l_1 c_1 + l_2 c_{12} \\
s_{123} &amp; c_{123} &amp; 0 &amp; l_1 s_1 + l_2 s_{12} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now assume a given end-effector orientation in the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;
^{ee}_{bs} T = \begin{pmatrix}
c_{\phi} &amp; -s_{\phi} &amp; 0 &amp; x \\
s_{\phi} &amp; c_{\phi} &amp; 0 &amp; y \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Equating the two previous expressions results in:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
c_{\phi} &amp; = &amp; c_{123} \\
s_{\phi} &amp; = &amp; s_{123} \\
x &amp; = &amp; l_1 c_1 + l_2 c_{12} \\
y &amp; = &amp; l_1 s_1 + l_2 s_{12} \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

As:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
c_{12} &amp; = &amp; c_1c_2 - s_1 s_2 \\
s_{12} &amp; = &amp; c_1 s_2 + s_1 c_2 \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;,
squaring both the expressions for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and adding them, leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;
x^2 + y^2 = l_1^2 + l_2^2 + 2 l_1 l_2 c_2
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;
c_2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2 l_1 l_2}
&lt;/math&gt;,
while &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; equals:
:&lt;math&gt;
s_2 = \pm \sqrt{1 - c_2^2}
&lt;/math&gt;,
and, finally, &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_2 = \mbox{Atan2}(s_2, c_2)
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note''': The choice of the sign for &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; corresponds with one of the two solutions in the figure above.

The expressions for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; may now be solved for &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt;. In order to do so, write them like this:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
x &amp; = &amp; k_1 c_1 - k_2 s_1 \\
y &amp; = &amp; k_1 s_1 + k_2 c_1 \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_1 = l_1 + l_2 c_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = l_2 s_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Let:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
r &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{k_1^2 + k_2^2} \\
\gamma &amp; = &amp; \mbox{Atan2}(k2,k1) \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
k_1 &amp; = &amp; r \cos \gamma \\
k_2 &amp; = &amp; r \sin \gamma \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Applying these to the above equations for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
x/r &amp; = &amp; \cos \gamma \, c_1 + \sin \gamma \, s_1 \\
y/r &amp; = &amp; \cos \gamma \, s_1 + \sin \gamma \, c_1 \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;,
or:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
\cos (\gamma + \theta_1) &amp; = &amp; \frac{x}{r} \\
\sin (\gamma + \theta_1) &amp; = &amp; \frac{y}{r} \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma + \theta_1 = \mbox{Atan2}(y,x)
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:
:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_1 = \mbox{Atan2}(y,x) - \mbox{Atan2}(k_2,k_1)
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note''': If &lt;math&gt;x = y = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; actually becomes arbitrary.

&lt;math&gt;\theta_3&lt;/math&gt; may now be solved from the first two equations for &lt;math&gt;s_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_3 = \phi - \theta_1 - \theta_2 = \mbox{Atan2}(s_{\phi},c_{\phi}) - \theta_1 - \theta_2
&lt;/math&gt;

:Actually, I would like to do some work on [[Wikijunior:The Elements|The Elements]], but my main focus will probably be either [[Wikijunior:Languages|Languages]] or [[Wikijunior:Europe|Europe]]. That said, I am open to comments if you think other books need some help. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 13:21, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
::I wasn't sure whether to edit here or on your talk page. Not sure what common protocol would be for that. The only books that seem to be done are Big Cats, Kings and Queens, The Solar System, World at Work and Alphabet. On the non-canonical list of books I'm thinking of indicating completion status so people know where each book is at. I'm planning on working on Languages for awhile but The Elements seems like a fine place to move to after that. I see value in working on almost any of the books there. The only two that I that I think  I would struggle with would be The US Constitution (I'm Canadian) and WWII.

:::There is no protocol for responses, unfortunately :(. Anyhow, though, you might be able to nominate the above books, if not already FB, to Featured status. I know that the Solar System is FB, although I would also note that Languages is FB. I agree, though, that Languages is probably not good, I'll work there for a while. Thoughts?

:::::Could be your loss is that we don't have enough resources to catch up on this count.

== ImmortalBeauty ==

I'am ImmortalBeauty, I'am feamle and live in enternal darkness. I shan't give out any of my personal information, such as a/s/l or whatever the internet talk is. I shall say that most of my postings on Wiki will be about Anti-slaughtering of Horses, Wolves or other wild animlas, or my faveorite topic, the immortal.  I'am dark and twisted, which is why many tend to avoid me. I hate large crowds and would prefer to be alone in the dark. I prefer night to day, for day is when the sun comes out, and I'am much too pale for sunlight. I love to look at the moon, mainly when its full, with stars lingering around it like diamonds on black silk. I think that is the most romantic time of the wakeing hours. I like soft music, such as violin or piano, but I can also mosh to bands such as Slipknot or HIM. I'am a cutter I'll just throw that out there now, and if you have a problem with it you can go die.</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

'''Chapter One, Lesson Two - Telling people where you're from and what language you speak:''' In this chapter you'll study basic conversations.

==Lesson 2==
===Countries, inhabitants and the language===
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| '''Country''' || '''People''' || '''Adjective''' || '''Language''' 
|-
| ''Roma'' (&quot;Rome&quot;) || ''Romanus'' (&quot;a Roman&quot;) || ''Romanus'', ''Romana'', ''Romanum'' (&quot;Roman&quot;) || ''Lingua Latina'' (&quot;Latin&quot;)
|-
| ''Anglia'' (&quot;England&quot;) || ''Anglus'' (&quot;a Englishman&quot;) || ''Anglicus'', ''Anglica'', ''Anglicum'' (&quot;English&quot;) || ''Lingua Anglica'' (&quot;English&quot;)
|-
| ''Islandia'' (&quot;Iceland&quot;) || ''Islandus'' (&quot;an Icelander&quot;) || ''Islandicus'', ''Islandica'', ''Islandicum'' (&quot;Icelandic&quot;) || ''Lingua Islandica'' (&quot;Icelandic&quot;)
|-
| ''Japonia'' (&quot;Japan&quot;) || ''Japonus'' (&quot;a Japanese&quot;) || ''Japonicus'', ''Japonica'', ''Japonicum'' (&quot;Japanese&quot;) || ''Lingua Japonica'' (&quot;Japanese&quot;)
|}

====Nationality====
:''If you're referring to an English man you say ''Anglic'''us''''' and if you're referring to an English woman you say ''Anglic'''a'''''. The ending '''-us''' is used for men and the ending '''-a''' for women.
If you're going to say &quot;I'm Japanese&quot; you just need to say ''Sum Japonic'''us'''.'' if you're male, and ''Sum Japonic'''a''''' if you're a female. Examples:
* ''Sum Islandic'''a''''' = I'm Icelandic (female)
* ''Sum Roman'''us''''' = I'm Roman (male)
* ''Sum Japonic'''a''''' = I'm Japanese (female)
* ''Sum Anglic'''us''''' = I'm English (male)

====Language====
To say that you &quot;speak&quot; a language you just need to say ''loquor''. ''Loquor'' means &quot;I speak&quot;, so if you're going to say &quot;I speak Latin&quot;, you say: ''Linguam latinam loquor''. Now don't get angry and confused over why &quot;lingua latina&quot; is now &quot;lingua'''m''' latina'''m'''&quot;. It will be explained later. For now, just remember that you add an 'm' to a word when it's the object. Now, some examples: 
* ''Linguam Anglicam loquor.'' = I speak English
* ''Linguam Latinam loquor.'' = I speak Latin.
Now to make the sentence '''negative''' you simply add ''[[wikt:en:non#Latin|non]]'' which means &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not&quot;:
* ''Linguam Latinam '''non''' loquor'' = I '''don't''' speak Latin.
* ''Linguam Islandicam '''non''' loquor'' = I '''don't''' speak Icelandic.
* ''Linguam Japonicam '''non''' loquor'' = I '''don't''' speak Japanese.

====Referring to other people====
If you're going to say &quot;you are English&quot; or &quot;you are Roman&quot; we need how to say &quot;you are&quot;. You almost never have to use [[w:en:personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] (I, we, they, you) in Latin because they are inferred from context or the verbs. So if you are going to say &quot;you are&quot; you simply say &quot;es&quot;. Example:
* ''Es Islandic'''us''''' = You are Icelandic (male)
* ''Non es Japonic'''a''''' = You aren't Japanese (female)
* ''Es Roman'''a''''' = You are Roman (female)
* ''Es Anglic'''us''''' = You are English (male)

Now you rarely need to ''tell'' people of what nationality they are (what did you say? &quot;you rarely need to use Latin either&quot;? Just shut up and pay attention!). If you want to ask people a question, you add ''[[wikt:en:-ne|-ne]]'' to the first word of the sentence. For example:
* ''Es Anglicus'' = You are English (male)
*: ''Es'''ne''' Anglicus?'' = ''Are'' you English'''?''' (male)
* ''Es Japonica'' = You are Japanese (girl)
*: ''Es'''ne''' Japonica?'' = ''Are'' you Japanese'''?''' (girl)
* ''Sum Islandicus'' = I'm Icelandic (male)
*: ''Sum'''ne''' Islandicus'' = ''Am'' I Icelandic'''?''' (male)

===Dialogue===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{Latin/Table|Dialogue|Are you Japanese?|Esne Japonica?}}
|-
!Speakers||Latin||English
|-
!Maria
|Salve Eva. 
|Hello Eva. 
|-
!Eva
|Salve Maria! 
|Hi Maria!
|-
!Maria
|Eva, es'''ne''' Japonica?
|Eva, are you Japanese?
|-
!Eva
|Non. Non sum Japonica.
|No. I'm not Japanese.
|-
!Maria
|Es'''ne''' Romana?
|Are you Roman?
|-
!Eva
|Hehae, non. Non sum Romana. Sum Islandica.
|Hehe, no. I'm not Roman, I'm Icelandic.
|}

===Asking what languages===
Here we'll learn how to ask people what languages they speak. First let's overview a very limited conjugation of the verb &quot;to speak&quot;.
* ''loquor'' = I speak 
* ''loqueris'' = you speak
* ''loquitur'' = he/she/it speaks
Now it would be advisable for you to learn by heart, as it'll prove immensely useful. Let's now learn a few things.
==== Do you speak? ====
To learn how to ask what people know or speak you must first learn to &quot;declare&quot; that they know something. ''E.g.'':
* ''Linguam Latinam loquor.'' = I speak Latin.
* ''Linguam Anglicam loquitur.'' = He/she speaks English.
* ''Linguam Islandicam non loquor.'' = I don't speak Icelandic.
* ''Linguam Japonicam loqueris.'' = You speak Japanese.
Now you wonder; &quot;how can I ask questions?&quot;. Did you just learn the [[wikt:en:enclitic|enclitic]] (don't worry about knowing that word, you're never going to use it) '''-ne''' which makes sentences into questions? You just add it to the first word of the sentence! 
* ''Loqueris'''ne'''?'' = Do you speak?
* ''Linguam'''ne''' Latinam loqueris?'' = Do you speak Latin?
* ''Linguam'''ne''' Latinam loquitur?'' = Does he/she speak Latin?

How would we say &quot;don't you speak Latin&quot;? Did you maybe think since we know how to say &quot;do you speak Latin&quot; and we know how say &quot;no&quot; (''non'') that it's:
* &lt;s&gt;Linguamne Latinam non loqueris?&lt;/s&gt; ... Nope sorry that's wrong. 
The way to say &quot;don't&quot; or &quot;aren't&quot; is the word '''''[[wikt:en:nonne|nonne]]'''''! (you might also see that it's made from ''non'' and ''-ne'')
* '''''Nonne''' Linguam Latinam loqueris?'' = '''Don't''' you speak Latin? 
* '''''Nonne''' Anglicus es?'' = '''Aren't''' you English? (referring to a man)
* '''''Nonne''' Lingua Latina est?'' = '''Isn't''' this Latin? 
*: &lt;small&gt;Notice that the word Latin is written as &quot;Lingua Latina&quot; but not as &quot;Linguam Latinam&quot;. This is because nothing &quot;affects&quot; it.&lt;/small&gt;

===Dialogue===
Now let's look at some dialogue (in a freak turn of events the speakers are Caesar and Brutus)..

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{Latin/Table|Dialogue|Are you Japanese?|Esne Japonica?}}
|-
!Speakers||Latin||English
|-
!Caesar
|Ave&lt;ref&gt;''Ave'' was a very formal expression of greetings. Were this an informal meeting of friends they would simply use ''salve''.&lt;/ref&gt; Brute.&lt;ref&gt;The reason why Brutus' name is written as ''Brute'' is because he's addressing him. This will be explained later. (v. [[wikt:en:et tu, Brute|et tu, Brut'''e''']])&lt;/ref&gt;
|Hail Brutus!
|-
!Brutus
|Ave Caesar. Quid agis hodie?
|Hail Caesar. How are you today?
|-
!Caesar
|Bene me habeo.&lt;ref&gt;Literally meaning &quot;I have me well&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
|I am well.
|-
!Brutus
|Caesar, nonne Romanus es?
|Caesar, aren't you Roman?
|-
!Caesar
|Sic est. Cur?
|I am. Why?
|-
!Brutus
|Nihil est. Linguamne Latinam loqueris?
|It's nothing. Do you speak Latin?
|-
!Caesar
|Sic est, Linguam Latinam loquor! Cur?
|Yes, I speak Latin! Why?
|-
!Brutus
|Cur non? Ei.. Nihil est. Vale.
|Why not? Oh.. It's nothing. Good bye.
|-
!Caesar
|..Vale..
|..bye..

IF YOU WANT TO USE IT PLEASE ASK ME!!!!

'''Plate tectonics''' is the theory (nothing in science can be absolutely proven) that the Earth is constantly moving, usually only a few inches per century. Plate tectonics mainly deals with the crust of the earth, not the mantle or core. The theory of Pangaea is relative to this. The Pangaea theory in its standard form says that the continents as they are now have moved apart over millions of years to make the world the way it is today. Plate tectonics is what causes volcanoes and earthquakes. It can also help with ocean-floor building, etc. When these plates move apart too fast, an earthquake happens. Earthquakes can lead to volcanic eruptions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello. Hopefully you have come here to start with the effort to clear our [[Category:NPOV Disputes|database of NPOV violations]]. Well, the steps to this are:
#Read-perhaps the vios are catered to, say, a graduate scientist. Check.
#Re-edit-if your reading shows the concentration of NPOV, then GO FOR IT!!!! It is important that you, however, replace the NPOV with very good information that can be verified.
#Reform-even if you have cycled through reading, and perhaps re-editing, and are convinced that it is hopelessly NPOV, then [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion|nominate it for deletion]]. If you add it to this [[/List of NPOV Violations/]], however, you can be saved the trouble of nominating it, because periodically I will post the contents of it up for deletion, and then there will be mass action.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
*A cavernous malformation is a vascular malformation composed of sinusoidal vessels without a large feeding artery.
*The primary difference between a cavernous malformation and an [[Radiation Oncology/CNS/Arteriovenous malformation|AVM]] is the lower pressure gradient.
*Represent 8-15% of intracranial malformations
*70-80% are supratentorial.
*0.25% to 6% annual risk of hemorrhage.

==Treatment==
===Stereotactic radiosurgery===
*'''Pittsburgh, 2002''' (1987-2000) - PMID 12015835 -- &quot;Long-term results after stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with cavernous malformations.&quot; Hasegawa T et al. Neurosurgery. 2002 Jun;50(6):1190-7.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Volume ==

Volume is like area expanded out into 3 dimensions.  Area deals with only 2 dimensions. For volume we have to consider another dimension.  Area can be thought of as how much space some drawing takes up  on a flat piece of paper.  Volume can be thought of as how much space an object takes up.


&lt;!---This table comes from the volume section of wikipedia---&gt;
== Volume formulae == &lt;!--- &quot;formulae&quot; is a correct plural of &quot;formula&quot; ---&gt;
{| class=wikitable
|-
! colspan = 3 | Common [[equation]]s for volume:
|-
!Shape
!Equation
!Variables
|-
|A [[Cube (geometry)|cube]]:
|&lt;math&gt;s^3 = s \cdot s \cdot s&lt;/math&gt;
|''s'' = length of a side
|-
|A rectangular [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]:
|&lt;math&gt;l \cdot w \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;
|l = ''l''ength, w = ''w''idth, h = ''h''eight
|-
|A [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] (circular prism):
|&lt;math&gt;\pi r^2 \cdot h&lt;/math&gt; 
|''r'' = radius of circular face, ''h'' = height
|-
|Any prism that has a constant cross sectional area along the height:
|&lt;math&gt;A \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;
|''A'' = area of the base, ''h'' = height
|-
|A [[sphere]]:
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt; 
|''r'' = radius of sphere&lt;br&gt;which is the [[integral]] of the [[Surface Area]] of a [[sphere]]
|-
|An [[ellipsoid]]:
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3} \pi abc&lt;/math&gt; 
|''a'', ''b'', ''c'' = semi-axes of ellipsoid
|-
|A [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]:
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}Ah&lt;/math&gt;
|''A'' = area of the base, ''h'' = height of pyramid
|-
|A [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] (circular-based pyramid):
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h&lt;/math&gt;
|''r'' = radius of [[circle]] at base, ''h'' = distance from base to tip
&lt;/small&gt;.

|}

(The units of volume depend on the units of length - if the lengths are in meters, the volume will be in cubic '''meters''', etc.)
==Pappus' Theorem==
The volume of any solid whose cross sectional areas are all the same is equal to that cross sectional area times the distance the centroid(the center of gravity in a physical object) would travel through the solid.

[[:Image:PappusCentroidTheoremExample.jpg]]

==Cavalieri's Principle==
If two solids are contained between two parallel planes and every plane parallel to these two plane has equal cross sections through these two solids, then their volumes are equal.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:19, 26 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Key of a Trombone ==

The traditional straight tenor trombone is written in the key of C, also called &quot;Concert Pitch.&quot; This means that trombone, unlike many wind instruments, will play in the same notes as a Piano. 

Many trombones have an &quot;F key&quot; or &quot;F attachment&quot; which adds piping to the trombone allowing it to play in the key of F. This is often used to improve the tuning of the instrument as it gets farther down the scale, or to make faster passages less difficult to play.

Bass Trombones often have similar Keys in F or even Eb, sometimes these can be played at the same time to produce an even lower tone.

== Scales ==

The trombone can play in any scale, however generally the easiest and most common are the first few flatted keys. Bb, Eb, Ab, Db. These are the keys most commonly played in beginning trombone music. 

Scales are often learned in terms of slide position, for example, 2 octaves of the Bb scale would be: 1 6 4 3 1 4 2 1 3 1 3 1 #2 2 1. Gradually, as the player progresses, this should be developed into knowing the notes of the scale as well to encourage the understanding of what they are playing, not just how.

You may notice the notation &quot;#2&quot; in the scale numbers above, this indicates a &quot;short second,&quot; the slide is moved slightly closer to the mouthpiece (a process which takes a great deal of practice and good ear) to produce a more in tune note than the &quot;normal&quot; position for the note. Such &quot;short&quot; positions are generally only used in the very upper reaches of a trombone's range.
Flat positions are more commonly used for trombonists in the valve or F-attachment range like an E below the staff being in b2 position.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to generate a user interface form directly from a model.

== Method ==
Because XForms is a declarative XML file it can be generated by transforming a model of your data directly into a form.  The most common way to store a model of hierarchical data is using an XML Schema.  A server-side program will scan the XML Schema document and for each element found it will create the appropriate XForms elements.

Generated forms have the advantage over hand-crafted forms in that they can can be generated with the same set of transforms.  If you change your form standards all the forms can be quickly be regenerated.  Many of these advantage can be gained by pushing the formatting and layout functionality of a form into CSS style sheets.  But there are also many aspects of a form that are not governed by a style sheet.

If you using a consistent naming convention in your forms you can also use this naming convention to decide what types of input controls to generate based on the information in the element name.  For example simple names and amounts will map to '''input''' controls, boolean true/false values will map to inputs formatted as checkboxes, dates will use calendar selectors, text objects will use '''textarea''' controls and codes will use '''select''' or '''select1''' controls.

Here is a sample of how ISO Data element Representation Terms map to XForms controls:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
! Representation Term
! XForms Control
|- 
| Amount, Name 
| input
|- 
| Indicator
| input with type=&quot;xs:boolean&quot;
|- 
| Date 
| input with type=&quot;xs:date&quot;
|-
| Text
| Textarea
|}

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

 | Closed as '''keep''' as there's no consensus here to delete. Additionally, conversion to a Subject: page as a basis for another method of organizing the language books is left open as a possibility, provided that this system is presented as that of the FSI and not as &quot;gospel truth.&quot; Certainly objections to it's methodology and/or conclusions are possible. Both sides must be [[WB:OR|verifiable]] in whatever arguments are put forward - no opinions please. Interested parties may further discuss conversion to a Subject: page on [[Talk:Language Learning Difficulty for English Speakers]], though opinions expressed here are not to be overlooked. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:45, 21 January 2008 (UTC)

This was tagged for [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]] by [[User:Girdi]], but I don't think it meets any of the speedy deletion criteria. His reason for deletion was &quot;This is just plain nonsense.&quot; I have no opinion for now; I've asked Girdi to expand on his reasons for deletion. FYI, there seems to be a lengthy discussion on the talk page concerning this. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:05, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

{{Vote/Transwiki}} and {{del|speedy delete}} I've taken a brief look at it, and the arguments on the talk page. The reasons listed there seem to focus on whether or not its accurate and its general value. However what I haven't seen pointed out and I believe qualifies for its deletion is that [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not an encyclopedia|Wikibooks modules are not individual encyclopedia-formatted articles]]. This should be transwikied to [[w:|Wikipedia]] and/or [[v:|Wikiversity]] if such a list doesn't already exist on both wikis. In either case this should be deleted, as its not appropriate contents for Wikibooks. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:27, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

:'''Move''' I think this is far better for Wikiversity then Wikipedia, but it is certainly not a book. However, this page does a lot to explain things like {{tlx|Category 3}} and [[:Category:Category 2 Languages]], which are prevalent in the foreign languages book. I recommend, in lieu of a transwiki, that this page be moved to [[:Category:Languages by category]] as an explanatory note for that system of organization. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:28, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
: That categories you have quoted appear to have been added during the development of the book/page which is up for deletion.  If the book is deleted then I would hope that these silly categories are also removed as they have no international uses and are not recognized by major foreign-language learning publishers or the European Council of Europe for Languages.

'''Keep''' I find it quite interesting and useful. [[User:Opiaterein|Opiaterein]] ([[User talk:Opiaterein|talk]]) 03:18, 25 December 2007 (UTC)

:{{del}} I have long argued that this page is crap.  I've never heard of such a dategory of languages before and don't agree with it's aims or how it guages the difficulty of languages. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:13, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
:{{del}} Nonsense. However, I would probably keep the content somewhere off Wikibooks, preferably elsewhere on the Wiki areas. [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 20:21, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

:'''Move''' As per Whiteknight suggestion. I also share the opinion that the list if flawed or oversimplified, but as it is stands it only states the views of The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the US Department of State (be it right or wrong) as such it can serve as the basis for analysis or the creation of a better listing with similar objectives that would/could indeed be made useful. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:29, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

:{{del}} Indeed; it seems to be just a rough indicator of a language's difficulty. [[User:Mouse is back|Mouse]] [[User talk:Mouse is back|is]] [[Special:Contributions/Mouse is back|back]] 01:02, 1 January 2008 (UTC)

:'''Proposal''' I would like to suggest the following changes to this page, as an alternative to deletion:
:#Page be moved to [[Subject:FSI Language Difficulties]] or [[Subject:Languages by Difficulty]], or something similar.
:#Manual book lists on this page be deleted, and replaced with DPL-based lists
:#Text on this page be reworked to be shorter, do more to describe what the FSI is, what the category system means, how it is developed, etc. Also include a note that this might not be an &quot;international standard&quot; way of categorizing languages.
:Considering that we have an entire Subject namespace for organizing things, I guess I don't see a reason not to employ this particular organizational method if there is any value to it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:43, 1 January 2008 (UTC)

::[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] '''Support WK's proposal''' - the language books need to be organized in various ways (currently it's only by language family); difficulty may well be a valid method (how useful a method it is has no bearing on this discussion). This is at least half-decent meta-content, which is perfectly suited to being moved to the Subject: namespace. Perhaps [[Subject:Languages]] should have tabs like [[Subject:Programming]] for various methods of sorting the books below the level of [[Subject:Languages]]. One tab for language families, another for difficulty, another for size of native speaking population, another for...? (as opposed to the simple subcategory method we're using now (which only works because we're only using one sub-categorization method - language family). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:42, 11 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
::{{support}} I also support Wk's proposal. It makes logical sense. - &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:25, 11 January 2008 (UTC)

::: I can't believe that some people are arguing for this to be kept.  Yes we need categorization for our language books but this should be in terms of language families (romance, germanic, etc.) or geographical area (European, African).  The term 'category 1/2/3' also gives the impression that we are referring to the importance of the language and not its difficulty.  It's always difficult to determine how hard a language is but this list has no recognized basis, is not used in the field of language teaching and ignores the fact that the most important thing determining how difficult the language is is the student's own abilities.  This page is quite simply rubbish. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:26, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
::::In principle, language difficulty is as valid an organizational scheme as any other you've mentioned. The problem is with finding a rating system for difficulty that's valid. This one happens to be backed up by &quot;The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the US Department of State.&quot; It may be BS, it may not be. I don't know, and I don't care. Since it's some (presumably) semi-reliable body that's put this together, I'm in no position to argue with them. Maybe leaving the categories as 1/2/3 isn't the best idea - rename them then. The Subject: page could certainly have some notice at the top that &quot;the most important thing determining how difficult the language is is the student's own abilities.  This page is quite simply rubbish&quot; as long as it's [[WB:OR|not just your opinion]]. I might word it differently: &quot;The FSI of the US State Department says this categorization scheme is a good one, but many experts in linguistics note that intrinsic ability and previous experience are the most important factors in language learning.&quot; &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:20, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

:::::Voted retain to broaden discussion topic &amp; nature. If required necessary move to another part of Wikipedia? 
:::::According to my understanding FSI is the origin, of many of the most common language proficiency scales currently used including it's USA successor: Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) Scale.
:::::Many other foreign language government authorities have created similar common language proficiency frameworks.  Many of these follow the very same assumptions that FSI created years ago with some minor tweaks, for example.
:::::&quot;This model has had a strong influence on the design and development of other language frameworks in the academic community: the American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) Proficiency Guidelines, the New Brunswick Oral Proficiency Scale and the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Australia). The Oral Proficiency Interview Scale used by Foreign Affairs Canada also mirrors the ILR scale.   (Paragraph quoted taken from a Canadian Government webpage here.  [http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/lo-ol/pubs/new-nouvelles_perspectives/app-annB_e.cfm]
:::::This same Canadian government source goes on to say this: &quot;Discussion: The ILR framework (and, by virtue, the ACTFL framework and others modeled after it) did not emerge from any particular theory of language learning. As pointed out by Omaggio-Hadley (1993, p. 13), these frameworks “came about primarily as a result of the perceived needs of practitioners in both government and academic settings who wanted to make a difference in the way languages were taught and communicate more effectively about the results of that instruction”. In its earlier form, the ILR scale underscored five (primarily linguistic) traits: accent, comprehension, fluency, grammar and vocabulary. Later task (language functions), topic (content), and accuracy (on the five traits) became the three main criteria, and sociolinguistic ability was added to the traits to be assessed. A careful examination of the descriptors now reveals a close affinity with a theoretically-derived model of communicative language use such as the Canale &amp; Swain (1980) model, with a particular emphasis on functional competence. While this context-embeddedness gives the ILR, ACTFL and similar frameworks a high degree of face validity, it also makes them very task specific.&quot;
:::::In regards, to the question of the FSI validity? The FSI/ILR framework uses a structured interview format (Oral Proficiency Interview) along with standardized scoring criteria, and has a high degree of consistency in scoring across language testers. So, the FSI/ILR does pass a face test validity in practice.
:::::The FSI/ILR point-of-view on language difficulty for English Speakers learning a new language, is one of close affinity with a theoretically-derived model of communicative language use such as the Canale &amp; Swain (1980) model, with a particular emphasis on functional competence. 
:::::Overall, I feel this discussion should be broadened (not erased!), to include other competing points-of-view on the subject of language framework scales.  Isn't the purpose of Wikipedia/Wikibooks to be inclusion of knowledge?  Why not include all the different language framework scales from all parts of the world, and then have a discussion about each one's assumptions, goals, validity, evidence in support of, who uses which scale, et al.
:::::In regards, to a criticism that Europe institutions do not acknowledge the FSI/ISL language framework scales.  Actually, the Goethe-Institute has recently mentioned the similarities between it's own, [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR)]], which is the culmination of over 30 years of work done by the Council of Europe &amp; the USA developed [[ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines]]. According to www.goethe.de [http://www.goethe.de/ins/us/lp/prj/ger/geu/enindex.htm] the Europeans are looking forward  'potential integration of the CEFR and ACTFL scales'. This supports the notion that the ACTFL and it's forefather language framework scales, the FSI/ISL have at the very least the attention of the  members of the Council of Europe and its Language Policy Division in particular. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:71.106.226.141|71.106.226.141]] ([[User talk:71.106.226.141|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/71.106.226.141|contribs]]) 11:49, January 17, 2008.&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">No! This recipe is not authentic and won't even produce a palatable result! Stargazy Pie was called because the fish were baked standing upright on their tails - their (intact) heads thus pointing straight up, poking through the pastry layer. This was to prevent the oil inside the fish (usually pilchards but also herrings or mackerel are used) from leaching out into the pie. This recipes wants beheaded fish laid laterally and the heads arranged on top of the pastry. What would be the point of that - unless you thought fish heads make a good garnish? Secondly, a large handful of fresh parsley and a bay-leaf or two were always added (both of which commonly grow in garden plots in the area and invariably find their way into most savoury dishes) and thirdly, clotted cream - plentiful and no more expensive in the necessary quantity (about a spoonful) than egg and always preferred - is added through a little centre gap in the pastry AFTER the pie has cooked. THIS RECIPE here WILL NOT WORK! I'm not blaming the poster of it - a Cornish Women's Institure book should have a good recipe, right? Not from that date. No one made in the 60's - its been revived recently but regular authentic use didn't survive WWI. By then, it was just folklore and this recipe is someone's idea of it based upon a standard shortcrust pastry pie technique. I'll post mine. Directly.[[Special:Contributions/90.242.102.64|90.242.102.64]] ([[User talk:90.242.102.64|talk]]) 02:52, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

------------------

As I haven't bothered to try this, I can only imagine that the recipe doesn't taste paticulaly good - but one thing is certain and that is that the dish has absolutely nothing to do with the original version, where the entire boned fish is covered with pastry and the fish heads stick out looking upwards.

{{cuisine|Cornish}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|UK Cuisine]]

== General Introduction ==
The cuisine of the far south-west peninsula of the United Kingdom was traditionally based upon both the constraints and abundance dictated by its geography and later by its industrial heritage. Abundant but rough seas, edged by precipitous coastline, provided both cheap protein for the locals and an export trade in salted fish when shoals swarmed close in but desperation when they failed; scattered fishing villages starved when unable to put to stormy seas in the relentless south-westerlies.

Tin-miners, originally working proud under their unique system of tribute, slowly lost political and monetary ground after the Enclosures Act and Industrial Revolution together put power solidly back into the hands of the wealthy - and largely absent -landowners. Importation of grain, whether from across the Tamar or shipped in, was ever needed due to the lack of suitable land for crop cultivation without the peaty moorlands, saltings and stream-tumbled valleys. What pasture could be found was thin and difficult: goats and sheep invariably provided what little meat the tinner, labourer or fisherman might see on a rare holiday. Farming was largely subsistence: wool was the usual product and comparatively few holdings outside of the landed estates were able to raise pigs or poultry beyond the family's own needs. Fortunately, the mild, wet climate meant that what crops and livestock (other than those exposed on the moors) that were raised - whether on the isolated farms or grown in the small gardens of the cob cottages - were rarely threatened by frosts. Both geography and climate continued to be the critical economic and social factor in the homogenisation of regional cultures precipitated by the advent of the railways, as Cornwall became the popular holiday destination it remains.

The end of the 20th century saw the last of tin-mining and the struggles of a remnant fishing industry at the same time as a new awareness and appreciation of local history and cultural heritage sought to preserve and celebrate what remained. As tourism thrives in new directions in the county, these forces together have been the major factor in the late 20th century renaissance in the production, distribution and appreciation of locally -grown and reared food. This led to a renewed interest in traditional cuisine and methods and this has in turn provided the tourist trade with a new and stimulating venture in attracting visitors keen to sample local flavours. Independent shops, farms and markets have also thrived from the demand for their produce and even the major supermarket branches have responded to pressure to reduce food miles and improve diversity by offering both staples and specialities that are locally sourced.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Achaemenid Empire fell with the defeat of Darius III at Arbela and the conquest of the Empire. A pretender rose to the throne calling himself Artaxerxes V but he was captured by Alexander and killed. With this Achaemenid rule came to an end and the country was taken over by the Greeks. Two Greek dynasties ruled Persia one after the another for a period of hundred years. They were eventually displaced by the rising Parthian power which drove the Seleucids the last of the two dynasties west into Syria and established its own rule in Persepolis.  



=== Alexander III or Alexander the Great 331 - 323 BC ===

Alexander the Great or Alexander III of Macedon became overlord of all Persia on the defeat of Darius III Condomannus at the Battle of Arbela. Darius III fled the battlefield and was captured and killed by the eunuch Bessas who ascended the throne assuming the title Artaxerxes V. But soon afterwards, Alexander invaded Persepolis and burnt down the city. Artaxerxes V was captured and punished with death for having caused the dead of Darius III. Later, Alexander gave a royal funeral to Darius III and married one of his daughters.

Alexander did not spend enough time at Persepolis to consolidate his hold on the Empire. Immediately after proclaiming himself as the Shah of Persia, he left for the East on a conquering spree taking the eastern satraps of Gandhara, Bactria,the Swat Valley and the Punjab. In Punjab, he encountered the Indian ruler Porus and defeated him but did not proceed further into Indian territory and was obliged to return. He died in 323 BC at Babyon. The cause is not known, but food poisoning is suspected.

The administrative structure of the Achaemenids remained largely intact all through Alexander's rule. The Persian satraps governed the satrapies for their Greek overlords. And Alexander did not distinguish between Persians and Greeks in Government service. He tried to foster c;ose friendly relations between the Persians and the Greeks and encouraged Greek soldiers to intermarry with native women.    

However, orthodox Zoroastrians remembered Alexander's period of rule for the tyranny he unleashed on Zoroastrianism and Zoroastrians. Being a polytheist himself, it is believed that he despised monotheistic religions and ordered the Avesta to be destroyed in its entirety. Zoroastrian scriptures mention him as &quot;the ally of the Evil One&quot;. His invasion is believed to be the first ever cataclysm which befell Zoroastrianism the second one being the invasion of the Arabs. The Shahnameh casts an aura of divinity about him by nurturing fanatastical legends and unfounded rumors about Alexander actually being the son of Darius III and a daughter of Philip of Macedon who was smuggled to Macedon in his infancy and brought up in the custody of his grandfather in order to conceal the true identity of his parents. But there is no available historical evidence to substantiate this claim.Nevertheless, Alexander left behind a legacy of destruction and intolerance which Zoroastrians found difficult to forget or forgive for centuries to come.

=== Alexander IV 323 - 309 BC ===

On the unexpectedly early death of Alexander in 323 BC, the Crown passed to his stillborn son who later ascended the throne as Alexander IV. Alexander IV was the last ruler of the united Macedonian Empire. The kingdom, however, was torn apart by anarchy and civil war. With an incompetent  minor on the throne, the distant outlying provinces became the target of adventurers and claimants to the throne.  

On the death of Alexander IV in 309 BC, the kingdom broke into three parts -- the European provinces of the Empire were under the hereditary royal line of Macedonian kings who maintained an uninterrupted succession from  Alexander the Great; the Asian provinces which comprised over three-fourths of the Empire became independent under Seleucus I Nikator a general of Alexander the Great who established the Seleucid Dynasty while the African provinces of the Empire comprising mostly of Egypt became independent under the Greek Ptolemies. 


== The Seleucids ==

When Alexander's kingdom disintegrated a few years after his death, Persia came under the rule of Seleucus I Nikator, a general of Alexander. Seleucus Nikator and his successors the Seleucids ruled Persia from 320 BC till 250 BC when most of Persia became independent under Parthian rule. The remainder was snatched away from Seleucids in stages from 250 BC to 171 BC. By the end of the 2nd century BC, the authority of the Seleucids over Persia had vanished. However, the Seleucids continued to rule over Syria till 65 BC when a Roman invasion of Syria wiped away the last remnants of Greek imperialism. 


=== Seleucus I Nikator 320 - 281 BC ===

Seleucus I or Seleucus Nikator a general of Alexander was made satrap of Babylon on the second division of the Empire in 320 BC. In the struggle between Antigonus and Eumenes  for sovereignty he supported Antigonus against his rival. But strangely, this only invoked the jealousy of Antigonus instead of his gratitude and he schemed to do away with Seleucus. Hence, Seleucus was forced to flee and he fled to the court of Ptolemy of Egypt who offered him protection. Meanwhile,the conduct of Antigonus had made a lot of enemies and ultimately culminated in the Battle of Ipsus (301 BC) in which &quot;the Allies&quot; inflicted a crushing defeat upon him. Seleucus was one of the first to rebel and he was locked in a dreadful confrontation with Antigonus ever since the recovery of Babylon in 312 BC. He led the bulk of the troops in the Battle of Issus as a consequence of which he was recognized as the independent overlord of all the Greek conquests in Asia.

Soon after obtaining his independence, Seleucus seems to have organized an invasion of India. Seleucus wantedf to annex the lands to the east of the Indus whioch Alexander had failed to conquer. But Seleucus faced a stout resistance from the emerging Mauryan power which successfully blocked his advance. Chandragupta Maurya (the ''Sandrocottus'' of the Greeks) , the Mauryan king pushed back the Greek troops to the other side of the Indus and conquered Afghanistan. The war came to an abrupt end and peace was concluded. As per the terms of the peace, Pakthoonistan, eastern Afghanistan, Bactria, Baluchistan and parts of Sistan were made over to Chandragupta Maurya in return for a princely gift of 500 war elephants. A marital alliance was sealed between the two with the marriage of Seleucus' daughter Helen with Chandragupta Maurya. Megasthenes was sent as the Greek ambassador to the Indian court and he has described the splendors of the Mauryan capital Pataliputra (''Greek'':Palimbothra) in his book ''Indica''.

During the initial years of his reign, Babylon was the capital of the Empire. But in 301 BC, he constructed the city of Selucia-upon-the-Tigris and moved the capital to that city. After the Battle of Ipssus, he once again shifted his capital and moved the seat of his Government to the city of Antioch in Syria. Antioch was to remain the capital of Seleucus Nikator and his successors till the end of the Seleucid Empire.

Selecus I died in 281 BC and was succeeded by his son Antiochus I.

=== Antiochus I (Soter) 281 - 261 BC ===

Antiochus I ruled from 281 BC to 261 BC. He was involved in constant warfare with the kings of the west. He invaded the kingdom of Bithynia in Turkey during the reigns of Zipcetas and Nicomedes I. Antiochus I found it difficult to subjugate Bithynia as Nicomedes was aided by the Gauls. Finally, the wars ended on an indecisive note. In 263 BC, he attacked Eumenes of Pergamus but was defeated at Sardis. He also launched a massive invasion of Egypt to support the rebelling Cyrenes against the Ptolemaic ruler but was once again unsuccessful. Both Antiochus I and II were preoccupied with their wars in the West that they paid little attention to the east. Untimately the level of neglect reached such alarming proportions during the reign of Antiochus II that a full-scale revolution broke in Parthia which was not put down in time. This resulted in the formation of the Parthian Empire and started the process of dismemberment of Greek rule in Persia.

=== Antiochus II (Theus) 261 - 249 BC ===

Antiochus I died in 261 BC and was succeeded by Antiochus II. Soon after his accession to the throne, he indulged in war with Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt. In 260 BC, he deposed Timachus, the tyrant of the country of Miletus thereby provoking Egypt into war. The bwar lasted over a decade until peace was concluded at the fag end of Antiochus Theus' reign. But by then, Antiochus had lost the satrapies of Parthia and Bactria which had broke off between 256 aqnd 250 BC when Antiochus was occupied in an intense struggle with Egypt apart from indulging in hostilies with Atropatene. He made no attempt to recover then. He died soon after the war came to an end.

=== Decline of the Seleucids and the Rise of Parthia ===

In 256 BC, when Antiochus II was busy in his wars, the Greek satrap of Bactria (the Persian ''Baktri'' or modern-day Balkh in Afghanistan) Diodotus declared his independence. Sometime between 256 and 250 BC, Arsaces(Arshaka) an inhabitant of Parthia revolted and established the Parthian kingdom. The Parthian kingdom gradually rose from strength to strength displacing the Seleucid Empire over a period of time. Antiochus II died soon after the war in Egypt came to an end.

Antiochus II was succeeded by his son Seleucus II during whose reign Ptolemy Euergetes the ruler of Egypt invaded the kingdom and occupied Antioch. Seleucus II ruled as a feudatory of Ptolemy who penetrated the kingdom upto its Eastern frontiers and threatened to revive the mighty empire of Alexander the Great. But a rebellion in Egypt cut short his enterprise thereby sparing both Selecus II and the emerging Parthian kingdom from destruction. 

In 237 BC, Seleucus II allied with his brother Antiochus Hierax and invaded Parthia to recover lost territory. But the alliance soon broke off and Tiridates the Parthian monarch administered a crushing defeat on Seleucus II in the battle that ensued. For the next twenty years, Seleucus II concentrated his energies on quelling the rebellion of his brother Antiochus Hierax that he allowed Tiridates to go scot free. 

In 214 BC, another jolt was administered to the crumbling Seleucid Empire when taking advantage of a civil war between Antiochus III the son of Seleucus II and Emperor of Syria and Achseus a rebel satrap the Parthian king Artabanus invaded the tract of Media and annexed it to his empire. No sooner had he quelled the rebellion by Achseus that Antiochus III turned his attention to Parthia and invaded the kingdom. The capital of the Parthian Empire Hecatompylos was occupied and Artabanus the Parthian monarch was forced to flee. At length, Artabanus submitted and was permitted to rule as a satrap of Syria.Soon after the successful war against Parthia, Antiochus III proceeded further eastward and subdued Bactria.

Syria had a minor revival during the reign of Antiochus III also called Antiochus the Great but the decline commenced once again after his death. During the reign of Seleucus IV (Philopater) who ruled from 181 to 174 BC, the Parthian monarch Phraates occupied Media and Rhagai. As a result ,the Seleucid kingdom was cut off from its eastern territories. Seleucus IV was succeeded by his brother Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 174 BC. Epiphanes earned the detestable reputation of being a religious fanatic who tried to force Hellenistic polytheism upon monotheistic Jews of Palestine. During his reign, Egypt claimed Palestine and a battle was fought with Egypt from 171 to 168 BC. It was brought to an end only by the intereference of Rome which asked Syria to cede all occupied territories to Egypt. Epiphanes made a successful conquest of Armenia in 165 BC but troubles began to brew in the homefront due to his policy of religious intolerance and destruction of Zoroastrian temples. Epiphanes died in 164 BC and was succeeded by a lad of nine. The boy Antiochus Eupator was deposed a few years later by a rival contender Demetrius who ascended the throne. A few years later Media was conquered by the Parthian monarch Mithridates. In 140 BC, the Seleucid monarch Demetrius II invaded Parthia with the hope of recovering lost provinces but was caught off-guard and captured by Mithridates who took him prisoner. 

Antiochus Sidetus was crowned Emperor in 140 BC in the absence of Demetrius II. He fought the pretender Tryphon and punished him with death in the year 137 BC. He then turned his attention to Palestine and subdued the province by 133 BC. By 129 BC he was well-prepared for an invasion of Parthia. Collecting over 120,000 soldiers sidetus crossed the frontier and invaded the Parthian Empire. The border provinces of Parthia fed-up with an oppressive administration openly welcomed the invader. However, winter impeded the progress of the army and following his instinct, Sidetus split up his army into several units and settled the towns of Mesapotamia. Phraates the Parthian Emperor saw his chance and sent Demetrius with a large Parthian army to reclaim the throne. The inhabitants were displeased with the haughty nature of the Greek soldiers and conspired a plot to cut down Sidetus' army in league with Phraates. Accordingly, on an appointed day, the inhabitants of Mesapotamia rose against the Seleucid soldiers camped inn their province and massacred all of them. The Parthian army pursued the remainder of the Seleucid army back into Syria. Sidetus was killed on the way and was succeeded by Demetrius. This was the last time that a Seleucid ruler dared to invade the Parthian Empire. The Seleucid Empire did survive till 65 BC but its power was greatly reduced and its influence felt only in Syria. in 65 BC, a Roman invasion of Syria put an end to the struggling Seleucid kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Qobad I (First reign) 488 - 498 ==

When Balash died in 488, civil war broke out. Qobad, a son of Firuz, entered the Persian capital with an army of Huns and captured the throne. 

Qobad's actual Persian name seems to have been Kavadh which has been Arabized to Qobad. Immediately on ascending thehrone, he fought back the Khazars who had invaded the country. He resisted them with an army of over one hundred thousand men and drove them back across the fromntier. He also built fortified posts a;ong the northern frontier to protect the kingdom.

Around this time, Qobad came under the influence of one Mazdak which proved to be detrimental to his future. He tried to impose Mazdakism upon the country and had to face vehement protest from the Zoroastrian mobeds. The imposition of Mazdakism as the state religion was the last straw. Christian Armenia rebelled and broke off its allegiance to Persia when compelled to adopt MaZdakism. Vatian was appointed king of Armenia. 

Eventually, a rebellion of the Persian populace  placed power in the hands of the Magi who immediately deposed him and placed Jamasp upon the throne of Persia.

== Jamasp 498 - 501 ==

The crown was placed upon Jamasp's head immediately after Qobad had fled the kingdom. Jamasp was a man of peaceful disposition and did not fight any wars.

In 501, three years after Jamasp had been crowned king, Qobad returned at the head of 30,000 Hephthalite horsemen and demanded that the kingdom be reinstated unto him. Jamasp obliged and abdicated in favor of Qobad.

== Qobad I (Second reign) 501 - 531 ==

Immediately after commencing his second reign, Qobad I turned against the Mazdakites and organized a series of persecutions. This won him the sanction of the Magi who were responsible for deposing him earlier.

=== War Against Rome ===

As per the peace of 442, Rome was required to pay a certain amount of money for the upkeep of the fortresses along the border. However, Rome refused. Provoked, Qobad invaded Roman Armenia and captured Theodosiopolis. He then proceeded to ravage Roman Armenia and Roman Mesapotamia taking the impregnable fortress of Amida and plundering Arzanne. A party of Romans encountered a body of 800 Huns who fought in support of Persia and slaughtered it to the last man. However, they were surprised by a contingent of Persian troops nearby and had to pay the price. At this instant, as war was raging in all its fury, a Hephthalite invasion compelled Qobad to call off the invasion. The Romans recovered all the lost provinces. Peace was concluded between the warring forces and Rome agreed to pay the required amount of money for the upkeep of the frontier garrisons.

=== War Against the Huns ===

The campaign against the Huns occupied Qobad uninterruptedly for the next ten years. Rome triend to make most of the situation by strengthening its frontier garrisons. The war against the Huns came to an end only in 517.

In 517, when the battle against the Huns came to an end Qobad made a formal complaint against Constantinople. The Romans did not apologize but made professions of friendship. The Roman Emperor Justin concluded a treaty with the Huns and with Lazica to forge an alliance against Persia. The uneasy condition prevailed till the end of Qobad's reign but did not aggravate into full-fledged war.

=== Persecution of the Mazdakites ===

In 523, there came to light, a conspiracy to remove Qobad's son Khusro and replace him with another son of Qobad, a Mazdakite sympathizer named Phthasarus to the throne. Qobad was overcome by rage and instructed Khusro to destroy Mazdak and his cult in the Empire. The prince accordingly unleashed a reign of terror which put an end to Mazdakism. Mazdakism, however, did survive in a much reduced form till the Islamic conquests and even after. It is considered to be one of the major factors which inspired the nationalist Khoramdin movement against Arab rule.

=== Second War with Rome ===

In 523, Gurgenes the king of Iberia whom Qobad had pressurized to accept Zoroastrianism broke into open revolt. Qobad responded by dispatching a large army which quelled the rebellion and carried the war far into Roman territory. Rome retaliated by invading Persarmenia and Mesapotamia in 526. Two Roman contingents were sent against Persia both of which were defeated. In early 528, Belisarius the Roman commander was ordered to build a fort on the Persian border at Mindon but Qobad sent an army of 30,000 men against him whic spoiled his efforts.

Shortly afterwards, Belisarius was made 'Commander of the East'. He fought 50,000 Persian soldiers commanded by Mihran and utterly routed them. The Romans were also victorious in Armenia where Mermeroes the Persian general had to face defeat. 

In 531, Al Mondar or Alamandarus the sheikh of the Arabs concluded an alliance with Persia. A joint Perso-Arab army was sent under Azarethes against the Romans. Belisarius quitted Daras but was defeated on the banks of the Euphrates and forced to flee. 

Qobad did not survive for long after the completion of the Perso-Roman war. He died on September 12, 531 at the age of eighty-two and was succeeded by his son, Khusro Anushirvan or Khusro I.

== Khusro I (Anushirvan) 531 - 578 ==

Khusro Anushirvan ascended the throne in 531 after disposing off the rival contenders to the throne. On ascending the throne, he even went one steop further by eliminating the entire male line of Qobad I.

As soon as he ascended the throne, he concluded what has been termed hy historians as the &quot;endless peace with Rome&quot;. While the peace was in vogue, the Roman Emperor Justinian was busy tackling the barbarian hordes which invaded his empire. Belisarius, especially, distinguished himself in these campaigns, emerging as the greatest general of the day. In 539, the defeated Ostrogoth king of Italy appealed to Khusro for help and Khusro responded by besieging Antioch thereby triggering the First Roman War of his reign.

=== First Roman War ===

Khusro Anushirvan invaded Antioch and reduced the citizens to utter desperation. However, he spared the city when the inhabitants agreed to pay a huge ransom. Khusro then passed north of Antioch and plundered Seleucia, Apameia and CHalcis before crossing the Euphrates into Mesapotamia and attacking Edessa, Constantina and Daras in quick succession.  Around this time, the Romans attacked Lazica forcing Khusro to divert his attention. Khusro immediately attacked Petra and conquered it after killing its commander Johannes.

Meanwhile, a contingent of Romans under Belisarius reached Mesapotamia and ravaged the province. However, the Roman siege of Nisibis failed. Belisarius sent Arethas, an Arab sheikh to invade Persian Mespotamia. But contrary to the general's orders, Arethas ravaged Persian Mesapotamia and took the spoils for himself.  

Khusro responded by crossing the Euphrates into Syria in the year 542 and invading Hierapolis. Butn when it appeared as if Hierapolis would fall, Belisarius arrived with his larege army and spread his troops along the Euphrates. Khusro fell upon the city of Callinicus and finding it undefended razed it to the ground. However an outburst of plague forced Khusro to retreat across the Euphrates. Khusro, then, invaded Armenia but the prevalence of a plague epidemic forced him to withdraw. The Romans responded by invading the village of Anglon in Persarmenia but the Persians offered a stout resistance forcing the former to withdraw.

In 544, Khusro once again crossed into Mesapotamia and besieged Edessa but was repulsed. Soon peace was concluded for a five-year long period.

=== Khusro's Second War with Rome ===

In 549, Rome incited Lazica to revolt against the Persians and sent an army of eight thousand men to aid them. This triggered the Second Roman War of Khusro Anushirvan. The Lazi king welcomed the Romans with open arms to deliver them from Persian rule. Khusro hatched a plot to assassinate the Lazi king but the plot failed.

The hostilies commenced when the Romans besieged Petra. The siege lasted many days but in the end, was successful.

In 550, the Persians took the field under a new general Chorianes and beat back the Lazi. But the retreating Lazi were reinforced by the Romans. They counter-attacked the Persians and killed their commander Chorianes. Soon afterwards, Dagisthseus was replaced by Bessas as the commander of the Roman army. The Romans besieged Petra and after overcoming some stiff resistance offered by the Persians succeeded in conquering the city. 

With the arrival of spring, Mermeroes took command of the Persian army and led a large contingent of horsemen and eight elephants into Lazica. The Persians succeeding in conqering most of Lazica. Mermeroes even extended Persian rule over  a few neighbouring provinces.

Meanwhile, even while the war was being fought in Lazica, peace was concluded between Rome and Persia by the Roman Emperor Justinian and the Sassanid Khusro Anushirvan. In 553, Mermeroes drove back the Romans and completelky surrounded them within a small tract by the Caspian known as 'The Island' before commencing his return march. But during his return, Mermeroes was affaected by fatigue and passed away at Kutais.

At this juncture, Gubarzes, the king of Lazica quarreled with the Romans and shifted allegiance to Persia. He was eventally killed by the Romans and replaced with a monarch with pro-Rome sympathies. The Rome-Lazi alliance was renewed in 555 and hostilites commenced once more. Nachoragan who replaced Mermeroes besieged the Roman soldiers left behind in &quot;The Island&quot; but was unsuccessful. Nachoragan was eventually recalled to Persia. The war came to an end in 557 by the signing of a peace treaty.

=== Invasion of Yemen ===

Abraha, the Abyssinian King of Yemen had died and there was a civil war raging between the heir-apparent Yaksoum who had ascended the throne and his half-brother Saif who was hurt by Yaksoum who had insulted him gravely. Saif sought Khusro's help which was at once accepted. A large Persian fleet under Saif landed at Aden and fought Yaksoum forcing him to flee. Saif ascended the throne and ruled for a couple of years before he was murdered. On his death, Khusro took over the administration of Yemen and made it a Persian province.

=== War with the Turks ===

Desirous of an alliance with Persia, Dizabul the Khan of the Turks sent ambassadors with costly presents to the court of Khusro Anushirvan. But Khusro poisoned the envoys and ordered the presents to be thrown into the sea. Humilated, Dizabul invaded Persia from the north in alliance with the Romans. The Turks took Shash, Ferghana, Samarkand, Bokhara and the northern provinces of Iran but fled when Khusro's son Ormazd arrived at the head of a large army. In 571, the Turksa sent envoys to nthe ROman Emperor and the very next year, a large Roman army invaded Persia.

=== The Last Roman War of Khusro Anushirvan ===

A large Roman army under Marcian had besieged Nisibis. Khusro at once proceeded to the relief of Nisibis and defeated the invaders. The Romans retreated to the fortress of Daras which was besieged by the Persians. At the same time, the Persian general Adarman crossed the Euphrates with an army of 6000 and ravaged Syria traking all the cities and important fortresses with the exception of Antioch. 

Khusro besieged Daras with an army of 40,000 horse and 100,000 foot but  the Roman garrison at Daras gave a brave resistance.

Meanwhile, the aged Emperor Justinian abdicated in favor a younger monarch , the Count TIberius who sent envoys to the court of Khusro. Both sides agreed for peace for a period of two years.

But despite the peace, hostilities continued in Armenia. Khusro invaded Armenia with a large army and conquered most of the province. The war was even carried into neighbouring Cappadocia. The Roman general Justinian retaliated by invading Persarmenia anmd pillaging it as far as the Caspian Sea.  In 576, the Romans gained the upper hand in Northern Armenia and Iberia while Khusro made an unsuccessful siege of Theodosiopolis. Later that year, the Persian general Tamchosro inflicted a crshing defeat on the Romans under Justinian. 

In 578, the Persians invaded Roman Armenia with an army of 20,000 horse. Simultaneously, Tamchosro invaded Amida. The Roman general Maurice responded by invading Persian Armenia and ravaging the country. He plundered the district of Arzanne and crossed into Eastern MEsapotamia and taking Singara, spread daeth and devastation all over the district. Around this time, Khusro passed away and was succeeded by his son Ormazd.

=== Reforms of Khusro Anushirvan ===

F. Altheim has studied the tax reforms of Chosroes in detail. From his conclusions we learn that all land were surveyed and taxed in the same way everywhere, while revenues which formerly frequently went to the nobles were to come into the central government treasury. 

Khusro introduced a new class of knights called &quot;dehkans&quot; who were required to maintain armies of their own. These knights were more powerful than feudal lords and villages were entrusted to them for the maintenance of these armies. The whole empire was divided into four military districts each under the protection of a ''spahbod'' or Commander-in-chief.

Khusro Anushirvan's time is also renowned for the progress in art and architecture. Qala-e-Dukhtar is a fine example of architecture of Anushirvan. Large quantity of silverware from the time of Khusro Anushirvan have sruvived to the modern day. There is also a marked improvement in the quality of coins minted by the state indicating progress and prosperity. Excavations in Iran and toher parts of the Sassanid Empire have revealed a number of seals from the Anushirvan era. 

Throughout the Sassanid era, the ''Mobeds'' reigned supreme and even officiated as judges, witnesses and custodians of territorial records.

=== Legacy ===

Khusro Anushirvan was arguably the greatest of the Sassanian monarchs. The evolution of classical Iranian civilization reached its culmination during this period. During his reign, pre-conquest Iranian culture reached the pinnacle of greatness and glory inspiring fables and legends. One sch fable is the story of the ''Arabian Nights'' which is supposedly a series of tales written during the time of Khusro Anushirvan. During the Arab conquest, the tales made their way to Iraq where they were borrowed by the Arabs and adpted by them to suit local conditions during the time of the Abbasids. During this period, the Persians also translated many notable foriegn works into Persian. Burzoe a prominent physician in the Sassanian court and ''vazir'' to Khusro Anushirvan translated the ''Panchatantra'' into Pahlavi. The Pahlavi translation ''Khalileh o Demneh'' was later translated into Arabic and became one of the most popular works of Arabic literature. The ''Academy of Gundeshapur'' became renowned all over the world as a centre of learning. The &quot;Pandnamak-i Vozurg-Mihr-i Bukhtakan&quot; (Modern Persian: Pandnameh e Bozorgmehr e Bakhtegan), a book of advice, which is another book attributed to Bozorgmehr, was preserved in the royal treasury (ganj-e shahigan) of Iran in the Sassanid Empire and has been translated into modern languages.

The game of chess reached Europe from India through Persia. It was known to the Indians as ''chathuranga'' and to the Persians as ''shatranj''. Brzoe himself is reputed to be a fine chess player.       

The renowned Iranoloist Frye regards Khusro Anushirvan as the greatest of the Sassanian monarchs. '''Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, is said to have remarked once that he was fortunate to have been born during the reign of an illuminated monarch as Khusro Anushirvan'''.

== Ormazd IV ==

The Roman Emperor Tiberius sent an offer of peace to Ormazd IV. But the latter rejected the offer. So in 579, the Roman general Maurice set off at the head of a large army and ravaged Kurdistan. He, inititally, planned to penetrate into and occupy Mespotamia. but the treacherous Arab sheikh Alamandarus betrayed him. The Persian general Adarman was sent the head of a large army to fight Maurice but was defeated. Maurice was able to make a safe retreat` to the Roman frontier. 

In 581, the Persians crossed the frontier under Tamchosro and invaded Constantia but was defeated and repulsed b y Maurice and Tamchosro himself, slain. At this juncture, Maurice was recalled by the ailing king Tiberius who handed the crown unto him. Maurice sent Johannes to lead the troops in the East. Johannes attacked the Persians but suffered a series of defeates. He was recalled and replacedm with Philippicus. Philippicus spent the years 584 and 585 making deep inroads into Persian territory. The Persians retaliated by attacking Monocartium and Martyropolis. Philippicus responded by invading Eastern Mesapotamia and chased the retreating army all the way to the fortress of Daras. He besieged the fortress of Chlomoron but was forced to withdraw. Philippicus retreated to Amida and handed over the mantle to one Heraclius.

Heraclius led an infantry division into Persian territory and ravaged the plains of the Tigris. However, a mutiny in the Roman army in 588, facilitated the Persian troops who invaded Constantia though unsuccessfully. In 589, the Persians crossed the frontier, and due to the treachery of Sittas a ROman officer, were able to occpy Martyroplois. Philippicus was replaced by Comentiolus under whom the Romans sccessfully conquered Nisibis. Later that year, Comentiolus successfully penetrated into Persian territory and began to threaten the whole of Mesapotamia. At the very instant when Romans were threatening Martyropolis, the Turks were plundering the northern provinces of the Empire. Ormazd dispatched Bahram with a large army to fight the Turks. The latter defeated the Turks and killed their ''Khan'' or leader. When the campaign came to an end, he was sent to lead the Persian troops against the Romans in the West. Bahram ravaged Colchis and other Roman cities but nsuffered a defeat at Araxes. Ormuzd was jealous of the successes of the Bahram and desired to insult him with the intention of harming his morale. So, he responded to the defat at Araxes by dispatching a set of women's garments. Enraged, Bahram sent Ormazd a letter of rebuke in which he addressed the former not as the son but the daughter of Khusro Anushirvan. Ormazd dispatched soldiers to arrest Bahram and bring him in chains. But the soldiers sent for the purpose went over to Bahram. Bahram incited his army against Ormazd resulting in widespread rebellion. 

At about the same time, Ormazd suspected his son Khusro and his brothers-in-law Bindoes and Bostan of conspiring against him and banished them from the kingdom. Bindoes and Bostan returned from exile in a few months and overthrew Ormazd making Khusro the Emperor of Persia.  

Khusro ascended the throne as Khusro II and had to immediately contend with the rebellion of Bahram. Bahram invaded Persia at the head of a large army. Khusro faced him on the banks of the Holwan river but was defeated and fled the kingdom. Bahram captured Ctesiphon and ascended the throne as Bahram VI.

== Bahram VI ==

Soon after Bahram's accession, a rebellion broke out in Armenia. However, Bahram ensured the neutrality of Mesapotamia by strengthening the defences of Anatho and Nisibis.

Meanwhile, Khusro was well received by the Roman Governor of Circesium who not only offered him asylum but also military aid against Bahram. 

In early spring of 590, Khusro proceeded at the head of 70,000 Roman troops upto the banks of the Tigris, from where he sent a detahcment eastward whie he, himself marched alongside the river Zab and in four days, reached the vicinity of Ctesiphon. In a series of two battles, Bahram was defeated and overthrown. He fled to the protection of the Turks of the north leaving Khusro in effective control of all Persia.   

== Khusro II (Perviz) 591-628 ==

Khusro ascended the throne in 591 when Bahram fled the kingdom. He ruled for 37 years. His period was one of exhilarating highs and humiliating lows. During his reign, the Sassanid Empire reached its greatest extent ever before plunging to depths of ignominy and subordination. He launched a relentless campaign against the Romans in Mesapotamia, West Asia, Turkey, Armenia and Egypt which imposed a great strain on the resources of the country that a decade from the end of Khusro's rule, the Sassanid Empire had passed into history.

As soon as he ascended the throne, Khusro reportedly had his uncles who were responsible for the murder ot Ormazd executed. This helped appease the people who had accused him of the guilt of parricide.

During the first eleven years of his reign, the relations with Rome were cordial and there was no animosity of discord which existed between them. In 602, however, the ROman Emperor Maurice who was on friebdly terms with Persia, was murdered by Phocus who usurped the throne. 

=== Conquests ===

In 603, Khusro declared war against the Romans and sent Narses across the frontier while he positioned himself in Mesapotamia. In 605, Khusro besieged Daras at the head of a large army and captured it successfully. Khusro ravaged Mesapotamia and easily conquered the fortress of Amida. In 607, the Persians took Harra, Resaina and Edessa. That very same year, Persian legions crossed the Euphrates and annexed the whole of Syria to the Sassanid Empire. A second Persian army entered Armenia and after successfully taking the strongholds of Satala and Theodosiopolis, invaded Cappadocia and successfully conquered Caesarea Mazaca. Phrygia and Galatia were invested as Persian troops proceeded as far as Chalcedon, opposite to Constantinople.  

In 610, the usurper Phocas was deposed and replaced with Heraclius as the Emperor of COnstantinople. The country was in turmoil. Taking advantage of this confusion, Khusro sent his general Shahr Barz to invade Syria. Shahr Barz successfully conquered Damascus and made it his base. From Damascus, he launched attacks on Palestine in 614 and conquered it by inciting civil unrest fuelled by a deep hatred for Christian Romans amongst the Jews. Jerusalem fell after a six-day long siege. The Cross of St.Helena, &quot;the True Cross&quot; was discovered and transported to the royal harem of Ctesiphon where it remained in the safe cstody of Shirin, the Christian wife of Khsro.

In 616, Shahr Barz entered Egypt after successful conquest of Sinai and the Pelusium. Alexandria fell in a short time and the rest of Egypt was conquered with little resistance. Persian troops advanced to the south and carried the Sassanid arms as far as the Ethiopian frontier. Meanwhile, Shahen commanded the troops in the north. Chalcedon on the opposite shores of the Bosporus to Constantinople was conquered after a short siege and the Persian army could been seen within a mile in sight of the Roman capital of Constantinople.

=== Heraclius' Invasion of Persia ===

On Easter 622, the Roman Emperor Heraclius personally took command of the army and attacked the Persians in Armenia in which Shahr Barz was defeated for the first time. The Romans launched a second invasion at the onset of winter taking Lazica in alliance with the Khazars. Then, mustering an army of 120,000 men, Heraclius lanched a second invasion of Armenia. Khusro established himself in Azerbaijan and sent two armies one under Shahr Barz and the other under Shahen to face Heraclius. Heraclis, however, withdrew from Armenia and attacked Azerbaijan forcing Khusro to withdraw. 

In 624, Khusro took the offensive and dispatched an army to attack Heraclius in Albania. However, Shahr Barz soffered three consecutive defeats, in  the last of which his army was cut to pieces. 

Early the next spring, Heraclius crossed the Tigris into Arzanne and recovered Martyropolis and Amida. But by the end of March, Khusro had established himself along the banks of the Euphrates forcing Heraclius to withdraw to theb safety of Cilicia. The Persians pursued the retreating Romans resulting in a deadly confrontation in Cilicia in which the Persians were defeated. Heraclius wintered at Sebaste(Sivas) in Cappadocia. With support from the Avars, Khusro sent two armies, one under Shahr Barz to assiste the Avars in a preplanned siege of Constantinople and the other under Shahen to fight the Romans in Mesapotamia. But Heraclius had secured the assistance of the Khazars against the Persians. He divided his own army in to three and positioned the first in the vicinity of Constantinople while another under his personal command was to effect the conquest of Lazica and a third nder Theodore to face Shahen.  

Theodore defeated Shahen amidst great slaughter. Heartbroken, Shahen died soon afterwards. The Persians were equally unsuccessful in Constantinople. A confederation of Avars, Slavs and Bulgars besieged Constantinople bt were repulsed by the superior artillery of the Romans. 

In September 627, Heraclius set out at the head of a large army from Lazica and invaded Mesapotamia. A decisive battle was fought at Nineveh in which the Persians were defeated and forced to retreat. Heraclius invaded Dastaghad on the Euphrates but the turbulent tide of the river blocked his passage further and he returned to COnstantinople, completely nmolested and entirely satisfied.

=== Death ===

Khusro favored his younger son born to his Christian wife Shirin (Irene) to his eldest son Siroe. Siroe rebelled against his father and arrested him. Khusro was immediately confined to a dungeon and later killed.

=== Episode of the Letter from Prophet Muhammad ===

Early Islamic tradition informs us that Muhammad, the prophet of Islam had sent a messenger, Abdullah ibn Hudhafah as-Sahmi together with a letter to preach the religion of Islam. The translation of the contents of the letter are as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Ever Merciful&lt;/br&gt; 

From Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, to Chosroes, Ruler of Persia. Peace be on him who follows the guidance, believes in Allah and His Messenger and bears witness that there is no one worthy of worship save Allah, the One, without associate, and that Muhammad is His Servant and Messenger. I invite you to the Call of Allah, as I am the Messenger of Allah to the whole of mankind, so that I may warn every living person and so that the truth may become clear and the judgment of God may overtake the infidels. I call upon you to accept Islam and thus make yourself secure. If you turn away, you will bear the sins of your Zoroastrian subjects.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The legend also says that in refusal and outrage, Khosrau tore up Muhammed's letter and conveyed his determination to stick on to Zoroastrianism. In reply, the Prophet is said to have said: &quot;May his kingdom tear apart&quot;.

Devout Muslims support the view that it was due to the curse of the Prophet that Khusro was murdered by his own son and the kingdom tore apart. However, the episode of the letter is rejected by a fair number of historians as a &quot;fable&quot; and &quot;part of  baseless propaganda&quot;.

=== Character of Khusro Perviz ===

Khusro II is always presented as a rash and daring monarch who never hesitated to take risks. However, nearly all accounts agree with the point that he lacked common sense. Khusro II is alwaysb regarded as a mixture of opposities. Despite his failures at the end of the reign, he was still one of the best monarchs of the Sassanian Empire and certainly the greatest monarch of his time and the most deserving person for the epithet of '''Eberwiz''' or '''Perviz''', '''The Victorious'''.

== Religion and Religious Movements ==

During the later part of the 5th century, a new faith arose in Iran which posed a serious threat to Zoroastrianism. This was Mazdakism which numbered atleast one Sassanian Emperor amongst its followers. However, the new tide ebbed away as quickly as it had arisen. The might of Zoroastrianism and its hold upon the people was visible when Qobad was deposed by the Magi. Since then, Mazdakism rapidly declined though it survived as a minor cult till the 10th century AD. Zoroastrianism made a splendid recovery and continued to hold sway despite the introduction of corrupt practices and un-Zoroastrian elements in the new faith. 

=== Mazdak ===

Mazdak was born in Persepolis to one Bamdat. Early in his life, he was a Zoroastrian High Priest and later renounced the creed in its existing form and declared himself to be a 'Reformer of Zoroastrianism' and a ''Champion of the Poor''. He preached a kind of Socialism and incorporated these principles into his new faith. 


==== Precepts of Mazdak ====

According to Mazdak, property and marriage were mere human inventions, contrary to the will of God, which required an equal division of the good things of this world among all, and forbade the appropriation of particular women by individual men. In communities based upon property and marriage, men might lawfully vindicate their natural rights by taking their fair share of the good things wrongfully appropriated by their fellows Adultery, incest, theft, were not really crimes, but necessary steps towards re-establishing the laws of nature in such societies. To these communistic views, which seem to have been the original speculations of his own mind, the Magian reformer added tenets borrowed from the Brahmins or from some other Oriental ascetics, such as the sacredness of animal life, the necessity of abstaining from animal food, other than milk, cheese, or eggs, the propriety of simplicity in apparel, and the need of abstemiousness and devotion.

==== Rise and Fall of Mazdakism ====

Mazdakism immediately found favor with the masses. One of the early converts was the Sassanian Emperor Qobad I. Qobad hated the Persian nobility and wished to curb their powers. He, therefore, recognised Mazdakism as the tool with which to tackle them. So, he let loose and orgy of forceful conversions outlawing other faiths and destroying fire temples. These acts provoked the ire of the Magi and Qobad was deposed. He, however, returned in three years and ascended the Sassanian throne. However, he stopped to lend official sanction to the faith. The proselytization of Mazdakism and Mazdakite ideals were curbed. Mazdak himself was killed at a banquet in 528 by the Crwon Prince Khusro Anushirvan.  

==== Legacy ====

Despite the assassination of Mazdak in 528, the new faith did not fizzle out. On the contrary, it long survived him and even the Islamic invasions. The Khorramdin Movement was inspired by Mazdakism and it has been long believed that its foremost leader Babak Khorramdin was himself a Mazdakite. However, by the 10th century AD and the rise of the Turks, the religion had almost died. '''Mazdak is universally recognized as the first socialist in history'''.

      <comment>/* The five schools */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The significance of the center==
Many inexperienced chess players will often ignore the center. This is a horrible idea. The center is the most important part of the chessboard, as pieces from the center can easily move to either flank with great speed. However, amateurs often prefer to concentrate on the king's side of the board. This is an incorrect mindset, and this page will tell you why.

==The five schools==
Let's start out with a little history:

===The Romantic School===
Starting in the mid-1800s, a school of thought called Romanticism began to take hold in the chess world. Romanticism is the philosophy of many players, that the king's flank is the most important. Romantic players often played for tactics alone, ignoring the center. In fact, winning came second to winning with style.

===The Classical School===
Then came the first World Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, who crushed his opponents with his deep positional understanding. He was the first modern master to impress upon his students the importance of the center. Some of his later disciples, including Tarrasch, Lasker, and Capablanca, went on to spread his beliefs about the center. Tarrasch was the leader of this school of thought, and was called &quot;the father of Classical dogma&quot;.

===The Hypermodern School===
In the 1920s there was a revolution in chess. Several Central European players like Reti, Nimzowitsch, and Gruenfeld burst onto the chess scene to dominate chess during the next few decades. Their ideas formed the basis for the Hypermodern school. The idea was that a large pawn center would eventually overextend itself and become a target. Nimzowitsch in particular believed in the importance of piece play against the center. His legacy, the Nimzo-Indian Defense, is very popular today with the world's strongest grandmasters. It involves restraining the central pawns with pieces.

===Russian Dynamism===
During the 1930s Hypermodernism and Classical dogma often clashed with each other. Classical dogma was more popular than Hypermodernism, and eventually two openings threatened to dominate international chess: the Queen's Gambit Declined and the Ruy Lopez, both sound classical openings. In the end, after Alekhine's death, a new generation of Soviet masters took hold, introducing a new philosophy regarding the center.

The Russian Dynamism, a blend of Hypermodernism, which stresses piece play, and Classicalism, which emphasized the pawn center, came with a welcome change to the Indian Defenses and the Sicilian Defense. The idea behind the Russian Dynamism was that it is okay to allow central pawn weaknesses for dynamic piece play. This brought with it a variety of new openings, such as the Boleslavsky Variation in the Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.Be2 e5!), which allows a hole on d5 in return for active play against the e4-pawn.

===The Modern School===
Essentially, the Modern school was introduced by Bobby Fischer. Fischer believed that a dose of all three schools was the correct approach to chess, and had wonderful games using all ideas, including his many great victories with the Najdorf Sicilian. Later world champions like Karpov and Kasparov built up on his work, leading to the present-day school of thought that all previous ideas were correct in their own way.

==The pawn center==
What Classical masters emphasized was the importance of the pawn center. This is still good today, and will be good for a long time. For example, the game at right, Keres-Fine, Ostend 1937, shows an instructive example of the pawn center.

''Position after Black's 20th move''
|}

White has a mighty pawn center, and here is how he brilliantly exploits its power: '''21.d5!''' White sacrifices a pawn to blunt Black's pieces and advance his e-pawn. '''21....exd5 22.e5 Nd7 23.Ng5 Nf8 24.Nxh7!''' White's pawn center allowed him to start a brutal attack and won in seven moves.

Notice how White's central pawn duo was very strong where they stood. Even standing on e4 and d4 the pawns can be very powerful, too. Black's passive formation would have allowed White to keep his pawns where they stood, influencing the course of the game. White could have played the pawn break d4-d5 at any moment in the game, followed by the advance e4-e5 to kick back the Black knight, with further preparation. Also, it is a typical idea: to block d5 and then follow with e4-e5. e4-e5 immediately would have allowed Black to sink his knight on d5. However, with the intermezzo d4-d5, Black's pieces were blunted and White immediately seized the initiative.

==Play against the pawn center==
If your opponent has a massive pawn center, there is often no need to fear if you have significant counterplay. Although a pawn center marks out a spatial advantage, you can try undermining its support. For example, in [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008397 one game against Letelier at Leipzig 1960], Fischer, as Black, played '''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 0-0'''. This is a Fischer idea, which is simply a move-order tool. '''5.e5 Ne8 6.f4 d6 7.Be3''' White erroneously believes that his center is invincible. As Fischer will prove, this idea is wrong. '''7....c5!''' Fischer sacrifices a pawn to undermine the center and open lines to White's uncastled king. '''8.dxc5 Nc6 9.cxd6 exd6 10.Ne4 Bf5 11.Ng3 Be6 12.Nf3 Qc7 13.Qb1 dxe5 14.f5 e4!''' Black's pawns have supplanted White's in the center. White is coming under serious attack and cannot hold back the threats to his king, which eventually came through on move 23.

Another example of undermining in the opening occurs in the Alapin Variation of the Sicilian Defense. 1.e4 c5 2.c3 White hopes to build up a strong pawn center. 2....Nf6 3.e5 Nd5 4.d4 cxd4 5.cxd4 e6! Restraining the pawn center and opening up the a3-f8 diagonal for Black's bishop. 6.Nf3 d6! Destroying the beachhead at e5. Black is assured of an even game.

Let's begin with a simple axiom. The purpose of maintaining a pawn center is to squeeze the opponent for space. You will have more space if you can deny the opponent's pieces squares. However, if your center ''looks'' nice but does not really gain space (i.e. it gives him squares), then it really doesn't mean anything at all! That was what Black had in mind when he played the following game, which is [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1015578 Scheichel--Adorjan, Hungary 1971]. '''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5''' The ultra-hypermodern Grünfeld Defense, which gives White a pawn center so that Black can target it. In this game, White plays the super-sharp Exchange Variation. '''4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7 7.Bc4 O-O 8.Ne2 c5 9.O-O Nc6 10.Be3 Qc7 11.Rc1 Rd8''' This position has been played over and over in many Grünfeld games. White is trying his best to uphold the integrity of the center, while Black is trying to destroy it. '''12.h3''' White would like to play f2-f4, gaining even more space, but after ...Bg4 Black would be able to chop off one of the defenders of d4. '''12...b6 13.f4 e6 14.Qe1 Na5 15.Bd3 f5!''' Hoping for the weakening 16.e5? when 16...c4 17.Bb1 Bb7 would give Black domination over the light squares. '''16.g4 Bb7''' This position deserves a diagram.

White's center is under attack by all of Black's pieces! White should not play 17.exf5 gxf5 18.gxf5 Re8, which would leave Black with more active pieces and leave White with an exposed king and weak pawns. '''17.Ng3 Qd7 18.Rd1 cxd4 19.Bb1?''' An error. White cannot afford this loss of time. '''19...Nc4 20.Bxd4 e5!''' The center is blown to bits and White's uncoordinated pieces are exposed. '''21.fxe5 fxg4 22.Qe2 Qc7 23.Qxg4 Nxe5''' After the resultant pawn exchanges, we see that all that is left of White's once-mighty pawn center are two weaklings on c3 and e4. Also note that Black's minor pieces are infinitely superior to White's. '''24.Qg5 h6 25.Qe3 Rf8 26.Kg2 Ba6 27.Rxf8+ Rxf8 28.Bxe5?''' Critically weakening the dark squares. '''Qxe5 29.Bc2 Bc4 30.Bb3 Bxb3 31.axb3 Qxc3 32.Qxc3 Bxc3 33.Rd7 Rf7''' and White resigned. He is down some material, and the endgame is hopeless for him.

==The pawn center as regards the attack==
Going back to the position in Keres--Fine, we notice that the pawn center was one of the things that guaranteed a successful kingside attack. Control of the center is vital to the success of the attack on the flank. An attack on the flank, therefore, is dependent on the attacker's control of the center or the closed center. Either way, this kind of attack is only successful when the defender cannot land a counterpunch in the center. For example, the game at right, Rodriguez--Tringov, Buenos Aires 1978, shows this drastically.

{| style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 1em;&quot;
| {{Chess position|=

   |rd|  |  |  |kd|bd|  |rd|=

   |30}}
|- style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
| '''Rodriguez--Tringov'''
'''Buenos Aires, 1978'''
''Position after White's 18th move''
|}

All of Black's kingside pawns are on their initial squares, so it appears that it would be hard for White to attack there. However, this is not the case. Indeed, there is an avalanche of pawns hanging over Black's head! However, this attack is sure to fail for three reasons:

:::1. White's king is awkwardly placed.
:::2. Black is not castled on the kingside.
:::3. Black can counterattack in the center.

Black, noting all three of these conditions, decides that the time is ripe for classic Sicilian counterplay. '''18....d5!''' Black counters a wing attack with play in the center. The sacrifice of the pawn is only temporary, for if 19.exd5, 19....Qc5+ 20.Kg2 Bxd5, with an excellent game for Black due to the open center and his bishop pair. '''19.Kg2 dxe4 20.Kh2 e3!''' Now it is easy to see that White's kingside pawn advance was premature and left the kingside overextended. Black's counterattack in the center stopped the attack before it began. Meanwhile, White is powerless to stop Black's central play. '''21.Bg2 Rd8''' and White resigned because there is no stopping penetration on the second rank with 22....Rd2.

===When the center is stable===
However, in the case of a stable center, where the defender cannot hit back in the center, a wing attack is usually a good idea. For example, if a wing attack is started, the defender can't do anything about it in the center. He will have to sit passively and defend, waiting for the attacker to slip. Otherwise, he will usually get mated. Of course, you could riskily play for mate on the king's wing, or you could push for a stable spatial advantage in the center. Both options are good, but it's usually just a matter of taste.

==Impression==
Discussions of names (baby name books) tend to stress the ''origins'' and ''meanings'' of names, rather than the ''impressions'' generated by names.

In &quot;[http://www.kaaj.com/psych/namebk.html Baby Name Report Card]&quot;, [[w:Albert Mehrabian|Albert Mehrabian]] measures the impressions name generate by 5 parameters:
* Ethical-Caring
* Popular-Fun
* Successful
* Masculine-Feminine
* Overall Attractiveness
...and uses the example of &quot;Chad&quot; as a name producing a very positive impression, while &quot;Bud&quot; produces a very negative impression; both are very masculine.

Note that names can shift gender over time.

==Popularity==
Popularity is a key aspect of a name; one may distinguish 3 overall categories, namely: very common, very uncommon, and medium popularity. Special considerations apply to names changing in popularity, notably fad names. Unique names are similar in practice to very uncommon names, while foreign names may be more or less popular in different country.

In the US today, a significant number of parents choose names in each such popularity category – the plurality have a medium popularity name, while a significant number have a popular or very uncommon name. In the past (19th century through 1950s), the most popular names were extremely popular (over 20% of children in early 19th century England and Wales had the most popular name – John or Mary, respectively) and very uncommon names (not in top 1,000) were very rare (5% in 1950 US), but very common names have become less popular, while very unusual names have become more popular.

Very common names are easy (to pronounce, remember, or spell), but less distinctive and potentially boring, and often overlap with someone else’s name (hence resulting in nicknames or use of other names); very common names can be common over the long term (a classic, like John or Mary), or can be popular over the short-term (a few years) or medium term (a few decades, like Jennifer from 1960s through 1980s). Very uncommon or unique names are distinctive and interesting (potentially distractingly so), and avoid overlap (they are almost always unique in a given group), but can be difficult to use. Medium popularity names fall between these extremes – they are generally easy (recognizable), if not to the same degree as common names, and reasonably distinctive, though not as unique as very uncommon names.

One issue is medium-term popular names, pejoratively “fad names” – names that increase sharply in popularity to the point of becoming very common, and then decrease sharply in popularity. These result in the name being common in one age group (cohort), but not common over the long term, and becomes associated with a generation. Beyond being very common in one’s cohort, medium-term popular names (like Jennifer) differ from long-term popular names (like Mary) in being more timely, less timeless – thus they can sound more contemporary, but can also sound dated when they are no longer popular. The long-term common names are by their nature stable, and thus a popular name that is not a long-term classic is likely of only medium-term popularity, and thus likely to fall out of popularity in the coming years. Further, once the fad is over – after a once-popular name has dropped out of fashion – people usually avoid it for several decades, as it sounds like a different generation. By contrast, short-term popular names are largely associated with a person, usually a celebrity, but sometimes an event, and tend to last only a few years.

Popularity can be used as a gauge both before or after choosing candidate names: one can choose a candidate name and then check its popularity, to see that it is not too popular or rare – or recently faddish (recent increase in popularity, but not yet very common); or one can look at a range of names in the desired popularity (say, top 10, top 200, top 500–1,000, etc.) and choose among them. One may also look at how the popularity of a candidate name has changed over time – particularly if it is significantly increasing or decreasing in popularity, or was once popular (hence faddish) but no longer so.

==Meaning==

==Associated people==
Naming after a relative or a celebrity (classical or contemporary) is quite common.

Further, some full names are relatively common, such as [[w:John Adams (disambiguation)|John Adams]], so one may wish to check if there are any historical figures which may come to find for a given full name, to avoid spurious associations or create intended ones, if this is desired.

==Ease==
Ease to pronounce, read, and spell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Matrices ==


A ''matrix'' is a rectangular array of numbers enclosed in brackets. In a notational sense, what differentiates a list of numbers from a matrix is its format. The numbers are listed so that each number has a certain, specific position between the brackets. Each number, or value, in a matrix is called an ''entry''. 

One of the main benefits of matrices is the properties which allow them to be manipulated and used for many different, but useful purposes. 

Matrices can vary in size. This variation in size is called ''dimensions''. Just like the dimensions of a room (width x length) matrices have dimensions (number of rows x number of columns). Thus, a 2 x 3 (read 2 by 3) matrix will have 2 rows and 3 columns.

Example of a 2 x 3 matrix:


: &lt;math&gt;
 M = \begin{bmatrix}
    572 &amp; 98   &amp; 302\\
     1  &amp; 732  &amp; 22\\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Another term associated with matrices is ''address''. Like your home address, an address describes where each value, or entry, of a matrix lives. The address is composed of the lowercase letter of the matrix with the row and column number (in that order) as subscripts. 


Using the 2 x 3 matrix M as an example, the positions of the values are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} m_{11} &amp; m_{12} &amp; m_{13} \\ m_{21} &amp; m_{22} &amp; m_{23}\end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} 572 &amp; 98 &amp; 302 &amp; \\ 1 &amp; 732 &amp; 22 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;m_{11}= 572  \quad m_{12}= 98  \quad m_{13}= 302  \quad m_{21}= 1  \quad m_{22}= 732  \quad m_{23}= 22&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

A ''square matrix'' is any matrix that has the same number of rows as it does columns. 

Example: 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 matrices are both square matrices.

:&lt;math&gt; 2 x 2 = \begin{bmatrix} {\color{red}1} &amp; 12\\ 21 &amp; {\color{red}2} \end{bmatrix}

\qquad  3 x 3 = \begin{bmatrix} {\color{red}7} &amp; 9 &amp; 30 \\ 1 &amp; {\color{red}2} &amp; 2 \\ 5 &amp; 43 &amp; {\color{red}6}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Take note of the numbers in &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt; above in the 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 square matrices. These numbers are in the addresses of the main diagonal. The ''main diagonal'' of a square matrix is the diagonal from the upper left corner entry to the bottom right corner entry. Notice that only square matrices can have a main diagonal.

== Adding and Subtracting Matrices ==



To add or subtract matrices, the sum or difference is found when addition or subtraction is applied to corresponding entries.

For example, 

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{bmatrix} {\color{red}7} &amp; {\color{blue}4} \end{bmatrix}  +  \begin{bmatrix}{\color{red}3} &amp; {\color{blue}9} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}{\color{red}10}&amp; {\color{blue}13} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} {\color{red}a_{11}} &amp; {\color{blue}a_{12}} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}{\color{red}b_{11}} &amp; {\color{blue}b_{12}} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}{\color{red}a_{11}+ b_{11}}&amp; {\color{blue}a_{12}+ b_{12}} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{bmatrix} {\color{red}7} &amp; {\color{blue}4} \end{bmatrix}  -  \begin{bmatrix}{\color{red}3} &amp; {\color{blue}9} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}{\color{red}4}&amp; {\color{blue}-5} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} {\color{red}a_{11}} &amp; {\color{blue}a_{12}} \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}{\color{red}b_{11}} &amp; {\color{blue}b_{12}} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}{\color{red}a_{11}- b_{11}}&amp; {\color{blue}a_{12}- b_{12}} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Since addition or subtraction takes place using corresponding entries, matrices must have the same dimensions in order to complete either operation. 

Consider this operation

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
    52\\
    36\\
  \end{bmatrix} +

\begin{bmatrix}
    12 &amp; 16 &amp; 5\\
  \end{bmatrix}
====&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11}\\
    a_{21}\\
  \end{bmatrix} +

\begin{bmatrix}
    b_{11} &amp; b_{12} &amp; b_{13}\\
  \end{bmatrix}\quad 
{\color{red}CAN'T\quad  BE\quad  DONE}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
     a_{11} + b_{11} &amp; ? + b_{12} &amp; ? + b_{13}\\
     a_{21} + ? &amp; ---        &amp; ---\\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider these matrices

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
    52 &amp; 4\\
    36 &amp; 18\\
  \end{bmatrix} +

\begin{bmatrix}
    12 &amp; 16\\
    34 &amp; 2\\
  \end{bmatrix}
====&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} &amp; a_{12}\\
    a_{21} &amp; a_{22}\\
  \end{bmatrix} +

\begin{bmatrix}
    b_{11} &amp; b_{12}\\
    b_{21} &amp; b_{22}
  \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11}+b_{11}&amp; a_{12}+b_{12}\\
    a_{21}+b_{21} &amp; a_{22}+b_{22}\\
  \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    64 &amp; 20\\
    70 &amp; 20\\
  \end{bmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties of Equality for Matrices ==

===Commutative Property===

Matrix addition is commutative
&lt;math&gt;  A + B = B + A&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
    5 &amp; 9 &amp; 0\\
    1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2\\
  \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
    7 &amp; 8 &amp; 3\\
    4 &amp; 7 &amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix}= 
\begin{bmatrix}
    7 &amp; 8 &amp; 3\\
    4 &amp; 7 &amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
    5 &amp; 9 &amp; 0\\
    1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2\\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&gt;______________&lt;/font&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    12 &amp; 17 &amp; 3\\
     5 &amp; 10 &amp; 8\\
  \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    12 &amp; 17 &amp; 3\\
     5 &amp; 10 &amp; 8\\
  \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

===Associative Property===

Matrix addition is associative. &lt;math&gt;A + B + C = (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
    4 &amp; 7\\
    1 &amp; 8\\
  \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
    3 &amp; 18\\
    24 &amp; 7 \\
  \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
    1  &amp; 8\\
    14 &amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix} =
\Bigg(\begin{bmatrix}
    4 &amp; 7\\
    1 &amp; 8\\
  \end{bmatrix}+

\begin{bmatrix}
    3 &amp; 18\\
    24 &amp; 7 \\
  \end{bmatrix}\Bigg) +

\begin{bmatrix}
    1  &amp; 8\\
    14 &amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix} =

\begin{bmatrix}
    4 &amp; 7\\
    1 &amp; 8\\
  \end{bmatrix}+
\Bigg(\begin{bmatrix}
    3 &amp; 18\\
    24 &amp; 7 \\
  \end{bmatrix} +

\begin{bmatrix}
    1  &amp; 8\\
    14 &amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix} \Bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
    4 &amp; 7\\
    1 &amp; 8\\
  \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
    3 &amp; 18\\
    24 &amp; 7 \\
  \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
    1  &amp; 8\\
    14 &amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix} =
\Bigg(\begin{bmatrix}
    7  &amp; 25\\
    25 &amp; 15\\
  \end{bmatrix}\Bigg) +

\begin{bmatrix}
    1  &amp; 8\\
    14 &amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix} \qquad \quad=

\begin{bmatrix}
    4 &amp; 7\\
    1 &amp; 8\\
  \end{bmatrix}+
\Bigg(\begin{bmatrix}
    4  &amp; 26\\
    38 &amp; 13 \\
  \end{bmatrix}\Bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&gt;_________&lt;/font&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
    8 &amp; 33\\
   39 &amp; 21\\
  \end{bmatrix} \qquad \quad \quad = \qquad \qquad
\begin{bmatrix}
    8 &amp; 33\\
   39 &amp; 21\\
  \end{bmatrix}  \qquad \qquad \quad
=\begin{bmatrix}
    8 &amp; 33\\
   39 &amp; 21\\
  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;


===Additive Identity===

The zero matrix is the ''additive identity'' matrix 'O'.

A ''Zero matrix'' is a matrix in which all of the entries are zero.
&lt;math&gt;
O =\begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Any matrix added to the matrix 'O' will retain its' same values.

Example of additive identity &lt;math&gt;A + O = A&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
    7 &amp; 4 \\
    6 &amp; 9 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
+

\begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}

=
\begin{bmatrix}
    7 &amp; 4 \\
    6 &amp; 9 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Additive Inverse===

It takes two matrices to form a pair of inverses. Two matrices are additive inverses if their sum is the zero matrix. This occurs when the ''additive inverse'' of a matrix contains the values opposite of each entry. &lt;math&gt;A + (-A) = O&lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
    {\color{red}8} &amp; {\color{red}2} &amp; {\color{red}-1}\\
   {\color{red}-6} &amp; {\color{red}9} &amp; {\color{red}-3}\\
  \end{bmatrix}
+

\begin{bmatrix}
   {\color{blue}-8}&amp; {\color{blue}-2} &amp; {\color{blue}1}\\
   {\color{blue}6} &amp; {\color{blue}-9} &amp; {\color{blue}3}\\
  \end{bmatrix}

=
\begin{bmatrix}
{\color{red}8} + {\color{blue}-8} &amp; {\color{red}2} + {\color{blue}-2} &amp; {\color{red}-1} + {\color{blue}1}\\
   {\color{red}-6} + {\color{blue}6} &amp; {\color{red}9}+{\color{blue}-9} &amp; {\color{red}-3}+{\color{blue}3}\\
  \end{bmatrix}

=

\begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


===Multiplicative Identity Matrix===


A ''multiplicative identity matrix'', usually denoted by the letter I, is any square matrix that has a value of 1 in all the entries along the main diagonal and 0 in the remaining entries.

&lt;math&gt;
I_{2x2} =\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 1\\
  \end{bmatrix} \qquad
I_{3x3} =\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Any matrix multiplied by an identity matrix will retain it's original entries. &lt;math&gt;A x I = A&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
A = \begin{bmatrix}
6 &amp; 15 &amp; 9\\
23 &amp; 5 &amp; 43\\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad  \quad
I =\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

[[Applicable Mathematics/Matrices#Multiplying Matrices|See Multiplying Matrices]]


&lt;math&gt;
AI=
\begin{bmatrix}
(6)(1) + (15)(0) + (9)(0) &amp; (6)(0) + (15)(1) + (9)(0) &amp; (6)(0) + (15)(0) + (9)(1)\\
(23)(1) + (5)(0) + (43)(0) &amp; (23)(0) + (5)(1) + (43)(0) &amp; (23)(0) + (5)(0) + (43)(1)\\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
AI = \begin{bmatrix}
6 &amp; 15 &amp; 9\\
23 &amp; 5 &amp; 43\\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplicative Inverse Matrix===

If matrices &lt;math&gt; A  x  B = I &lt;/math&gt; where I is the identity matrix, then A and B are multiplicative inverses of one another.

&lt;math&gt;
A = \begin{bmatrix}

== Multiplying Matrices ==


[[Applicable Mathematics/Matrices#Multiplicative Identity Matrix|Back to Multiplicative Identity Matrix]]


Another useful property of matrices is called a ''scalar''. A ''scalar'' is a number located outside of a single matrix. To apply the scalar to the matrix, simply multiply each entry of the matrix by the ''scalar''.

For example,

: &lt;math&gt;
{\color{red}3}\begin{bmatrix}
    3 &amp; 9 &amp; 15\\
    1 &amp; 7.5 &amp; 2\\
  \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    ({\color{red}3})3 &amp; ({\color{red}3}) 9 &amp; ({\color{red}3})15\\
    ({\color{red}3})1 &amp; ({\color{red}3})7.5 &amp;({\color{red}3})2\\
  \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    9 &amp; 27 &amp; 45\\
    3 &amp; 22.5 &amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In order to multiply two matrices together it is necessary to pay attention to their dimensions. Matrices A and J can be multiplied only if the number of columns in A equals the number of rows in J. Also, another hint is that the product of an a x j and a j x b matrix is an a x b matrix. Notice that the number of columns from the first matrix '''must''' equal the number of rows from the second matrix (j = j). 

First, we'll look at how to test to see if we can multiply matrices.

Consider matrices Q and R.

&lt;math&gt; 
      
Q = 2  \quad x \quad {\color{red}3}\qquad \quad \qquad R = {\color{red}3} \quad x \quad 2\qquad   
{\color{red}3\ columns} = {\color{red}3\ rows}

&lt;/math&gt;


Since the number of columns of matrix Q equals the rows of matrix R, these matrices can be multiplied. This will produce a 2 x 2 matrix.

&lt;math&gt;
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
{\color{red}1} &amp; {\color{red}7} &amp; {\color{red}9}\\
3 &amp; 5 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad 
x
\qquad 
R = \begin{bmatrix}
{\color{red}8} &amp; 9 \\
{\color{red}3} &amp; 5 \\
{\color{red}4} &amp; 6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying Q and R.

During this process, you may find your fingers and mental addition extremely helpful. You can use your left pointer finger to follow the entries in the ''rows'' of matrix Q and your right pointer finger to follow the ''columns'' of matrix R. To multiply matrices, add the products of consecutive entries in corresponding rows of matrix Q and columns of matrix R.

&lt;math&gt; 
QR=\begin{bmatrix} {\color{red}q_{11}} &amp; {\color{red}q_{12}} &amp;  {\color{red}q_{13}}\\
{\color{red}q_{21}} &amp; {\color{red}q_{22}} &amp;  {\color{red}q_{23}}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} {\color{blue}r_{11}} &amp; {\color{blue}r_{12}} &amp;  \\
{\color{blue}r_{21}} &amp; {\color{blue}r_{22}} \\
{\color{blue}r_{31}} &amp; {\color{blue}r_{32}} \\
\end{bmatrix}=
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
QR_{11}={\color{red}q_{11}} \bullet {\color{blue}r_{11}} \quad  + &amp;  {\color{red}q_{12}}  \bullet  {\color{blue}r_{21}}  \quad  + &amp;  {\color{red}q_{13}} \bullet  {\color{blue}r_{31}}\quad   QR_{12}={\color{red}q_{11}} \bullet {\color{blue}r_{12}} \quad  + &amp;  {\color{red}q_{12}}  \bullet  {\color{blue}r_{22}}  \quad  + &amp;  {\color{red}q_{13}} \bullet  {\color{blue}r_{32}} \\
QR_{21}={\color{red}q_{21}} \bullet {\color{blue}r_{11}} \quad  + &amp;  {\color{red}q_{22}}  \bullet  {\color{blue}r_{21}}  \quad  + &amp;  {\color{red}q_{23}} \bullet  {\color{blue}r_{31}}\quad   QR_{22}={\color{red}q_{21}} \bullet {\color{blue}r_{12}} \quad  + &amp;  {\color{red}q_{22}}  \bullet  {\color{blue}r_{22}}  \quad  + &amp;  {\color{red}q_{23}} \bullet  {\color{blue}r_{32}} \\
\end{bmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
QR = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 7 &amp; 9\\
3 &amp; 5 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
8 &amp; 9 \\
3 &amp; 5 \\

(1)(8) + (7)(3) + (9)(4) &amp; (1)(9) + (7)(5) + (9)(6)\\
(3)(8) + (5)(3) + (1)(4) &amp; (3)(9) + (5)(5) + (1)(6)\\

\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Determinants ==

Every square matrix has a value called a ''determinant'', and only square matrices have defined determinants. The ''determinant'' of a 2x2 square matrix is the difference of the products of the diagonals.


The determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix can be found as follows:


&lt;math&gt;det\begin{bmatrix}
    {\color{red}9} &amp; {\color{blue}2}\\
    {\color{blue}7} &amp; {\color{red}8}\\
  \end{bmatrix}=
({\color{red}9})({\color{red}8}) - ({\color{blue}7})({\color{blue}2}) = 58
&lt;/math&gt;


The &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;down&lt;/font&gt;&quot; diagonal is in red and the &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;up&lt;/font&gt;&quot; diagonal is in blue. The &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;up&lt;/font&gt; diagonals are always subtracted from the &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;down&lt;/font&gt; diagonals.
Matrices that are larger than a 2 x 2 matrix become a little more complicated when finding the determinant but the same rules apply.

**The &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;down&lt;/font&gt;&quot; diagonal is not necessarily the same as the main diagonal mentioned earlier. The down diagonal happens to be the main diagonal for a 2 x 2 matrix but larger matrices will have multiple &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;down&lt;/font&gt; diagonals and only one main diagonal.



Let's find 
&lt;math&gt;det\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 6 &amp; 19\\
    8 &amp; 17 &amp; 5\\
    14 &amp; 9 &amp; 3\\
  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;


When finding the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix it is helpful to write the first two columns to the right side of the matrix like so,


&lt;math&gt;det\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 6 &amp; 19\\
    8 &amp; 17 &amp; 5\\
    14 &amp; 9 &amp; 3\\
  \end{bmatrix}
\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 6 \\ 8 &amp; 17 \\ 14 &amp; 9 \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


As shown above in the 2x2 matrix, the numbers are color coded. The &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/font&gt; numbers, once again, indicate they are used in the &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;up&lt;/font&gt; diagonals, the &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt; are used in the &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;down&lt;/font&gt;  diagonals, and those in &lt;font color=&quot;magenta&quot;&gt;magenta&lt;/font&gt; are used in both.


&lt;math&gt;det\begin{bmatrix}
    {\color{red}1} &amp; {\color{red}6} &amp; {\color{magenta}19}\\
    8 &amp; {\color{magenta}17} &amp; {\color{magenta}5}\\
    {\color{blue}14} &amp; {\color{blue}9} &amp; {\color{magenta}3}\\
  \end{bmatrix}
\begin{matrix} {\color{blue}1} &amp; {\color{blue}6} \\ {\color{magenta}8} &amp; 17 \\ {\color{red}14} &amp; {\color{red}9} \end{matrix} = ({\color{red}1} * {\color{red}17} * {\color{red}3}) + ({\color{red}6} * {\color{red}5} * {\color{red}14}) + ({\color{red}19} * {\color{red}8} * {\color{red}9}) - \Big[({\color{blue}14} * {\color{blue}17} * {\color{blue}19}) + ({\color{blue}9} * {\color{blue}5} * {\color{blue}1}) + ({\color{blue}3} * {\color{blue}8} * {\color{blue}6})\Big] 
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
= ({\color{red}51} + {\color{red}420} + {\color{red}1,368}) - ({\color{blue}4,522} + {\color{blue}45} + {\color{blue}144}) = -2872
&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, the determinant of the above 3x3 matrix is -2872.

'''Plate tectonics''' is the theory (nothing in science can be absolutely proven) that the Earth is constantly moving, usually only a few inches per century. If it moves more than this, there is an earthquake. Plate tectonics mainly deals with the crust of the earth, not the mantle or core. The theory of Pangaea is relative to this. The Pangaea theory says that the continents as they are now have moved apart over millions of years to make the world the way it is today, although to be fair to them, some creation scientists/geologists say that Pangaea was pulled apart rather suddenly in geological terms (only 40-150 days!). Plate tectonics is the reason earthquakes in, say, Wisconsin are not as felt or as damaging as an earthquake in, say, California-because Wisconsin is at the center of a plate, and California is at the convulsion of two plates. Plate tectonics is the reason earthquakes happen-when the plates move too fast, an earthquake happens.

'''Black salt''' (also ''kala namak'', ''sanchal'') is an unrefined mineral salt used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cuisine]]. It has a sulphuric flavour, and is actually a pinkish gray, not black.

G'day, I wonder whether you might find [[v:Wikiversity as a Wikimedia sister project|Wikiversity]] to be a more appropriate host for some of this? Wikibooks is a host for [[WB:WIW|textboooks]], not coursework, so you might be best served by moving some of the course-specific stuff there before it runs into trouble here.

The User and client profiles were discussed with the following notes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Description:
Issues Raised:
- Who is project being designed for?

&gt; Grade school age children 7-9 or 10-12 (one grade-school, homogeneous group)

- Approx number of potential audience?

&gt; 40 per session

- What is the attention span of the target audience?

&gt; 30 seconds to a minute and a half

- Length of media elements?

&gt; 30 seconds to a minute and a half

- What would hold the targeted audience’s attention and effectively get the point across?
  &gt; Action
  &gt; Noise
  &gt; Sound (surround)
  &gt; Color
  &gt; Fast paced elements
  &gt; Interaction
  &gt; Competition
  &gt; Keeping the actual audience in motion
  &gt; The idea of reward

While we are initially planning this with the target audience in mind, we need to not forget who the client ultimately is and what they want. Client is the Kirkpatrick Foundation and the OKC art museum.

Collective Ideas/Suggestions:

- Segmenting the group, and moving the audience

- Competition between the groups

- Competitive scavenger hunt inside the virtual interactive museum (virtual flythrough), per following:

  1. Split the group in two and have them compete by interacting with a VR fly-through of the 
     museum (the manipulate where they fly) in looking for treasure
  2. Perhaps even better, have another group of their friends actually at the museum, and by 
     use of two-way A/V communications, they tell the team at the museum where to go and what 
     to look for
- Use the Wii-mote to control the virtual artwork inside the VR tent

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Description:
A treasure-hunt competition where the group of children will be split into two teams and each team will use Wii controllers and their half of the enclosure’s projection screens to work their way through a VR environment of the museum, using various collected clues, to find all the objects/information(?) before the other team does. Also in the enclosure would be a chroma-key wall where an actor/college student would show off media interaction by coordinating their movements and behavior with characters projected on through the chroma-key (Interactive  team?).
Leading up to the enclosure would be a tunnel-like entrance where the students would be introduced to the game and what’s ahead in the enclosure as well images and other aspects of interactive media via flat screens (Design and AV teams)
Selling this idea to schools will require printed material (Design team)
Other considerations:

- What is the operational budget?

&gt; Potentially $0- $200,000

- What is the timeframe?

&gt; This project is due a year from now.

=================================================================================================
'''Week02:'''

Discussion regarding the look and feel of the final product, geared towards the user-profile from last week:
General Considerations:

- Team Leaders: What are you going to do with the selected software to appeal to and reach children (what look and feel for the media)? Preparer a final statement for each team to encapsulate this and post it on Facebook in the respective team blogs

- Project concept is now entitled Surround Screen Video or SSV

- Create a detailed list of everything each team needs from the other teams

- Post what each team will offer on the Facebook, group wall

--------------------------------------
- Interactive Team Considerations:

- Further discussion given to the overall concept. A third possibility has now made it to the fore, and that is to break up the main group into much smaller groups, as follows:

&gt; The media intro that the children see before entering the SSV is now conducted live by a college student or actor in front of the chroma key wall. On entering, the children see the actor and realise it was a live performance.

&gt; Initially, all the screen inside the SSV are used to give a brief, guided tour of the VR museum interface, conducted by the same student/actor

&gt; Once broken up into their separate groups, each with a Wii controller infront of an individual screen, the presenter shows how the basic interface works – basically click on a 2D layout of museum, and the room clicked grows into a 3D, VR model. Each group at each screen will play games that last no more than ten minutes (approx) where they have to figure out basic puzzles that are based on the art museum room that they are in. Overall, competition could still aplly at the as to which team solved the most puzzles.

- Printout concept for high-school brochure: To avoid the usual trifold, create something that folds out rather like the SSV would; i.e. from the centre out to create a circular brochure?
For more details, see: http://supercoenbros.blogspot.com/
--------------------------------------
- Video &amp; Design Teams:

&gt; What sort of transitions should be used in the VR tour when going between rooms? Do we want to have something elaborate that switches between VR and real video, or something more simple and quick that allows the students to quickly go between rooms? We do want some sort of transition so there isn’t just a jarring jump that breaks the illlusion.

&gt; This needs to be placed along side the idea of having an actual live team actually in the museum, if we still want to pursue that variation(?)
--------------------------------------
- Design team Considerations:

&gt; Select colour palette (graphics used will ultimately dictate this)

&gt; Research other ideas on the web – other fads. Particularly look at the Hannah Montana site and the game they have there that John mentioned.

&gt; Remember that we will ultimately be selling the idea and its look to the Kirkpatrick foundation and the museum

&gt; Work on starting the collection of a large library of still images – remember the discussion regarding needing only 1 second exposure duration before moving to the next image.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

Someone needs to better describe potential energy to include things like energy stored in a spring or chemical bonds.

Someone needs to make this a lot longer.  This doesn't describe a small host of necessary things -- phase diagrams, energy types, entropy, enthalpy, mass / heat / energy transfer, steady state, equilibrium, engines (ie Carnot engines), basics of refrigeration, ...</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">With regard to any suggestion that &quot;vibration of structures&quot; be merged into &quot;vibration&quot; - I comment that this is perhaps not wise. To begin with, &quot;Sound&quot; is also vibration but is worthy of its own explanation. Structural Vibration could be merged with Structural Engineering. It could also be merged with Mechanical Engineering. It is a field of study overlapping both these professions. I have no doubt that Vibration of Structures is a field of engineering, whereas &quot;vibration&quot; could also be seen as a field within the science of physics. My recommendation would be to leave Vibration of Structures on a page of its own, but add a link to it from both the Mechanical and Structural Engineering pages. It has potential for quite detailed explanations and in my opinion warrants being kept separate to avoid confusion. If it had to be merged somewhere - I'd say the most logical place is in with Mechanical Engineering.

The title of the page should be Vibration of Structures, rather than Vibrations of Structures (i.e. drop the (s)). A structure that is vibrating is in a state of vibration. My understanding is that the plural of vibration would be vibration. The word vibration means a repeated movement or displacement. The singular of vibration is a pulse or impulse.

== Warning comment ==

Hi - someone using your IP created three nonsense pages in January (deleted).  That is why there was a warning.  It will always be a problem with shared IPs so you would be better registering a user name.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|FutureBASIC|FBtoC Documentation Project}}


The Wikibook project supports the development of the FutureBASIC programming language. FutureBASIC, also known as FB, is a compiled procedural BASIC dialect used to develop applications for Apple Macintosh family of computers.

If you would like to contribute energy to the FB Documentation Project, please read our [[Futurebasic/appendix/styleguide|Style Guide for FB Documentation]].

=== Language Reference and Programming Guide ===
The '''Language Reference''' focuses on the FutureBASIC language and syntax. While programming is discussed, this is primarily to demonstrate the language syntax. The '''Programming Guide''' offers far more detail on accomplishing specific tasks. The '''Beginner's Guide''' is primarily concerned with how to use the FB IDE and compiling programs. It exists to explain the process of compiling applications, not as a replacement for the '''Programming Guide.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The FutureBASIC Language ==
'''FutureBASIC''' (FB) is a high-level procedural programming language&amp;#8212;in fact a whole &quot;Integrated Development Environment&quot; (IDE)&amp;#8212;for the '''Apple'''&amp;trade; '''Macintosh'''&amp;reg; computer system. It is a compiled BASIC dialect allowing easy access to the graphical user interface and file system of the MacOS. In providing structures such as nestable records and arrays, and various forms of subroutines (local functions) and callbacks it is quite as powerful as C however with the syntax of BASIC and a less strict variable typing. '''FB''' features an editor, compiler, debugger, profiler, project manager, documentation, and code samples.

The current version is '''FB4 Release 4'''. Since January 1, 2008, FutureBASIC is freeware.

[[/Reference|Language Reference]]

==History of FutureBASIC==
FB began life in the mid-1980s as '''ZBasic'''{{ref|ZBasic}}, which was created by &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Andrew &amp;nbsp;Gariepy&lt;/span&gt; and envisioned as a cross-platform development system. Before long, the cross-platform aspects were dropped in favor of focusing on Macintosh development. ZBasic acquired a devoted following of developers who praised its ease of use and the tight, fast code produced by the compiler (a legendary labor involving extensive use of hand-built 68K assembly language code). In 1992 and as the next major step after ZBasic version 5, '''Zedcor''' Inc., the company of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Gariepy&lt;/span&gt; brothers &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Andy, Mike, Peter&lt;/span&gt; and friends based in Tucson/Arizona presented '''FutureBASIC''' (later called '''FBI'''){{ref|FBI}}. In 1995 '''Staz Software'''{{ref|Staz_Software}}, led by &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Chris Stasny&lt;/span&gt;, acquired the rights to market FutureBASIC. &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Chris&amp;nbsp;Stasny&lt;/span&gt; started this business with an upgraded version, namely '''FBII'''{{ref|FBII}}, and with his own development, the '''Program Generator'''{{ref|PG_PRO}} (PG PRO), a CASE tool.

The transition from 68k to PowerPC {{h:title|Central Processing Unit|CPU}}s was a lengthy process that involved a complete rewrite of the editor by &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Chris&amp;nbsp;Stasny&lt;/span&gt; and an adaptation of the compiler by &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Andy&amp;nbsp;Gariepy&lt;/span&gt;. This was undertaken during Apple's darkest days when the further existence of the Mac and Apple itself was in the news every week. The result of their efforts, a dramatically enhanced {{h:title|Integrated Development Environment|IDE}} called '''FB^3''', was released in September 1999, featuring among many other things a separate compiler application, various open, hence modifiable runtimes{{ref|Runtime}}, inline PPC assembly, a simplified access to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Toolbox Macintosh Toolbox&amp;trade; {{h:title|Application Programming Interface|API}}], as well as an expanded library of built-in functions. Major update releases introduced a full-featured ''Appearance Compliant''{{ref|Appearance_runtime}} runtime written by &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Robert&amp;nbsp;Purves&lt;/span&gt; and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_%28computing%29 Carbon] compliance of generated applications. Once completely carbonized to run natively on OS X, the {{h:title|FutureBASIC Integrated Development Environment|FB IDE}} was called '''FB4''' and first released in July 2004.

Based in Diamondhead/Mississippi, Staz Software was severely hit by Hurricane Katrina in September of 2005 and development pace was slowed at a time when major effort was required to keep the {{h:title|Integrated Development Environment|IDE}} up to date with Apple's evolution towards the Intel&amp;trade;-based Macintosh. More recently, an independent team of volunteer FB programmers developed a cross-compiler (FBtoC) that allows FB to generate applications as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Binaries Universal Binaries] through the use of the open source [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection '''gcc'''] compiler which is included with each copy of Apple's OS X system software. On January 1, 2008, Staz Software announced that '''FB4''' would henceforth be freeware and '''FBtoC 1.0''' was made available at [http://www.4toc.com/fb4/ http://www.4toc.com/fb4/]

From System 6 to MacOS X on Intel, the longevity of the FutureBASIC development system on the Mac Platform is second to none.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

=== What is FBtoC? ===
FBtoC is a replacement for the FB Compiler (FB Compiler.app) . Translating the code to C allows Apple's developer tools to create a universal binary. The diagrams below illustrate the process:

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;FB Compiler:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;padding:2px;border-style:solid; border-width:1px;&quot;&gt;FB source code&lt;/span&gt; →  &lt;span style=&quot;padding:2px;border-style:solid; border-width:1px;&quot;&gt;legacy app (PPC-only, CFM format, resource fork...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;FBtoC:&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;padding:2px;border-style:solid; border-width:1px;&quot;&gt;FB source code&lt;/span&gt; → &lt;span style=&quot;padding:2px;border-style:solid; border-width:1px;&quot;&gt;C source code&lt;/span&gt; → &lt;span style=&quot;padding:2px;border-style:solid; border-width:1px;&quot;&gt;OS X app package with Carbon universal binary in Mach-O format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

FBtoC translates appearance projects and standalone files, and console-type text-only standalone files. PG projects cannot be translated. Using FBtoC normally requires no detailed knowledge of C. 

==== Why translate to C when I code in BASIC? ====
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The compiler (gcc) has more powerful optimizations for speed than the FB compiler.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Native Intel code runs ≈3 times faster (or more)  than PPC code under Rosetta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Framework access is much simpler than in FB (see later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FBtoC can automatically copy specified files into the app's resources (see later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple's modern development tools work on apps built by FBtoC. Tools include the Xcode debugger and the performance analyser Shark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An app can be built as small as 64 KB.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(window 1 : print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; : do HandleEvents : until gFBQuit)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On an Intel Mac, crash reports are interpretable, unlike those of a legacy FB app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike FB, there is no 32k limit on local function variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then there's the coveted Universal Binary status!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Installation ==
This section describes the installation of both FutureBASIC and FBtoC. Before continuing, you will need to obtain the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FBtoC installation files and documentation from: [http://www.4toc.com/fb4/ FBtoC Project Page]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Apple Develop Tools, available on your OS C installation DVD or from [http://developer.apple.com/ Apple's Developer Connection Web site]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== System Requirements ===
FBtoC should work on OS X 10.3.9 and later. Most development and testing has been done on OS X 10.4 and 10.5. Before using FBtoC you should have installed Apple's free Developer Tools (a.k.a. Xcode Tools), from your OS X install CDs or DVD. 

To create universal binaries, you must have OS X 10.4 or higher, gcc 4.0 or higher, and install the Cross-development SDKs. Without /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk, only the native architecture of your Mac can be built. The Finder view (below) of the Developer folder shows the SDKs after installation. Cross-development is an optional part of the Xcode Tools install (from the OS X DVD or CDs).

See also Apple's documentation:
[http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/cross_development/Introduction/chapter_1_section_1.html Apple Developer Tools Documentation]

=== Installing FBtoC ===
Just drag-and-drop. The folder containing FBtoC.app must also contain three special folders:  '''build_goodies''', '''Headers''', and '''User Libraries'''.

The '''build-goodies''' folder contains pretranslated parts of the runtime. Changing any of these files is likely to break FBtoC.

The '''Headers''' folder contains a subset of the standard FB Headers files. Most of them needed modification to make them work with FBtoC. In general, an existing FB Headers file will not work if simply copied into this folder.

'''User Libraries''' has the same function as in FB, except that the little-known special file UserFloatPrefs is ignored by FBtoC.

== Differences Between FutureBASIC and FBtoC ==

=== Mildly bad news ===
Some things that have to be done differently in FBtoC:

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;compile long if&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;replace by #if....&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;enterproc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;label must match the enterproc fn name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;autoXREFCurr&amp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;different syntax; see later&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DynamicRemoveItems&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;different syntax; see later&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ControlButtonContentInfo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;different syntax with '.u'; see later&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;HMHelpContent&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;different syntax with '.u'; see later&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Hndl&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;replace by Handle&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;proc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;different syntax; also, label *must* precede line in which proc appears&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;100#, 100!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FBII format; rewrite both as 100.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Features not implemented ==
Due to FBtoC operational constraints and other more obvious constraints (e.g.  Intel doesn't support PowerPC assembler -duh), some legacy syntax cannot be implemented. However, a modern equivalent to achieve a similar goal often exists. Updating legacy source code to a modern equivalent benefits from newer features and helps preserve the longevity of the source code.

=== 1. Legacy syntax and language ===

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;beginassem ... endassem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FB assembler is incompatible with gcc (even on PPC)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;tbalias&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;discussed later&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;dim record&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FBII pseudo-record; use true record instead&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;dim as int x;0, hi as byte, lo as byte&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;aliased vars would lead to endian bugs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

=== 3. Toolbox aliases not supported ===
The TBalias statement in FB allows old Toolbox names to be kept and applied to new functions when introduced by Apple. The idea must have been to save programmers a minute or two updating function names, a task otherwise tiresomely required every few years. The TBalias feature is now Considered Harmful and will not be supported by FBtoC. You may have already upgraded your project to use the correct (Apple's official) Toolbox names. If not, be prepared for FBtoC error messages indicating dodgy names:

&lt;pre&gt;
•• Unknown statement in line 6 of untitled
  6:  RmveResource( resH )
                 ^
&lt;/pre&gt;

The simple, recommended, and only, workaround is to replace each occurrence in your code of the fossil RmveResource by  RemoveResource. 

Some Toolbox functions that were commonly aliased in old FB code are listed below:

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; &gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;FB, FBtoC and C&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;FB-only alias&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;GetIntlResource&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;IUGetIntl&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MemError&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;MemErr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DisposeHandle&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DisposHandle&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DisposePtr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DisposPtr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;AppendResMenu&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AddResMenu&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;GetMenuHandle&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;GetMHandle&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CountMenuItems&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CountMItems&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;EnableMenuItem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;EnableItem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DisableMenuItem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DisableItem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;GetControlValue&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;GetCtlValue&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;GetControlReference&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;GetCRefcon&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PBReadSync&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PBRead&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PBCatMoveSync&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CatMove&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PBHCreateSync&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;HCreate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PBFlushVolSync&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FlushVol&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;AEPutParamDesc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AEPutKeyDesc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SecondsToDate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Secs2Date&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;LongSecondsToDate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;LongSecs2Date&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;RemoveResource&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;RmveResource&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== 4. Missing Headers files ===
&lt;pre&gt;
include &quot;Util_Dialogtests.incl&quot;

•• Include file not found in line 1 of OopsMissingFunction.main
  1:  include &quot;Util_Dialogtests.incl&quot;
                                    ^
&lt;/pre&gt;

FBtoC's Headers folder doesn't have this file yet.


=== 5. Incomplete Headers files ===
&lt;pre&gt;
include &quot;Util_Files.incl&quot;
dim as FSSpec   fs
dim as Boolean  found
found = usr FSFileExists( fs )

•• Unknown function in line 4 of OopsMissingFunction.main: FSFileExists
  4:  found = usr FSFileExists( fs )
                               ^
&lt;/pre&gt;

Util_Files.incl is present in FBtoC's Headers folder; the error arises because the function usr FSFileExists has been conditionalised out by some petty official, one hopes temporarily. [Note added later: FSFileExists is now implemented] 


== Sample translations by FBtoC ==
Elderly FB code preserved in the FBtoC runtime:

&lt;pre&gt;
CLEAR LOCAL
dim pBlk.128
LOCAL FN FBGetFolderName(DirID&amp;,WDRefNum%,@StrPtr&amp;)
 StrPtr&amp;.Nil$ = &quot;&quot;
 pBlk.ioDirID&amp;    = DirID&amp;
 pBlk.ioVRefNum%  = WDRefNum%
 pBlk.ioNamePtr&amp;  = StrPtr&amp;
 pBlk.ioFDirIndex%= -1
 long if FN PBGetCatInfoSync(@pBlk)
  StrPtr&amp;.Nil$ = &quot;Error&quot;
 end if
END FN
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
long FBGetFolderName( long  DirID, short  WDRefNum, long  StrPtr )
{
  char              pBlk[128] = {};
  PLstrcpy( ((StringPtr)StrPtr), &quot;\p&quot; );
  *(long*)(pBlk + 48) = DirID;
  *(short*)(pBlk + 22) = WDRefNum;
  *(long*)(pBlk + 18) = StrPtr;
  *(short*)(pBlk + 28) = -1;
  if ( PBGetCatInfoSync( (void*)&amp;pBlk ) )
  {
  PLstrcpy( ((StringPtr)StrPtr), &quot;\pError&quot; );
  } // 'end if'
  return 0;
} 
&lt;/pre&gt;

One of FBtoC's many internal functions:

&lt;pre&gt;
local fn DefinePointRecord
 dim as VarInfo  varInfo
 BlockZero( varInfo, sizeof( varInfo ) )
 varInfo.varType = _shortVarType // for fields
 fn SuppressTypedefs
 fn StartRecordDefinition( &quot;Point&quot; )
 fn AddFieldToRecordDefinition( &quot;v&quot;, &quot;&quot;, varInfo )
 fn AddFieldToRecordDefinition( &quot;h&quot;, &quot;&quot;, varInfo )
 fn FinishRecordDefinition
 fn DontSuppressTypedefs
end fn
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
long DefinePointRecord()
{
  VarInfo           varInfo;
  BlockZero( &amp;varInfo, sizeof( varInfo ) );
  varInfo.varType =  3;
  SuppressTypedefs();
  StartRecordDefinition( PLstrcpy( gFBStrStk[++gFBStk], &quot;\pPoint&quot; ) );
  AddFieldToRecordDefinition( PLstrcpy( gFBStrStk[++gFBStk], &quot;\pv&quot; ), PLstrcpy( gFBStrStk[++gFBStk], &quot;\p&quot; ), &amp;varInfo );
  AddFieldToRecordDefinition( PLstrcpy( gFBStrStk[++gFBStk], &quot;\ph&quot; ), PLstrcpy( gFBStrStk[++gFBStk], &quot;\p&quot; ), &amp;varInfo );
  FinishRecordDefinition();
  DontSuppressTypedefs();
  return 0;
} 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Template (to be removed later) ===
[[/template | Click here for Template]]

Go here: &lt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Futurebasic/language/reference&gt; 
to admire the long list of keywords to work on.

Use template page (the link is just above). 

To edit an entry:

1 - Click on the link titled Template (above the list of keywords).

2 - A new page is displayed in your browser showing how the layout of an 
entry looks like. Click on the top most link on the right of the screen 
(probably titled [edit] in English).

3 - The browser opens a new page displaying a form. The main field 
contains the code used to create the template. It looks like the following:
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:linen;width:50%;margin:auto;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Layout Template (remove this line)&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;== Keyword Goes Here ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Statement Function Operator or Other? (update the checkmarks below) ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
✔ χ Appearance ✔ χ Standard ✔ χ Console

&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Syntax ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
code syntax goes here and is pre-formatted (plain text)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Revised ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Date &amp; release (remove the Revised section if no date)

&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Description ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Description goes here.

&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Example ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sample code goes here (remove the Example section if no sample code)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Notes ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Special notes. (leave this section if no notes)

&lt;nowiki&gt;=== See Also ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;cross-reference&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Futurebasic/language/reference|Language Reference]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
4 - Copy the whole text (you can possibly paste it in a text editor 
window to have it handy at a later time).

5. - If you haven't already done so, put beer in fridge

6 - Now go find a keyword in the list whose entry is empty, and paste 
the template code and click on the Save button.

If you're not comfortable with HTML, leave to someone else the updating 
of the entry and repeat the process for another empty keyword entry 
(i.e. GOTO #6).

If you want to proceed further:

7 - Open the FB Help page in a new browser window or better a text 
editor. If you're using a browser you will have to display the HTML 
source code.

Now, depending on your skill with HTML coupled with wiki idiosyncrasy 
you might do the following:

8a - Edit again the keyword entry updating each section with the 
corresponding HTML code of the FB Help page.

9a - Save your change and leave to someone else the pleasure to clean up 
the mess.

or

8b - Clean up the HTML code in your text editor. Sometimes, there are a 
bunch of tags to remove and even to use more efficiently, I guess.
Leave the links related to the missing image resources, it might help 
later to find out which entries require illustrations. Maybe Christopher 
can tell us how we can manage the image files.

FB snippets of code of the Ref manual need serious cleaning since they 
are inserted inside &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags therefore they cannot embed any 
other HTML code. Other things are worth to know (perhaps for another 
post), but I think the rule of thumb is to end-up with the less HTML 
code as possible.

9b - Update each section of the keyword entry with the appropriate clean 
HTML code.

10 - Repeat ad nauseum (i.e. GOTO #6) with a variant, though: try to 
find also keyword entries whose template has not been updated.

11 - Celebrate in true Staz style (with beer) when you're done (optional).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== #Define ==

=== Statement ===

✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console 

=== Syntax === 
&lt;pre&gt;
#define newTypeName as oldTypeName 
#define newTypeName as {pointer to|@|^|.} oldTypeName 
#define newTypeName as {handle to|@@|^^|..} oldTypeName 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description === 
The &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; statement is one way to create a name for a variable type (the other way to do so is to use the &lt;code&gt;begin record&lt;/code&gt; statement). &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;newTypeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be any new name you like that is different from the names of all existing types. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;oldTypeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the name of an existing type; this can either be a built-in type such as &lt;code&gt;Rect&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, or a type which you created previously, in a &lt;code&gt;begin record&lt;/code&gt; statement or in another &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; statement. After the &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; statement, you can declare variables of the new type using &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statements, and you can pass &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;newTypeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to 
the &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; functions.
 
If you use the first syntax, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;newTypeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; essentially becomes a synonym for &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;oldTypeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you use the other two syntaxes, then variables of the new type are recognized as pointers or handles to structures of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;oldTypeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This is the only way to create a type name for pointers or handles to other types.

=== Notes === 
&lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; is non-executable, so you can’t change its effect by putting it inside a conditional 
execution structure such as &lt;code&gt;long&amp;nbsp;if...end&amp;nbsp;if&lt;/code&gt;. 

A non-executable statement inside a &lt;code&gt;compile long if&lt;/code&gt; block will only be compiled if the 
condition following the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; is met. Otherwise it will be ignored.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most common classes of mistakes in purchasing equipment are:
* overemphasizing equipment
* neglecting less glamorous components
* not understanding trade-offs / focusing on headline numbers
We detail these in turn.

==Overemphasizing equipment==
Equipment is a tool, not an end (unless you are a photographic engineer or collector): the goal is to take photographs, which requires a compelling ''subject'' and a skilled ''photographer'' '''far''' more than it requires expensive equipment.

You do not need to buy cheap equipment first, if you reasonably expect that you'll soon run into its limitations, but don't buy equipment unless you expect to use its capacities.

===Subject matters most===
:''Mistake: Buying equipment without an eye to intended use''

A compelling subject, photographed with the cheapest [[w:disposable camera|disposable camera]] or [[w:Camera phone|camera phone]], is more interesting than a boring subject, even if it be photographed with the fanciest camera.

Think about what subjects you wish to photograph, and buy equipment to facilitate ''that''.

===Technique matters more than equipment===
:''Mistake: Thinking equipment obviates technique or compensates for poor technique''

Quality cameras make it ''easier'' to take pictures and, properly used, can produce higher quality pictures and effects that cannot be replicated with inferior equipment, but they required skilled technique. Good technique with a point and shoot yield better results than poor technique with a far more expensive camera.

No equipment can replace a good eye, or attention to composition or light.

==Less glamorous components==
The most glamorous components of a system are the '''body''' and particularly dramatic '''lenses''' (especially large telephoto). A system is much more than a body, and all the parts play a role.

===Focus on system, not body===
:''Mistake: Focusing on body, instead of system''

Especially with current technology, lenses last much longer than bodies (decades), and over time you will likely spend much more on lenses than on a body. Lenses are not generally compatible between manufacturers, so if you expect to buy more than one lens (which you will if you are serious), you are buying a ''system'', not a ''body''.

Thus, do not concentrate on minor differences between the current bodies of various manufacturers and at various price points.

===Spend on lenses, not body===
:''Mistake: Spending on body (instead of lenses)''
&quot;Whatever you do, don't spend too much on the body. It is much better to have a good lens on a cheap body than vice versa.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.net/equipment/what-camera-should-I-buy.adp#35mmslr What Camera Should I Buy?], by Philip Greenspun&lt;/ref&gt;

In a quip: &quot;Buy glass, not chips&quot;.

===Don't skimp on minor parts===
:''Mistake: Trying to save on minor parts''

A fancy system with inadequately cheap minor parts has feet of clay.
For instance, buying cheap memory cards or filters.
This is a false economy: an unreliable memory card may cause you to lose many pictures, while a poor quality filter will severely degrade your Image Quality.

Further, this is often a very small savings: minor parts are generally quite cheap.

Alternatively, one may buy cheap parts at first, only to be frustrated and spend far more in the long run replacing the cheap parts.

&quot;Just buy the right stuff the first time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bythom.com/support.htm Serious Support], by Thom Hogan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budget for a full system, not a body===
:''Mistake: Budgeting for a body, then being dismayed at unexpected costs''

A system costs more, often much more, than a body alone.

If one does not budget for a full system, one is likely to be dismayed at the full cost of a system, and to skimp on minor parts.

Better to buy a cheaper body and few lenses at first, together with quality parts for a full system, and subsequently upgrade and expand.

Draw up a ''full'' list before purchasing components to avoid blowing your budget.

==Trade-offs/Headline numbers==
Photographic equipment has many variables, and particular pieces of equipment make various trade-offs: a particular lens may have higher Image Quality and be faster, but be much heavier and more expensive.

Ignoring these trade-offs and focusing on a single number is softheaded, and leads to unforeseen compromises and frustration. The most common &quot;headline numbers&quot; that people focus on are '''zoom factor''' and '''pixel count''', and both are deceiving.

===Zooms and Superzooms versus Prime===
Zoom lenses, and especially [[w:superzoom|superzoom]] lenses,
are undeniably convenient, but have severe trade-offs:
* poor Image Quality
* slow: they generally have small aperture, making them dim, and unsuited for DOF effects
* image distortion
* flare
* poor AutoFocus
* heavy
* expensive
Prime lenses are often much higher quality, faster, and cheaper, and zoom lenses with low zoom factors are generally similarly superior to superzoom lenses.

===Image quality isn't just pixel count===
:''Mistake: Focusing on pixel count, instead of Image Quality''
More pixels are not necessarily better, and beyond a certain point are worse: small pixels are noisier, and eventually the increased noise outweighs the increased resolution.

Pixel count is a headline number—dig deeper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section provides an overview of classes of cameras and relative prevalence, without making recommendations – it is for context.

The main classes of cameras are:
* [[w:Digital camera#Compact digital cameras|compact digital cameras]]: the vast majority of cameras&lt;ref&gt;That is, cameras that are not part of a multi-purpose device, notably a cell phone.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[w:Digital single-lens reflex cameras|DSLRs]] (digital single-lens reflex cameras).

In more detail, in increasing order of size, quality, and expense, and decreasing order of number of units sold per year:
* [[w:Camera phone|camera phones]]
* [[w:Digital camera#Compact digital cameras|compact digital cameras]]
* [[w:Bridge digital camera|bridge digital cameras]] &amp; [[#Large sensor non-DSLR|large sensor non-DSLR]] (see below)
* [[w:Digital single-lens reflex cameras|DSLRs]]
* [[w:Medium format (film%)#Medium-format cameras|medium-format cameras]] and [[w:Large format|large format cameras]]
:notably [[w:view camera|view cameras]], largely film, but also some digital, as part of [[w:Digital camera#Professional modular digital camera systems|professional modular digital camera systems]]

== Other classes ==
=== Rangefinders ===
There are also a few
* [[w:Rangefinder camera#Digital rangefinder|digital rangefinder cameras]]
most notably the [[w:Leica|Leica M8]]. They are of specialized interest, and roughly comparable to DSLRs, but rather more expensive; Leica has a strong following.

=== Large sensor non-DSLR ===
The &quot;large sensor non-DSLR&quot; class is an emerging class, consisting of cameras with large sensor (like entry-level DSLRs), but a smaller format. Several of these are in the [[w:Micro Four Thirds System|Micro Four Thirds System]], by Panasonic and Olympus, which features a Four Thirds size sensor and interchangeable lenses.
There are currently two types:
* High-quality compact
*:These are pocket-size (compact) cameras with a large sensor
*:[[w:Sigma DP1|Sigma DP1]] &amp; [[w:Sigma DP2|Sigma DP2]] are available, and have a fixed lens.
*:Olympus has also announced a camera in this class with interchangeable lenses and a retro design.
* DSLR-style without viewfinder
*:These are similar in design and size to bridge cameras, but with large sensors: smaller bodies than DSLRs, and an [[w:electronic viewfinder|electronic viewfinder]] (EVF)
*:[[w:Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1|Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1]] &amp; [[w:Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1|Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1]]

== Users ==
* Casual photographers are well-served by compact digital cameras, which are generally &quot;point &amp; shoot&quot;.
* Serious photographers (including amateurs/enthusiasts) almost universally go for DSLRs.
* A small number of serious photographers go for film medium format and large format cameras.

== Numbers ==
In terms of numbers, the vast majority of cameras produced today are camera phones, with over 1 billion expected to be sold in 2008. By contrast, approximately 100 million digital cameras were sold in 2006, of which 5 million were DSLRs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaging-resource.com/NEWS/1175724860.html IDC report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of DSLRs are growing rapidly (on the order of 30%/year), so more recent numbers will be much higher.

==What about film?==
For most purposes, digital has entirely superseded film. In many circumstances, the quality is comparable, and digital is far cheaper and easier, easily allowing one to take hundreds of photographs for free.

For certain purposes, notably high-quality landscapes, film remains the medium of choice. Similarly, some enjoy the process and tradition of film.

==In defense of small cameras==
A camera is no good if it's left at home.

Small cameras, such as cell phones and compact digitals, have smaller and noisier sensors than DSLRs (which in turn have worse sensors than medium format digitals), and produce worse photographs, particularly at higher ISO speeds and bigger enlargements. However, they are much more portable, and hence more likely to be to hand when one wishes to take a photograph. For casual photographers, who would rarely if ever lug around a DSLR, a small camera is the only camera one will practically use.

Further, used properly, a small camera can produce quite good photographs, particularly at low ISO speeds and if one does not plan to enlarge it too greatly – for posting on the web, for instance.

Many serious photographers carry around a small camera whilst about casually, and reserve DSLRs for specifically photographic expeditions or the studio.

Traditionally these compact cameras have been from the run of &quot;small sensor&quot; cameras, but with the advent of the high-quality compact (Sigma DP1 &amp; DP2, and announced Olympus ones), many photographers are excited about these.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The production of &quot;future media&quot; often involves a team of  artists, musicians, multimedia experts, communicators and other kinds of specialists.  New media communication technologies can prepare people for emerging career opportunities that are being generated by interactive, immersive, multistory, multimedia technologies.  A historical perspective is necessary to understand predicted future trends, but this book is about the future, not the past or present.

==Learning About Future Media==
The ideal environment for learning about future media technologies would include demonstrations, field trips, and other “learn by doing” experiences.  Guest speakers and panel discussions including industry professionals, alumni, professors, and students with expertise in fields mentioned above can provide invaluable information.  Software tools for hands-on lab work could include, but be limited to:  graphic editing (Adobe Photoshop), audio editing (Adobe Audition), video editing (Apple Final Cut Pro).  
[[Image:FM_-010.jpg|right|400px]]

===In your study of future media, you CAN expect to:===
* 1. Experience an overview of historical and emerging industry trends in graphic design, music technology, and multimedia.
* 2. Be able to define the marketable skills, attitudes and strategies demanded by future careers. 
* 3. Experience how technology is affecting world wide social development.
* 4. Discuss some differences between a Believer’s media perspective and secular developers who might focus primarily on profit and entertainment value.
* 5. Be amazed and sometimes overwhelmed by what you can do with interactive media.
* 6. Learn techniques to locate, organize and analyze emerging communication technologies.

===During your study of future media, you should NOT expect to:===
* 1. Be passive  while others do most of the thinking for you.

After moving a page from its location, go back and check if the redirect is needed (if there are still pages linking to the old location) if not clean it and tag it with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|motive}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template, if links exits, you can fix it or leave it alone depending on your available time.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:19, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

Hello, this is [[User:GuoXia|GuoXia]]. I believe you sent me an email, and I replied, but I just wanted to leave you a little message here, as my email has been known to act somewhat spastically, and may not have sent. So just in case you didn't get the email, I thank you very much for taking an interest in this wikibook, which has been in dire need of reorganization, and I admire the work you've been doing. I'd also be more than happy to assist with the Chinese section, as well as wherever else you may need me. Just tell me what to do, and I'll try to begin!

== Moved page ==

I created this in error http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/1._e4/1...a5 and moved it.
Do moved pages have to be deleted? I was under the impression(perhaps incorrectly) that moving a page means it's old page disappears. If not then would there be any purpose to moving rather then copying a page? [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 15:39, 6 February 2008 (UTC)
:When you move a page, it takes the page's history along with it, so that editors can still see who wrote the page, and when. If you simply copy the page's contents to a new location, it would appear that you wrote the entire page at that time. When moving the page, the old page becomes a redirect (meaning that anyone who goes there will be sent to the new article). The old page still exists, but does not contain any of the previous content. Redirects are generally only needed if another page linked to the original. Since there are no links to the page you accidentally created, it's referred to as an 'orphaned redirect' and is probably not needed. You haven't done anything wrong- I was just cleaning up something we no longer need. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 15:45, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

== Serbo-Croatian ==

I do not want to talk about politics, but it is common knowledge that Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians speak the same language. It is very inefficient to put separate courses for them. Since they are 99% identical, you're just merely rehashing the same things put in one variant on the other. I propose merging them into one page. Yes, it is the ONLY Slavic language in two Alphabets-- Latin and Cyrillic-- albeit the Latin version of the language is more frequently used, even among Orthodox believers.  After all, you wouldn't put Mexican Spanish and European Spanish as separate pages, would you? Nor would you put West German and East German as separate pages? [[User:Brokenote|Brokenote]] ([[User talk:Brokenote|talk]]) 22:47, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

Lexical similarity? As I said, they are 99.9 per cent IDENTICAL. Why don't we merge the dialects into one? It will make everyone's job A LOT easier. First things first, put politics aside at ALL TIMES; this is NOT a political forum or a place to put all this useless junk that leads to nowhere. Brokenote (talk) 22:47, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

Who said you have any political loyalties? I'm merely proposing what should be the page be: any hint of political biases or forums will be dismissed immediately; I've seen enough POVs from a lot of people and it really is a waste of time.Brokenote (talk) 22:47, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

Ironically, Wikipedia ALSO treats them as one language (have you seen the Sprskohrvatski edition?): do you see any double-standards in it? IF they put it as seprate languages-- TRUST me, I;ve seen the discusison boards--- they're overloaded with endless ranting and political squabbling. Why waste one's time written three separate dialects that are practically the same language, putting all politics aside, and just put them into one? It saves time and memory space.

Hey Neoptolemus, how are you? i've been watching some of your work as a page patroller, and you're doing a wonderful job. If you're interested, I'd nominate you for adminship. 

Anyway, I'm about to turn my bot on and do some serious work over at [[Linear Algebra]]. If you're watching RC at all, I'm sure you've seen all the work I've done in it so far. All the manual work is done now, and it's time for the bot to take over. However, the bot is probably going to require a few passes, which is going to flood the RC list. Since you are patrolling, will this bother you? I could probably flag myself for the duration of the job so that i dont flood the list, if you want.

Another not-very-problematic, but very friendly reminder :) Please mark pages as patrolled if you're tagging them. Unfortunately, this means that you must get to the page via [[Special:NewPages]], but I think the process at [[WB:NPP]] is fairly straightforward. Get a page (or batch of pages) from [[Special:NewPages]]; look at the page; mark it as patrolled, then go back and tag/edit/whatever. This reduces duplication of efforts because other patrollers know that it's been viewed by a fellow patroller. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:19, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

== How's Admining Going? ==

I just wanted to check in with you, and see how you're doing with the new admin tools? I've seen some of your work on the RC feed (I watch it when I get bored, it's like TV for me now), and from what I see you are doing great work. It always makes me happy when people I nominate turn into great admins! That means I did my research well. 

Anyway, I wondered if you could do me a favor and read through some of the pages at [[Using Wikibooks/The Wikibooks Administrator]]. I'm not saying that you need to learn any lessons from this (you might, but I don't think you need it), but I really wanted to get some feedback from a new admin about it. It's intended to be a learning tool, but I don't know if it's good enough yet for anybody to really learn from it. Plus, in my old age, I can't remember what things are important, or what concepts are challenging, or whatever. You're welcome to edit the book or write up a bitch-list for me and I'll do it myself. God knows I need to at least pretend to be productive around here :) Thanks! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:51, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

:All right, I read through the book today, and it is certainly helpful in explaining the role of an admin and outlining what exactly all these new buttons do. [[MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook]] fills a similar role in that it also explains how to use the extra buttons, but I think [[Using Wikibooks]] is definitely more helpful from a Wikibooks-specific point of view. I think there are more things that can be added into this book, such as the things that are touched on in the MW Admin Handbook (Special Admin-only pages, etc). MWAH covers quite a bit more content, so I think Using Wikibooks could benefit from borrowing from it's TOC list. According to the main contents page of Using Wikibooks, the Admin chapter is only half-finished, so when these missing topics are incorporated, I think it will become a very helpful tool in training new admins.

== Need info on how to edit Cookbook: Smoking ==

I'm not sure I'm doing this right, as this is the first time I am attempting to add or edit a cookbook page. I feel the page does not fully encompass the varieties of smoking foods, and does not properly describe the variety of smokers and smoking techniques. Also, I would like to contribute some basic recipes and guidelines for cooking. I must also disagree with the statement that all smoked meats must be cured, as I use my smoker quite frequently and I rarely use cured meats. I would like some feedback as to how to properly incorporate my knowledge to this wiki cookbook, with out discrediting others.

FREE &quot;FINISHED&quot; BOOKS on line

Hi Everyone at WIKI

I am not sure &quot;who&quot; to direct this suggestion to, but I am sure that there are many people who have written &quot;finished&quot; fiction and children's books/stories who would be willing to publish them free on-line.

So I would like to suggest a NEW WIKI section for &quot;free finished&quot; books.  

Kind regards

Janet

:Two points worth making here: The first is that Wikibooks does not accept fiction, complete or otherwise. So, people who have fiction works are probably better off going to [[wikia:|Wikia]] or some other place like that to publish them. The second point is that we do [[WB:DONATE|accept donations]] here, but any book that is donated must be released under the GFDL and must be open to editing. That means that a book here on wikibooks is never really &quot;complete&quot; in the sense that more work cannot and will not be done on it. However, if the book is an appropriate form of non-fiction, and if the author agrees to the terms of the GFDL, we would be happy to accept book donations. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:47, 16 December 2007 (UTC)

== '''&lt;big&gt;How to put tables on a book&lt;/big&gt;''' ==

I will appreciate if someone could explain me how to create a table on wikibooks, or better yet how to export a table from Word into wikibook.

Thanks in advance!

[[User:Vallsvg|Vallsvg]] ([[User talk:Vallsvg|talk]]) 21:46, 2 January 2008 (UTC)

:I'm fairly certain (though would love to be proven wrong!) that it is impossible to transfer tables directly into wikibooks from Word. That said, [[Help:Table]] has a lot of information about how to make tables in many ways, shapes, and forms, although this page is admittedly quite a mess. For a lot of tables, this syntax will work (take out the stuff with &lt;!-- --&gt; which is just there for explaining purposes):

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 {| border=&quot;1&quot; &lt;!-- singifies that you want your cells to have borders of thickness 1, if omitted your table will have no borders --&gt;
 ! col 1 title !! col 2 title &lt;!-- give your columns titles. These will come out bold because of the &quot;!&quot;, which of course is optional --&gt;
 |-
 | Column 1, row 1  || Column 2, row 1 
 |- &lt;!-- Column separator --&gt;
 | Cell 1, row 2 
 | Cell 2, row 2 &lt;!--this gives the same result 
 |} &lt;!--signals end of table --&gt;
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

: This code looks like this when rendered:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; 
! col 1 title !! col 2 title &lt;!-- give your columns titles. These will come out bold because of the &quot;!&quot;, which of course is optional --&gt;
|-
| Column 1, row 1  || Column 2, row 1 
|- &lt;!-- Column separator --&gt;
| Column 1, row 2 
| Column 2, row 2 
|} &lt;!--signals end of table --&gt;

:Note that tables are a pain in the butt and can be tricky, for example if you want one cell in a row to be bold and the other not to, they must go on separate lines, otherwise the program will get confused and think you only used one column!

:I just overhauled the page at [[Editing Wikitext/Tables]], so it includes some better information now.

I'm going to investigate that now and see if i can find a good workaround. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:44, 3 January 2008 (UTC)

::You could export simple tables from word usind a macro.  I had a quick go at knocking something together like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
c = ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Columns.Count
r = ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Rows.Count
S = &quot;{| border=&quot;&quot;1&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; vbCrLf &amp; &quot;|-&quot; &amp; vbCrLf &amp; &quot;| &quot;
For y = 1 To r
    For x = 1 To c
        S = S &amp; Replace(ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Cell(y, x).Range, Chr(13) &amp; Chr(7), &quot;&quot;)
        If x &lt;&gt; c Then S = S &amp; &quot;|| &quot;
    Next
    If y &lt;&gt; r Then S = S &amp; vbCrLf &amp; &quot;|-&quot; &amp; vbCrLf &amp; &quot;| &quot;
Next
S = S &amp; vbCrLf &amp; &quot;|}&quot;
Selection.TypeText Text:=S
&lt;/source&gt;

(Hmmm.  Seems like I need some lessons in wiki markup myself.  How do I fix the carriage returns and indents in the above?)

Usage is (for Word 2002 though should be similar for other versions):
*Create a new word document.
*Tools--&gt;macro--&gt;macros
*Give your macro a name
*Select macros in the document you have just created
*Create
*A vb screen will appear.  Paste the above code between the sub and end sub.
*Close the vb window.
*Paste the table you want to wikify into the new document.
*Place your cursor below that.
*Tools--&gt;macro--&gt;macros
*Select your macro and click run.
*The wiki code appears where your cursor was.
*Cut and paste into wiki!

The macro only works for the first table in the document (That's the 1 in Tables(1)) which is why I recommend creating a new document.  If someone could test and let me know if the instructions make sense?  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:09, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

:::Well, when I say that the counts are monthly, those are just my observations. I think it is reasonable to say that we are getting about 100,000 page hits per month. I don't think it's reasonable to say that we are getting over 3,000,000 hits per month. Also, the counts tend to refine themselves over the course of the month, with asymptotic behavior. Counts at the beginning of the month are the least accurate, and they refine themselves from there. I could be wrong about all this, of course.

Substract the total for the day before and you will get the number of hits for the day. It is between 5500 and 9000 for the main page.

You can try to make sense out of buggy information but the ideal would be to get the thing fixed (I think it's clearly a bug). I have send an e-mail to the developper, opened a bug [https://jira.ts.wikimedia.org/browse/LEON-10 on their server] and opened another support bug in case the first one remains unnoticed (not sure Leon is very active right now). I keep you posted if I have any news. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 20:25, 3 January 2008 (UTC)

:Using the algorithm that you suggested, It appears that wikibooks is getting anywhere from 20K - 30K hits ''per day'', for a total of 750,000 page hits per month. This seems like a large number, but not when you consider some key things. An edit consists of 3 page hits. The first to view the page, the second to edit the page, and the third to show the page when it is saved. That's if the page is not previewed while editing (a preview adds an additional page hit). Based on some stats I've seen, we have an average of about 16,000 hits per month, which translates roughly to 48,000 page hits (we have negligibly few bot edits, and bot edits wouldn't be counted by this). That leaves about 700,000 non-edit page views per month, or about 23,000 page views per day. This is a very large number, but is not necessarily far-fetched. I think that's a good estimate for us to use. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:42, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

::Assuming that the algorithm used by WikiCharts is to simply add hits together and divide by the number of days, there are still a few problems with the theories on how many actual hits are happening. The actual number in all probability is higher rather then lower, because the sampling is random making it dependent on the algorithm implode by each browser as to how often a hit is registered, all actions that do not involve just viewing a page (such as editing it, moving it, etc.) are never counted, and people using a text-only browser or has javascript disable aren't being counted either. So an edit consists of only 2 hits max, since the editing and the previewing aren't counted, and its unlikely that both viewing before and after an edit are going to be counted. Its also unlikely that any one person's page views are getting counted all that often. So you should either accept that 20K to 30K hits ''per day'' is actually rather low compared to how many hits are actually happening, or aim for a number much higher then 30K. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:14, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

:::You're right about the editing point, I didn't realize that wgIsArticle was false on an edit page.  I would venture to guess (and this is purely guess work) that the number of people using all-text browsers or browsers with javascript disabled are very low. I say this because many modern websites become almost unusable without javascript. People who have it disabled would have a very hard time doing some things on the internet. I make the limiting assumption that the number of people who fall into this category is negligible. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:23, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

Hi, extract from a conversation on #wikipedia-en-help few minutes ago:&lt;br&gt;

14:15:05 | &lt;Jacques611&gt; hi, easy question actually&lt;br&gt;
14:15:23 | &lt;Jacques611&gt; there is problem with a tool we use on wikibooks&lt;br&gt;
14:15:36 | &lt;Jacques611&gt; the tool is name Wikicharts&lt;br&gt;
14:16:06 | &lt;Jacques611&gt; there is a bug with it and there does not seem to be any active support&lt;br&gt;
14:16:15 | &lt;Jacques611&gt; I am wondering where to go&lt;br&gt;

:On the discussion on [[#Wikiprojects|Wikiprojects]] above [[User:Helpfulstuffnz]] was suggesting to put a more prominent link to the [[Wikibooks:Wikiprojects]] page. Since book projects go with books and subject projects will probably eventually go with subjects it seems perfectly logical to put maintenance projects with maintenance and just give an explanation of the 3 kinds of projects in the Wikiprojects page. So good idea for me, I would just consider the possibility of putting the links to the projects directly on the [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks maintenance|maintenance]] page, that would save a click and a page. The discussions on potential projects could go on the talk page.

== Picture of the Year competition ==

Dear Wikimedians,

Wikimedia Commons is happy to announce that the 2007 Picture of the Year competition will be held soon. Any user who is registered at any Wikimedia wiki and has more than 200 edits is invited to vote.

The competition is among the 514 images that became Featured Pictures at Wikimedia Commons between 2007-01-01 and 2007-12-31. There are literally hundreds of beautiful high quality pictures... please help us choose the best one!

Voting will be conducted through a tool on the toolserver (to make it easier to count compared to editing on a wiki). Users can request a voting token on http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Picture_of_the_Year/2007/Voting . You will need to have email enabled for the user account you intend to vote from. You can only vote once, even if you have multiple accounts that meet the edit requirement. The voter log will be public although the actual votes themselves will be private.

There are two rounds of voting. In the first round, you can vote for as many images as you like, regardless of category. In the final (28), you can only vote for one image.

Thanks,
Wikimedia Commons Picture of the Year committee

Dear Wikimedians,

The 2007 Wikimedia Commons Picture of the Year competition is now open!

Please visit here to see if you are eligible and get a voting token: [[Commons:Commons:Picture_of_the_Year/2007/Voting|here]]

The images are presented in categories, but you can vote for as many as you like, in as many categories as you like. (The categories are just so you don't have to look at hundreds of images at once.) The top 28 images will make it to the final.

Before you cast your vote, you can preview them all at [[commons:Commons:Picture_of_the_Year/2007/Galleries|the galleries]].
Voting is open from January 10-17, so please take the time to have your say!

== Moving a book ==

Hello,
I've just recently started a new book about Yiddish. Its target audience is very different from the already existing Yiddish book, as explained in the [[Yiddish for Yeshivah Bachurim/Introduction|introduction]]. I was wondering if it is okay to get the page [[Yiddish]] to point to both books, and to rename the other one (which currently has almost no content at all) to Conversational Yiddish, or something like that. I notice that other languages (such as English and Chinese) have their own bookshelves, and want to know if would be possible to do something like that for Yiddish. (Or possibly just to delete the other book which currently is just a useless list of animal names and colours.)
Thank you. [[User:Clum|Clum]] ([[User talk:Clum|talk]]) 08:35, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

:You're right, the [[Yiddish]] book has almost no content. Let me ask you, since you know more about this subject then I do: Is the [[Yiddish]] book worth keeping as it currently is? If it's not worth keeping, we can &quot;merge&quot; it into your book. Since this book has so little content, a &quot;merge&quot; would basically consist of deleting that page and posting a redirect to your book instead. Some other options to consider:
:#We could easily rename that page &quot;Conversational Yiddish&quot;, and then use the page [[Yiddish]] to point to both books (see [[C++]] for an example of that).
:#We could create a page at [[Subject:Yiddish]] to point to both books (possibly still using [[Yiddish]] to disambiguate).
:Let me know what you think. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:57, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

::On the one hand, the current [[Yiddish]] book isn't really worth keeping. The only part of it which is slightly useful is the Verbs section, which has conjugations for three of the most common verbs (particularly to be and to have which are used as helping verbs). This information is in any case [[Yiddish for Yeshivah Bachurim/Conjugating verbs|found in my book]] as well.

::On the other hand, I'm not sure that its such a good idea to have [[Yiddish]] pointing directly to my book, because someone expecting to learn conversational Yiddish might be a bit disappointed by my book. The problem is that modern Yiddish is really split into two distinct uses. There are still hundreds of thousands, or perhaps millions of speakers of Yiddish which mainly use Yiddish as their every-day language. However, most of them speak Yiddish natively, and are unlikely to look to Wikibooks for help in learning the language. The other group of people that uses Yiddish is the [[w:Yeshiva|Yeshivah]] (Jewish Torah study centers) system. Since Yiddish is the language that has been used to speak by Ashkenazic Jewry for centuries, many lectures in Yeshivos are still taught in Yiddish. The jargon used in Yeshivos, though, is very different from everyday conversation. It consists mostly of words referring to Torah concepts and religious law, and is usually heavily mixed with the local language (usually English or Hebrew). I believe that a large percentage of people trying to learn Yiddish are doing so in order to understand lectures in Yeshivos (that's why I learned Yiddish), and would benefit from my book. However, my book concentrates mostly on obscure religious terms that someone who wants to learn conversational Yiddish would have no interest in, so it could be misleading to call my book plain &quot;Yiddish&quot;.

::In short,
::#No, the current Yiddish book is not worth keeping.
::#But, I like the idea you gave of having the [[Yiddish]] page pointing to both books, like in C++.
::#So I'm unsure what should be done. --[[User:Clum|Clum]] ([[User talk:Clum|talk]]) 16:57, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

:::Well, how about we delete the [[Yiddish]] book, create a redirect from [[Yiddish]] to your book, and then when we have a book about conversational yiddish (because we dont have one now) we can add that to the [[Yiddish]] page. Because, until we have two books, it doesnt make sense to go out of our way to make space for them. Plus, once we get the book in the future we will know exactly where to put it. Sound Good? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:46, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

::::Oh no! I just spent lots of time renaming the old book and setting up all sorts of bookshelves, categories, and disambiguation pages. I still do believe that the [[Conversational Yiddish]] book as is is totally useless, so if you can undo everything I just did and follow through with your plan, then that might be a good idea. On the other hand, the existence of a Conversational Yiddish book might encourage people to contribute to it (not that it has encouraged anyone in the last couple of years - look at its disappointing talk page). 

::::One more thing, I tried putting all pages from both books into the automatically created Category:Yiddish and for some reason, even though I added it to my [[Template:Yiddish for Yeshivah Bachurim/Bottombar]], and a link is added to each page, they're not appearing in the actual Category. --[[User:Clum|Clum]] ([[User talk:Clum|talk]]) 21:29, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

:There isn't currently, but that's a good idea. We could include a category, and use DPL to list the books. This would rely on the books having that on the appropriate page, and that it be maintained. It's still worth thinking about.

== Gadgets Extension ==

Commons has an interesting extension loaded that allows people to select certain &quot;gadgets&quot; on the preferences page. Once selected, these javascript tools are loaded for you automatically, without having to modify your javascript pages, and without having to know any javascript. Information about the extension is here:

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Gadgets

And you can see the results on commons here: [[commons:Special:Gadgets]] and [[commons:Special:Preferences]] (when you are logged in, on the &quot;Gadgets&quot; tab). All javascript gadgets are located in the MediaWiki namespace, so only admins can modify them. This would allow people to:

*Test or preview a javascript code without having to modify your personal javascript file, or refresh your cache.
*Share useful javascripts with other members quickly and easily
*Quickly customize your interface by picking and choosing from existing scripts, without needing to know anything about javascript.
*Test changes or extensions to the site javascript on small groups, without having to make changes directly to [[MediaWiki:common.js]]. 

I think it's a good-looking extension, doesnt appear to affect performance (it's in use on commons, and they have higher traffic then we have), and is completely opt-in because you need to change your preferences before any of these javascript gadgets will take effect. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:52, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

::Yes, I probably should have posted that here; [[WB:AA]] is like a &quot;default&quot; for me. I did mention the bugs there. In short, it won't work (for now) with cologne blue, and can mess up custom skins. OTOH, most people use a monobook-derived skin, and if you've made your own, then you can probably figure out the workaround.
::Even with those drawbacks, I think it's a useful thing to have. Assuming that there is some (small) population of Wikibookians who can't use it due to those 2 bugs, it will be highly useful for those who can use it. And eventually, the bugs will get fixed. Do we wait until the bugs in MedaiWiki are fixed before using it? Clearly not. (Duesentrieb is thinking of adding a feature to restrict certain scripts to admins/bcrats etc, so you can actually restrict who can click the checkbox. Now, you have to just say &quot;don't use this unless you're an admin; it won't work.&quot;) The extension is stable, and is used on other WMF wikis. I had some ideas of which scripts would be useful to enable through this extension on the [[WB:AA#mw:Extension:Gadgets|other page]], and we can certainly &lt;s&gt;steal&lt;/s&gt; borrow ideas from other projects. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:59, 5 December 2007 (UTC)
:::I use a custom skin myself, if you've ever taken a look at my [[User:Whiteknight/myskin.css|css file, you'll know it was a big undertaking, and it would be trivial for me to adjust it for a new extension. I also have about half a dozen scripts of my own that I would love to get more people using because they automate common book-related tasks (categorizing books, creating new books, creating print versions, etc). Like I said though, commons already uses it, so it can't be too buggy.

== What's the difference between a subject and a category? ==

I have no clue, which is sort of embarrassing, since I've been quite active, and only just realized that they were two different things. When should a subject be used, and when should a category be used? Thanks. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 02:13, 17 January 2008 (UTC)
:The template {{tlx|Subject}} allows you to include up to 10(?) categories. I've actually stopped using it because it makes it difficult to change categories with a bot. That's neither here nor there. The Subject: namespace consists of pages with dynamically-created lists of categories. This uses DPL, which allows more flexibility than the category pages and need not be manually maintained like the bookshelves. For example, we can list the intersection of two categories, or all pages in a certain category that are ''not'' in some other category. So there really is no &quot;using subjects&quot; - pages which are appropriately categorized will show up on the corresponding Subject: page automatically. If you want more details, [[User:Whiteknight]] was the one who proposed that namespace. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:23, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

:The {{tlx|Subject}} template is simply a short-hand way to write categories. The following code snippets are identical:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:A]] [[Category:B]] [[Category:C]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:and 

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Subject|A|B|C}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:We figured that this nice shortcut would help to improve readability, and would help to encourage authors to actually use proper categorization (as mike pointed out, it's not ideal for bot use, so categories can be used instead for the same effect). 
:The Category: namespace is automatically generated based on page lists that contain the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:...]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. In the category, all pages are simply listed, and we don't have any control over presentation. In the [[WB:SUBJECT|Subject namespace]], we can use DPL to transclude  lists from multiple categories, or to combine categories. For instance, we can show a list of pages that are in both category A and category B (but not one or the other). We can also show pages that are in category A, but not in category B. This ability to combine and intersect two categories Can be used to great effect. Look at [[Subject:Engineering]] as an example: We can create lists of books that are engineering books AND have printable versions. Or, we can create lists of books that are engineering books AND are featured books. 
:In addition to these automatically-generated lists using DPL, we can also create manual lists because Subject: is just an ordinary namespace with pages that can be edited normally. [[User:SB Johnny]] has been using Subject: pages to try and cross-reference some common words, especially between the gardening book and the cookbook. See for instance: [[Subject:Maple]]. I hope this answers your questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:07, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rollback and Patroller Rights ==

There are two tools that have been available traditionally only to admins, but which are possible to be extended to other users as well. These are:
;Rollback: It's like the &quot;undo&quot; function, but faster. 1 click undoes all the edits made by the most recent editor. It's useful for fighting vandalism quickly, but there is a certain potential to be abusive because rolling back a legitimate edit is not considered &quot;good&quot;.
;Patroller: This allows a person to patrol pages at [[Special:Newpages]]. Again, this is useful for finding vandalism, but it also helps in making sure that newly created pages are &quot;correct&quot;. 
At the moment, these two capabilities are reserved for admins, but rollback can be useful to other people, and there is a perpetual backlog of unpatrolled new pages that our current admin staff can't keep up with. I would like to propose the following:
#Enable Rollback and Patroller rights to be separate from admin rights (that is, non-admins can get them)
#Allow admins to give rollback and patroller rights (not require bcrats or stewards to do it)
#Also allow admins to remove these rights if they are abused (or maybe only allow bcrats to remove the rights, to prevent warring or something). 
Giving these kinds of rights out would help reduce strain on our current admin staff, and would also provide a &quot;testing&quot; phase for new admin candidates to get good experience with some extra tools. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:42, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{support}} 1 &amp; 2 strongly. 3 - removal is important as well.... (&lt;small&gt;actually thinking!&lt;/small&gt; if &quot;quicker&quot; removal was an issue it might be better if admins could remove as well as grant but I don't think I feel strongly.  With some very limited exceptions (unblocking an IP because I found it was an Open Proxy being the only one that springs to mind) I would never revert the actions of another admin without real discussion, probably not even then. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:51, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{support}} and echo Herby: admin actions must be undoable (by admins). I hadn't thought about this being a trial phase for potential admins, but that's a great point. This would be a really good way to see if someone's ready - show they know what's vandalism and how to use rollback; show they understand [[WB:WIW]] by new page patrolling. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:05, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{support}}  the proposal point 1) to separate the flags from the admin rights but on proposal points 2,3 even if I also agree to the text, would require that responsibilities and requirements to and from granting those rights be written (and discussed) even if not approved on the RFA or any other place that would allow a Wikibookian  to request the flags. On another note since I already expressed support, I must ask if this is really necessary, because we can is not a very great argument. I would as soon give all the administrative rights and tasks to a user, and I strongly object to Mike.lifeguard to use this as a &quot;trial base&quot; for the full admin rights.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:04, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
*:{{comment}} - see [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2007/November#Mentorship?]]. I'll try my hand at drafting a ''simple'' guideline for granting (and revoking) these tools.

How we dole out the rights is separate issue. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:57, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
*:{{comment}} Well, current user-rights decisions are left to bureaucrat discretion, and I don't see why that would have to change for these rights. It's generally better to keep all the processes standardized, so there is no confusion or special cases. I propose that all requests/nominations for +rollbacker or +patroller are handled on [[WB:RFA]] (possibly rename that page to &quot;Requests for permissions&quot;, or something more general). We leave the final determination up to administrator discretion. Since these are less then admin, we should expect a person to get about half as much support as would normally be needed to become an admin, and about a quarter of what it would take to promote a new bcrat. Here are some general guidelines: rollbacker/patroller: 4 votes, admin: 8 votes, bcrat: 16 votes. Admins who don't use proper discretion, or abuse this privilege, like any other abuses, could be nominated for de-adminship. People with rollback/patroller who abuse those rights can have them removed quickly. Beyond this, I don't forsee any problems. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:36, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} - Before I place a vote, could someone give me an actual example of a user who fits into this category?

*{{comment}} - is this needed?  Wikibooks is still a small project and adding another layer of beaurocracy seems unneccesary at present and besides tools like 'rollback' can be added by anybody already by adding the script to their monobook thingy. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:12, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
*:Good questions from both Withinfocus and Xania here, let me see if I can answer them adequately. First thing, the &quot;new page patrol&quot; job can be performed by any trusted user, not just admins. Basically, you just check out newly created pages, and tag them with appropriate cleanup templates if needed. Too many new pages are created regularly, and our current admins just can't keep up with the backlog. There are many new pages that are never patrolled. Being an admin comes with a certain amount of responsibility, and people have turned down nominations before becaues of this. Having the ability to patrol new pages without having to become a full-fledged admin might be an attractive option for many people. I don't have a specific example of a particular person who could use this, but that doesnt mean that such examples don't exist. 
*:To Xania, I would say that we are not a &quot;small&quot; project in any sense, and we have the workload of a larger project. The problem is that many book authors don't get involved in community-wide cleanup tasks. We have an uncharacteristically small amount of vandalism, but that's because we have some very aggressive anti-vandalism policies and practices (especially compared to wikipedia, for instance). Some of the numbers and statistics that we are starting to see show that wikibooks is actually a surprisingly large project. Plus, many people anticipate more growth. Even if we don't have a pressing need now for these tools (and I would argue that we do) it still makes sense to implement them now. I hope this helps. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:24, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
*::I'm probably an example - I help out whenever I have time, but that time is limited and sporadic, so getting support for full-admin probably wouldn't happen. But having these tools available would allow me to make somewhat better use of my time. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 02:37, 16 January 2008 (UTC)
*:{{comment}} - Actually, with the Gadgets extension, it's even easier than editing monobook.js. MW rollback is easier on the servers, and faster for the user than a scripted rollback. As well, we're looking at giving +patroller, which is where I think we really need this. There's no backlog visible today, but there usually is (a big one) - more hands there are definitely needed. As for adding bureaucracy, I think my [[User:Mike.lifeguard/Rights|initial ideas]] for a guideline avoids that. I have some users in mind, but I'm not sure it's appropriate to start nominating people before the software is configured and we have some idea of what process we'll be using. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:31, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
:::Supporting what Mike &amp; Whiteknight have said.  This merely makes RC patrolling easier/quicker for those who do it anyway and who are not admins.  In practice I think WB could get great benefit from this - it is SO frustrating to deal with vandals with one hand tied behind your back - I can still remember it!  This doesn't solve the problem but it does make it easier to deal with.  There are few RC patrollers and even fewer of those are admins.  For those of you who are unsure try actually watching RC for a few days - you will then understand the problem and see people who might be granted the rights.
:::On reflection I have no problem with admins granting the rights (I notice I am able to on en wp!).  If there are few admins active it is even more true that there are few 'crats active.  It is not even as though we have particularly &quot;new&quot; admins on here - maybe if we did it would be wise for them not to grant such rights for a month or so?  It really is no big issue - the fact that en wp manages to make it one merely shows what a madhouse that place can be. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:10, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

Which really it is: these tools aren't rocket science.  I will offer myself as an example of someone who would request and make use of these tools.  I would be happy to patrol new pages and would make good use of the rollback in reverting vanadlism. I'm not a stage at the moment where I am looking to request adminship, as I can't guarentee my constant presence round here, (sometimes the real world pulls me away for periods), so these tools would be an excellent inbetween.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 23:21, 12 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{support}}. Rollback would make reverting multiple-edit vandalism much easier, rather than having to sort through diffs until finding a good version of a page. And patrolling abilities would be a ''huge'' help for checking Recent Changes, as I often do. This would let me know which edits have already been OKed by other trusted users. I agree with what [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike]] said far above, that these rights would allow bureaucrats to test potential administrators without giving them too much free range to mess things up. I am in [[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]]'s situation as well - looking for a nice in-between of having extra buttons to make editing easier, but not at the moment having the open schedule for full-fledged administrator duties.

Many on en.wikipedia didn't want to even see this option available at all.  All of this said, I am grateful to the dev team that it is now a reasonable option to grant these administrator tools to others who may not want or need the full set of admin tools.  For myself, I hope that here on Wikibooks these are handed out fairly liberally, and that the process will be much more informal than trying to obtain adminship.  Especially the rollback feature, although I would like to see somebody formally commit to helping scan recent changes if they receive the patroller tools.  I am indifferent in regards to giving admins access to removing access to these tools, as I hope that the number of individuals who need to have these rights taken away would be such a small handful that one or two bureaucrats ought to be able to handle that workload.  This does give a nice set of options for &quot;pre-administrators&quot; or people who want to show they are honorable enough to become admins but the rest of the community would like to gain some extra trust from first.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 12:14, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

Please also see the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance#Special:Userrights|discussion elsewhere]].
:It looks like people are strongly in favour of spreading the work out for both rollback and patrolling somehow, and the questions remaining are regarding implementation.
:One issue raised is whether admins or bcrats should be granting the rights. Whiteknight has asked that bcrats ''not'' be responsible for this (Herby and I agreed); withinfocus has requested the opposite.
:Several people have noted that these rights are not a big deal. In a similar vein, some of the strongest comments are requesting that whatever process there is for granting/revoking the rights be drama- and bureaucracy-free. Opposing that view is a request for a vote for each user requesting the rights.
:Finally, I'd like to plug my [[User:Mike.lifeguard/Rights|not-a-policy-proposal]]; it's just ideas for how admins might rationally choose who to give the rights to (though I don't think we really need anything written down).

::{{comment}} - Twinkle will soon use MediaWiki rollback. Currently the only remedy for abuse of TW is to block the user, which is rather harsh; before TW was a Gadget, an admin could remove TW from the user's monobook. This update to TW means that removing +rollbacker will disable TW. It is possible to keep an old version of TW, but I think we should keep a reasonably up-to-date version. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:06, 15 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{support}} (See also above) It's certainly something that would allow people with limited time to contribute to assist without having to apply for full adminship. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 02:37, 16 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{support}} This sounds like a great idea (I also like Whiteknight's idea of using this for an pre-admin testing phase) and as Mike said we do need a bit of help with new page patrol around here. --[[User:Az1568|Az1568]]&lt;sup&gt; ([[User talk:Az1568|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 06:03, 17 January 2008 (UTC)
:'''Comment''' since this idea that it should be used as a pre-admin test is taking a life of its own, I must restate that  I strongly object to test phases or mentoring as a &quot;requirement&quot; that could be used to prevent a user from obtaining the administrative flag. Administrative tasks go beyond monitoring edits. On the other hand I agree that any productive work should be a contributing factor in any form one wishes to contribute it for obtaining the access. In other words I'm against the formalization of some sort of steps that would require a user to prove more that the normal level of interest and knowledge as is now expressed on the RFA at least as drastic as this one. We are all volunteers, assuming good faith, a demonstration of interest and knowledge is all we should request.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:21, 17 January 2008 (UTC)
===Consensus check===
Well this looks like consensus to me. Barring any new concerns or objections, I'll be submitting this request to bugzilla on Friday. As for implementation, here's what it looks like we're doing:
*Admins may hand out +patroller and +rollbacker to any user they feel are qualified to have them using their best judgment;
**It may be useful to point potential patrollers towards [[Wikibooks:New page patrol]] and potential rollbackers towards [[Wikibooks:Dealing with vandalism]] for information. For both, you might remind them about the Gadgets options.
**You may want to use [[Wikibooks:User rights]] as a ''very'' loose &lt;s&gt;guideline&lt;/s&gt; ''idea'' for granting and revoking the rights. I do not expect this to become an official policy or guideline. In fact, I ''dont't'' want that. Instead, that page should be changed to reflect what we're doing. So if it turns out that the page doesn't describe how we go about granting and revoking these rights, then the page changes - not us. The admins here can be trusted to be sane.
*Admins are not to wheelwar with the rights - discussion is to take place before reversing another admin's rights change except in the case of obvious abuse;
*Users will request rights at [[WB:RFA]] (which will be renamed to [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] and have it's sections changed - I'll do this at the same time as the request);
*Admins will process requests, and archive them as normal. No discussion is required; admins will use their discretion in granting these rights. Comments are welcome, as always, but this is ''not'' an RFA(!)
*For removal in the case of clear, ongoing abuse: remove first, discuss second;
*For removal in all other cases: discuss first, remove second (this includes inactivity).
Sound good? Please feel free to tweak this if my measure of consensus is off; with such a long discussion I may be off in places. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:45, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

*{{support}} Sounds perfect with the exception of the inactivity bit. I'll probably be one of the first in line once the request page goes up, as these are tasks that I frequently do but with long (and I mean long, see my [[Special:Contributions/Xerol|history]]) periods of inactivity, which is the only thing preventing me from requesting a full RfA. I don't think inactivity should be a reason to remove these rights as they're not as extensive as adminship and it just seems like it adds a layer of bureaucracy that was trying to be avoided. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 06:44, 17 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{support|Sounds good}} - nice work Mike.  Any views on how long a request should be on the page?  Is it hours, a day or two any longer would be odd to me?  Going for a low bureaucratic process is great with me.

*:Let's not aim for minutes like enwiki had for a while =D. I'm guessing that time before yea/nay will be hours for people we already know (ie I have some people in mind to get the bits already); for people we don't, maybe a day or two (esp for +patroller, we may want to let them patrol without the bit so the other patrollers will be looking at their work, thought this is not necessary). After &lt;nowiki&gt;{{done}} or {{not done}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, things should be archived as normal(?), which means a week. Maybe check that last point - if there's no big discussion then [[Special:Log/rights]] may suffice. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:53, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

***{{comment}} Seriously, what use are we as bureaucrats if we don't take this task? I don't think giving these to admins fits the normal style at all.

****I guess my question would be &quot;why is it not an admin task?&quot;.  Lack of trust or what?  The rights (unlike most 'crat assigned rights) are removable again very easily.  They really are &quot;no big deal&quot; &amp; should be seen as such.  Within reason &quot;ask &amp; you can have them&quot; - this is a very small community - anyone watching RC will get to know people very quickly I think (possibly far quicker than a 'crat who is not very active for example). --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:37, 19 January 2008 (UTC)
*****I don't think it's a lack of trust, it's more like people are opposed to making exceptions to the rules already in place (i.e. that 'crats give special permissions to people). I think that makes sense in some degree, unless there are too many people asking for the tags for the 'crats to handle. What mechanism would people use to request the tags anyways?

*****The reason we have bureaucrats grant +sysop and +bot is that it's necessary to weigh a consensus since there's a discussion that takes place, and it's a weighty one. We're not having RFAs here; these are not powerful tools (useful, but not powerful), so there will be no consensus to weigh before granting the rights. In cases where there ''is'' some discussion (if someone expresses some concern over giving it to some user), the discussion will probably be smaller than a VFD, which admins close regularly. Nevertheless, I wouldn't oppose having a bureaucrat handle those requests where there was some non-trivial discussion about whether to grant the bit or not. That seems like a good compromise between &quot;admins are in the best position to see who should get these rights which aren't a big deal and we hate bureaucracy&quot; and &quot;but bureaucrats are supposed to grant user rights&quot; &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:13, 19 January 2008 (UTC)

I've noticed a couple of bookshelves that bear the exact same name as their departments- e.g. [[Wikibooks:Natural Sciences bookshelf]] and [[Wikibooks:Social science bookshelf]]. Since these are in departments of the same name, would it be helpful to add &quot;general&quot; to the names?

If there's no more interest then I guess Laleena and I will be lonely but powerful. :) [[User:Rmawhorter|Rmawhorter]] ([[User talk:Rmawhorter|talk]]) 03:11, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

:I don't know that I would call it a &quot;wasteland&quot;, but Wikijunior really does need our love and our help. We've tried doing things to promote Wikijunior, including adding prominent links to the sidebar and the main page, creating a whole Wikijunior: namespace and creating categorization systems such as [[Subject:Wikijunior]]. I'm able to lend ''some help'', although I tend to work in very short energetic bursts, and I like to have a plan ready before I do anything. You come up with a good plan, a listing of specific items that need help, and I'll see what I can do about it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:15, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

:::I think that we should start with some of the books that are almost done. My suggestion is that we start with Languages and then move on to Dinosaurs. Languages has significant content already as opposed to some of the other unfinished books. Here's what I think needs to be done on Languages:
:::*grammar/spelling work
:::*continuity between the different articles with regard to scope and layout
:::*age appropriate vocabulary and grammar
:::*more words defined in the glossary
:::*see that there's appropriate coverage for the 25 most spoken languages
:::*if we can finish then a pdf and an html version should be created [[User:Rmawhorter|Rmawhorter]] ([[User talk:Rmawhorter|talk]]) 05:01, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

:Our wiki does have the ability to track contributions using the history pages, but you cannot close your project, prevent people from editing freely, or try to maintain any kind of editorial control. However, if you give it a chance, I think you will find that using an open system can be very productive. More people will be likely to edit an open book (as opposed to a closed one), and in practice you will find that few people (at least initially) will participate in it anyway. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:44, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

== copying from wikipedia ==

The module [[C Programming/Standard libraries]] appears to be a copy-and-paste fork of [[Wikipedia:C standard library]].
So I slapped the &quot;dewikify&quot; template on it, as recommended by [[Wikibooks:Dewikify]].
Anything else I need to do that isn't already mentioned on [[Wikibooks:Dewikify]]?

Is there some &quot;policy&quot; or &quot;guideline&quot; on how to handle copy-and-paste from Wikipedia articles to Wikibooks, in general?
In particular, handling cases &quot;forks&quot; where we end up with 2 slightly-different versions, one on Wikipedia and the other on Wikibooks?
See [[Talk:C Programming/Standard libraries]] for one specific case, which I'm sure will not be the last.

== Wiki as a Database ==

Since I feel more comfortable working with the Wikibooks community, and I'm afraid I would get overwhelming feedback in other forii, I'm raising this issue here and will try to expand upon this elsewhere if there seems to be some interested in the concept.  

What I'm trying to do is to help organize a group/documentation project that would explain how you can use MediaWiki software '''''as a database''''', and to help point out flaws in the MediaWiki software that make it harder to implement some of these ideas, where perhaps some developer effort could be used to help improve the situation.  I'm talking some very minor changes to MediaWiki here, not some major all-inclusive foundational changes like the earlier [[meta:WikiData]] project that sought to give direct access to the MySQL database running the Wikimedia projects.  Eventually this discussion, if it continues, will be moved to Meta, but I'd like to talk about this with those who I consider to be friends first.

To show an example of a project I've been working on that uses this concept of a '''Wiki as a Database''', I can give you [[wikia:Runescape:Grand_Exchange_Market_Watch]].  What I've done here is to create a sort of a database with an extensive array of hierarchical templates that feed into one another.  It is important to note that nearly all of the features of this concept already exist within MediaWiki... even if they haven't been extensively used in this fashion before.  One of the key features of this is how each database &quot;record&quot; is kept as a separate page and not mixed with other page content.  I'll go into administrative nightmares (aka what a wiki admin or sysop does) with this whole thing, but it is manageable.  Don't get caught up with the specific implementation here, but I do think there are many applications of this concept that can be used extensively here on Wikibooks.

One of my goals with setting up this template hierarchy was to introduce the concept of &quot;edit once, update everywhere&quot;.  In other words, this is a genuine database that is intended to have either parts or major sections of each database record to be used on multiple pages throughout the entire wiki, and mixed liberally with other wiki content with a very minimal amount of fuss.  I've used this data for displaying the information into tables, integrated it into &quot;infoboxes&quot; common on Wikipedia and elsewhere, performed calculations upon the data, and in general pushed the concept about as hard as can be done.  Like I said, this is a real database, using MediaWiki, and nearly anything you can normally do with a database can also be done with this information.

Some significantly lacking areas of MediaWiki including the following problems:

*A way of showing when a record/page was last updated from within the template hierarchy.  The current &quot;hack&quot; that is being used is to accomplish this task is to use the five tilda ('''&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;''') substitution mechanism for showing when an entry was last modified.  To fix this, some method should be created to allow the date of modification of a template to be passed up to a page that has transcluded text.  Currently, Media Wiki only allows you to view the date/time of last modification for the current page only, not any of the subordinate templates.  This is particularly useful in a wiki context as you can flag data which is out of date or stale and encourage wiki participants to help update the information to something more current.... especially if the information is time sensitive like stock information or population statistics (to give examples).

*Preloading assistance for updating data records.  MediaWiki has a wonderful mechanism for allowing preloaded text to be used as a sort of standard &quot;template&quot;, but it can be used only if the content of the page is already blank or doesn't already exist in the MediaWiki database (meaning the SQL database running the wiki).  I've been trying to use this as a mechanism to overcome the problems of dating time sensitive material (the above problem by simply generating the five tildas when you edit a page), but there are other uses for allowing some sort of calculated modification of a template, where you can generate wiki markup text based upon content from this database.  BTW, I do understand why for the sake of vandals this isn't done, but I'm pointing out that there are some useful reasons why you may want to preload new content to replace older content.

*Administrative issues for where to put the database items.  At least here on Wikibooks, this could all be shunted off to be something of a bunch of sub-pages from a Wikibook, but it is a huge problem for other wiki projects.  I've gone into huge arguments about the fact that these pages ought to be thrown into various namespaces for project administration, as people doing a recent changes patrol are simply overwhelmed with literally thousands of database modifications that are drowning out modifications to other content that isn't in the context of a database item.  Basically, these admins want to have some sort of flag that they can &quot;ignore&quot; the database items when performing a recent changes patrol.  A database record-specific namespace would IMHO be the ideal way to accomplish this task, but that isn't a standard feature for MediaWiki installations (yet).  Throwing these into the &quot;Template:&quot; namespace of a typical MediaWiki project is only going to destroy patrolling templates.... which IMHO is something that normally should be viewed with a jaundiced eye as changes to most templates can have a tremendous impact on a project... but updating these records ought to be routine and most of these changes are of little consequence.

This is all a huge mouthful, and I'll wait for some replies on the topic.  One area I would love to hit here is the book information database, where information about all of the Wikibooks can be organized in various fashions for browsing to find something you want, and include information that goes well beyond categorization.  Perhaps I'll start a Wikibook about this topic as well.  It is at least another concept that you can add into your tool box for editing content on a wiki.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 13:45, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

:If I understand your ideas correctly (and I need to take a much closer look at your implementation), I think you are really adding undue complexity in order to make MediaWiki perform a task which it isn't strictly designed to do. With respect to the dating problem you describe above, [[User:Darklama]] did a lot of work with having templates that changed their appearance over time. Using a timestamp and some creative parserfunctions, you can easily highlight pages that are old and stale. Having these timestamps be automatically updated when the page is edited is going to require some kind of change to either javascript (regular expressions can find old timestamps and replace them with new timestamps before an edit is submitted) or some kind of custom mediawiki extension. I think the javascript option is the better of the two, but then you have the problem of needing to install the necessary javascript for all editors, possibly by default (without installing it on non-database pages, or for users who don't use the database). I don't know much about Wikia, but I am doubtful that they would have an equivalent of the &quot;per-book&quot; gadget that we recently installed here.
:In short, I think this is an interesting idea, but I worry that the added complexity of all the necessary scaffolding is akin to cramming a round peg in a square hole. It may be worthwhile to create the necessary mediawiki extensions, or even fork mediawiki and create a specialized wiki that can do things like this automatically. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:27, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

::In defense of this concept... yeah, I would have to agree that this is a cramming a round peg into a square hole, and successfully shaving off the edges of the peg in order to get it to fit.  What is so killer on all of this is that MediaWiki runs on top of a real database anyway, but in order to get this to work, you have to &quot;undo&quot; the restrictions that prohibit you from accessing the database in the first place.

::BTW, I've looked into parser functions of almost any and every stripe that I can find, particularly to solve the date function issue.  Parser functions simply don't have this capability in any way, shape, or form (at the moment).  If the &quot;template&quot; or &quot;page&quot; has a hard date-stamp on it somewhere, that information can be used for dating (including the color modification you are talking about).  But the date stamp must be provided when you edit the page and can't be derived after the fact (using a subst: command can work, but even that can be clumsy).  I'll bet Darklama's pages were using a subst: invocation to add the timestamp.  Adding a fancy timestamp template is far more difficult than simply using five tildas... in terms of user simplicity.  I have also looked into modifications of [[MediaWiki:Common.js]] as a solution, and for smaller wikis this generally isn't a huge problem.  This does, however, require constant tweaks if you want to come up with another database that uses the same sort of interface, and poses additional problems.

::I have been incredibly tempted to get into hacking a mediawiki extension that would make this all happen.  Again, this would require some sort of direct access into the database tables of an SQL database... and it would all have to be logged somehow as well, provide histories of table entries, and all sorts of other overhead (if you are going to keep a wiki philosophy of providing an audit trail to revert changes by vandals).  What I'm suggesting is something that does work now, even if it is a very imperfect solution... and provide the basis to motivate those who might want to provide a much better solution.  Attempting to make an extension of this nature, this is a huge undertaking of a degree that I am only beginning to comprehend.  Please look at [[meta:Wikidata]] to see many such attempts in the past, none of which are currently in a state ready for general use on MediaWiki projects.  Not even Ultimate Wiktionary has been this useful, and the other direct database implementations have been very specific in their objectives and have not been for a general database application for use within a wiki.

::Another huge design constraint I'm putting on this is that whatever interface is selected, it should be usable by even brand-new editors without requiring a separate &quot;client&quot; download in order to use the interface.  In other words, it should be organic to the wiki itself and should use similar kinds of user restrictions on its use.  'bots are nice to use for some people, but getting access to a bot necessarily complicates getting the tools in the hands of additional users.

::The point here is that there are many very real applications that would make use of a genuine database within a MediaWiki project that can show real-time data changes on multiple pages simultaneously.  There is also no legitimate reason to have to update the very same piece of data on multiple pages... which is definitely where some sort of template is helpful.  Yes, setting up the template heirarchy is incredibly complex, although editing a single &quot;record&quot; has proven to be pretty simple to accomplish... and I've seen some very new wiki users (new to any sort of wiki interface) successfully make modifications, or even add some interesting extensions.  I've made some mistakes along the way to setting this up, and I'm also willing to be shown a better way to accomplish this task.  Yes, this takes a bit of mind bending to see how this works, but it does work, in many ways thanks to some newer extension that have been added as &quot;standard features&quot; to MediaWiki software that wasn't available even so much as a year ago.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 23:49, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

:Hi Robert, this afternoon I was noting to somebody at university that I did not think MediaWiki was supporting any form editing or list management (à la Notes or SharePoint services to name a few). I understand from your post that you are confirming this absence of support. You are a real hacker to built it &quot;over&quot; the template structure :-) I started using that approach to generate the navigation for [[.NET Development Foundation]] and it's fun but a little complicated. A good programmer can put a database anywhere. But from a management point of view I think those approaches should remain isolated and &quot;hacker reserved&quot; for special projects (like yours) until real support for forms and list management is added to MediaWiki (maybe that will never come because poeple at wikipedia are generally not in favor of transcluding stuff). I am worried, for the same reasons, at all the extensions that [[User:Whiteknight]], [[User:Darklama]] and others are constantly adding. If they happen to leave the project there might be a major support problem. But you probably have though about that like they surely did.

::Thanks for the pointer to the semantic wiki.  I've been following semantic web philosophies for more than a decade, and have worked on some similar concepts from time to time with an eye toward applications in education.

::One aspect of all of this that does concern me, however, is the CPU bandwidth requirements for processing all of this data.  I know that a number of significant features have been &quot;turned off&quot; from Wikimedia projects due to some considerable problems with CPU bandwidth, not to mention &quot;external storage&quot; I/O bandwidth.  I'm not suggesting &quot;my approach&quot; is necessarily lighter on that topic either... in fact I think it is worse than a direct database access by likely a whole order of magnitude and may even be a smaller O(n) algorithm if you can avoid templates in the manner I've been using them.  As you have been discussing in terms of all of the extensions that have been added to Wikibooks, this is continuing to be a concern.  Local I/O bandwidth (not network bandwidth surprisingly) is IMHO the &quot;critical path&quot; problem that will open this sort of activity up for more general usage.

::A concern that I have with projects like Semantic Web and Ultimate Wiktionary is that they are addressing specific issues without looking at the global issues involved.... and providing two semi-compatable but incomplete solutions to nearly the same problem.  On both of these projects there have been some very intelligent individuals who have thought through a great many issues, and I'm not trying to slight either effort.  Some incredible work has been done to try and &quot;crack&quot; this problem, and there clearly is some demand for access to something of a database by wiki users within a wiki.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 13:20, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

:::I was pretty sure you were already following these things. Whatever the syntax used I think the information will be kept in the &quot;pages&quot; (template parameters like you do, page attributes, link tags like [http://del.icio.us del.icio.us], semantic categories like [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_MediaWiki Semantic MediaWiki], straight natural language processing &quot;à la Prolog&quot; or anything else). In all cases the information will have to be processed either on page save (like the timestamp problem you are pointing), on page rendering (the template structure with caching) or by a &quot;bot&quot; of some kind (asynchronous processing). In all cases very interesting servicing and performance questions will arise. My point is that those questions have to be adressed before trying to &quot;generalize&quot; an approach, same thing for the &quot;maintenance&quot; problems I was talking about earlier (and as you know we could add lots of those types of concerns). 

:::The &quot;individual&quot; approach used to update pages on Wikipedia (not sure it works that well on Wikibooks) clearly does not work well for software projects, even open source ones. This is why I am pointing at things like Semantic Mediawiki. Not the solution itself but the fact that there '''must''' be a ''community'' adressing the problem. I see a technically average solution supported by a community as much better than a technically good solution without support (isn't that what MediaWiki is all about? - not aven a WYSIWYG editor!). All this verbose to say that you can count on my support, and some of my time, if you can integrate this effort in one of the communities surrounding MediaWiki (or MediaWiki itself). If that cannot be done my ''newbie'' feeling is that we should keep this for special projects so we do not jeopardize the main application and database. That said I fully respect your IT competences and looking forward to work with you sometime.

::::At least some of this is already in use on Wikiversity's [[v:Bloom Clock|Bloom Clock]], in the sense that is uses templates inside other templates. So for example, if you look at the edit window of [[v:BCP/Taraxacum officinale]], you note that it contains a number of templates and other included pages, while on the other hand that page is used like a template on numerous pages in the Bloom Clock's [[v:Bloom Clock/Keys|Keys]] (I think it definitely bears repeating here as a way of incorporating a true &quot;modularity&quot; to Wikibooks).

== Clearing an article's cache? ==

Hi all. I'm working on a tag-extension for uploaded images in which I make it possible to edit tags succesfully in image description pages without having to make changes to the article itself. I did this by sending the tags to updateArticle() when posting and then bypassing the &quot;if ( 0 != strcmp( $text, $oldtext )&quot; (check if anything changed in the article) by putting my function addTags() after it. This way the tags are added anyway, even when the article wasn't updated.

My problem is: when an article isn't updated the cache isn't cleared, requiring a hard refresh to see the new tags. How can I make sure the article cache is cleared even when it hasn't changed? Many thanks! [[User:Litso|Litso]] ([[User talk:Litso|talk]]) 15:16, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

== Test templates ==

Hi, I just gave a test template to an IP, who made a test to one of the pages, by removing a &lt;/math&gt; tag. The template itself is incredibly harsh, I think. A bold &quot;Do not make inappropriate edits&quot; followed by &quot;your edits are considered disruptive and harmful&quot; for what was simply someone testing the wiki, seems way over the top. I haven't even looked at the other test templates, and not sure I want to, for fear of frightening myself away from here &lt;tt&gt;;)&lt;/tt&gt; Anyway, compared to some other wikis I work on, the test messages here are very harsh and unfriendly, and I propose they be changed.

:We actually use {{tlx|test}} as ''the'' vandalism warning - only rarely are others ever used. So I think it's appropriate that the wording is geared towards true vandalism, not test edits. Of course, perhaps this should be changed - {{tlx|test}} could be for actual test edits, and {{tlx|blatantvandal}} could be for actual vandalism, instead of using the former for both cases. Let's get some feedback before changing such a widely-used template. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:34, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

:::Generally speaking, yes. People doing test edits get more leeway, but we tend to block vandals much more quickly than other wikis (while it's not necessarily one warning, we definitely don't give 4 warnings like enwikipedia).

:This does show that perhaps our template names could do with yet another update to be more specific. {{tlx|test}} should likely be a message to new users on harmless test edits (as the name implies). As mike said, vandals around here only get one warning at most (and in many cases, they don't even get that). Newbie tests on the other hand are viewed with so much tolerance that we rarely comment on them at all. It's often easier to fix the mistake and then give the user a proper welcome then it is to give them any kind of &quot;warning&quot; at all.

Even though you are the professor for my class I wanted to get a bit more history on you.  I am really excited for you with your new addition arriving soon.  I am also the mother of three children and they are everything.  Moms define their success based on the childrens accomplishments.  I am truly blessed because all three of my children are healthy, happy and doing well in school.  I hope to make them proud by earning my degree.  I have always wanted to teach and have talked about it so much.  This is my third try at getting my degree.  I am determined and with the support of my family and the good lord I will succeed.  I know you will enjoy your new baby as you have shown great mothering pride in all the pictures of your other children.  Thanks for taking the time to teach us this semester.[[User:Pbrit001|Pbrit001]] ([[User talk:Pbrit001|talk]]) 00:51, 14 September 2008 (UTC)

== Wiki introduction ==

Hi Jenniferjkidd,

I've noticed that some of the contributors to the class project that you seem to be one of the leaders of have had some problems getting accustomed to the wiki interface. Perhaps they could use reading up on some of the documentation that we have. Unfortunately, much of it is poor and some of us are trying to get it up to shape. Comments on what is unclear would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:35, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;The following two comments moved from [[User talk:Swift]]. If I leave you a note on your talk page, please reply there.&lt;/span&gt;
: Hi Swift,
: Thanks for asking. I have found that posting a picture can be problematic - especially figuring out the licensing. Does everyone need to include a summary of their pic, for example? I also haven't found a specific page that provides a simple easy to use guide to Wikicode. For example, a list of desired outcomes and then steps or links to step by step instructions for how to accomplish this. Does such a thing exist? I've tried to create something of the sort for by students (for example, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Education_and_Instructional_Assessment/Edition_4/How_to_Use_this_Book_Table_of_Contents/Posting_an_Article_and_Posting_a_Picture_, but if something you all have done already exists, that's even better.[[User:Jenniferjkidd|Jenniferjkidd]] ([[User talk:Jenniferjkidd|talk]]) 15:31, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Metabolomics_Project_Logo.jpg‎ |right|400x400px]] 
{{drop|M}}etabolism has been studied on some level for hundreds or thousands of years. People often associate metabolism with nutrition. In the life sciences, a detailed discussion of metabolism is usually presented in a variety of courses, including introductory biology, cell biology, microbiology and biochemistry. With the advent of the human genome project, there is a shift in perspective in the life sciences to something called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology &quot;systems biology&quot;] in which we view living organisms or groups of organisms as systems with a number of components. The question then becomes, &quot;if I perturb the system by changing concentrations of a component, or I remove a component or I add a new component, how is that going to affect the system?

This site is being developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology for the purpose of introducing a systems biology perspective to the traditional metabolism course that is part of our one year biochemistry course sequence. Here is a proposed time line within our program. 

'''2008''' Project Begins. We are simply trying to populate the topics with links to excellent web resources and open access articles. Students will write brief summaries of each resource they identify. 

'''2009''' Project Refinements. We will re-evaluate the table of contents and reorganize it to reflect the most important content areas, adding or removing additional table of contents entries as appropriate. Students will actually write individual chapters based on the linked web resources and open access articles.

'''2010''' Working Textbook. The second draft of each chapter will be prepared and input will be solicited from the broader community of life science educators. This refinement process will continue indefinitely until either (a) metabolomics is incorporated into all existing educational materials relating to metabolism or (b) my preferred choice - online textbooks become the norm, freeing students from the cost of purchase and freeing faculty from having 1000 kg of textbooks on their shelves.

Please also view our book on [[Proteomics]].

Polish is my native language. I was born 12.07.1975. I have MA with computer science and I have LIC with psyhics My main hobbies: Science fiction, physics and computer science. I'm technical advisory engineer and I working in Włocławek. I live in Włocławek Poland, and I'm from to Poland. Before I lived in Włocławek, I lived in Bydgoszcz. I'm come from Poland.  

==My adventures with computer science==

My adventure with computer science is since 1994, when I was 1st year student computer science in Toruń. Computer science I finished study in 1999, when I writting MA on topic &quot;Windows 98&quot;, where I wrote about Win 98 tools. But IMO I'm better in Win XP than Win 98:P. Beetween 1995 - 1997 I worked as shop assistant. Next my job was job in Lexmark division between 1997-1997, when I finishing computer science. Later between 1999-2001 I worked in firm, which wrote programs. In 2001 april this firm bancruted. My next work where I worked between 2001-2003 was..teacher of computer science. In 2004 to became counsel to optics. 18.12.2004 I to became an expert in firm, where I've been working. Between days 18.12.2004 - 16.08.2005 I was an expert and consuel to Pascal. Next to I to became 01.09.2005 a member watchdog and I was secy of watchdog first to 01.03.2005, later to 23.04.2005 when  I piece to disqualification from office, but officjal I'm not member watchdog since 1st May 2005. Since 19.05.2005 to 04.02.2007 I was chief of programist-rad. Since 10th February I work as technical advisory engineer. What I would to do in my work? In my work I do as programmer C++, Pascal etc. And testing operating systems, behavior operating systems in alien milieu e.g behavior Win 98 in NT sistems. Next to in my work I do testing new technologies etc.

==About me==

My hobbies are: computer science (I've finished MA study and I've written MA about Win 98), science-fictions films, physics (I've finished LIC study with physics and I wrote LIC about optics etc.) and fantasies. In computer science my the biggest interest are operating systems, my favourite operating system is [[w:Microsoft Windows XP Professional]], which I use as my operating system. In computer science I never like network..I do not why.. And in industry we usually saids: ''To next run computer!'' (polish oryginal: ''Do ponownego uruchomienia kompa'').

{{closed|I think that the consensus is to {{keep}}, even though some people wanted it to be deleted, myself included.

This is inspired by Herby's nom above; as he says, it is merely a skeleton, with little or no content. Also, the subject matter &quot;solar system&quot; is kind of encompassed by the book on Astronomy, but that's just a footnote. --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:26, 14 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}} as a stub with (seemingly) a good framework for future expansion. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:31, 14 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}} I tend towards keep, although I hesitate a little. First off, we have an excellent book on this topic at [[Wikijunior:Solar System]], although we don't delete a book for adult readers just because we have one for children on the same topic. Also, we do have good books at [[Astronomy]] and [[Astrodynamics]], although neither of these books seems to focus enough on objects just in our solar system. I say keep it, but tag it with cleanup and expansion templates so people know it needs help. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:36, 14 January 2008 (UTC)
*&lt;s&gt;[[Image:Symbol merge vote.svg|15px]] '''Merge with [[Astronomy]]''' - Otherwise {{del}} the rest of the pages, merging as many substantial opening comments as possible into [[Astronomy]] as well. I ''might'' be able to organize the book into a hand-crafted  solar system section for [[Astronomy]]. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 22:30, 15 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;{{del}}After reading other comments I am for a delete. [[Volcanoes]], another work of [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]], was almost entirely deleted due to the fact that it was just a framework, and I think that Mike was right to delete all but the intro page. I still have not finished rescuing the book from its &quot;VFD pit&quot; into a &quot;completed&quot; book (and Mike is helping me too). I attribute the same conditions to this book, although I am willing to, after deletion, change it into a book not unlike [[Volcanoes]]. Cheers, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 01:46, 24 January 2008 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - While in its current form it seems to be incredibly shallow, and is even a shadow of the very excellent Wikijunior Solar System book, there is a need for a Solar System book on Wikibooks.  My only concern about making an adult-level Wikibook about the Solar System (or perhaps renamed to a more adult sounding [[Planetary Science]]) is that it would be difficult in the current format to beat the content about the Solar System on Wikipedia.  Please, oh please, oh please don't merge this into the monstrosity of the [[Astronomy]] Wikibook.  I nominated that book (Astronomy) for a VfD because it became the dumping ground for a whole bunch of very disconnected and irrelevant content by several mergists that has taken ''years of work'' to try and do something of a clean up from even the previous awful state of that book.  Let's not destroy a good book with inferior content.  If there is a rationale for deleting this book, it is because it is a macropedia and as such is against the terms of [[WB:WIW]].  Even then, I've seen stubby books that are this awful get cleaned up by somebody with strong determination and a vision.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 11:53, 16 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{del}} - another abandoned shell of an idea. As RH points out, Wikijunior already has better than this. If someone shows an interest in building an &quot;adult&quot; book (sounds risqué) on the solar system or planetary science, I'm sure they'll not be hampered by the loss of this effort.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An inclusive definition for interactive media is illusive if not impossible to write.  Interactivity in media can be described by degree, but not by a single, all-encompassing definition.  Interactive media has been called a &quot;hybrid media technology&quot; because it can combine any format (print, web, disc, video, audio, virtual reality scene, PDF, web link, etc.) that allow users to respond to content. 


Inteactive media is evolving at a faster rate than most other aspects of new technology and multisensory experimentation is bringing startling new considerations into the multimedia mix.  Movies an audience can taste, touch, see, hear and feel are not science fiction.  User created content on Youtube is a manifestation of people's thirst for interactivity, as that web site gives users ultimate control over content by allowing them to create it themselves.

It's not just access that makes multimedia powerful, but the control over content given to users. Interactive Media authoring programs enable the user to manipulate the materials through linking, sorting, searching and annotating activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">    P2P networking is a networking style that does not need the use of a centralized server to share files between computers. This style of networking means that an individual does not need to rent server space to share files with other people on the internet. Ethically and morally, this style of networking tends more towards pirating of anything that is on a person’s computer. It also allows for the passing of viruses. In the eyes of the law, the passing of files over P2P networks that were not bought by the person holding the file, is illegal, but it is very hard for the authorities to track downloads over such networks.

     Another paradigm shift that one believes is the most devastating of all is the ability to deceive the general public with editing software.  Since the invention of programs like Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Adobe Audition, and Apple Logic Pro it’s a fairly simple process to take a breaking news story and edit out key parts of the broadcast to make it appear as though something didn’t happen the did or take what a person said out of context.  It happens frequently in news stories and it used as a way to spice up a dull story or to try to start some controversy.  Whatever the reason, this shift from explaining the news just as it happens to spicing up the news for the sake of ratings is a sad move for our culture and society.  It not only doesn’t keep citizens accurately informed but also ruins reputations and could potentially destroy a person’s creditability.

     On the more computer tech 'savvy' side of multimedia, a paradigm that affected the actual hardwre and computing capabilities which enable multitudes of projects to be done or even conceived, is that of virtualization.
     Today’s powerful x86 computer hardware was originally designed to run only a single operating system and a single application, but virtualization breaks that bond, making it possible to run multiple operating systems and multiple applications on the same computer at the same time, increasing the utilization and flexibility of hardware.
     Virtualization lets you transform hardware into software. Use software such as VMware ESX Server to transform or “virtualize” the hardware resources of an x86-based computer—including the CPU, RAM, hard disk and network controller—to create a fully functional virtual machine that can run its own operating system and applications just like a “real” computer. Multiple virtual machines share hardware resources without interfering with each other so that you can safely run several operating systems and applications at the same time on a single computer.
     Possibilities of this technology are practically limitless and can be applied to all areas, not just multimedia. Many schools and universities are switching to this technology because it is cheaper and also much more hardware efficient.
     Smart Drugs: Better Performance Through Biochemistry- In the future, people will take medicine designed not only to prevent, but also to enhance their bodies. According to futurist Dr. James Canton (founder of the think tank Institute for Global Futures), more than half of all Americans are currently using some kind of drug. Over 33% of these individuals take medication with the express purpose of altering their moods or alleviating such things as stress and depression. According to the Philips Health Index, an estimated 15-25% of people take these mentality-shifting drugs (such as Prozac) with the intent to create a heightened sense of alertness and increased performance on the job. Imagine a time when you may find yourself at a competitive disadvantage if you choose not to take enhancement mediation.
The Extreme Future, James Canton, pg. 141-143

      <text xml:space="preserve">On-line social networking is a web phenomenon almost beyond compare.  At least ten million people have dated on-line as of the beginning of 2008 and the average Myspace site is getting forty hits per day.  

If a large part of success is &quot;all about who you know&quot;, is on-line social networking the most effective way to build a sphere of friends?  Are Facebook and Myspace trends that have reshaped the course of social inteaction, or just a total waste of time?

      <text xml:space="preserve">When a video posted on Youtube gets twice the viewing audience as a nationally syndicated TV sitcom show you can be sure that the big networks are paying attention to viral media.  It costs about $2.5 million dollars an episode to produce one thirty segment of a television series and it typically takes most of a year to build an audience.  A back yard video shot on a $600 digital video camera should not be able to generate more viewers than the networks can get throughout an entire season - but they are.  

What makes media go viral (a video, a new band, a photo, a web site, etc.)?  Should people who want to communicate learn how to infect the public with a media virus or treat the whole idea like a plague?

      <text xml:space="preserve">For several years, media researchers have demonstrated movies that you can taste, smell, and feel.  Multimedia developement indicates that people crave any experience that more closely resembles their real-world (TV instead of radio, color TV instead of black and white, high def. TV over standard definition TV, etc.).  

Is multisensory multimedia inevitable?  Will it replace or supplement books and other conventional media?  When will it become available for general consumption at an affordable price?  If completely immersive multisensory multimedia becomes common place, what are the implications for you and the rest of society?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Video games might be the most commonly recognized virtual experience and they become more realistic with each new release.  Second Life has become an on-line web phenomenon that attracts a million unique visitors every week.  Avitars (a user's alter-ego digital stand-in on the web) populate and ever growing world of virtual environments.  The military trains soldiers in a game-like device that turns people into track-balls in order to allow them to navigate an infinite landscape. http://www.virtusphere.com/


&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:TrainingSphere.jpg|left|200px]] --&gt;

What are some potential applications for virtual experiences designed for entertainment, education, marketing, political messages, and other purposes?


All of us have experienced virtual reality to one extent or another. When we become engrossed in a movie or a video game, we enter into a virtual world. For a brief period of time, we lose awareness of the world outside and our consciousness becomes focused on the sounds and images presented on the screen. However, virtual reality and immersive media is not solely reserved for games or media of the such, but it can AND has also been applied in fields such as psychology.

Numerous research in the past 7 years has been dedicated to the use of virtual reality in therapy, especially in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders encountered in clinical practice, if not the most common. Standard treatment consists of psychotropic medication and psychotherapeutic interventions. A key psychotherapeutic intervention is exposure therapy. Exposure can be either imaginal, by having the patient imagine a particular scene (for instance, a traumatic war experience), or in vivo (for instance, having a patient who is afraid of flying go to an airport, watch planes take off, sit in an airplane seat, etc.).

A virtual exposure may have advantages over both imaginal and in vivo exposure. It may be superior to imaginal exposure in that it is much more life-like and therefore might be more effective. At the same time, it has many potential advantages over in vivo exposure. It is generally much less costly; it saves public embarrassment; it can be stopped if the symptoms get overwhelming. In addition, the key aspects can be repeated over and over; for instance, if someone has a fear of flying, and the therapist identifies that the take-off is the anxiety provoking aspect of flying, a virtual take-off can be replayed over and over again. Physiological monitoring of data such as heart or respiration rate is much easier to achieve during virtual than in vivo exposure. Finally, many situations that one would not replay, such as war trauma or sexual assault, can be addressed through the safety of virtual reality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In his best seller &quot;The World is Flat&quot;, Thomas Friedman states that &quot;anything that can be defined by a set of procedures or formulas, and anything that can be accomplished in cheaper in another country will be outsourced - if it hasn't happened already&quot;.  There are things we can do to prepare ourselves for this outsourcing of jobs is affecting every profession and the &quot;flattening&quot; of our world.  

If we can learn to think like &quot;designers&quot;, rather than piggy banks for information we safeguard our own futures.  With the advent of the internet, portable devices and powerful search engines, piggy bank employees are being outsourced.  There is no indication that artificial intelligence, or any other technology, will ever be able to compete with the creative intelligence of humans.  For self preservation, how do we cultivate our own creative potential to a marketable level?

As a result of outsourcing and other disruptive trends in modern society, it will be important to realize what it takes to be successful in the future job market. In the past, talented individuals who were willing to work hard and be honest would end up on top. That will change. From now on, it will be the rule breakers and the innovators, the creative people who can figure out new ways to write the rules who will be successful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the Bible, the book of Genesis says that God made man so he would have someone to fellowship and interact with.  It also says that people are made in God's image.  Perhaps this helps explain why people are so much more compulsive about interactive media than conventional, traiditional, less interactive media (for about five years now, blockbuster video games have made more money than all of the major films combined).   

Perhaps the ultimate interactive media is that which an audience creates themselves.  Will user generated content replace the media produced by &quot;professionals&quot;?  Why does Youtube overwhelm network television shows in viewership?  Isn't quality and professional experience important any more?  Why do people watch grainy, stupid videos on Youtube?  Will they continue to do so, or is this just a brief interlude of bad taste?

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the early 21'st century, a new arena began emerging in technology. The integration of multiple functions that have in the past been confined to individual devices, into a single device. Simply put, one gadget that can perform the job of multiple devices. Until recently, the only machine capble of handling such tasks was the personal computer and computing technology. However, as more and more advances in the technological field were pioneered, items like CD/MP3/DVD players, PDA's and even camera phones began to emerge. Today, such devices are commonplace and not so much a marvel as before. Almost all cellular phones made today have some multi-tasking component integrated into their functionality, with more and more being added each year. Perfect examples of these advanced phones would be the p990, from (Sony Ericsson), which along with the Motorolas Blackberry Phone, was one of the very first PDA/Camera/MP3/Internet devices on the commercial market in the US. Of course, advancements such as these were already made in countries like Japan and Europe, thus are not so much of a surprise to their cultures. However, in the US, technology such as this is still relatively new and extremely costly as well, which is one of the few disadvantages to such devices. 

Is the iPhone a music player, video viewer, web browser, GPS, telephone or PDA?  The Apple company would answer &quot;yes&quot;.

Where will the convergence of media and media management devices (and perhaps everything in society) end?  What else can be &quot;converged&quot; after the iPhone?  Why are things converging?  What, in our society, has not converged and probably never should?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unless one purchases and uses only a single body and the kit lens, one's equipment is not a DSLR ''camera'', but a DSLR ''system'', meaning a compatible set of bodies, lenses, and accessories. Indeed, SLR and DSLR bodies in the same system can be interchanged (notably, the same lenses can be used). However, bodies from one system (e.g. Canon EOS) cannot generally be used with lenses from another system (e.g. Nikon F-mount), which becomes a major concern if one has a significant investment in lenses.

Because components are not interchangeable between systems, photographers typically choose one system and remain with it for as long as possible. Few consider owning multiple systems to be economical and switching between systems often entails considerable expense. 

The key consideration in selecting a system is the lenses and bodies that one expects to use in future, typically over a 10-30 year time frame: one can expect to acquire additional lenses, and periodically upgrade the body.

==Canon and Nikon==
The two leading DSLR systems are Canon and Nikon, or more properly the [[w:Canon EOS|Canon EOS]] system with [[w:Canon EF lens mount|Canon EF-mount]] and the [[w:Nikon F-mount|Nikon F-mount]] system, referring to the lens systems. There are other brands, detailed below, but Canon and Nikon are the preeminent systems, with combined market share of about 89%. While there are significant differences, discussed at [[../Canon and Nikon|Canon and Nikon]], they are both widely respected and widely used.

Canon and Nikon have ''broad ranges'' of ''lenses'' and ''accessories,'' and extensive support, so one can easily:
* rent lenses for them,
* purchase components and get repairs, and
* resell equipment in a large market.

==Other brands==
Other brands of DSLRs include:
* Fujifilm
* Kodak
* Leica
* Olympus
* Panasonic
* Pentax : [[w:Pentax K mount|Pentax K mount]] ([http://photo.net/equipment/pentax/ photo.net]) ([http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Pentax/ dpreview.com])
* Sigma (notable for using the [[w:Foveon X3 sensor|Foveon X3 sensor]])
* Sony (was Konica Minolta) : Sony Alpha mount ([http://photo.net/equipment/sony/ photo.net]) ([http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Sony/ dpreview.com])
They use [[w:Lenses for SLR and DSLR cameras#Lens mounts|various lens mounts]], and have much smaller selections of lenses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kenrockwell.com/olympus/lenses.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Why use another brand?===
If you are building a new system, any of the major manufacturers can be considered a good choice. Factors to consider would be:

;Legacy glass: If you have a large collection of older lenses, a DSLR from the same manufacturer may allow you to continue to use them.
;Features: Different manufacturers take different approaches to the same issues, and you may find one suits you better than the others. An example would be image stabilisation – some makers have chosen to include it as an in-body option, which thus applies to all lenses, while others build stabilising mechanics into the lenses themselves.
;Price: Naturally, the perceived price to performance ratio will be a major consideration for most buyers.

== Дарсан хIума (Lesson Material) ==
In these lessons, we will learn how to greet another person, ask how they are feeling, and ask what their names are. We will also be able to tell what our names are and engage in simple conversation.

=== Маршалла хаттар (Greetings) ===
&lt;small&gt;''Note that the phonetics which are written out for pronunciaton follow English pronunciation rules. The letter '''ä''' will represent the palochka, allowing you to make the '''I''' sound you have learnt in the [[Chechen/Alphabet|Alphabet lesson]]. This is again temporary, try to read the Cyrillic alphabet instead of the phonetics.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;big&gt; '''Notes''' &lt;/big&gt;
** The greetings, &lt;big&gt;'''Ассаламу Iалайкум'''&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;'''Салам'''&lt;/big&gt;, along with their replies, &lt;big&gt;'''Ва Iалайкум ассалам'''&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;'''Ва салам'''&lt;/big&gt;, are derived from the religion of Islam, and borrowed from Arabic. This is a very special greeting to give to a Chechen, especially if you are not Chechen or Muslim. This literally means ''Peace be upon you'', and can be found in many other languages that have had or still have a strong Islamic influence. Again, you do not have to be Muslim to say this greeting.
** In Chechen, like many European languages, there are two ways to address a person. There is a singular and plural form (Like in English saying ''you'' and ''you all''), then there is also a familiar form and polite form. We have encountered these in the greetings &lt;big&gt;'''Маршалла ду шугьа'''&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;'''хьоьга'''&lt;/big&gt;. The familiar form, &lt;big&gt;'''хьоьга'''&lt;/big&gt;, is also the same as the singular form, and is used when talking to people you know well or if you are in a younger generation, used amongst people around your age, or talking to your pet dog or cat. The polite form, &lt;big&gt;'''шугьа'''&lt;/big&gt;, is used when speaking to strangers, teachers, in business, or people of higher status in the social class. It is also used when talking to more than one person. When in doubt, use the polite form. 
** You probably have been either baffled or &quot;laughing&quot; at the way to say ''yes'' and ''no'' in Chechen. Indeed, you have read the pronunciation correctly. To say yes in Chechen, it is a quick '''Ha''' sound but cut it short at the end. To get the sound, try to just blow out air and whilst your mouth is open, stop your breath from both your nose and mouth. Do this really fast and you have just said ''Yes'' in Chechen. 
** To say ''no'' in Chechen, it is a little different than ''yes'' and a bit softer. If you speak ''sarcasm'', all you have to do is give a fake laugh, (ha ha), but hold the first ''ha'' longer than the second. You should realise too that luckily Chechen is not a language to be spoken fast like French, Spanish, or even English. Each word needs to be said clearly in order to be understood. Also realise that Chechens are not used to hearing foreigners speak their language, so you need to really emphasise these sounds that sound weird to us English speakers in order to be understood. So try it again bearing this in mind, ''Haa-ha''. 

&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt; At this point, you might feel frustrated with this new starting vocabulary and the odd sounds of Chechen. It is important to approach language learning in a positive way, and enjoy it. If you feel frustrated, take a deep breath, take a break, and come back to it. The more you practise and look at something, the more it will become natural. Chechen is not like any language you have probably heard of, so of course it will be different, but remember, the results can be very rewarding. And of course, this is a self teaching course, so go at your own pace. You don't have to go on to the next section or lessons until you feel comfortable! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Грамматика (Grammar) ==
Chechen grammar is extremely complicated for [[:w:Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language speakers. There are 8 grammatical cases (if you are unfamiliar with a case system, don't worry, we will cover it in the future lessons). This means that a word will change form or add a suffix depending on its action in the sentence. As of now, we will focus on the more spoken aspect of Chechen whilst covering the basic essential parts of the [[:w:grammar|grammar]].

=== ЦIерметдешнаш (Pronouns) ===
[[:W:Pronouns|Pronouns]] are nouns which substitute other nouns in a certain phrase or sentence. For example, in English pronouns are ''I, you, he, she, it''. In Chechen they are:

&lt;center&gt;
{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Chechen !!width=&quot;20px&quot;| !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Chechen
|-
| I || Со || || We || Тхо, Вай &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| You || Хьо || || You (plural) || Шу
|-
| He, She, it ||  Иза || || They || Уьш
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

* In Chechen there are two ways to say '''We'''. These forms are called ''Inclusive'' and ''Exclusive''. The inclusive form, &lt;big&gt;'''Вай'''&lt;/big&gt;, (sometimes pronounced ''vay'' depending on the dialect) is used when you are including the listener. (For example: We, both you and me, will go to the store). The exclusive form, &lt;big&gt;'''Тхо'''&lt;/big&gt;, is used when you are referring to a group which does not include the listener. (For example: We, my friend and I, are going to the store).

* Note that in Chechen, pronouns are never capitalised unless of course they are starting the sentence. (In English, we always capitalise ''I'' in the sentence. Like most European languages, we do not capitalise '''cо''' in Chechen).

=== Классаш и хоттам (Classes and the copula) ===
Now that we have learnt the pronouns, we can start building our first Chechen sentences. Before we get into constructing our basic sentences, we need to cover some explanations first in English.

'''The Class System''' is something unique in the Chechen language. Instead of having each word fall into a gender category such as ''masculine, feminine,'' or ''neuter'', Chechen words each belong to a specific class. These determine the grammatical course of the other words in the sentence, especially certain important verbs. There are 6 classes in Chechen, which we can remember as ''V Y D Y B B'' &quot;(to help you remember the order: vyu dyubb)&quot; or '''В Ю Д Ю Б Б'''. The good part of this class system is that the chart is very easy to memorise and figure out ways to remember it. The bad part is that there isn't really any pattern to determine the class of inanimate objects.

Let's start with the first 2 classes. These are the easier ones to learn, because they actually do have a similar gender attribute found in languages like English and Finnish. This aspect is called ''natural gender''. Meaning if you are talking about a boy, this boy is obviously masculine, along with ''uncle, grandfather, man, an American man'' and so on. These words fall into '''Class 1 (V - В)'''. If the word refers to a woman, such as ''wife, girl, aunt, a British woman'', these words fall into '''Class 2 (Y - Ю)'''.

But what does this mean? These will make the Chechen copula, ''to be''. A copula is just a technical linguistic word for a verb. In other words, we are now learning the way to make sentences like ''I am a boy, he is a man, she is a girl'' and so on. The words ''am, is,'' and ''are'' will go at the end of the sentence, just like any other verb in Chechen. So you will wind up saying ''I boy am, he man is, she girl is''. And of course these words will change appropriately to the class.

Now let's take a look at how to say ''am, is,'' and ''are'' in Chechen for the first two classes. (Note: This is called conjugating a verb).


&lt;center&gt;
{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Pronoun !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Class 1 &lt;/br&gt; &lt;small&gt;masculine&lt;/small&gt; !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Class 2 &lt;/br&gt; &lt;small&gt;feminine&lt;/small&gt; 
|-
| со || ву || ю 
|-
| хьо || ву || ю 
|-
| иза || ву || ю 
|-
| тхо || ду || ду 
|-
| шу || ду || ду 
|-
| уьш || бу || бу 
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

We can look at this chart and easily master it. Just remember in the singular (I, you, he, she, it) that '''ву''' always refers to masculine and '''ю''' always refers to feminine. In the plural, the copula is the same for both classes. We and the plural form of You both use '''ду''' and They use '''бу'''. That it! You have just mastered your first 2 classes of Chechen! Now let's use them and make our sentences!

=== Нохчийн предложни (The Chechen Sentence) ===
The sentence order in Chechen is '''Subject + Object/Predicate + Verb''' (SOV), similar to Korean and Japanese. What does this mean? Take note of the following English examples of sentence structure:
&lt;p&gt;
'''English:''' I am a boy, and she is a girl.&lt;/br&gt;
'''Chechen:''' I boy am, and she girl is.
&lt;p&gt;
This will take some time to get used to. Just keep practising! But now let's start making some sentences in Chechen. Look at the examples if you have difficulty understand the explanations, some people can just learn a language by seeing examples&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
'''Со кIант ву''' - I am a boy &lt;/br&gt;
'''Иза кIант ву''' - He is a boy &lt;/br&gt;
'''Иза йоI ю''' - She is a girl &lt;/br&gt;
'''Хьо зуда ю''' - You are a woman &lt;/br&gt;
'''Со кIант ву a хьо йоI ю''' - I am a boy and you are a girl
&lt;p&gt;
Why don't you try a few out yourself? How would you say, &quot;''He is a man?''&quot; Now translate this sentence from Chechen to English: &quot;''Хьо йоI ю я зуда ю? Со зуда ю.''&quot;. Yes, со кхета that these sentences are very elementary, but we start at the basics and we will build on them.

== Культура (Culture) ==
Note that sometimes the Chechen word, '''оьздангалла''' is used to mean culture, but '''культура''' is more common.

=== Ислам нохчийн маттахь (Islam in the Chechen language) ===
Ассаламу Iалайкум (assalamu alaykum!) Do you remember from this lesson what the proper response would be? Ва Iалайкум Ассалам (wa alaykum assalam!) This greeting comes from the Arabic, ''peace be upon you'', which is also the universal Islamic greeting. Chechnya is a Muslim country and the language has been welcoming influence from Arabic, the original language of the Holy Quran and also used in daily prayers. I am sure you have noticed by now the many sounds that come from Arabic are also found in the Chechen language. Besides these sounds, there are a few phrases that you will commonly hear when listening to Chechens speak their language.

Besides the Islamic greeting, Assalamu alaykum, there are a few others you might encounter, such as '''ЛаилахIа иллаАллахIа''', ''laa illaha illallah''. This means &quot;there is no god but Allah&quot;. '''АллахIа''', pronounced ''Allah'', is the Arabic word for the monotheistic God. Chechens might also use the word Дала or Дела as well to refer to God, but АллахIа is more common. Another common Islamic phrase would be '''ИншАллахIа''', ''inshallah'', which literally means &quot;God willing&quot;. Some words like the word for thank you, '''баркалла''', have totally integrated into the Chechen language and have derived from the Arabic. In a later lesson, we will learn religious vocabulary and more about religion in Chechnya, but for now, it is a good time to understand the Islamic influence on the Chechen people and their beautiful language.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt; '''Дика ду! Молодец!''', you have done well so far. How do you like Chechen now? Take a break, review what you have learnt, then move on and read a little about Chechen culture and do the exercises. When you are walking in town, in a store, or whatever the place may be around people, try saying to yourself (not outloud, unless you want people staring at you) these simple sentences, like ''He is a boy, and he is a man''. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Clairvoyance/Remote Viewing'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

'''Clairvoyance''' and '''remote viewing''' refer to the same phenomenon- the ability for one person to see something, occurring at that exact moment, through means other than the five senses. Along with telepathy, it is one of the two major forms of Anomalous Cognition (gaining information without the five senses). The existence of this phenomenon has never been scientifically proven.

The term ''clairvoyance'' is often differentiated by the fact that it does not occur in a controlled environment. This leads to even more difficulty in ascertaining its existence.

&lt;noinclude&gt;==Experimentation==&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;includeonly&gt;===Experimentation===&lt;/includeonly&gt;

In the early 1970s, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and later the U.S. Air Force, began funding experiments to test the existence of remote viewing. It lasted until the mid 1990s. At that point, the data was analyzed. Some test subjects had scored above simple chance, however, it was not by a great deal- 10 to 15%. Additionally, the methods of testing were called into question. Ultimately, no consensus could be reached as to whether remote viewing existed, and it remains unproven.

== [[Cookbook:Monte Cristo Sandwich]] ==

G'day, welcome to the Cookbook. Thanks for adding your recipe. I have just formatted it to look like the other recipes in our collection - take a look at it now to see what I mean. You can read about how the Cookbook works [[Cookbook:Policy|here]], and talk with other Cookbook contributors [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|here]]. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:39, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

== Monte Cristo? ==

A Monte Cristo doesn't neccesarily have to use ham, cheese, etc. I've seen chefs do a lot of different sandwiches and they still call them Monte Cristo sandwiches. I thought a Monte Cristo sandwich was any sandwich that was battered in egg. So does Bobby Flay, Wolfgang Puck, Gordon Ramsay, Morimoto, Alton Brown, Rachael Ray, Sandra Lee, Tyler Florence, Paula Deen, etc. So could I change it?

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Diffusion===

If you put a dye pill in a glass of water, it will start out concentrated in one place, but as the atoms of water move around by Brownian motion they knock the atoms of dye around until it spreads throughout the glass coloring the water evenly. This property of matter is called DIFFUSION.


===Osmosis and cells===
Osmosis is something that all cells must learn to deal with. Different cells use different strategies to avoid being damaged by osmotic pressure.

An animal cell in a hypotonic solution is in danger of lysis (breaking apart) because the water will flow into the cell making it bulge and expand.
A cell in a hypertonic solution will shrivel and lose water (plasmolyze).

[[Image:Erythrozyten_und_Osmotischer_Druck.svg|450px]]


Plant cells have a cell wall which prevents lysis when they are in a hypotonic solution. The cells expand until they hit the cell wall and then get no bigger. This is why we can put a flower in a glass of water without worrying about the cells bursting.

Plant cells, however, can plasmolyse. If you put a plant into salt water the cells will shrivel as water rushes out of the cells which have now become a hypotonic solution. Plant cells are not designed to work under such conditions, and so most plants will die if you try to grow them in salt water.

==Organelles==

Eukaryotic cells contain many substructures called '''organelles'''. These little organs perform different functions inside the cell.


====Nucleus====
[[Image:Diagram_human_cell_nucleus.svg|thumb|200px|right|nucleus]]
The largest organelle is the '''nucleus'''. This is where the information used to run the cell is found.

A dark spot inside a nucleus is called a ''nucleolus'' and this is thought to be the location where ribosomal RNA (ribonucleic acid) is made. Some cells have nucleoli and some cells do not.

The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane. The membrane contains holes called ''nuclear pores'' that are used to transport large objects ( such as ribosomes) out of the nucleus.

====The endomembrane system====
[[Image:Endomembrane_system_diagram_en.svg|left|350px]]
The nucleus works together with a group of organelles that make up what is called the endomembrane system. They are the factories which build the cell.

'''Ribosomes''' are small structures found in the cytoplasm which make proteins. When proteins must be inserted into a membrane, or when they must be secreted, then the ribosome will attach to a structure called the '''rough endoplasmic reticulum''' where the protein will be made. ( Reticulum means a net.)

The rough endoplasmic reticulum is rough because of the ribosomes on its surface. Proteins made here will travel in small bubbles called ''vesicles'' to another organelle called the '''Golgi apparatus''' where they are sorted, assembled into larger structures, and sent to different parts of the cell.

The Golgi makes '''lysosomes''' which contain digestive enzymes for breaking down food. It also assembles structures that will end up in the plasma membrane.

The '''smooth endoplasmic reticulum''' does not contain ribosomes. It is thought to be the site of many chemical processes including the synthesis of lipids.

====Vesicles====
Small round bubbles found in a cell are called '''vesicles'''. Some vesicles are simply molecules in transit such as from the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, or from the Golgi to the plasma membrane.

Others have special functions such as ''lysosomes'' which contain digestive fluids or ''peroxisomes'' that contain chemicals to breakdown harmful oxidants in the cell.

''Secretory vesicles'' are used to store chemicals that will be secreted from the cell. A vesicle that is filled with water is called a vacuole. Plants for example have large vacuoles in the center of the cell.

====Mitochondria====
[[Image:MitoChondria.jpg|right|300px]]

The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. It produces high energy molecules called ''ATP'' that are used throughout the cell to drive chemical reactions. Mitochondria are the site of aerobic respiration where sugar is broken down in the presence of oxygen to make energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a bit of an experiment, but I hope that we will be able to use a template to set up assignments easily. We have a format from Edexcel and dropping the information into the form would be easier than writing a whole form each time.

* [[Help:Templates]] - Wikibooks' help page for templates.
* [[Template:BTECNatAppSciAssignment]] - the template itself.

This is what the template looks like when it's used:

&lt;nowiki&gt;|Task5=&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;|Deadline5=&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;|Deadline6=&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;|Resources=}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the relevant page.

This allows up to six criteria and six tasks per assignment. Are more required? If any are left blank, then the template ignores them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When the Toppy starts up with no channels (out of the box, or after a Factory Reset) it will only show the Main Menu.  In this situation you to go to the Service Search item of the Installation Menu and perform a search for channels.  You can use the slow Auto search, or a much better [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Quick Channel Scan|quick manual scan]].

If you have TAPs installed you might need to prevent them loading in this state.  To do this, press and hold down the '0' button on the remote while the Toppy is starting up.

If you are preparing to do a Factory Reset then either do a channel scan immediately afterwards (before rebooting), or disable all TAPs first using something like TAPCommander.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Due to bugs in the EPG data collection, if the Toppy is left on for a long time it will run out of free slots for new data and there may be gaps, duplicate entries or whole missing channels.  Currently, the simplest solution is to regularly switch the Toppy into standby (which helps save electricity, too).  (Previous concerns about missing recordings when in standby have been addressed by fixes to the [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Timers Bug|Timers Bug]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a problem with the firmware image in flash memory.  You need to [http://www.toppy.org.uk/newusers/manual6a.php re-flash the firmware] using one of the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/newusers/manual5.php Topfield utilities], or one of the tools listed below.  To do this you need to have a reliable USB (or serial) connection to the Toppy and you need to prepare the process on the PC/Mac while the Toppy is off, then switch it out of standby so the Boot Loader can perform the firmware flash (this &quot;failsafe&quot; mechanism should always be available).  There are known issues when power saving is enabled on USB ports (so disable this feature) and when using the Topfield USB driver under Vista.  The Toppy's Boot Loader presents only a small &quot;window of opportunity&quot; for connecting to the PC/Mac, so if it doesn't work first time, try again.

* [http://www.toppy.org.uk/downloads/Topfield_Windows_Applications_Setup_1.0.4.zip TFDN_USB] is the Topfield utility for downloading firmwares to the Toppy over USB.  (TFD_Down is the serial version.)

* [http://www.topfield.cc/files/Firebird/VegaPack.zip VegaPack] and [http://www.topfield-sat.de/SVS-WEB/topset_en.html TopSet] can also do this, as well as other useful things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Auto scan is quite slow since it has to cover the whole range of UHF channels.   Since there are only 6 [http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/dtt/dtt.cgi?reg=UK&amp;by=mux multiplexes (or muxes)] on Freeview it is much quicker to plug in your corresponding 6 local UHF channel numbers into a Manual scan.  This (after a Factory Reset) will also eliminate the chance of (poor quality) duplicates being picked up from other nearby transmitters, which can cause grief to TAPs like MyStuff.

* Find your local transmitter on the [http://dtg.org.uk/retailer/transmitters.html DTG Transmitters] page or do a search on the [http://www.wolfbane.com/cgi-bin/tvd.exe Wolfbane Reception Predictor].

* Note down the 6 different UHF channels for muxes 1, 2, A, B, C and D.

* Enter these channels one at a time into a Manual search (Installation menu, Service Search item, change the search type to Manual). It is possible that the number range available doesn't cover the channel, effectively stopping you from putting in the channel number. In this case ... i dont know what you can do.

If you're just trying to update to incorporate the latest [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Freeview Shuffle|Freeview channel shuffle]] then you might be able to just [[Topfield 5800/Troubleshooting/Delete Channel|delete the old/moved channels]] and scan just the particular muxes that have the new channel data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because you can (normally) copy parts of a recording during playback, the Toppy reserves one of the two recording slots for this purpose, so you can normally record only one other programme during playback.  Therefore, to start a second recording it must interrupt your viewing (with a [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Check Your Reservation|&quot;CYR&quot; prompt]]) and stop the playback.  But this playback can ''always'' be resumed immediately (and the system helpfully sets a bookmark to help you do this).  

If you are not bothered about copying recordings then the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/patches.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[Xp]&amp;nbsp;PlayNoCYR firmware patch&lt;/nowiki&gt;] will eliminate the interruptions during playback (with the side-effect of preventing copying of recordings).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;Check Your Reservation&quot; (or &quot;CYR&quot;) prompt is a [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Confusing Text|confusing bit of text]] asking permission to change what's currently being viewed in order to start a second recording.  This is sometimes '''necessary''' because the Toppy only has [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Twin_Tuner|two tuners]], so in order to make a second recording it may have to change the tuner being used for the currently viewed channel.  If you value your choice of recordings then the correct answer is &quot;Yes&quot; to this prompt (or press Exit, or let it time out), which will cause the channel to be changed and the second recording will be started.  If you choose &quot;No&quot; then the second recording will be cancelled.

However, there are bugs/features which mean that this message may interrupt your viewing for no good reason (sometimes you may find you can immediately resume what you were watching after choosing the &quot;Yes&quot; option).  The [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/patches.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[Xp]&amp;nbsp;PlayNoCYR and [Xw]&amp;nbsp;WatchNoCYR firmware patches&lt;/nowiki&gt;] fix these issues, leaving the CYR prompt to only those times when it is actually necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most common cause of a missed recording is when a lot of timers are set and stored in a &quot;bad&quot; order within the Toppy — a bug causes the wrong information to be communicated to the wakeup system.  This is fixed by the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/patches.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[T]&amp;nbsp;(or [T2])&amp;nbsp;Timer firmware patch&lt;/nowiki&gt;].

Another possibility is a power cut when the Toppy was in standby.  In this case, the Toppy will (ordinarily) stay in standby when the power is restored.  But it is likely that the Front Display will have lost the time and be reset to &quot;00:00&quot; at a date in the past.  So it will not be able to wake the Toppy up at the correct time for the next recording.  This issue can be fixed by the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/patches.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[P]&amp;nbsp;PowerRestore firmware patch&lt;/nowiki&gt;] which will cause the Toppy to turn itself on when the power is restored (and it will then set its clock properly, so future timer recordings will work).

Other causes are a crash (for various reasons, including a rogue TAP) or when the [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Front Display|Front Display gets confused]].  Both should be signalled by the &quot;Four Flashing Dots of Doom&quot; on the Front Display.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes the connection to the Front Display can be lost and this usually shows itself by the &quot;Four Flashing Dots of Doom&quot; when turning the Toppy off, or by the Front Display continuing to show the time (e.g. &quot;08:34&quot;) instead of the channel number (e.g. &quot;P001&quot;) when turned on.  The Toppy will also not wake itself from standby to do recordings when it is in this state.

This can be remedied by turning the Toppy off at the mains for about 20 seconds, so that all power to the Front Display is lost and it will be reset.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The USB connection is limited by the hardware to much less than the theoretical maximum of USB2.0, but various inefficiencies in firmware also reduce the speed.  One of the most significant problems is remedied by the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/patches.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[U]&amp;nbsp;USBAccelerator firmware patch&lt;/nowiki&gt;] which speeds up downloads from the Toppy enormously (note that this also requires use an updated .dll on the PC, or compatible tools).  In a similar way, the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/patches.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[Uu]&amp;nbsp;USBUpload firmware patch&lt;/nowiki&gt;] can help improve upload speed to the Toppy.

Other factors that can affect the USB speed is the quality and length of the cable being used.  If possible, try different cables to help diagnose this, and avoid very long cables unless they are good quality and &quot;active&quot; (powered).

When using Altair software to transfer files, it has a faster &quot;Turbo&quot; mode. This mode disables the remote control; if a programme or recording is running it will continue, but cannot be changed until the transfer completes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;LOAD&quot; message in the Front Display is set by the special aXeL extension.  If the display does not change to &quot;RUN&quot; then there is a problem with the way the normal firmware has been extended to accommodate aXeL.  You will need to re-flash your firmware using the [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Failsafe|failsafe mechanism]].  The easiest (and safest) way to apply aXeL is to use [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/hdfw.html HDFW] (and forget all about faffing with &quot;extending&quot; firmwares).

: All you have to do to rename the page is move it to a new location (see the move tab up at the top).  I would have taken care of it myself, but I don't know if the new name should be &quot;Chokladboll&quot; or &quot;Swedish Chokladboll&quot;.  Your call. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:08, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

:: The move tab isn't visible for me for some reason. Anyway, I personally think &quot;Chokladboll&quot; would the appropriate name, and since both the english and swedish wikipedia name it just that it would only be appropriate if this recipe had the same name. --[[User:Krutbulle|Krutbulle]] ([[User talk:Krutbulle|talk]]) 11:23, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

:::You will get a move tab soon, once your account is confirmed. I have gone ahead and renamed the page. '''[[User:Majorly|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Majorly&lt;/span&gt;]]''' (''[[User talk:Majorly|talk]]'') 11:29, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

== Coffee ==

Could you add milk instead of coffee or something? Coffee's pretty gross to me.
:The coffee is in a small amount, and only really serves to enhance the flavour of the cocoa (it is often used for this purpose in desserts). I'd be surprised if you can taste the coffee in the chokladboll. That said, if you really don't want to add coffee, using milk will still make a delicious ball. [[User:Wikidsoup|Wikidsoup]] ([[User talk:Wikidsoup|talk]]) 22:40, 4 April 2008 (UTC)
::I wouldn't recommend removing the coffee: it does add important taste, but it really doesn't taste coffee (unless you use too much of it). [[User:Ran4|Ran4]] ([[User talk:Ran4|talk]]) 08:47, 22 July 2010 (UTC)
:::You could try replacing the coffee with (e.g.) rum essence, orange juice etc. [[User:ChrisHodgesUK|ChrisHodgesUK]] ([[User talk:ChrisHodgesUK|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ChrisHodgesUK|contribs]]) 13:21, 16 April 2013 (UTC)

== Unable to Roll ==

Before adding the coffee and vanilla extract, the mixture was consistent enough to roll. After adding the coffee and vanilla extract, the mixture won't even roll. It's way too 'watery' or 'thin'. It merely gets all over my hands and either forms into a patty or sticks to the my hands. Are you sure you're supposed to put liquid into the mixture?
:Perhaps it is affected by the type of butter/margarine you are using, or is your kitchen rather warm?

== Type of sugar (etc.) ==
The recipe should probably specify the type of sugar (especially as it is measured by volume).  I used [[w:caster sugar]] but guessing that the recipe called for granulated I reduced the quantity a little, and they turned out very nice, but with a slight sugary crunch. Does anyone know the &quot;right&quot; answer?

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are stuck in a reboot cycle then the most likely problem is a rogue TAP.  Stop TAPs from loading by holding down the '0' button on the remote while the Toppy starts up.

Another possibility is a problem with corrupt Settings.  If you are stuck in a reboot cycle then you cannot do a Factory Reset but you can blank the Settings by flashing [http://www.topfield.cc/files/Firebird/EmptySettings.tfd EmptySettings] using the [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Failsafe|failsafe mechanism]].  Note that after applying this you '''must''' perform a Factory Reset as soon as possible, once the reboot cycle has been fixed.

Finally, an incompatible firmware patch may be causing the Toppy to crash as soon as it starts up.  Re-flash a plain firmware using the [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Failsafe|failsafe mechanism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A &quot;clever&quot; feature of the Toppy is that the '0' button on the remote will cycle between various Aspect Ratios (when it's not being used to enter a channel number).  This will override and update the Setting in the Main Menu.  You can disable this feature by using the  [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/patches.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[Z]&amp;nbsp;AspectRatio firmware patch&lt;/nowiki&gt;] (note that you '''will''' still be able to use the '0' button to stop TAPs loading during booting).

      <comment>&quot;extend&quot; tap using &quot;accurate recording&quot; signals</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Published TV schedules are (for various reasons) not always accurate.  This means that a programme may start a little earlier or later, or (quite commonly) end later than the schedule.  Therefore, most people &quot;pad&quot; their recordings with an extra couple of minutes before the start time and slightly more than that after the end time.  This can be done by adjusting the timer manually after setting it in the EPG (press Record again and then adjust the start time and duration), but many replacement EPG TAPs offer this as an automatic feature (and can cope with the complexities of recording consecutive programmes and resolving clashes between channels).

There is a TAP, Extend[http://www.toppy.org.uk/downloads/info.php?tid=279], which will extend recordings based on the programme transitions signalled by the broadcaster (known as &quot;Accurate Recording&quot; signals in the UK). This is useful for programs which overrun significantly. It requires a particular firmware patch (already included in some customised firmware, but not in factory firmware), and depends on the broadcaster transmitting the signals correctly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The timeshift buffer is quite fragile.  It will be dumped in preference to making a timer recording and in many other situations, too.  So it is not something that should be relied on.  If possible, set timers and record the programmes you want to watch, even if you think you might watch it live.  And if you find yourself watching something that suddenly becomes interesting, convert the timeshift buffer (if it exists!) into a proper recording by using the Recording item in the Main Menu and selecting the &quot;Current Event&quot; as the Start Time (some replacement EPG TAPs may also offer this feature).

      <comment>recording 2 &amp; watching another may cause problems</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Toppy has two tuners so you can record two channels at once.  Most PVRs will then limit your viewing to one or either of those channels, but the Toppy has a very clever chipset — you get a much wider choice and sometimes ''all'' channels are available (this is often referred to as &quot;Record Two, Watch a Third&quot;).  Technically, this choice is dictated by which [http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/dtt/dtt.cgi?reg=UK&amp;by=mux multiplex (or mux)] the two recording channels are from.  If they are from the same mux then the Toppy can use just one tuner, leaving the second tuner free for watching any channel.  If they are from different muxes then the choice of channels that can be watched will be limited to any channel that is also on one of those two muxes.

For example, (in the current Freeview setup) if you are recording BBC1 and ITV1 then you cannot watch Five.  But you could watch, say, BBC2 or Ch4 (as well as BBC1 and ITV1, of course).  However, if you are recording ITV1 and Ch4 then you will be able to watch any other channel.

Note that there are bugs/features which sometimes make it seem like the Toppy is more limited than this, causing [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Check_Your_Reservation|&quot;CYR&quot;]] prompts at unnecessary times.

If recording two programs and watching a third the 5800 can sometimes become unstable and require switching off, usually after using the remote control to do something. This may be more likely if several TAPs are running. If this happens, in future try not to change the watched channel when recording two others to avoid spoiling the recordings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you press the Power button while the Toppy is recording it will give you a &quot;Power Off&quot; prompt asking you to confirm this choice.  If you select &quot;Yes&quot; then it will stop all current recordings and go into standby.  If you select &quot;No&quot; (or press Exit) then it will cancel the power off and remain on.  But there is a third option: leave the prompt alone.  If you do this it will automatically go into standby once all recordings have completed.

Another option is to use the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/newusers/manual3d.php Sleep Timer] to do a timed shutdown.  Ordinarily the Toppy will power off once the set time has elapsed, but if there are recordings in progress it will wait for them to complete first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">EPG data is not preserved when the Toppy is turned off, so it starts with no data when it first comes out of standby.  However, it does not take long to collect a lot of data, especially when tuned to the better BBC channels.  You should also be able to see the EPG Guide being populated with new data while you are looking at it.

If this situation persists then the [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Freeview Shuffle|Freeview channel list]] may have changed, or your local transmitter may be experiencing [http://www.bbc.co.uk/reception/transmitters/index.shtml problems or maintenance].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The genesis of this book is a workshop at [http://www.spaconference.org/spa2008/index.php  SPA2008] on Technical Book writing. This conference brings together software developers, managers and consultants for three days of workshops, tutorials  and a variety of other collaborative learning events.

One workshop has as its topic  [http://www.spaconference.org/spa2008/sessions/session146.html Technical Publishing 2.0]. This session will bring together both published writers, of which there are many regular attenders at this conference, and budding writers looking for inspiration and advice about getting into print. Wikibooks serve a dual role in the workshop - as one of a number of new mediums for publishing and as a convenient mechanism to support the conference session before, during and after, and then perhaps to evolve into a useful Wikibook on the topic. The focus of the workshop is to explore the way the internet and web 2.0 is changing the nature of publishing.

Initially it is expected SPA delegates in general and workshop participants in particular will be the main contributors, but it is of course open to all.

== The problem ==
The root problem is to design learning resources to assist software practitioners  develop and extend their knowledge base, develop new skills and upgrade existing ones.  To tackle this problem we need to understand better how software practitioners go about this task in practice.  We would expect different approaches to be used, depending, for example, on [[/Learning Styles/ | learning style]] , [[/Learning Strategies/ | learning strategies ]] and knowledge of [[/Learning Resources/ | available learning resources]].

*[http://www.phil-race.com/files/htwol%203rd%20edition%20Sep%202005.pdf ]

== SPA participants ==
Participants at the SPA workshop will be asked to reflect on their most recent learning experience, to rate these resources in terms of their utility and to plot the sequence in which the resources are used.  The session then proceeds to brainstorm ways in which the individual learning resources and particularly print books can be improved and coordinated to proved a more satisfactory and efficient learning medium

=== A Pattern Language ===
A structural device which may be useful here is the notion of a patten language. Patterns are a format familiar to software practitioners through their use by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John M. Vlissides  in their seminal work &quot;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994), as a means of describing recurrent software structures in the emerging field of object-oriented programming.  Patterns as named and articulated units of established practice originate in the work of Christopher Alexander and his team at Berkeley in the field of community   architecture.  Publishing, like architecture is  a long-established  trade, from which can be distilled practices and processes together with the context in which they are most suitable and the ground on which this good practice is based.  Publishing, perhaps more so than architecture is undergoing change as new technologies for collaboration, production and dissemination arise. Patterns and wikis are also closely associated through the seminal work of Ward Cunningham, creator of the initial wiki on the subject of software patterns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Canon and Nikon are the two dominant DSLR makers as of 2007, and have been for a number of years. They are both excellent brands, and both have large followings. That said, they are incompatible (ones lenses don't work on the others body), and in building a collection of equipment, you will choose one or the other. It makes a difference, but not a great one, and after committing to a system, many develop a love-hate relationship with the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Such as [http://www.bythom.com/ Thom Hogan's] with Nikon, as at ''[http://www.bythom.com/changenikon.htm If I ran Nikon]''. A similar article could be written for Canon.&lt;/ref&gt; Some differences are detailed below.

==How to choose?==
:''This is also applicable to non-Canon/Nikon systems.''

Most importantly, you are choosing a ''system'', not a ''body''. Instead of thinking about minor differences between current bodies, consider which ''lenses'' and bodies you expect to be using over the next 10 or 20 years. This is admittedly difficult when starting off, but lenses last decades, and it is prohibitively expensive to switch between systems or have two parallel sets of equipment: switching systems is a major decision.

Ideally, consider what kind of photography you are likely to do or may do for the foreseeable future, and how each system fits it. What equipment would you get initially? Over the next few years? Further down the road?

Also, actually test out both systems: some people fall in love with the Nikon feel, for instance.

==Bodies==
Broadly, Canon is generally averred to produce higher IQ bodies at lower prices, while Nikon cameras are considered more enjoyable to use.
===Canon===
* better image quality
** full-frame sensors
** less noise, especially at high ISOs
* cheaper

Canon has had full-frame sensor cameras since 2001, with the 1D. As of 2008, Nikon has just introduced a full-frame camera, the D3.

Canon's DSLRs have traditionally been cheaper than comparable Nikons, but Nikon's D40 is rather cheaper than Canon's 400D.

===Nikon===
* better physical feel
* better software UI

==Lenses==
Both produce an extensive (which is not to say ''complete'') range of lenses, unlike the other DSLR manufacturers. Both have individual lenses with strong followings; below are notable classes of lenses that they each make.
===Canon===
* Sports lenses (fast super telephotos)
:Canon's white super telephoto lenses are instantly recognizable at sports events.
* T/S: 3 currently
:against Nikon's having had none, and having introduced 1 in 2008

===Nikon===
* Largest lineup
:Because Nikon retained the [[w:Nikon F-mount|F-mount]], every lens they've made still works, in contrast to Canon, whose EOS system of 1987 broke backwards compatibility.

By the way, it would be ''Me gusta&lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt; manzanas''. The verb ''gustar'' refers to the object that is being liked (hence the ''me'' pronoun), and since ''manzanas'' is plural, it takes the ''ellos'' ending. :) '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 00:58, 31 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Software Engineering Games==
{{TODO|Interconnect [[Software Engineering]]}}

== Selecting the hardware ==
To develop a game you may need not only qualified personal is special tasks, like graphics designers but you will have also to consider the software for editors (for creating things such as characters, items, scenery) but also the physical hardware to support those tasks, for example graphic tablets may be required for the graphic design, and you will probably need scanners to input hand drawn pictures from artists as well as cameras cameras could to be used to take pictures of drawn artwork. All these extra costs have to be well considered and depend only on the level of your project.

But hardware considerations are not restricted to the tools you will be using, but most important is the requirement to run your finished product, this will not only affect the target audience but shape the development of the project. The software requirements to implement you game design may require to access large amounts of memory but have a limited amount available to work with at each time the can be also other limitations such weaker CPUs, weaker processor caches or non-default memory alignment requirements.

=== The easy way out... ===
No frills, no whistles and no extra costs. If you select a virtual framework, lets say by using Flash as your developing framework you will skip the need to think about and supporting special hardware or setups, you will also have a RAD tool to put your concept into action.

=== Distribution media ===
Distribution media is important to determine how much resources can be packed and how they should be packed.

==Selecting the Programming Language==

===Prototyping===
A prototype is meant to be an exploration, a journey to see how ideas will play out once they are embodied into a full working program. It is the testing of a new concept that has not been seen before and because of this it must be most flexible in its implementation so it it easy to improve, since the creation of the prototype will inspires completely new ideas. If the exploration of new concepts is not done during the prototyping phase then what was the point of the prototype at all?

Prototype is meant to be done quickly and then it needs to change even quicker. To be able to do that it as to be maintainable and use a flexible and well-written code base. But keep in mind that a prototype is only useful if it is good enough so to prove your vision as correct and to be discarded for a real implementation, if you spend to much time on the prototype that you start to begging to question it's replacement, then you are on the wrong path or have spent to much effort on what should remain the first tryout of the master plan.

      <comment>/* XQuery and Functional Programming */ actually, mu-recursive functions were as least as important to the development of FP as lambda calculus</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== History of XQuery ==

== XQuery and Functional Programming ==
XQuery is an example of a [[w:Functional programming|functional programming]] language.  Like other functional languages, XQuery variables are immutable, meaning that you can set them once but never change them after that.  XQuery functions do not have &quot;side effects&quot; meaning that they do not change data that is not specifically passed to them.

Functional programming has recently gained popularity with the rise of the [[w:MapReduce|MapReduce]] algorithms recently popularized by Google.  Google's ability to leverage tens of thousands of CPUs in its data center has shown that functional languages are in many ways superior to procedural languages.  But many of the benefits of functional programming go back to mathematical formalisms of the 1930s, including the [[w:Lambda calculus|lambda calculus]] and the [[w:μ-recursive function|μ-recursive functions]].

Although the XQuery 1.0 W3C specification does not allow a function to be passed as an argument to a function, most implementations such as eXist support this, so technically the eXist implementation of XQuery is a true functional language but the W3C standard is not. However, XQuery 1.1 is to allow function items as data&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-11/#id-inline-func&lt;/ref&gt; while 

A history of functional programming is available at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_programming/Functional_programming Functional Programming].  This article has an excellent historical background on functional programming and why functional programs are ideal for a server environment where reliability is critical.

== XQuery as a w3c Standard ==

In [[w:1998|1998]] [[w:Jonathan Robie|Jonathan Robie]] and [[w:Joe Lapp|Joe Lapp]] (then the principal architect of [[w:WebMethods|WebMethods]]) created a new query language designed specifically to query XML files called [[w:XQL|XQL]]

In 1998, two query languages, XQL and [[w:XML-QL|XML-QL]] got a lot of interest within the W3C and a working group for XML-based querying languages was formed.

In 1998 the World Wide Web consortium hosted a conference on query languages&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TandS/QL/QL98/Overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  This conference gathered XML and query language experts from around the world and from many fields.  66 &quot;Position Papers&quot; were presented.  The result was a very large knowledge base of use cases and proposals that began as a basis for a future standardized query language.

The working group selected around 90 use cases and compared the ability of seven advanced query languages to execute them.
None of the seven were perfect.  Each had some defects.  The working group took the best part of each of the seven languages and created the XQuery standard.

The XSLT language reached recommendation status in 1999.  But there were many people who felt that XSLT was too difficult to learn, and because of the XML syntax, it was very unfamiliar for many software developers.  People with an SQL background had a difficult time understanding how to learn XSLT.

== XQuery and SQL ==

Studies have shown that people familiar with SQL can quickly learn XQuery.  Once developers understand the structure of the FLWOR statement, many SQL concepts such as sorting and selecting distinct values are easily learned.

== XQuery and XSLT ==

Many developers once considered XSLT template-style transforms ideal for transforming documents and XQuery ideal for querying more structured XML data such as a collection of book metadata.  Recent work with typeswitch-style transforms have shown that XQuery modules and functions can be used to create document-style transforms that rival most XSLT functions.  And because many XQuery systems leverage document indexes they can be considerably faster than XSLT transforms that were never designed to use indexed XML structures.

      <comment>/* Advantages over SQL */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Benefits of XQuery ==

The principal benefits of XQuery are:

* '''Expressiveness''' - XQuery can query many different data structures and its recursive nature makes it ideal for querying tree and graph structures
* '''Brevity''' - XQuery statements are shorter than similar SQL or XSLT programs
* '''Flexibility''' - XQuery can query both hierarchical and tabular data
* '''Consistency''' - XQuery has a consistent syntax and can be used with other XML standards such as XML Schema datatypes

XQuery is frequently compared with two other languages, SQL and XSLT, but has a number of advantages over these.

== Advantages over SQL ==
Unlike SQL, XQuery returns not just tables but arbitrary tree structures.  This allows XQuery to directly create XHTML structures that can be used in web pages. XQuery is for XML-based object databases, and object databases are much more flexible and powerful than databases which store in purely tabular format. 

Unlike XSLT, XQuery can be learned by anyone familiar with SQL.  Many of the constructs are very similar such as:

* '''Ordering Results:''' Both XQuery and SQL add an &lt;code&gt;order by&lt;/code&gt; clause to the query.
* '''Selecting Distinct Values:''' Both XQuery and SQL have easy ways to select distinct values from a result set
* '''Restricting Rows:''' Both XQuery and SQL have a WHERE X=Y clause that can be added to an XQuery

Another big advantage is that XQuery is essentially the native query language of the World Wide Web. One can query actual web pages with XQuery, but not SQL. Even if one uses SQL-based databases to store HTML/XHTML pages or fragments of such pages, one will miss many of the advantages of XQuery's simple tag/attribute search (which is akin to searching for column names within column names).

== Advantages over XSLT ==

Unlike XSLT, XQuery can be quickly learned by anyone familiar with SQL.  XSLT has many patterns that are unfamiliar to many procedural software developers. Also, whereas XSLT is good for using as a static means to convert one type of document to another, for example RSS to HTML, XQuery is a much more dynamic querying tool, useful for pulling out sections of data from large documents and/or large number of documents.

=== The Debate about XQuery vs. XSLT for Document Transformation ===

There has been a debate of sorts about the merits of the two languages for transforming XML: [[w:XSLT|XSLT]] and [[w:XQuery|XQuery]].  A common misconception is that &quot;XQuery is best for querying or selecting XML, and XSLT is best for transforming it.&quot;  In reality, both methods are capable of transforming XML.  Despite XSLT's longer history and larger install base, the &quot;XQuery typeswitch&quot; method of transforming XML provides numerous advantages. 

Most people who need to transform XML hear that they need to learn a language called XSLT.  XSLT, whose first version was published by the W3C in 1999, was a huge innovation for its time and, indeed, remains dominant.  It was one of the very first languages dedicated to transforming XML documents, and it was the first domain-specific language (DSL) to use advanced theories from the world of functional programming to create very reliable, side-effect free transformations.  Many XML developers still feel strong indebted to this groundbreaking language, since it helped them see a new model of software development: one focused around the transformation of models and empowering them to fuse both the requirements and documentation of a transformation routing into a single, modular program.  

On the other hand, learning XSLT requires overcoming a very substantial learning curve.  XSLT's difficulty is due, in part, to one of the key design decisions by its architects: to express the transformation rules using XML itself, rather than creating a brand new syntax and grammar for storing the transformation rules.  XSLT's unique approach to transformation rules also contributes to the steepness of the learning curve.  The learning curve can be overcome, but it is fair to say that this learning curve has created a opening for an alternative approach.  

XQuery has filled this demand for an alternative among a growing community of users: they find XQuery has a lower learning curve, it meets their needs for transforming XML, and, together with XQuery's other advantages, it has become a compelling &quot;all-in-one&quot; language.  Like XSLT, XQuery was created by the W3C to handle XML.  But instead of expressing the language in XML syntax, the architects of XQuery chose a new syntax that would be more familiar to users of server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Perl, or Python.  XQuery was designed to be similar to users of relational database query languages such as SQL, while still remaining true to functional programming practices.  Despite its relative youth (XQuery 1.0 was only released in 2007 when XSLT had already reached its version 2.0), XQuery was born remarkably mature.  XML servers like eXist-db and MarkLogic were already using XQuery as their language for querying XML and performing web server operations (obviating the need for learning PHP, Perl, or Python).  

So, in the face of the XSLT community's contention that &quot;XSLT is best for transforming documents and XQuery is best for querying databases&quot;, this community of users was surprised to find that XQuery has entirely replaced their need for XSLT.  They have come to argue unabashedly that they prefer XQuery for this purpose.  

How does XQuery accomplish the task of transforming XML?  The primary technique in XQuery for transforming XML is a little-known expression added by the authors of XQuery, called &quot;typeswitch.&quot;  Although it is quite simple, typeswitch enables XQuery to perform nearly the full set of transformations that XSLT does.  A typeswitch expression quickly looks at a node's type, and depending on the node's type, performs the operation you specify for that type of node.  What this means is that each distinct element of a document can have its own rule, and these rules can be stored in modular XQuery functions.  This humble addition to the XQuery language allows developers to transform documents with complex content and unpredictable order - something commonly believed to be best reserved for the domain of XSLT.  Despite the differences in syntax and approach to transformation, a growing community has actually come to see the XQuery typeswitch expression as a valid, even superior, way to store their document transformation logic.

By structuring a set of XQuery functions around the typeswitch expression, you can achieve the same result as XSLT-style transforms while retaining the benefits of XQuery: ease of learning and integration with native XML databases.  Even more important for those users of native XML databases, the availability of typeswitch means that they only need to learn a single language for their database queries, web server operations, and document transformations.  These XQuery typeswitch routines have proved easy to build, test, and maintain - some believe easier than XSLT.  XQuery typeswitch has given these users a high degree of agility, allowing them to master XQuery fully rather than splitting their time and attention between XQuery and XSLT.

That said, there is still a large body of legacy XSLT transforms that work well, and there are XSLT developers who see little benefit from transitioning to a typeswitch-style XQuery.  Both are valid approaches to document transformation.  A natural tension has arisen between the proponents of XQuery typeswitch and XSLT, each promoting what they are most comfortable with and believe to be superior.  In practice you might be best served by trying both techniques and determining what style is right for you and your organization.  Without presuming a background or interest in XSLT, this article and its companion article help you to understand the key patterns for using XQuery typeswitch for your XML transformation needs.

==Added some...==
Didn't know were you were headed in with the book but just created a rudimentary structure and started some topics, I used a very sarcastic tone on the text as it will be probably easier to read, fell free to edit away the text, it was a cool 15minutes.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:18, 31 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Installing the eXist native XML database ==

Steps for Installing eXist on Microsoft Windows Systems

The full up-to-date [http://exist-db.org/quickstart.html quick start installation instructions] are available on the eXist web site.  This set of instructions is slightly simplified for the needs of the cookbook.

# Download the JAR file (Java Archive File) from http://www.exist-db.org
# To install it, you will need a JDK (Java Developer Kit) installed on your system, preferably version 1.5 or higher
## To test this type &quot;javac -version&quot; at the command prompt.
## If you do not have a JDK installed, install the (not bundled) &quot;Java SE Development Kit (JDK)&quot; JDK 6 Update XX from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp  
# Double Click the jar file.  This will automatically install the application.  &lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Warning&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Do not use the default installation path that has &quot;Program Files&quot; and the default install directory.  This will not work because of the spaces in the path name.  You MUST pick a path that does not have spaces, '''C:\eXist''' for example.  Complete the installation by selecting the defaults.  It is strongly advised to set the admin password
# On Windows start up the eXist database by selecting it from the Start menu, or double clicking '''C:\eXist\bin\startup.bat'''.   This will start up a DOS console.  Give it a few seconds to start up the server.  
# Bring up your web browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/exist http://localhost:8080/exist]  It shows a local copy of the eXist site.  
# Click Admin in the Administration menus (on the left). This section allows you to add users and passwords
# You may choose to &quot;Import Example Data&quot; if you like
# You can now enter simple queries by going to the page [http://localhost:8080/exist/sandbox/ http://localhost:8080/exist/sandbox/]

== Adding a WebDAV Client ==
# If you are using Windows, you can also add a WebDAV folder that will allow you to drag-and-drop many XML and XQuery files from your windows desktop to and from an eXist collection.

[http://exist-db.org/webdav.html WebDAV Windows]

Note that the Windows interface is somewhat buggy.  You can not copy files from one eXist system directly to another eXist system.  You must first copy to a windows file system and then copy it to the second eXist system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Guidelines for wikibook authors ==
Our goal is to allow many people to contribute examples but allow our readers a consistent user experience.  In that light we would like all of our authors to use some of the following standards.

This book has a strong focus on learning some aspect of XQuery via examples.  Our hope is to have a large collection of small sample XQuery programs.  Each program should have the minimal code to demonstrate some aspect of XQuery.  Although most of our users use eXist, we hope the examples can be used with MarkLogic, BaseX and other XQuery systems. 

Make sure you use the '''source''' tags to surround your code.  If it is XML code use the '''lang=&quot;xml&quot;''' attribute.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  ...xml code here...
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember to try to keep the examples as simple as you can to demonstrate the core concepts of your examples.

== Sample XQuery File ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
let $message := 'Hello World!'
return
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;message&gt;{$message}&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Each XQuery file should begin with the word '''xquery''' and the version number.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Complex XQueries should have comments using the XQuery comments

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

(: This is a comment :)
&lt;/source&gt;

== File Name Conventions ==

Please use three space characters to indent your XQuery and XML examples.  Do not use tabs.  We use three characters because we use PDF output of these books and the printed pages have limited width.

Please do not exceed 70 characters per line.  This helps formatting for printed versions of this Wikibook.

For XQuery scripts are stored inside the database please use the '''.xq''' suffix.

If you are running on a system that MUST be compatible with the three-letter Microsoft DOS file name extension please use the '''.xql''' file suffix.

For XQuery modules please use the suffix '''.xqm'''.

For each module that has unit tests use the suffix '''-test.xq'''.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:140%&quot;&gt;'''Comparing the Ideas behind Relaxation, LC and RC Oscillators'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


== A relaxation oscillator ==

'''The basic idea.''' The simpler and more intuitive '''relaxation oscillator''' consists of (Fig. 1) a flow (current) source, an accumulator of potential energy (a capacitor), a switch SW and a load (a resistor)&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle|How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle]] (creating a philosophy of the relaxation oscillator)&lt;/ref&gt;. Such an arrangement operates in two stages as follows: in the first stage, we connect the current source to the accumulator and begin charging it; in the second stage, we connect the accumulator to the load (turn on the switch SW) and discharge it. Let's repeat it in other words: in a period of a relaxation oscillation, we first draw a kind of energy (usually, potential) from the flow source to fill the accumulator, then &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator and just &quot;throw out&quot; it to the environment. Thus, in the first stage of every period the source has to restore the energy in the accumulator.

[[Image:Relaxation_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. A relaxation oscillator has only one accumulating element; the energy moves only in one direction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Features.''' Note that the relaxation arrangement needs only one accumulator. It lies on the way of energy and serves as a buffer that interrupts temporarily the flow (only, the average flow remains constant). In this way, it intermits, tears to &quot;pieces&quot; the energy flow. It is interesting fact that a continuous current enters the accumulator while an intermittent current leaves it; so, we might say that a relaxation oscillator &quot;discretisizes&quot;, &quot;portens&quot;, &quot;doses&quot; the unceasing input flow of energy. At the same time, the accumulator's contents increases and decreases periodically. The shape of the curve is not sinusoidal because at the points of switching (at the peaks) the &quot;flow-creating&quot; quantity has a maximum magnitude. Note also that increase and decrease can have different durations. Examples of this possibility are a photoflash (slow charging, fast discharging), a toilet tank, a husband that fills slowly and continuously a family money deposit while his wife empties rapidly and regularly it:)

== An LC oscillator ==

'''The basic idea.''' Contrary, in order to create an ideal LC oscillation (assume an LC tank without losses), we charge the accumulator only once in the beginning (by turning on the switch SW on the bottom of the figure). Then, we &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator but do not &quot;throw it away&quot;; instead, we convert it into an opposite kind (''kinetic to potential'' or ''potential to kinetic'') and store the converted energy in another accumulator. We move, transfer, convey the energy from the one accumulator to the other. After, we use this energy to restore the energy of the first accumulator instead to &quot;suck&quot; energy from the source (we move back the energy).

[[Image:LC_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. An LC oscillator has two accumulating elements; the energy circulates between them.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Implementation.''' For this purpose, the LC arrangement consists of two heterogeneous (regarding to the two kinds of energy) accumulating elements (Fig. 2). Each of them can either provide energy (when it serves as a source) or store the energy (when it serves as a load). When act as a source, it is a weakening, depleting, exhausting source because the other (accumulating) element &quot;sucks out&quot; the source's energy. The energy moves from the source to the accumulator and the source's output quantity decreases.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== An RC oscillator ==

== Comparing the three kinds of oscillators ==

=== Similarities ===

#Both the oscillating circuits contain at least one accumulating element that acts either as a source or as an integrator.


=== Differences ===

#A relaxation oscillator consists of only one accumulating element while an LC oscillator consists of two accumulating elements.
#The relaxation accumulator is ''flow'' or ''pressure'' like; the LC accumulators are heterogeneous (the one is ''flow-like'' and the other is ''pressure-like'').
#A relaxation oscillator stores only one kind of energy (usually potential) in the accumulator while an LC oscillator stores two opposite kinds of energy (''kinetic'' and ''potential'') in the two accumulators.
#In a relaxation oscillator we &quot;throw away&quot; the energy while in an LC oscillator we treasure it temporarily in an additional accumulator with the purpose of future usage. That's why, LC oscillators are more economical than relaxation ones.
#Resonance phenomenon does not exist in a relaxation circuit; it can be observed only in the LC tank.
#In a relaxation oscillator the energy moves only in one direction (source -&gt; accumulator -&gt; load) while in an LC oscillator the energy changes periodically its direction (it circulates between the two elements).
#The shape of a relaxation oscillation is peaked, angular while the shape of an LC oscillation is rounded (sinusoidal). The reason of that is that at the peaks the source of a relaxation oscillator changes its output quantity with the maximum magnitude while the &quot;source&quot; of an LC oscillator (charged accumulator) does not change its output quantity.
#The shape of the relaxation oscillation can be asymmetrical (the increase and the decrease can have different durations) while the shape of the LC oscillation is precisely symmetrical.

== What the secret of relaxation oscillations is ==

Maybe, we have first to say here ''what the truth about relaxation oscillation is'' and then to discuss how to present this wisdom to visitors (these are different things). Well, let's begin with the first.

=== The initial point: ''A steady quantity'' ===

At the starting point we need a steady quantity. Where to get it from? As usual in this world, we need energy to create a quantity. We can get this energy from some power source. So, the first thing what we need (in this world) is a power source.

=== The problem: ''How to make it oscillate?'' ===

Then, we ask yourself, &quot;How do we make the steady quantity oscillate?&quot; But what does mean &quot;to oscillate&quot;? Simply speaking, to oscillate means just to make the quantity increase and decrease consecutively and regularly. How do we do this magic?

=== Preparing a steady quantity to be changed ===

It seems it's too difficult to make the very power source oscillate (power sources keep up constant their output quantities). Then, what do we do? We can act like in many situations of routine: instead to change the whole source energy we get some amount of energy from the source and store it in some &quot;place&quot; with the purpose to change it. As there are two kinds of energy - kinetic and potential, we can store energy in two kinds of energy accumulators (integrators). Let's do it; we have got the initial steady quantity. Examples: if we have stored a kinetic energy in an inductor, we obtain a constant current; if we have stored a potential energy in a capacitor, we obtain a constant voltage.

=== Changing the accumulated quantity ===

Now, we can begin doing the &quot;veritable work&quot; - to increase and decrase the steady quantity, in order to make it oscillate. How can we make it increase? Of course, by adding continuosly energy to the accumulator. And how can we make it decrease? Contrary, by subtracting continuosly energy from the accumulator. In both the cases we move, transport, transfer energy from one place to other - from the source to the accumulator and v.v.

==== Relaxation oscillations ====

''(...We might explain what an LC oscillation is, if we say what it is not. Here, we might say that an LC oscillation is not a '''relaxation''' one. Only, we would explain what a &quot;relaxation oscillation&quot; is. This phenomenon is no less vague and mystic than the LC phenomenon (I have never met good resources about it). Now, we have opportunity to reveal the secret behind relaxation phenomenon by comparing it with LC one. After that, we may move these thoughts to the future [[Circuit Idea/How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle|story]] about relaxation oscillations...)''

[[Image:Relaxation_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt; A relaxation oscillator has only one accumulating element; the energy moves only in one direction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''The basic idea.''' According to the powerful idea [[#Changing the accumulated quantity|above]], we might first build the simpler and more intuitive ''relaxation oscillator'' by using three elements: a flow (current) source, an accumulator of potential energy (a capacitor) and a load (a resistor). Such an arrangement operates in two stages as follows: in the first stage, we connect the current source to the accumulator and begin charging it; in the second stage, we connect the accumulator to the load (turn on the switch SW) and discharge it. Let's repeat it in other words: in a period of a relaxation oscillation, we first draw a kind of energy (usually, potential) from the flow source to fill the accumulator, then &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator and just &quot;throw out&quot; it to the environment. Thus, in the first stage of every period the source has to restore the energy in the accumulator.

'''Features.''' Note that the relaxation arrangement needs only one accumulator. It lies on the way of energy and serves as a buffer that interrupts temporarily the flow (only, the average flow remains constant). In this way, it intermits, tears to &quot;pieces&quot; the energy flow. It is interesting fact that a continuous current enters the accumulator while an intermittent current leaves it; so, we might say that a relaxation oscillator &quot;discretisizes&quot;, &quot;portens&quot;, &quot;doses&quot; the unceasing input flow of energy. At the same time, the accumulator's contents increases and decreases periodically. The shape of the curve is not sinusoidal because at the points of switching (at the peaks) the &quot;flow-creating&quot; quantity has a maximum magnitude. Note also that increase and decrease can have different durations. Examples of this possibility (see the analogies below) are a photoflash (slow charging, fast discharging), a toilet tank, a husband that fills slowly and continuously a family money deposit while his wife empties rapidly and regularly it:)

'''What does &quot;relaxation oscillation&quot; mean?''' I have been asking myself many times what the word &quot;relaxation&quot; means in this context. What does &quot;relax&quot; here? Maybe, the capacitor? If yes, when does the capacitor relax? Maybe, when we charge it (in this case, &quot;relaxation&quot; would mean restoring, retrieving, recreating the content of the accumulating element). Or maybe, the capacitor relaxes (returns to its initial &quot;zero energy&quot; state of equilibrium) when we discharge it...

'''Relaxation analogies.''' We can see many manifestations of this phenomenon in nature, routine, engineering and finally, in electronics. For example, I have a remembrance from my childhood how sometimes faulty toilet tanks began working intermittently (filling -&gt; emptying -&gt; filling -&gt; emptying... up to infinity:) Similarly, imagine you were foolish enough to make a common money deposit with your wife:) Then, you begin working hard to feed up continuously the deposit. As a result, the amount of money increases continuously through time. Only, at some point your wife decides that's enough and draw out all the money accumulated. You begin working again... and she empties the deposit again... and this repeats again... and again... and again...:) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 20:06, 18 January 2008 (UTC)

==== LC oscillations ====

[[Image:LC_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt;An LC oscillator has two accumulating elements; the energy circulates between them.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''The basic idea.''' Contrary, in order to create an ideal LC oscillation (assume an LC tank without losses), we charge the accumulator only once in the beginning (by turning on the switch SW on the bottom of the figure). Then, we &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator but do not &quot;throw it away&quot;; instead, we convert it into an opposite kind (''kinetic to potential'' or ''potential to kinetic'') and store the converted energy in another accumulator. We move, transfer, convey the energy from the one accumulator to the other. After, we use this energy to restore the energy of the first accumulator instead to &quot;suck&quot; energy from the source (we move back the energy). By the way, maybe is more correctly to say &quot;energy moves&quot; rather than &quot;we move the energy&quot;. But why the energy moves by itself? What makes it move? What makes it move to and fro without end? Don't you think there is something mystic in this endless &quot;ping-pong&quot; movement?

'''Implementation.''' For this purpose, the LC arrangement consists of two heterogenious (regarding to the two kinds of energy) accumulating elements. Each of them can either provide energy (when it serves as a source) or store the energy (when it serves as a load). When act as a source, it is a weakening, depleting, exhausting source because the other (accumulating) element &quot;sucks out&quot; the source's energy. The energy moves from the source to the accumulator and the source's output quantity decreases.

'''Pasta and Bean Soup''' (''Pasta Fagioli'') is a true classical Italian peasant dish, again overcomplicated all too often by highfallutin' chefs. But made properly, with simple ingredients, and maybe let to infuse in the pot for 24 hours, you have one of the most delicious and hearty soups imaginable.

*1 large slug of premium [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 glass of dry white [[Cookbook:wine|wine]]
*5 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], peeled and chopped ''(use less garlic at your peril!!)''
*1 [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], peeled and chopped
*4 very red [[Cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]], chopped finely or one tin (235 g) chopped tomatoes
*3 large ''squeezes'' of Italian tomato [[Cookbook:purée|purée]]
*2 235g tins of borlotti beans
*1 handful of fresh, chopped [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]] (optional)
*1 sprig of [[Cookbook:rosemary|rosemary]] about 3 inches long
*A large handful of chopped [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]]
*1 ½ litres [[Cookbook:water|water]]
*2 [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|stock cubes]]
*1 pinch of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*large pinch of freshly ground [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
*large pinch of [[Cookbook:cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*5 handfuls of [[Cookbook:pasta|pasta]] shells or penne
*100 ml of single fresh [[Cookbook:cream|cream]] (optional)

==Procedure==

#Heat the olive oil in the pan, and add the chopped garlic and onions and fry gently for about 3 minutes until translucent but not coloured. Add the cayenne pepper and mix well in the pan.
#Add the glass of white wine and allow to evaporate slightly
#Add the water, the stock cubes, the tomato paste, pepper, salt, Pasta and the 2 tins of beans and allow to simmer gently for as long as the pasta needs to cook (see packet) stirring occasionally.
#Once the pasta is [[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]], stop the cooking process and add the chopped parsley and the cream and stir in well.
#Now add the rosemary sprig and allow the whole thing to infuse for about 2 hours.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* Add a small piece of [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] rind to the pot once you have added the water. Take it out once you are ready to serve the soup. Adds a... well... a parmesany taste to the soup!!
* The soup should be quite thick, but if it is not thick enough, take some of the soup out of the pot (preferably excluding any pasta) and blend it. Return the blended mixture to the soup to thicken.
* This soup can be adjusted by the addition of extra beans, extra pasta, to suit your individual taste. As a general rule the pasta should form about 40 percent of the soup !

Buon Appetito Wikibookians !

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't understand something. Isn't it illegal to write information written in the D&amp;D book, published by wizards of the coast ? answer, cause I will write this article if it's possible. 
thanks.
:It would be illegal to copy straight from the guide. The idea is that the stuff written here is ''free'', and is written by contributors. You can write it if you like, as long as it is your own work, and not taken from the book.

Actually Wizards of the Coast makes available a document called the SRD, which I think stands for Standard Rules something.  Anyway the point is the SRD is offered up on the Open Gaming License, which (i'm not a lawyer) Means it can be copied and reproduced word for word here.  It is not however a full guide to Dungeons and Dragons but instead offers a basic trimmed down version of the game, sans flavor content. --[[User:Evilestmark|Evilestmark]] ([[User talk:Evilestmark|talk]]) 05:56, 19 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Copyright problem with [[:Image:FancyCaptcha screenshot.png]] ==
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:FancyCaptcha screenshot.png]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:FancyCaptcha screenshot.png]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and status. The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Please take the time to read [[Wikibooks:Media]] to learn more about what copyright information is required to satisfy our requirements and remember to include this important information for every file that you upload in the future as well. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add this information; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask another Wikibookian at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|help desk]].

See {{UserImages}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:19, 31 January 2008 (UTC)}}

==my Screenshot is Unknown License?!==

Hello Shaplov,

When you upload the image you need to select the appropriate license.  Where have these images come from?  If you have created them yourself then you will be fine to license them under GFDL.  However if these are screenshots of someone elses work then you may not have permission to use these images in Wikibooks.  Looking at what you have uploaded it wouldn't take long to create free versions of these images.  Let me know if you need anymore help.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 07:40, 6 February 2008 (UTC)
:: Yeah... I need help. First of all, when I uploaded images, the upload page said: 

:::: &quot;'''Permission:''' Supply a short quote of the permission the copyright owner of the file gave you. In case of a general permission (e. g. US Public Domain or a website releasing its content under a free license) supply a short link to that legal disclaimer or an according hint. Omit if you are the author.&quot;
:: So, as far as I created this images, I ommited the permision assuming that it will be licenced on default licence used in this site. May be you should change text at download page. 

::The second thing is that I created a screenshot of my own site. I do not know how to do these screenshots so they won't be a screenshot of someone else's work. I think that MediaWiki is licenced on GPL and I can use anything I create using it (including screenshots) for free... 
::--[[User:Shaplov|Shaplov]] ([[User talk:Shaplov|talk]]) 11:27, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

== Screenshots ==

Those are {{tlx|free screenshot|GPL}}. I restored them, fixed the licensing and reverted my removal from the page. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:57, 27 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">It depends.

If you're seriously interested in photography and just starting out, you are generally best served with a Canon or Nikon DSLR.

Other companies and classes of camera are worth considering, and may suit your desires better.

In more detail:
;Compact Digitals: These are for casual photographers: &quot;point &amp; shoot&quot;
:If you don't want to dedicate much time or money, want a camera that fits in a pocket or purse, and just want to easily take photos to view on computers or small prints, compact digitals are ideal, and the choice of 100 million people per year. Conversely, they have poor quality, and some subjects (notably sports or most indoor photography) cannot be photographed well with a compact digital.
;DSLRs: These are for serious photographers.
:DSLRs are suitable for almost all purposes, can provide excellent quality (properly used), and are reasonably portable and affordable. Systems start from below $500 and they can be carried around your neck, and over 5 million bodies are sold per year.
;Medium Format or Large Format, (film): top quality, bulky and slow, film workflow
:Medium Format, and especially Large Format cameras are capable of quality far beyond any digital camera, and a view camera system can be had for $500. They have some severe limitations though, notably bulk and speed: the larger systems require a car or fit person to carry, and are only suitable for stationary subjects. Further, they involve film, and hence the film process (notably expensive development for each image), which some dislike and some prefer. If you are interested in photographing subjects suitable for such cameras, and don't mind or would enjoy working with film, you should definitely consider such a camera, though perhaps not as your first system. Digital sensors are available for MF and LF, but are quite expensive and limited.

== Sensor size ==
[[File:SensorSizes.svg|thumb|Relative [[w:Image sensor format|sensor sizes]] of common formats.]]

The key reason that compact digitals are disdained by serious photographers is that the sensors are small. All else equal, a bigger sensor is better – the typical compact [[w:Image sensor format|digital sensor size]] is 25 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, while the smallest DSLR sensors are 9 times bigger, more typically 13–15 times bigger, with the biggest DSLR sensors being over 34 times bigger. This results in a major difference in quality, but an increase in cost and size – bigger sensors are harder to make, and require bigger (and heavier) lenses.

The larger sensors in DSLRs provide ''very significant'' advantages in low-light sensitivity, [[w:dynamic range|dynamic range]], and [[w:image noise|image noise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/digital.sensor.performance.summary/index.html|title= Digital Camera Sensor Performance Summary|author=R. N. Clark|publisher=ClarkVision.com|date=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a few exceptions (discussed below), large sensors have been found only in DSLR cameras – thus &quot;high-quality digital camera&quot; has meant DSLR.

==Compact digitals==
Compact digitals vary greatly in appearance, interface, and features, and substantially in price, but rather little in image quality. Specific models are hard to recommend because of the rapid replacement cycle in this category.

Biggest issues (beyond price) are generally portability (does it fit where you want to carry it?) and usability: does the interface work for you?

''Auxiliary camera.'' Compact cameras are widely used and recommended as auxiliary cameras – a camera is no good if it's at home – and thus many photographers will carry around a pocket or purse-sized camera when not on a specifically photographic expedition.

''Ignore pixel count.'' At these sensor sizes, higher pixels yield higher noise which swamp the higher resolution and instead yield ''worse'' image quality, not better.

* [http://photo.net/equipment/best-digital-camera/ The Best Digital Cameras], by Philip Greenspun

Recently a few compact cameras with large sensors have been released – these allow a camera that can fit in a pocket but can take DSLR-quality images, though compared to DSLRs they generally lack features and make other trade-offs.
These include the [[w:Sigma DP1|Sigma DP1]] and [[w:Sigma DP2|Sigma DP2]], which featured a fixed lens, and an announced camera by Olympus in the [[w:Micro Fourth Thirds system|Micro Fourth Thirds system]], which features interchangeable lenses and a retro design.

These have caused some measure of excitement, as they allow high quality images in a camera that can easily be carried around, and thus are suited as an auxiliary camera for when one does not wish to carry around a DSLR.

== Bridge cameras ==
[[w:Bridge camera|Bridge camera]]s—cameras between compact digitals and DSLRs—form an amorphous category.

=== Usual meaning ===
They generally mean &quot;a small sensor with a big lens&quot; – thus a style similar to a DSLR, but with a small sensor and hence relatively poor image quality. By comparison with compact digitals, they have bigger and faster lenses, hence can take photographs in lower light and of moving objects, while by comparison with DSLRs the lenses are much easier to make, and hence are generally super-zoom.

These fill a niche which is increasingly small as the price of DSLRs has come down, and one is almost always better served by an entry level DSLR such as the Canon Rebel XTi/XSi or Nikon D40. Currently in the US&lt;ref&gt;(2009-APR)&lt;/ref&gt; entry DSLRs (with kit lens) retail for $375 (Nikon D40) to $600 (Canon Digital Rebel XSi), while bridge cameras are in the $250 to $400 range.

If quality is a concern, get an entry-level DSLR or large sensor non-DSLR (see below); if budget is a concern, get a compact digital and play to its strengths.

=== Large sensor non-DSLR ===
The &quot;large sensor non-DSLR&quot; class is an emerging class, consisting of cameras with large sensor (like entry-level DSLRs), but a smaller format. Several of these are in the [[w:Micro Four Thirds System|Micro Four Thirds System]], by Panasonic and Olympus, which features a Four Thirds size sensor and interchangeable lenses.
There are currently two types:
* High-quality compact
*:These are pocket-size (compact) cameras with a large sensor
*:[[w:Sigma DP1|Sigma DP1]] &amp; [[w:Sigma DP2|Sigma DP2]] are available, and have a fixed (non-interchangeable) lens with a fixed focal length.
*:Olympus has also announced a camera in this class with interchangeable lenses and a retro design.
* DSLR-style without viewfinder
*:These are similar in design and size to bridge cameras, but with large sensors: smaller bodies than DSLRs, and an [[w:electronic viewfinder|electronic viewfinder]] (EVF)
*:[[w:Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1|Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1]] &amp; [[w:Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1|Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1]]

High-quality compact cameras have generated some measure of excitement, as they finally provide a camera that takes quality photographs but fits in the pocket. These are limited in many ways compared to DSLRs (the Sigma DP1 &amp; DP2 have fixed lenses with fixed focal length), but can function within their limits, and as auxiliary cameras.

Large sensor non-DSLRs fill a similar role to entry-level DSLRs, and are worth considering as alternatives – the lack of a [[w:pentaprism|pentaprism]] and mirror makes them significantly smaller and lighter, at the cost of not having an optical viewfinder. Further, there are very few cameras in this class.

== DSLRs ==
As discussed at [[../DSLRs|DSLRs]], you are first buying a ''system'', not a ''camera'' or ''body''. Unless you find [[../DSLRs#Other_brands|an other brand]] particularly compelling – and there are reasons to do so – you should get a [[../DSLRs#Canon_and_Nikon|Canon or Nikon]] body and some lenses.

* [http://photo.net/equipment/building-a-digital-slr-system/ Building a DSLR system], by Philip Greenspun

===System===
See [[../Canon_and_Nikon|Canon and Nikon]] for comparison between the systems; they are both excellent. Try them both out to see if either particularly delights you, and consider how you expect to use your camera, and whether either brand has particular strengths or weaknesses. If you have trouble deciding, price up what you expect to buy on either system and choose one if it's substantially cheaper than the other. Otherwise, flip a coin: they're both good.

=== Body ===
Which body is mostly determined by budget: the more you spend, the higher quality and more features. Some issues:
;weight: The largest DSLRs (like the 1Ds Mark III) are very heavy and bulky, which may bother you.
;full-frame: Several top-end DSLRs (currently Canon 1Ds, 5D, and Nikon D3, D3X, D770 and Sony α 900) are [[w:Full-frame digital SLR|full-frame]]. This is a substantially larger sensor and consequently yields much higher quality pictures; for some this is a sine qua non. However, this is more demanding on the lenses.
;high-speed: If you wish to do professional sports photography, the Canon 1D and the Nikon D3 have much higher speeds than the others.

===Lenses===
In general, one begins with a '''[[Photography_Equipment/Lenses/Overview#Standard_Lenses|standard lens]]''', and subsequently buys lenses as necessary for particular subjects. See [[../Lenses|lenses]] for details.

As a standard lens, most commonly people use the zoom lens that is included with the DSLR body (called the '''[[w:kit lens|kit lens]]'''). Indeed, many people use no other lenses, and thus reap relatively little of the flexibility benefits that a DSLR affords. Others decry this practice&lt;ref&gt;http://photo.net/equipment/building-a-digital-slr-system/&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest instead that one use a (prime) [[w:normal lens|normal lens]].

Kit lenses are not the highest quality zoom lenses, having low Image Quality and being slow (hence needed lots of light and not being capable of Depth of Field effects); they may be a good value though.

For a prime normal lens on a small sensor DSLR, the appropriate focal length is 50mm divided by the [[w:crop factor|crop factor]]. For APS-C Canons (EF-S: Rebel, 20D/30D/40D), this is 1.6x, so a normal lens is 31.25mm, or about 30mm. For APS-C Nikons (DX), this is 1.5x, so a normal lens is 33 1/3mm.

Some common recommendations follow.

===Film===
*[http://photo.net/equipment/medium-format/choosing Choosing a Medium Format Camera],  by Philip Greenspun
*[http://photo.net/equipment/large-format/choosing Choosing a Large Format Camera], by Philip Greenspun

===Digital===
MF backs exist that are similar to DSLR sensors: a full sensor. These are extremely expensive, but can be rented.

LF backs are '''scanning backs''': a sensor the size of a LF image would be prohibitively expensive, so instead one uses a row of sensors which scans across the image, with exposures measured in minutes. They are thus only suited for photography of static objects.

      <comment>/* Zero-input Response */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Example 1==

Consider the driven RLC circuit below. Determine the current in the circuit, ''y(t)'', given an input of &lt;math&gt;x(t)=8e^{-2t}&lt;/math&gt;. The initial current is 0A and the initial voltage across the capacitor is 2V. 

[[Image:System Response Example 1.svg|center]]

===Setting Up the Differential Equation===

Recall that the voltages across inductors, resistors and capacitors are related to the current as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;v_L=L \frac{di}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;v_R=iR \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;v_C=\frac{1}{C} \int i \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

By Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, we obtain the loop equation, replacing ''i'' with ''y(t)'':

::&lt;math&gt;x(t)=L \frac{dy(t)}{dt}+Ry(t)+\frac{1}{C} \int y(t) \,dt&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating with respect to ''t'' gives us:

::&lt;math&gt;\dot x(t)=L \ddot y(t)+R \dot y(t)+\frac{1}{C} y(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in the values gives us our differential equation decribing the system:

::&lt;math&gt;\dot x(t)= \ddot y(t)+ 4 \dot y(t)+ 3 y(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We want to put this into the following form:

::&lt;math&gt;Q(D)y(t)=P(D)x(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;{{eqn|System Equation}}
::&lt;math&gt; \left( D^2+4D+3 \right) y(t) = D x(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now we have our equation, we can begin to find the responses.

===Zero-input Response===

Zero-input response (ZIR) is the behaviour of the circuit when the input is null. Thus the differential equation to solve is:
{{eqn|Zero-Input Differential Equation}}
::&lt;math&gt;\left( D^2 + 4D + 3 \right) y(t) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

What we expect to see here is the capacitor discharging its initial charge through the resistor and inductor, subject to the initial conditions. The ratio of the component values will set the damping. Let's look at this first to get an idea of the behaviour of the circuit.

The equation can also be written as:

::&lt;math&gt; \left( D^2 + 2\zeta\omega_0 D + \omega_0^2 \right) y(t) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''&amp;zeta;'' is the [[w:damping ratio|damping ratio]], and ''&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the resonant frequency, found in the DE as the constant term in the polynomial:
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_0=\sqrt{3} \, \mbox{rad/s}&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore can solve for ''&amp;zeta;'':
::&lt;math&gt;2 \zeta \omega_0 = 4\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{4}{2 \sqrt{3}} \approx 1.15&lt;/math&gt;

This system is therefore over-damped, so we expect to see the current rising and decaying to zero without oscillation.

====Initial Conditions====

The initial conditions also need to be factored in before we can compute the ZIR. We know from the problem that the initial current is zero. However, the current's derivative is not explicitly given. However, the voltage across the capacitor is, so we can go back the loop voltage equation:

::&lt;math&gt;x(t)=v_L+v_R+v_C\,&lt;/math&gt;

We know that the input is zero, and that there is 2V across the capacitor. Also, as the current is zero, the resistor also has zero current across it. Thus:

::&lt;math&gt;0=v_L+0+2z\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;v_L=-2 \,\mbox{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The voltage across the inductor is linked to the derivative of the current:

::&lt;math&gt;v_L=L \dot y_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\dot y_0(t)= -2 &lt;/math&gt;

We now have enough initial conditions:
{{eqn|Zero-Input Initial Conditions}}
::&lt;math&gt;y_0(t)=0; \quad \dot y_0(t)=-2&lt;/math&gt;

====Solving the DE====

The characteristic equation is:

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda^2 + 4 \lambda + 3 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(\lambda+1)(\lambda+3)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

We have our characteristic roots:

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1=-1; \quad \lambda_2=-3&lt;/math&gt;

The general solution is:

::&lt;math&gt;y_0(t)=c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 e^{-3t}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Applying initial conditions:

::&lt;math&gt;     y_0(0)=  0 =   c_1 + c_2\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\dot y_0(0)= -2 = - c_1 - 3 c_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

Solving these simultaneous equations gives us:

::&lt;math&gt;c_1=-1; \quad c_2=1&lt;/math&gt;

The zero-input response is now:
{{eqn|Zero-Input Response}}
::&lt;math&gt;y_0(t)=-e^{-t}+e^{-3t}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Unit-impulse Response===
To find the unit input response, ''h(t)'', we consider the same differential equation as for the zero-input case above, but we consider the circuit with all inital values (current and voltage) at zero. To do this, we specify the following initial conditions, to find a sum of the characteristic modes of the system, ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(t)''.
{{eqn|Unit-Impulse Initial Conditions}}
::&lt;math&gt;y_0(t)=0; \quad \dot y_0(t)=1\,&lt;/math&gt;

The general solution is the same as before:

The general solution is:

::&lt;math&gt;y_n(t)=c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 e^{-3t}\,&lt;/math&gt;

However, solving for the coefficients yields a different specific solution:
::&lt;math&gt;c_1=\frac1 2; \quad c_2=-\frac1 2&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y_n(t)=\frac1 2 e^{-t} - \frac1 2 e^{-3t}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, recall that the original DE describing the circuit had a differential operator, ''P(D)'' on the right-hand side, acting on the input. Because we are now applying an input, we must take this into account. This is done by applying it to ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(t)''. In this case, it is a single derivative. The result of this is the unit-impulse response.

::&lt;math&gt;h(t)=P(D)y_n(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;h(t)=(D)y_n(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
{{eqn|Unit-Impulse Response}}
::&lt;math&gt;h(t)= -\frac1 2 e^{-t} + \frac3 2 e^{-3t}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is non-zero at ''t''=0, which appears to contradict our conditions. However, as the unit impulse lasts for an infinitesimal period, the circuit must suddenly &quot;jump&quot; to a different total energy instantly, or else it couldn't ever be excited by an impulse. In real life, a finite-duration signal will cause the circuit to ramp up rather than jump.

===Zero-state Response===

The zero-state response, ''y&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' is the response of the initially relaxed circuit to the input ''x(t)''. This is found by the convolution of the unit-impulse response and the input:

::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=h(t) * x(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

By the defnition of convolution:

::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=\int_0^t h(\tau) x(t-\tau) \, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=\int_0^t \left( -\frac1 2 e^{-\tau} + \frac3 2 e^{-3\tau} \right) \left( 8 e^{-2(t-\tau)} \right) \, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through:

::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=\int_0^t \left( -4 e^{-\tau} e^{-2(t-\tau)}+ 12 e^{-3\tau} e^{-2(t-\tau)} \right)  \, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=\int_0^t \left( -4 e^{-\tau} e^{2\tau}e^{-2 t)}+ 12 e^{-3\tau} e^{2\tau}e^{-2 t)} \right)  \, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Because the integral is with respect to ''&amp;tau;'', we can bring out the ''t'' term:

::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=e^{-2 t}\int_0^t \left( -4 e^{-\tau} e^{2\tau}+ 12 e^{-3\tau} e^{2\tau} \right)  \, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=e^{-2 t}\int_0^t \left( -4 e^{\tau} + 12 e^{-\tau} \right)  \, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=e^{-2 t} \left[ -4 e^{\tau} - 12 e^{-\tau} \right]_0^t&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=e^{-2 t} \left( -4 e^{t} - 12 e^{-t} + 4 + 12 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, multiplying out and combining exponentials gives us the zero-state response:
{{eqn|Zero-State Response}}
::&lt;math&gt;y_s(t)=-4 e^{-t} + 16 e^{-2t} - 12 e^{-3t}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the current is now zero at ''t''=0 again. For any realistic signal, this will happen, due to the inductor disallowing steps in current.

===Total Response===

The total response is given by the sum of the zero-input and zero-state components:

::&lt;math&gt;y_t(t)=y_{0}(t)+h(t) * x(t)\, &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_t(t)=-e^{-t}+e^{-3t}-4 e^{-t} + 16 e^{-2t} - 12 e^{-3t}\,&lt;/math&gt;{{eqn|Total Response}}
::&lt;math&gt;y_t(t)=-5 e^{-t} + 16 e^{-2t} - 11 e^{-3t}\,&lt;/math&gt;

We can plot the zero-input, zero-state, unit-impulse and total responses together:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Video Game Design ==
Video games have many different forms, from old arcade games to small hand held devices, simple flash games you play online to the newest hit for one of the big names in the industry that can cost more than a movie to make.

Like any other type of game, a video game can be simple or complex, quick or slow, and even require a great deal of practice or patience to get the hang of. A lot of people, however, do not really know what goes on behind the screen. You can see the moving symbols and colors, the sounds, and know that they react when you press buttons, but what actually is happening back there? 

Before designing a game for implementation, it is necessary to understand the industry you are getting into. Video Games have been around since 1931, today it is one of the fastest industries. Most new ideas in software developments are really new variations on old ideas. Some research will always provide new insights or ease the implementation of new approaches.

Today there are a myriad of different programming languages available to the amateur game designer, many of them freely available. There are also tools that allow you to create your own games without  programming. If you ever want to be a paid game designer, you will have to know a programming language or two. If, however you just want to make games for your own amusement, this is not required.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Abs ==

=== Function ===
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
positiveValue = abs( expr )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;abs&lt;/code&gt; function returns the absolute value of the numeric expression &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero. Thus, the number 3 has an absolute value of 3, while the number -12.34 has an absolute value of 12.34. The absolute value of zero is zero.

=== Notes ===
The standard &lt;code&gt;abs&lt;/code&gt; function can accept either an integer or a floating-point &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter.

FB provides also the &lt;code&gt;usr abs&lt;/code&gt; routine which originally used to execute faster with 68K applications. This is no longer the case, but the function is still present in the language for backward compatibility.

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns the arccosine of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in radians. In other words, if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents the cosine of some angle, then &lt;code&gt;ACOS(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns the angle. The returned angle will be in the range of 0 to π radians (which corresponds to 0 to 180 degrees). &lt;code&gt;ACOS&lt;/code&gt; always returns a double-precision result.

=== Function ===

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; . This is the (positive-valued) inverse of the &lt;code&gt;cosh&lt;/code&gt; function, so that &lt;code&gt;acosh( cosh( &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; ) )&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;abs( &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; )&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;acosh&lt;code&gt; always returns a double-precision result.

&lt;pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Expression &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and expression &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt; are each interpreted as 32-bit integer quantities. The &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; operator performs a &quot;bitwise comparison&quot; of each bit in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt; with the bit in the corresponding position in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt; . The result is another 32-bit quantity; each bit in the result is determined as follows:

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Bit value in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Bit value in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprB&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Bit value in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;result&amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Example ===
In the following example, expressions are evaluated as true or false before a decision is made for branching. The logical expression &lt;code&gt;time&gt;7&lt;/code&gt; is true, and is therefore evaluated as -1. The expression &lt;code&gt;time&lt;8.5&lt;/code&gt; is false, and is therefore evaluated as 0. Then the bitwise comparison (-1) &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; (0) is performed, resulting in zero. Finally, the &lt;code&gt;long&amp;nbsp;if&lt;/code&gt; statement interprets this zero result as meaning &quot;false,&quot; and therefore skips the first &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement.
&lt;pre&gt;
time = 9.5
long if time &gt; 7 and time &lt; 8.5
   print &quot;It is time for breakfast!&quot;
xelse
   print &quot;We have to wait 'til noon to eat!&quot;
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;
The example below shows how bits are manipulated with &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
defstr long
print bin$( 923 )
print bin$( 123 )
print &quot;--------------------------------&quot;
print bin$( 923 and 123 )
&lt;/pre&gt;
program output:
&lt;pre&gt;
00000000000000000000001110011011
00000000000000000000000001111011
--------------------------------
00000000000000000000000000011011
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Notes ===
In a statement like &lt;code&gt;if &lt;i&gt;expr1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;expr2&lt;/i&gt; then...&lt;/code&gt;, it is possible for &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;expr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to be false even though each individual &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated as true. Consider this example:
&lt;pre&gt;
JoeIsHere = 16
FredIsHere = 2
if JoeIsHere then print &quot;Joe's here&quot; else print &quot;Joe's gone&quot;
if FredIsHere then print &quot;Fred's here&quot;¬
  else print &quot;Fred's gone&quot;
long if JoeIsHere and FredIsHere
  print &quot;They're both here&quot;
xelse
  print &quot;They're NOT both here!&quot;
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;
program output:
&lt;pre&gt;
Joe's here
Fred's here
They're NOT both here!
&lt;/pre&gt;
This strange result happens because the expression &quot;&lt;code&gt;16 and 2&lt;/code&gt;&quot; evaluates to 0, which is then interpreted as &quot;false&quot; by the &lt;code&gt;long&amp;nbsp;if&lt;/code&gt; statement. This wouldn't have happened if we had set &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;JoeIsHere&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to -1 and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;FredIsHere&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to -1, because the expression &quot;&lt;code&gt;-1 and -1&lt;/code&gt;&quot; evaluates to -1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== FN Annuity# ==

=== Function ===
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
annuityFactor# = fn annuity#( rate, periods )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns the annuity factor for the given interest rate and number of periods. The interest rate should be expressed as a fraction of 1; for example, 5.2 percent should be expressed as 0.052.


=== Notes ===
&lt;code&gt;fn annuity#&lt;/code&gt; uses the following formula:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;annuityFactor\# = \frac {1-(1+rate) ^{periods}} {rate}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button[#] [-] id&amp;[, [state][, [value][, [min][, [max][, ¬
                     [title$][,[rect][, [type]]]]]]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revided ===
Feb 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;appearance button&lt;/code&gt; statement puts a new control in the current output window, or alters an existing control's characteristics. After you create a button using the &lt;code&gt;appearance&amp;nbsp;button&lt;/code&gt; statement, you can use the &lt;code&gt;[[Futurebasic/language/reference/dialog_function|dialog]]&lt;/code&gt; function to determine whether the user has clicked it. You can use the &lt;code&gt;[[Futurebasic/language/reference/button_close|button&amp;nbsp;close]] &lt;/code&gt;statement if you want to dispose of the button without closing the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first create a button with a specific ID (in a given window), you must specify all the parameters up to and including &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you later want to modify that button's characteristics, execute &lt;code&gt;appearance&amp;nbsp;button&lt;/code&gt; again with the same ID, and specify one or more of the other parameters (except &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which cannot be altered). The button will be redrawn using the new characteristics that you specified; any parameter that you don't specify will not be altered.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;id&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;a positive or negative integer whose absolute value is in the range 1 through 2147483647. The number you assign must be different from all other scroll bars or buttons in that window. Negative values build invisible buttons. Positive values build visible buttons.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The state may be:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;_grayBtn&lt;/code&gt; (0/disabled)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;_activebtn&lt;/code&gt; (1/default/active)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;_markedBtn&lt;/code&gt; (2/selected)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td nowrap&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;max&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;generally an integer value for the initial, minimum, and maximum values of a control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;title$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a string expression. This parameter is not used to set the text of buttons defined with &lt;code&gt;_kControlStaticTextProc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_kControlEditTextProc&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;code&gt;[[Futurebasic/language/reference/def_setbuttontextstring|def&amp;nbsp;SetButtonTextString]]&lt;/code&gt; for information on how this may be accomplished.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a rectangle in local window coordinates. You can express it in either of two forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;(x1,y1)-(x2,y2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;Two diagonally opposite corner points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;@rectAddr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Long integer expression or &lt;code&gt;pointer&lt;/code&gt; variable which points to an 8-byte struct such as a &lt;code&gt;Rect&lt;/code&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;any of the many types listed in the following text.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== New Things To Keep In Mind ====
On button creation, default values supplied for missing parameters (if any) are:
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_activeBtn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;max&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;title$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;null string&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

You can hide the control with either &lt;code&gt;button -1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;appearance button&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; -1&lt;/code&gt; and you can deactivate the control with either &lt;code&gt;button&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_grayBtn&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;appearance&amp;nbsp;button&amp;nbsp;1, _grayBtn&lt;/code&gt;. Buttons are commonly hidden and revealed as tab panes are brought into or removed from view. The same is true of panes that are changed in response to items such as group pop-up placards.
To read an appearance button's value, use either &lt;code&gt;x = button( id )&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;x = button( id, _FBGetCtlRawValue )&lt;/code&gt;

==== Summary of Appearance Helpers ====
&lt;p&gt;The following utility routines will help access information regarding the new appearance buttons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;actualSize = fn ButtonDataSize( btnID, part, tagName )&lt;br /&gt;
def GetButtonData( btnID, part, tagName, maxSize,&amp;not; theData, actualSize )&lt;br /&gt;
def SetButtonTextString( btnID, theString )&lt;br /&gt;
theString = fn ButtonTextString$( btnID )&lt;br /&gt;
def SetButtonFocus( btnID )&lt;br /&gt;
def GetButtonTextSelection( btnID, selStart, selEnd )&lt;br /&gt;
def SetButtonTextSelection( btnID, selStart, selEnd )&lt;/code&gt;

==== Button Types ====
The Appearance Manager introduces many new control definitions. While it is not our intention to completely document all of Apple's new buttons, a few possible types are shown below with examples on how each might be implemented.

==== Push Buttons ====
Since the Appearance Manager works in both System 9 and OS X, you will see major differences in how each control is presented. Common push buttons are shown below in both versions.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton01.gif&quot; alt=&quot;appearancebuttonhtm01&quot; height=&quot;496&quot; width=&quot;328&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton02.gif&quot; alt=&quot;appearancebuttonhtm02&quot; height=&quot;473&quot; width=&quot;312&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Push buttons in OS X&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Push buttons in System 9&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

So that you may see how each button was displayed, the following code shows that source used to generate the displays.
&lt;pre&gt;
/*
appearance button [#] [-] id&amp;amp;[, [state][, [value][,&amp;not;
[min][, [max][, [title$][,[rect][, [type]]]]]]]
*/
appearance button  bRef,_activeBtn,0,0,1,&amp;not;
    &quot;_kControlPushButtonProc&quot;,@r,_kControlPushButtonProc
appearance button  bRef,_activeBtn,0,0,1,&amp;not;
    &quot;_kControlBevelButtonSmallBevelProc&quot;,@r,&amp;not;
    _kControlBevelButtonSmallBevelProc
appearance button  bRef,_activeBtn,0,0,1,&amp;not;
    &quot;_kControlBevelButtonNormalBevelProc&quot;,@r,&amp;not;
    _kControlBevelButtonNormalBevelProc
appearance button  bRef,_activeBtn,0,0,1,&amp;not;
    &quot;_kControlBevelButtonLargeBevelProc&quot;,@r,&amp;not;
    _kControlBevelButtonLargeBevelProc
// &quot;value&quot; is menu ID
appearance button  bRef,_activeBtn,101,0,1,&amp;not;
    &quot;Bevel+_kControlBevelButtonMenuOnRight&quot;,@r,&amp;not;
    _kControlBevelButtonSmallBevelProc + &amp;not;
    _kControlBevelButtonMenuOnRight
// max value is cicn ID
appearance button  bRef,_activeBtn,0,0,256,&amp;not;
    &quot;_kControlPushButRightIconProc&quot;,@r, &amp;not;
    _kControlPushButRightIconProc
appearance button  bRef,_activeBtn,0,0,256,&amp;not;
    &quot;_kControlPushButLeftIconProc&quot;,@r,&amp;not;
    _kControlPushButLeftIconProc
// get rect from pict to determine button size
h = fn GetPicture( 256 )
long if h
  pR;8 = @h..picFrame%
  OffsetRect( pR, -pR.left, -pR.top )
  OffsetRect( pR, r.left, r.top )
// control &quot;value&quot; is pict ID
  appearance button  bRef,_activeBtn,256,0,1,&amp;not;
      &quot;_kControlPictureProc&quot;,@pR,_kControlPictureProc
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;
Not all possible push buttons (and their variations) are shown here. For example, the control that displays an arrow to indicate the presence of a menu was built with a small bevel. It would have been created with a large bevel by using
&lt;code&gt;_kControlBevelButtonLargeBevelProc + _kControlBevelButtonMenuOnRight&lt;/code&gt;

Other button types that you may wish to investigate are:
&lt;pre&gt;
_kControlIconProc
_kControlIconNoTrackProc
_kControlIconSuiteProc
_kControlIconSuiteNoTrackProc
_kControlPictureNoTrackProc
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Using Buttons to Group or Separate ====
FB buttons (which are Control Manager controls) can be grouped together, placed in placards or separated by lines. The following example creates buttons on a plain white background so that you may more easily see the drawing that is implemented by the control definition. We begin with the source code statements used to create the buttons.
&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button bRef,_activeBtn,0,0,1,&amp;not;
   &quot;_kControlGroupBoxTextTitleProc&quot;,@r,&amp;not;
   _kControlGroupBoxTextTitleProc
appearance button bRef,_activeBtn,0,0,1,&amp;not;
   &quot;_kControlGroupBoxSecondaryTextTitleProc&quot;,@r,&amp;not;
   _kControlGroupBoxSecondaryTextTitleProc
appearance button bRef,_activeBtn,1,0,1,&amp;not;
   &quot;_kControlGroupBoxCheckBoxProc&quot;,@r,&amp;not;
   _kControlGroupBoxCheckBoxProc
appearance button bRef,_activeBtn,1,0,1,&amp;not;
   &quot;_kControlGroupBoxSecondaryCheckBoxProc&quot;,@r,&amp;not;
   _kControlGroupBoxSecondaryCheckBoxProc
// min value is menu ID
appearance button  bRef,_activeBtn,1,101,1,&amp;not;
   &quot;&quot;,@r,_kControlGroupBoxPopUpButtonProc
appearance button bRef,_activeBtn,1,101,1,&amp;not;
   &quot;&quot;,@r,_kControlGroupBoxSecondaryPopUpButtonProc
appearance button bRef,_activeBtn,1,0,1,&amp;not;
   &quot;&quot;,@r,_kControlPlacardProc
appearance button bRef,_activeBtn,1,0,1,&amp;not;
   &quot;&quot;,@r,_kControlSeparatorLineProc
   &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton03.gif&quot; alt=&quot;appearancebuttonhtm03&quot; height=&quot;435&quot; width=&quot;346&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton04.gif&quot; alt=&quot;appearancebuttonhtm04&quot; height=&quot;429&quot; width=&quot;349&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Groups and Separators in OS X&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Groups and Separators in System 9
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Embedding Buttons ====
Part of the strength of Appearance Manager buttons is that one button may be embedded in another. By disabling or hiding the parent button (called a super control), all embedded controls would automatically be disabled or hidden. Each window has a primary control known as a root control. The following example builds a window with a parent radio group button. Inside of that parent are three radio buttons. We can determine which of the three buttons has been selected by getting the value (via the &lt;code&gt;button()&lt;/code&gt; function) of the parent button.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
dim r as Rect
dim pR as Rect
dim h as handle
dim bRef as long
dim err as OSErr
// setup
_btnHt = 20
_btnWd = 80
_btnMargin = 8
bRef = 1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton05.gif&quot; alt=&quot;appearancebuttonhtm05&quot; height=&quot;152&quot; width=&quot;103&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// create a window
SetRect( r, 0, 0, _btnWd_btnMargin_btnMargin, 120 )
appearance window 1,,@r
err = fn SetThemeWindowBackground( window( _wndPointer ),&amp;not;
   _kThemeActiveDialogBackgroundBrush, _zTrue )
// button #1 is the papa button
// note that the parent button has sufficient space so that
// it holds all embedded buttons within its own rectangle
SetRect( r ,_btnMargin, _btnMargin,&amp;not;
   _btnMargin_btnWd, (_btnMargin_btnHt)*3 )
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 0, 0, 1,&amp;not;
   &quot;&quot;, @r, _kControlRadioGroupProc
bRef ++
SetRect( r, _btnMargin, _btnMargin, _btnMargin_btnWd,&amp;not;
   _btnMargin_btnHt )
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 0, 0, 1,&amp;not;
   &quot;Radio 1&quot;, @r, _kControlRadioButtonProc
def EmbedButton( bRef, 1 )
bRef ++ : OffsetRect( r, 0, _btnHt_btnMargin )
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 0, 0, 1,&amp;not;
   &quot;Radio 2&quot;, @r, _kControlRadioButtonProc
def EmbedButton( bRef, 1 )
bRef ++ : OffsetRect( r, 0, _btnHt_btnMargin )
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 0, 0, 1,&amp;not;
   &quot;Radio 3&quot;, @r, _kControlRadioButtonProc
def EmbedButton( bRef, 1 )

  reference = dialog( action )
  long if action = _btnclick
    MoveTo( 8, 100 )
    print &quot;Current Button &quot;; button( 1 );
  end if
end fn

&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Check Boxes ====
Other than the obvious differences in physical appearance, check boxes generally follow the same guidelines as they have for many years. One notable exception to this rule is the ability to create a mixed check box. This box contains a dash instead of a check mark to show that part, but not all, of the current selection has a specific feature. This adds a new possible maximum value of 2 (&lt;code&gt;_kControlCheckBoxMixedValue = 2&lt;/code&gt;) to the control's range.

Possible check box values now include:

&lt;code&gt;_kControlCheckBoxUncheckedValue&lt;br&gt;
_kControlCheckBoxCheckedValue&lt;br&gt;
_kControlCheckBoxMixedValue&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton06.gif&quot; alt=&quot;appearancebuttonhtm04&quot; height=&quot;136&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check Boxes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buttons in the screen shot above were created using the following lines of code:
&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn,&amp;not;
   _kControlCheckBoxUncheckedValue, 0,&amp;not;
   _kControlCheckBoxMixedValue,&amp;not;
   &quot;Unchecked Check Box&quot;, @r, _kControlCheckBoxProc
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn,&amp;not;
   _kControlCheckBoxMixedValue, 0,&amp;not;
   _kControlCheckBoxMixedValue,&amp;not;
   &quot;Mixed Value Check Box&quot;, @r, _kControlCheckBoxProc
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn,&amp;not;
   _kControlCheckBoxCheckedValue, 0,&amp;not;
   _kControlCheckBoxMixedValue,&amp;not;
   &quot;Checked Check Box&quot;, @r, _kControlCheckBoxProc
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You cannot use &lt;code&gt;button bRef, state&lt;/code&gt; to tick and untick group buttons of type &lt;code&gt;_kControlGroupBoxCheckBoxProc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_kControlGroupBoxSecondaryCheckBoxProc&lt;/code&gt;. Use &lt;code&gt;appearance&amp;nbsp;button&amp;nbsp;bRef,,state-1&lt;/code&gt; instead. (&lt;code&gt;button&amp;nbsp;bRef,0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;button&amp;nbsp;bRef,1&lt;/code&gt; will however inactivate and activate the button respectively).

==== Time and Date Buttons ====
In addition to more common controls, the Appearance Manager can create buttons that manage dates and times. Special data structures are maintained to access the information from these controls, but by following a few simple examples, you can quickly master these skills.

The enhanced &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; function is useful for extracting complex data from controls. Two specific items come in to play:
&lt;pre&gt;
ignored = button( btnRef, _FBGetControlDate )
ignored = button( btnRef, _FBGetControlTime )
&lt;/pre&gt;
Referencing either of these functions will fill a global date/time record named &lt;code&gt;gFBControlLongDate&lt;/code&gt; and another named &lt;code&gt;gFBControlSeconds&lt;/code&gt;. The variable named &lt;code&gt;gFBControlSeconds&lt;/code&gt; is a signed 64 bit variable which may be saved in a file or used in any variable where compressed storage is required.

The format for &lt;code&gt;gFBControlLongDate&lt;/code&gt; is that of a &lt;code&gt;LongDateRec&lt;/code&gt; which follows the layout of the structure below:
&lt;pre&gt;
begin record LongDateRec
   dim era        as short
   dim year       as short
   dim month      as short
   dim day        as short
   dim hour       as short
   dim minute     as short
   dim second     as short
   dim dayOfWeek  as short
   dim dayOfYear  as short
   dim weekOfYear as short
   dim pm         as short
   dim res1       as short
   dim res2       as short
   dim res3       as short
end record
&lt;/pre&gt;
After calling the &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; function to examine the contents of a control, you may extract portions of the date/time as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
dayOfMonth = gFBControlLongDate.day
thisYear   = gFBControlLongDate.year
&lt;/pre&gt;
Another variable is maintained that holds the text for a specific date/time control. The contents of &lt;code&gt;gFBControlText&lt;/code&gt; (a Pascal string) are determined by the second &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; function parameter. When &lt;code&gt;_FBGetControlDate is&lt;/code&gt; used, it is the control's date. When &lt;code&gt;_FBGetControlTime&lt;/code&gt; is used, it is the control's time.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton07.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;283&quot; width=&quot;442&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
    Date/Time Buttons
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In addition to setting specific types when creating a date/time control, you must set an initial value of one of the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
_kControlClockNoFlags
_kControlClockIsDisplayOnly
_kControlClockIsLive
&lt;/pre&gt;
The specific statements used to create the Time/Date example follow:
&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 0, 0, 1,, @r,&amp;not;
   _kControlClockTimeProc
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, _kControlClockIsLive, 0, 1,,&amp;not;
   @r ,_kControlClockTimeSecondsProc
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, _kControlClockNoFlags,&amp;not;
   0, 1,, @r, _kControlClockDateProc
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, _kControlClockNoFlags,&amp;not;
   0, 1,, @r, _kControlClockMonthYearProc
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, &amp;not;
   _kControlClockIsLive_kControlClockIsDisplayOnly,&amp;not;
   0, 1,, @r, _kControlClockTimeSecondsProc
&lt;/pre&gt;
To extract and display the contents of a control, the following statements were created:
&lt;pre&gt;
err = button( bRef, _FBgetControlTime )
edit field bRef, gFBControlText, @r
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Wait States ====
The Appearance Manager provides several methods for telling the user that your application is busy with a task. These include chasing arrows, and finite and indeterminate progress bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton10.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/appearancebutton.htm15.gif&quot; height=&quot;144&quot; width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait States&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The chasing arrows control is easy to create and is self maintaining. Each time your program scans for events, the arrows are animated. The following statement creates a chasing arrows control:

&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 0, 0, 1,, @r,&amp;not;
   _kControlChasingArrowsProc
&lt;/pre&gt;
Progress bars are also easy to create, but you need to keep a couple of things in mind. First, the progress bar operates in a range of -32,768 to +32,767. If your task involves a greater number of steps, you will have to calculate a ratio to keep things within range. Second, the progress bar is updated by your program. This is as easy as setting a new value for the button, but it is code that you must write.

The minimum and maximum values for the control become the minimum and maximum values for the progress bar. The initial and current value show the current rate of progress. In the example above, the button was created using the following source:
&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 50, 0, 100,, @r,&amp;not;
   _kControlProgressBarProc
&lt;/pre&gt;
The minimum value was zero; maximum was 100. At the time of creation, the control value was 50, so the indicator shows colorization half way across the bar. If we wanted to indicate that the next step had been completed, we would use the following code:

&lt;pre&gt;appearance button bRef,, 51&lt;/pre&gt;
Indeterminate progress bars are more complex. After the button is created, you must set the control's internal data to a new value. The following code shows how:
&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 1, 0, 1,, @r,&amp;not;
   _kControlProgressBarProc
dim b   as boolean
dim err as OSErr
b = _true
err = fn SetControlData( bRef, 0,&amp;not;
   _kControlProgressBarIndeterminateTag, sizeof( boolean ), @b )
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Range Selectors (Sliders and Arrows) ====

&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton08.gif&quot; alt=&quot;appearancebuttonhtm02&quot; height=&quot;349&quot; width=&quot;146&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;There are many variations of the slider. Each begins with the simple type constant of &lt;code&gt;_kControlSliderProc&lt;/code&gt;. Additional parameters are added to this constant to add features to the control. The following constants are available for slider variations:
&lt;pre&gt;
_kControlSliderLiveFeedback
_kControlSliderHasTickMarks
_kControlSliderReverseDirection
_kControlSliderNonDirectional
&lt;/pre&gt;
To create a slider that uses an upward pointing indicator and has tickmarks, the following type would be used:
&lt;pre&gt;
_kControlSliderProc + ¬
   _kControlSliderHasTickMarks + ¬
   _kControlSliderReverseDirection
&lt;/pre&gt;
Vertical sliders are created by building the button with a vertical dimension that is greater than the horizontal dimension. The control definition handles the new orientation automatically.

Range Selectors
Sliders and Little Arrows


The following source lines show how this display was created:
&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 1, 1, 10,, @r,¬
   _kControlSliderProc
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 10, 1, 10,, @r,¬
   _kControlSliderProc_kControlSliderHasTickMarks
appearance button, _activeBtn, 1, 1, 10,, @r,¬
   _kControlSliderProc_kControlSliderNondirectional
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 1, 1, 10,, @r,¬
   _kControlSliderProc_kcontrolSliderReverseDirection
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 10, 1, 10,, @r,¬
   _kControlSliderProc_kControlSliderHasTickMarks +¬
   _kcontrolSliderReverseDirection

// vert orientation
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 10, 1, 10,, @r,¬
   _kControlSliderProc
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 10, 1, 10,, @r,¬
   _kControlSliderProc_kControlSliderNondirectional
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 10, 1, 10,, @r,¬
   _kControlSliderProc_kControlSliderHasTickMarks +¬
   _kcontrolSliderReverseDirection

appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 0, 0, 1,, @r,¬
   _kControlLittleArrowsProc
&lt;/pre&gt;
When sliders are created, the number of tick marks is set by the initial value of the control. After the control is created, the value is reset to the control minimum. Sliders range from a minimum value of -32,768 to a maximum of +32,767. The number of tick marks is something that you need to determine by balancing the size of the control against the range of the control's minimum/maximum value.

The little arrows (shown in the screen shot above) are used to increment and decrement a related visual counter (usually an edit field with a specific range of numbers). The current version of the OS X control definition is intolerant of variations in the value used for the height of this type of control. Our tests show that it must be exactly 22 pixels tall. Other values offset the arrows inside of the beveled area or, in more extreme cases, can place the arrows entirely outside of the beveled area.

==== Pop-Up Menus ====

There are two distinct types of pop-up menus: beveled, and standard. Both are valid types and the particular use of one over the other is something that should be guided by your individual application and by [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/chapter_1_section_1.html|&lt;i&gt;Apple's Human Interface Guidelines&lt;/i&gt;]. Beveled buttons are created as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, menuID, 0, 1,&amp;not;
   &quot;Bevel+_kControlBevelButtonMenuOnRight&quot;,&amp;not;
   @r, _kControlBevelButtonSmallBevelProc + &amp;not;
   _kControlBevelButtonMenuOnRight
 &lt;/pre&gt;
When bevel-button menus are created, the initial value for the control is the resource ID number of the menu. Three specific &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; function commands may be used to extract information from the control.
&lt;pre&gt;
handle       = button( bRef, _FBgetBevelControlMenuHandle )
currentItem  = button( bRef, _FBgetBevelControlMenuVal )
previousItem = button( bRef, _FBgetBevelControlLastMenu )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton11.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;237&quot; width=&quot;283&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Pop-Up Menu Buttons
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Standard pop-up buttons follow slightly different syntax. When creating, the minimum value specifies the menu resource ID and the maximum value is the width of the title for the menu. Passing in a menu ID of -12345 causes the popup not to try and get the menu from a resource. Instead, you can build the menu and later stuff the menuhandle field in the popup data information (using &lt;code&gt;def&amp;nbsp;SetButtonData( id&amp;amp;,  _kControlMenuPart, _kControlPopupButtonMenuHandleTag, sizeof( handle ), @yourMenuHndl )&lt;/code&gt;). You can pass -1 in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;max&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to have the control calculate the width of the title on its own instead of guessing and then tweaking to get it right. It adds the appropriate amount of space between the title and the popup. A maximum value of zero means, &quot;Don't show the title.&quot;

After creation you might need to change the value, minimum and maximum to the correct settings for your pop-up menu with:
&lt;pre&gt;appearance button id&amp;amp;,, value, min, max&lt;/pre&gt;
The standard pop-up button menu in the above illustration was created with the following code:
&lt;pre&gt;appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 0, 101, -1, &quot;Pop Title:&quot;&amp;not;
   ,@r, _kControlPopUpButtonProc
   &lt;/pre&gt;
A single &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; function provides access to the menu handle. Remember: standard and beveled pop-up menus do not use the same &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; function constants.
&lt;pre&gt;menuHandle = button( bRef,  _FBgetControlMenuHandle )&lt;/pre&gt;
You can retrieve the current pop-up menu item with:
&lt;pre&gt;mItem = button( bRef )&lt;/pre&gt;

==== List Boxes ====

Lists generally use an auxiliary resource to define their format. The resource type used is 'ldes' and a definition for it can be created using Resourcerer 2.4 or later or by creating a template in any resource editor. You may also format a handle to match the &lt;code&gt;_&amp;quot;ldes&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; record and save that handle as a resource. The resource ID for the ldes is passed in the '&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;' parameter when creating the control. You may pass zero in value which would tell the List Box control to not use a resource. The list will be created with default values, and will use the standard &lt;code&gt;LDEF (0)&lt;/code&gt;. You can change the list by getting the list handle. You can set the LDEF by using the tag below (&lt;code&gt;_kControlListBoxLDEFTag&lt;/code&gt;) in conjunction with &lt;code&gt;def&amp;nbsp;SetButtonData&lt;/code&gt;.

A list box resource is defined as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
begin record ldes
   dim versionNumber   as short
   dim numberOfRows    as short
   dim numberOfColumns as short
   dim cellHeight      as short
   dim cellWidth       as short
   dim hasVertScroll   as boolean
   dim filler1         as byte
   dim hasHorizScroll  as boolean
   dim filler2         as byte
   dim LDEFresID       as short
   dim hasSizeBox      as boolean
   dim reserved        as byte
end record
&lt;/pre&gt;
The following example creates a list box from a resource with an ID of 256. Then it fills the list with item text.

To simplify this example, Resourcerer was used to create the list box resource.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton12.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/appearancebutton.htm18.gif&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; width=&quot;329&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Creating an ldes Resource
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
appearance button bRef, _activeBtn, 256, 0, 1,&amp;not;
   &quot;List Box&quot;, @r, _kControlListBoxProc
dim cH          as handle        //control handle
dim @bufferSize as long
dim @lH         as handle        //list handle
dim y,t$
dim @celly,cellX                 //cell &quot;point&quot; record
cH = button&amp;amp;( bRef )
err = fn GetControlData( cH, 0,&amp;not;
   _kControlListBoxListHandleTag, &amp;not;
   sizeof( handle ),  lH, bufferSize )
cellX = 0
for cellY = 0 to 9
  t$ = &amp;quot;Item #&amp;quot; + mid$( str$( cellY + 1 ), 2 )
  LSetCell( @t$[1], t$[0], celly, lH )
next
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton09.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;148&quot; width=&quot;166&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
List Box
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Tab Buttons ====

Tab buttons will require more work than other controls. This stems from the fact that tabs are really several controls that act in unison. First is the main tab control. When this is created you specify the number of tabs that will be present by setting the max value of the control. It is generally better to create the tab button invisibly (by using a negative button reference number) then show it by issuing a &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; statement with the positive version of the reference number.

After the initial shell is built for the tab, you must set the title for each tab using &lt;code&gt;def&amp;nbsp;SetButtonData&lt;/code&gt;. Then a user pane is inserted for each tab. These are embedded in the tab shell using &lt;code&gt;def&amp;nbsp;EmbedButton&lt;/code&gt;. Buttons that will reside in each user pane are created and embedded in the user pane.

When a dialog event is encountered, the value of the tab shell button corresponds to the position of the clicked tab in the tab list. Your program must loop through each user pane and show or hide them so that the display matches the clicked tab.

Study the following example to see how a working tab button is created. Be sure to note the simple &lt;code&gt;dialog&lt;/code&gt; handler that maintains the buttons.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancebutton13.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;233&quot; width=&quot;312&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Tab Buttons
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

There are many styles of tab buttons:
&lt;pre&gt;
_kControlTabLargeProc
_kControlTabSmallProc
_kControlTabLargeNorthProc
_kControlTabSmallNorthProc
_kControlTabLargeSouthProc
_kControlTabSmallSouthProc
_kControlTabLargeEastProc
_kControlTabSmallEastProc
_kControlTabLargeWestProc
_kControlTabSmallWestProc
&lt;/pre&gt;
This example uses &lt;code&gt;_kControlTabSmallProc&lt;/code&gt;, but you should experiment with other types to see the results.
&lt;pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Appearance Window ==

=== Statement ===
✔ Appearance χ Standard χ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
appearance window [#][-] id&amp;[, [title$][, [rect][, ¬
                  [windowClass][, [windowAttributes] [, [FBAttributes]]]]]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
=== Revised ===
Feb 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
Use this statement to do any of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Create a new screen window;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Activate (highlight and bring to the front) an existing window;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Make an existing window visible or invisible;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Alter the title or rectangle of an existing window.&lt;/li&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;appearance window&lt;/code&gt; statement closely follows the older &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; statement, but is used primarily for the creation of windows. You may freely mix &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; functions and &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; statements with windows that are created via the &lt;code&gt;appearance&amp;nbsp;window&lt;/code&gt; statement. For instance, after creating a window with the &lt;code&gt;appearance&amp;nbsp;window&lt;/code&gt; statement, you could determine its size with the &lt;code&gt;window( _width )&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;window( _height )&lt;/code&gt; functions.

You may notice that windows in most modern applications have a background that is something other than white. This is not accomplished by drawing into the window with graphic commands. It is put in place with a simple call to the &lt;i&gt;Theme Manager&lt;/i&gt;. The following line will be useful in many programs.
&lt;pre&gt;
def SetWindowBackground( _kThemeActiveDialogBackgroundBrush, _zTrue )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancewindow01.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;98&quot; width=&quot;311&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancewindow02.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;98&quot; width=&quot;312&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows with and without theme backgrounds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
The parameters for &lt;code&gt;appearance window&lt;/code&gt; should be specified as follows. They are interpreted slightly differently depending on whether you are creating a new window or altering an existing one.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - a positive or negative integer whose absolute value is in the range 1 through 2147483647.
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;title$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - a string expression.
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - a rectangle in global screen coordinates. You can express it in either of two forms:

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td nowrap&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;(x1,y1)-(x2,y2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Two diagonally opposite corner points.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; &gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;@rectAddr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Long integer expression or &lt;code&gt;pointer&lt;/code&gt; variable which points to an 8-byte struct such as a &lt;code&gt;Rect&lt;/code&gt; type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowClass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - an unsigned long integer that specifies the Macintosh window class. This is not the same value as FB's user definable class for the standard runtime. It more closely represents the layer in which a window will reside. To create a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowClass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; variable use the following syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
dim wc as WindowClass
&lt;/pre&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowClass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; table introduces some new terms which may not be familiar to those new to OS X.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancewindow03.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;67&quot; width=&quot;237&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Window with toolbar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
A sheet window is attached to a parent window. It drops from the title bar of the parent and is used to force some decision relative to the parent window.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;a/appearancewindow04.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; width=&quot;197&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Sheet window&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;th&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowClass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kAlertWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;I need your attention now.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kMovableAlertWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;I need your attention now, but I'm kind enough to let you switch out of this app to do other things&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kModalWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;system modal, not draggable&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kMovableModalWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;application modal, draggable&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kFloatingWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;floats above all other application windows. Available in OS 8.6 or later&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kDocumentWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;document windows&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kDesktopWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;the desktop&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kHelpWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;10&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;11&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;sheets&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kToolbarWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;12&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;floats above docs, below floating windows&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kPlainWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;13&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;plain&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kOverlayWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;14&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;overlays&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kSheetAlertWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;15&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;sheet alerts&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_kAltPlainWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;16&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;plain alerts&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;FBAttributes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - this long integer sets up handling procedures that are used by the runtime. Some of the features used in the Standard BASIC runtime are not carried forward for the Appearance Runtime. For example, &lt;code&gt;_noAutoClip&lt;/code&gt; is not used because there is no such thing as &lt;code&gt;autoclip&lt;/code&gt; in Appearance.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Constant&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;FB Attribute&lt;/th&gt;
	&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_updateVisRgn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2048&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;This attribute affects how the window’s clip region will be set when FutureBASIC calls your dialog-event handling routine with a &lt;code&gt;_wndRefresh&lt;/code&gt; event. If you specify this attribute, the clip region will be set to include only that part of the window which was identified as actually needing a refresh (the clip region will be reset to its previous value when the routine exits). If you omit this attribute, the clip region will be set to include the entire window (possibly excluding controls, edit fields, etc.)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_clickThru&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;This attribute affects what happens when your program activates the window in response to a &lt;code&gt;_wndClick&lt;/code&gt; event. If the &lt;code&gt;_clickThru&lt;/code&gt; attribute is set, the activating click will be “passed through” to the window; this may cause other events (such as &lt;code&gt;_btnClick&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_efClick&lt;/code&gt;) to be generated, depending on what was clicked on. If you omit this attribute, two separate clicks are required to activate the window and to interact with its contents.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_noAutoFocus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;32768&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;Use this attribute to prevent the tab key from advancing the keyboard focus in edit fields&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td nowrap&gt;&lt;code&gt;_keepInactive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;65536&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;This attributes insures that the window will never be activated. Controls in the window will not function If you bring the window forward under program control (&lt;code&gt;WINDOW&lt;/code&gt; statement) it will behave normally. This type of window is intended for use as a backdrop.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
==== To Create a New Screen Window ====
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Specify an &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; value such that &lt;code&gt;abs( &lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt; )&lt;/code&gt; is different from the ID number of any existing window. A new window is created and is assigned an ID number of &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. You can use the window's ID number later to identify the window in other FB statements&amp;nbsp;and functions. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is negative, the window is created invisibly; it's sometimes useful to create a window invisibly if it will contain controls, edit fields and graphics that&amp;nbsp;may take a long time to build. You can use the &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; statement again to make&amp;nbsp;an invisible window visible (see below). When you create a new window, it becomes&amp;nbsp;the current output window. If you create it visibly (and you don't specify the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt; attribute), it also becomes the current active window.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;title$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; assigns a string to the window's title bar (if the window has a title bar). If&amp;nbsp;you omit this parameter, the window will be created without a title.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies the initial size and location of the window's content rectangle. Note&amp;nbsp;that &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not include the window's frame. This parameter is interpreted in a special way if you specify an upper-left coordinate of (0,0) in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; in this case, the&amp;nbsp;window is centered in the screen, and its width and height are determined by the right&amp;nbsp;and bottom coordinates of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Note that this special interpretation applies only&amp;nbsp;when you're creating a new window. If you omit this parameter, a window of a&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;default&amp;quot; size and location is created.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowClass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies the layer in which a window will reside.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowAttributes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies the types of window widgets (close box, grow box)&amp;nbsp;that a window will include.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;FBAttributes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies runtime handling parameters that determine how the window&amp;nbsp;will behave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Append ==

=== Statement ===
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
append [#]fileID
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement moves the file mark, in the currently-open file indicated by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;fileID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, to the end-of-file position (without overwriting any of the existing data in the file). This causes subsequent file output statements such as &lt;code&gt;print#&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;write#&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&amp;nbsp;file#&lt;/code&gt; to append data to the end of the file.

=== Example ===
In the following, note that we open the output file using the &lt;b&gt;&quot;R&quot;&lt;/b&gt; method. This is because opening with the &lt;b&gt;&quot;O&quot;&lt;/b&gt; method causes the &amp;quot;end-of-file&amp;quot; mark to move to the beginning of the file, effectively erasing any existing data.
&lt;pre&gt;
a$ = &quot;TESTING...&quot;
open &quot;R&quot;, 1, fileName$,, wdRefNum% 'Open an existing file
append #1                          'Set file pointer to end
write #1, a$;25                    'Add data to end of file
close #1                           'Close file
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Apple Menu ==

=== Statement ===
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard χ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
apple menu string$
&lt;/pre&gt;
=== Description ===
This statement inserts one or more items at the top of the Apple Menu, and separates them from the existing Apple Menu items with a grey dividing line. The items you add are visible only while your application is frontmost. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter contains the text of the item(s); to add multiple items, separate them with semicolons in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Certain &amp;quot;meta characters&amp;quot; in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; have special interpretations; see the &lt;code&gt;menu&lt;/code&gt; statement for more information.

After you add items to the Apple Menu, you can use the &lt;code&gt;menu&lt;/code&gt; function to detect when the user selects one of the items you've added.

If you execute &lt;code&gt;apple menu&lt;/code&gt; more than once, any items you added to the Apple Menu previously will be completely replaced.

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
apple menu &quot;About this program...;About Me...&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;a/applemenu01.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;221&quot; height=&quot;105&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;

=== Notes ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== AppleEventMessage$ ==

=== Function ===
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
string$ = AppleEventMessage$
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
May, 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
When your application (also referred to as your process) receives an Apple Event message and the event class is &lt;code&gt;_&amp;quot;TEXT&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, FB will retrieve the event data as a Pascal string when this function is invoked.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Asc ==

=== Function ===
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
ASCIIcode% = asc( string$ )
ASCIIcode% = asc( container$$ )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
July 28, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Description ===
Returns the ASCII character code for the first character in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. (A character code is a numeric value in the range of 0 through 255 that represents a specific character in the &lt;i&gt;American Standard Code for Information Interchange&lt;/i&gt; (ASCII).) If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;(or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) contains no characters, then &lt;code&gt;asc(&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt; returns zero.

The ASCII character codes between 32 and 127 represent standard characters which generally remain the same from one font family to another. Codes greater than 127 represent different sets of characters depending on the font. Codes below 32 usually represent non-printing &amp;quot;characters.&amp;quot;

=== Notes ===
If the string is a single-character literal, such as &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;, then you should consider using the underscore-literal syntax instead, as in this example:
&lt;pre&gt;
ASCIIcode% = _&quot;G&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The above code executes much faster than &lt;code&gt;ASCIIcode% = asc( &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; )&lt;/code&gt;.

You can use the following syntax to return the ASCII code of the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;-th character in a string variable &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
ASCIIcode% = stringVar$[n]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;code&gt;[[Futurebasic/language/reference/chrstring | chr$]]; &lt;/code&gt;[[Futurebasic/language/ascii_codes | Appendix F: &lt;i&gt;ASCII Character Codes&lt;/i&gt;]]

=== Function ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
radianAngle# = asin( expr )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns the arcsine of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in radians. In other words, if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents the sine of some angle, then &lt;code&gt;asin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns the angle. The returned angle will be in the range of -π/2 to +π/2 radians (which corresponds to -90 to +90 degrees). &lt;code&gt;asin&lt;/code&gt; always returns a double-precision result.

=== Notes ===

=== Function ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
result# = asinh( expr )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns the inverse hyperbolic sine of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This is the inverse of the &lt;code&gt;sinh&lt;/code&gt; function, so that &lt;code&gt;asinh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;(sinh(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;))&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;asinh&lt;/code&gt; always returns a double-precision result.

=== Description ===
Returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Atn ==

=== Function ===
✔  Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
radianAngle# = atn( expr )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns the arctangent of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in radians. In other words, if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents the tangent of some angle, then &lt;code&gt;atn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns the angle. The returned angle will be in the range of -π/2 to +π/2 radians (which corresponds to -90 to +90 degrees). &lt;code&gt;atn&lt;/code&gt; always returns a double-precision result.

=== Example ===
Because &lt;code&gt;atn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;(1)&lt;/code&gt; equals π/4, you can use &lt;code&gt;atn&lt;/code&gt; to get a value for π.
&lt;pre&gt;
dim pi#
end globals

pi = atn( 1 ) * 4
print pi
&lt;/pre&gt;
Program output:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Occasionally the way the [http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/dtt/dtt.cgi Freeview channels] are organised is shuffled about a bit.  Sometimes new channels are added, some stop broadcasting, there are name changes, or things are just moved about for technical reasons.  This shuffling can sometimes confuse the Toppy (and other Freeview receivers) with symptoms such as missing EPG data or the wrong channel being displayed.

To remedy this you will need to do a [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Quick Channel Scan|rescan]] to get the correct channel list.  If just a few channels are affected then you may be able to simply [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Delete Channel|delete the old channels]] and scan for the new ones, but it's usually safest to do a Factory Reset (which will also delete all your current timers) and then a complete [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Quick Channel Scan|rescan]].

If you are running an [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/EPG Old Firmwares|older firmware]] (pre-&quot;Bastille&quot;, 5.12.88) then the EPG data for some channels may be missing because the specific broadcaster is having a bad day and is not sending it (or [http://www.bbc.co.uk/reception/transmitters/index.shtml transmitter problems or maintenance]).  This is much less likely to be a problem on newer firmwares which can collect ''all'' the EPG data from ''any'' single channel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/New Book Page}}

== Design Patterns ==

Developing books do not emerge fully-formed and in a perfect book shape. The process for creating a book can cause a book to take many forms which are not in themselves acceptable here at Wikibooks. However, so long as progress is continuous, various stages of books can not only be accepted here in the short-term, but also can be beneficial tools to book authors. 

Books are large projects, and it is generally not conceivable that an author will be able to write, to completion, one page at a time in a linear fashion. In fact, it should be assumed that most authors are only transient members here at Wikibooks, and that they could abandon their work here at any time. 

With this in mind, an author who wants to see their books succeed in the long-term should develop their book while attempting to maximize the ability for future authors to take over if the original author should leave suddenly. Books should start as a clear plan, such as a pagelist or an outline. From the outline, a page should progress to one of several intermediate forms. These intermediate forms allow a book to increase in size and information content rapidly, without needing to worry extensively about organization or formatting. After a book has expanded significantly in one of these intermediate forms, editors, revisers, and reviewers can polish the book to make it better and eventually make it a featured book. The general design pattern for a book that allows other authors to quickly and easily pick up where the original author left off is:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Outline &amp;rarr; Intermediate Form &amp;rarr; Book &amp;rarr; Featured Book&lt;/div&gt;

=== Warning About Intermediate Forms ===

Notice that intermediate forms are not considered stable books. If a book in an intermediate form is long abandoned, it runs a high risk of being deleted. Stubs are relatively well tolerated on Wikibooks, and a large portion of our community will resist deleting them unless they are in particularly bad shape. Macropedias are against policy, and unless a transwiki will significantly improve content at Wikipedia (which is unlikely), macropedias can be quickly deleted. This is a case that is counter-intuitive: Where a book in notably better condition (a macropedia) can be deleted easier than a book in worse condition (a stub).  Course-like books are better-tolerated than macropedias are, but they still run the risk of being transwikied to [[v:|Wikiversity]] if you don't pay close attention to them.

== Outlines ==

Outlines are not necessarily stubs because they do not need to contain any content. Outlines are a great way to plan and prepare a book, but a free-standing outline that has been long-abandoned by it's original authors are generally not helpful or valuable. In fact, they can be counter-productive because they set up a framework that other editors will be compelled to follow, but they don't provide any foothold where a new contributor can start working quickly. An empty outline is a set of limitations and no benefits, and this situation can be discouraging enough to a new contributor to drive them to start a separate book, or even leave Wikibooks entirely.

{{User:Whiteknight/Note|Rule|Use outlines for your personal planning work. DO NOT leave a book as a bare outline for long}}

The outline phase of a book should be brief. Outlines should quickly be filled with at least a base amount of content so that future authors and editors have some raw material to work with. There are tfour major directions that an outline can progress in:

;Stubs:A small amount of text can be added to all or most of the pages in an outline to convert it to a stub. Stubs should contain basic information about the subject and the organization, so that future authors know what to write and where to write it. Following a form is much easier when there are guidelines. Books in this condition will likely be marked with {{tlx|Stub}} or {{tlx|Book stub}} templates.
;Macropedias:Pages can be seeded with articles imported from Wikipedia. In these early stages they become a &quot;macropedia&quot;, which is like a collection of encyclopedia articles on a single topic. Macropedias created by importing text from Wikipedia will need to be extensively de-formatted (dewikified) before future authors can begin to contribute book-like content in a meaningful way. Macropedias that are made in other ways, such as students creating encyclopedia-like chapters as part of a class project, don't need to be dewikified but they will need to be integrated together to form a smooth narrative.
;Courses:During the progression of a school course, information can be &quot;dumped&quot; into the page as it is received. This means that things like lecture notes, reading notes, assignments and their solutions, and other information received through a course can be uploaded as they are learned. Course-like materials do not need to be de-formatted like Wikipedia articles need to be, but they often need to be restructured, organized, and edited extensively.
;Content Dump:A content dump is where we start with an outline and quickly add large volumes of unstructured information to it. Content dumps lack the structure of the other types of growth patterns, but can grow at some of the quickest rates. Notice that content dumps will need major rearranging, revising to produce a consistent narrative, and formatting to make the book more attractive and approachable.

=== Link List ===

A step up from an outline is a link list. Link lists are collections of links to other books, other wikis (such as [[commons:|Commons]], [[w:|Wikipedia]], or [[s:|Wikisource]]), or other places where information about the subject can be obtained. Link lists can be helpful in organizing resources and finding places to import raw material from, but they are also very dangerous. Link lists or &quot;Link farms&quot; are a violation of policy, and they likely will be deleted if they do not evolve quickly. If you would like to maintain a list of resources for your own use, it is typically better to do it in your own userspace where many such content policies do not apply.

== Stubs ==

Stubs are a page, or several pages, with only a brief amount of starter text. This starter text can often explain what the page is going to cover, and provide a small amount of introductory text that other authors can help to expand. A &quot;good stub&quot; should:

#Explain clearly what the page will cover
#Provide a brief introduction to the topic
#Provide an organizational framework (named headings, for instance) to help show where information should go. 

Stubs that do not contain this information are likely to be more of a hindrance than a help to future authors, and should likely be deleted.

== Macropedias ==

A great way for some books to get started is to import related articles from Wikipedia. Wikipedia articles, after being deformatted, contain large amounts of information that can eventually be revised and rearranged to form a book module. This task isn't an easy one, but often times starting with a full page of information can help the author to see what information needs to be incorporated in the page. 

Macropedias are not allowed as a final product, but they are an acceptable first stage in constructing a new book.

== Courses ==

New books started by groups, such as class projects, often take the form of the group that created them. This means that class groups will tend to create books that follow the outline for a school course. 

As in a macropedia, above, sometimes a book can get off to a great start by first dumping information on the page in a formless manner, and then shaping that book later. In that vein, a course-like book can be viewed as an early production phase for a proper book. Often, books in a course-like stage can be easily forked to Wikiversity, so that both an online course and the accompanying textbook can be in development simultaneously. 

=== Metadata ===

Groups, especially class groups, tend to require a certain amount of hierarchical organization among their members. This organization often plays out in the book in the form of group meta-data such as &quot;attendance&quot; sheets, notes about which group members are working on which chapters, information about the project itself so that other contributors understand what's going on, et cetera. This metadata should likely be confined to the talk pages, although sometimes this isn't an attractive short-term option. 

Whenever metadata is being stored in the book namespace, the long term goal should be for that data to be distilled to it's important components and moved to a special location on a page entitled &quot;About This Book&quot;, or &quot;Authors&quot;, or something similar. You should always be mindful that long after your group has finished working on the book, other authors will be working on it and will want to add their own names to the list of authors. They may even want to get in touch with you later to let you know how things are going.

== Book == 

A book is not just a collection of information like a macropedia or a course-like book will be. Books should be unified and continuous with a central narrative that builds on old information in order to present new information. Starting with an intermediate form, authors should:

#Rearrange materials into a logical order. Easy, fundamental concepts should go in the beginning, and more advanced concepts should be moved towards the end. Vocabulary words should be defined before they are used in the text. 
#Format material like a book. Long lists of bullet points or long numbered lists should be replaced with paragraphs of prose. Beyond just simple prose, a book should be written in such a way that readers will be able to learn from it, and not just be a simple presentation of facts or figures. 
#Remove excess markup. Excessive markup, such as large numbers of wikilinks, bold and italics text, and large lists should be removed. Markup should be used to enhance certain points, but not be used so often as to distract the reader. 

== Featured Book ==

The last development stage for a book, but certainly not the end of development, is for the book to become featured.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to the FB Language == 
An FB program consists of a series of statements, and optional statement labels. Usually you will 
write each statement on a separate line; however, it’s possible to put multiple statements on a 
single line, and conversely a single statement may span multiple lines: 

You can write multiple statements on a single line by separating each pair of statements with a 
colon, as in this example: 
&lt;pre&gt;
A = 7 * B : Print score(A) : Fn doSum(x) 

&lt;/pre&gt;
If a line ends with the continuation character, the (last) statement on that line continues on the 
next line. The continuation character looks like this: ¬, and it is typed by entering Option-L. 
Example: 
&lt;pre&gt;
myArray(numberDogs, numberCats, numberPorcupines) ¬ 
        = Fn createMenagerie(Mid$(animalName$(x), ¬ 
        nameOffset, 4), vetNumber) 
&lt;/pre&gt;
While you can safely insert a line-break character [option-L] in a quoted string, elsewhere it is 
wise to only insert line-break characters between statements, and definitely not to mix them with 
block statement. For those who still use line numbers, Any line in your program (except lines 
which follow a continuation character) may begin with a line number. 

Certain special statements mark the beginning or end of a “block structure.” A statement which 
opens or closes a block structure should not appear with any other statement on the same line. 
Such statements include the following: 

&lt;pre&gt;
#If...  #Else... #EndIf 
Begin Enum... End Enum 
Begin Globals... End Globals 
Begin Record... End Record 
BeginAssem... EndAssem 
Compile Long If... Compile Xelse... Compile End If  
Dim Record... Dim End Record 
Do... Until 
EnterProc... ExitProc 
EnterProc%... ExitProc% 
For... Next 
Local Fn... End Fn 
Long Fn... End Fn 
Long If... Xelse...End If  
Select Case... End Select Case 
While... Wend
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Line Numbers ===
Any line in your program (except lines which follow a continuation character) may begin with a 
line number. A line number must be an integer in the range 1 through 65534, and no two lines 
may have the same number. At least one space character should separate the line number from the 
first statement in the line. Example: 
&lt;pre&gt;
140 Print &quot;Hello&quot;: Beep 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Line numbers can be useful for identifying a particular location in your program, as a target for 
statements such as &lt;code&gt;Goto&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Gosub&lt;/code&gt;. However, line numbers are considered an antiquated syntax 
feature, and their use is generally discouraged.

=== Statement Labels === 
A statement label is another way to identify a particular location in your program. A statement 
label must appear on a line by itself, and the same label can’t appear more than once in your 
program. Depending on your Preferences settings, you can express a statement label in the 
following ways: 

A string of characters inside double-quotes. Example: 
&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;My First Label&quot; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
A string of non-space characters followed by a colon. This kind of label is only available if the 
“Allow QuickBasic Labels” preference is set (See the Editor manual). Example: 
&lt;pre&gt;
Label17: 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Like line numbers, statement labels can be useful if your program contains statements like &lt;code&gt;Goto&lt;/code&gt; 
or &lt;code&gt;Gosub&lt;/code&gt;; or if your program uses the &lt;code&gt;Line&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Proc&lt;/code&gt; functions.
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that when the preference for QuickBASIC labels is turned on a 
FutureBASIC statement may look like a QuickBASIC label to the compiler. Example: 
&lt;pre&gt;
Print:Stop:Rem this won't work with QB labels On 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Because QuickBASIC labels require that no space be present between the text and the colon, you 
can side step possible errors as follows: 
&lt;pre&gt;
Print : Stop : Rem note the space before the colon 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Executable and Non-executable Statements ===
Every statement in FB is either an executable statement or a non-executable statement. 

Executable statements represent instructions which are to be performed when the program is 
run. When you run your program, a given executable statement may be performed once, or 
more than once, or not at all, depending on the program conditions. The order in which 
executable statements are performed is not necessarily the same as the order in which they 
appear in your program. Examples of executable statements are: &lt;code&gt;Print&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;Let&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;Open&lt;/code&gt;. 

Non-executable statements represent instructions which tell the FB compiler how to build your 
program. They help the compiler to determine how to allocate memory, and how to interpret 
and compile other statements in your program. The order in which non-executable statements 
appear in your program is important: when the compiler builds your program, it scans all 
statements from top to bottom, and a non-executable statement can only affect the 
interpretation of lines which appear below it. You cannot change the effect of a non-executable 
statement by putting it inside a “conditional execution” block such as &lt;code&gt;Long If...End If&lt;/code&gt;, or 
&lt;code&gt;For...Next&lt;/code&gt;. However, you can conditionally include or exclude a non-executable statement 
from the program by putting it inside a &lt;code&gt;Compile Long If&lt;/code&gt; block. Examples of non- 
executable statements are: &lt;code&gt;Dim&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;Data&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;Local Fn&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;Def Len&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Program Layout and Order of Execution ===
Parts of your program may be located within function blocks and procedure blocks. Function and 
procedure blocks are blocks of statements which are surrounded by the following pairs of 
statements: 
&lt;pre&gt;
Local Fn...End Fn 
Long Fn...End Fn 
EnterProc...ExitProc 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Statements which are outside of all function and procedure blocks are said to belong to the 
“main” part of your program. “Main” statements may either precede function &amp; procedure 
blocks, or follow them, or both. 

When your program runs, the first executable statement that appears in “main” is the first 
statement that actually executes. After that, the order of execution depends on the specifics of the 
program: normally, statements are executed in the order in which they appear in “main,” but the 
flow of execution can be altered by statements like &lt;code&gt;Long If&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;Goto&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;While&lt;/code&gt;; 
&lt;code&gt;Fn &lt;userFunction&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; etc. Function blocks and procedure blocks are not executed until they are 
explicitly “called,” using a statement like &lt;code&gt;Fn &lt;userFunction&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The program stops when it 
reaches an &lt;code&gt;End&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Stop&lt;/code&gt; statement, or when it reaches the last statement in “main.” Note that if 
there are no executable statements in “main,” your program won’t do anything.

=== Identifiers === 
An identifier is a name that you make up to identify something in your program. In FB, identifiers 
are used to name the following kinds of things: 

* variables; 
* arrays (see below); 
* user-defined functions (see the &lt;code&gt;Local Fn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Long Fn&lt;/code&gt; etc. statements); 
* user-defined data types (see the &lt;code&gt;#Define&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Begin Record&lt;/code&gt; statements); 
* record fields (see the &lt;code&gt;Begin Record&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Dim&lt;/code&gt; statements); 
* symbolic constants (see the “Constant declaration” statement). 

In FB, an identifier can have any length up to 245 characters. It must start with a letter; its 
subsequent characters can be any combination of letters, numeric digits, and underscore 
characters ( _ ) (symbolic constant names should not contain embedded underscores). Identifiers 
which represent variables, arrays and function names may also be followed by a “type-identifier 
suffix,” which is a 1- or 2-character symbol that specifies the item’s data type (see Appendix C 
for a list of type-identifier suffixes). Identifiers are “case-insensitive,” so the identifiers 
&lt;code&gt;highscore&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HighScore&lt;/code&gt; are both recognized as the same identifier. 

You can use the same identifier to name two different things, as long as the context makes it clear 
which thing is being referred to. For example, your program may have a variable identified as 
&lt;code&gt;BookList$&lt;/code&gt;, and also a local function identified as &lt;code&gt;BookList$&lt;/code&gt;; FB can distinguish between 
these two, because references to local functions are always preceded by the &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; keyword in your 
program.

=== Variables === 
A variable can be thought of as a “named container for data.” There are a number of different 
ways to represent variables in FB; see Appendix B for more information. Every variable is 
associated with a “data type,” which determines the amount of memory that the variable occupies, 
and how the variable’s value is interpreted. There are a number of data types predefined in FB; 
you can also create user-defined data types called records. See [[Futurebasic/language/variables|Appendix B: &lt;i&gt;Variables&lt;/i&gt;]] for more information.

=== Arrays === 
An array is a collection of variables which all share the same name and same data type. Each 
variable in the collection is called an element of the array; your program distinguishes one 
element from another by means of subscripts, which are numbers in parentheses following the 
array’s name. For example, if &lt;code&gt;theAngle&lt;/code&gt; is the name of an array, then &lt;code&gt;theAngle(3)&lt;/code&gt; 
represents one element of the array, and &lt;code&gt;theAngle(4)&lt;/code&gt; represents a different element of the 
array. 

The example above illustrates a one-dimensional array. In a two-dimensional array, each element 
is represented by a unique ordered pair of subscripts. If &lt;code&gt;Salary&amp;&lt;/code&gt; is the name of a two- 
dimensional array, then &lt;code&gt;Salary&amp;(4,7)&lt;/code&gt; represents an element of the array, and 
&lt;code&gt;Salary&amp;(7,4)&lt;/code&gt; represents a different element of the array. 
An array can have more than two dimensions; in fact, it can have up to 255. You use the &lt;code&gt;Dim&lt;/code&gt; 
statement to declare how many dimensions a given array has, and to specify the 
maximum values that can be assigned to each subscript. 

The minimum value that can be assigned to a subscript is always 0.

=== Conventions Used in this Manual === 
In the syntax descriptions that appear in the remainder of this manual, the following conventions 
apply: 

* Items in &lt;code&gt;''italics''&lt;/code&gt; represent placeholders which should be replaced as indicated in the description; 
* Items in &lt;code&gt;'''bold text'''&lt;/code&gt; represent literal text that you should enter exactly as shown; 
* Items in &lt;code&gt;plain non-italic text&lt;/code&gt; represent literal text that you should usually enter exactly as shown; however, the following characters should not be entered, but have special meanings explained below: 
&lt;pre&gt;
[ ] { } | … 
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Items enclosed in square brackets [ ] are optional; 
* Items separated by vertical bars | and enclosed by curly brackets { } represent a list from which one item should be chosen; 
* Items separated by vertical bars | and enclosed by square brackets [ ] represent a list from which one or zero items should be chosen; 
* An elipsis (…) indicates that the preceding item may be repeated an indefinite number of times. 

Example: Consider the following syntax description template: 
&lt;pre&gt;
bob [, {bill | ron [, rick]}] 
&lt;/pre&gt;
This template matches each of the following: 
&lt;pre&gt;
bob 
bob, bill 
bob, ron 
bob, ron, rick
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Printing from FB ==
Revised: February 2002 (FB^3 Release 6)

== Description ==
You may envision the printed page as something very similar to a window. In general, commands used to produce any type of display on the screen will produce a similar imprint on the page. The exception would be controls which cannot be sent to the printer port.

You instruct your program to switch to the printer using the &lt;code&gt;route&lt;/code&gt; command.
&lt;pre&gt;
route _toPrinter
rem printing commands here
route _toScreen
&lt;/pre&gt;
You may freely switch back and forth between the printed page and the screen by executing &lt;code&gt;route&lt;/code&gt; commands. When it is time to eject a page or to terminate printing entirely, you can clear the page with &lt;code&gt;clear&amp;nbsp;lprint&lt;/code&gt; or close down the printer (which has the side effect of automatically clearing the page) with &lt;code&gt;close&amp;nbsp;lprint&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Page Size ===
You can query the printer as to how large the page is by routine output to the printer, then executing &lt;code&gt;window()&lt;/code&gt; functions.
&lt;pre&gt;
route _toPrinter
pageWidth = window( _width )
pageHeight = window( _height )
route _toScreen
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Print Dialogs ===
Two dialogs are used before printing. The first is a style dialog that lets the user determine page orientation, scaling, and other items. This is usually brought up in response to selection of the ''Page Setup'' item under the ''File'' menu. The syntax is &lt;code&gt;def&amp;nbsp;page&lt;/code&gt;.

The second common dialog is a job dialog. It lets the user determine how many copies will be printed, which page numbers will be included, and other items that vary from one printer to the next. The job dialog is brought up with &lt;code&gt;def&amp;nbsp;lprint&lt;/code&gt; and is normally displayed before each print session. Note that the Print Manager actually handles the details of the job. If the user wants to print 2 copies of pages 7 through 10, your application may happily print a single copy of the entire document and the Print Manager correctly filter the output to adhere to the user's request.

=== Notes ===
Do not call &lt;code&gt;clear lprint&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;close lprint&lt;/code&gt; when output is being routed to the printer. This may cause the system to crash. Instead, route output back to the screen, then clear or close.

=== Appearance Manager Printing ===
Because buttons cannot be sent to the printed page, Appearance Manager edit fields cannot be printed. There is a simple work around. Create the edit fields in a window, then use the edit field statement (with only the field number as a parameter) and it will be copied to the printer. The following example show how this is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// Appearance Manager printing
window 1
edit field 1, &amp;quot;This is a test&amp;quot;, (10,10)-(120,32)
// Now print it
route _toPrinter
edit field 1
route _toScreen
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this example, we did not clear or close the printer (&lt;code&gt;clear lprint&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;close lprint&lt;/code&gt;). This is because the operation is automatically performed when the program terminates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Specifying Files and Directories ==
There are a number of FB statements and functions in which you must specify a particular file and/or a particular directory. A directory is basically a folder; in addition, every volume (basically, every disk) has a root directory, which has the same name as the volume itself. A directory is a container; when you double-click on a folder icon in the Finder, you see a window which shows that directory's contents. Likewise, when you double-click on a volume's icon, you see a window which shows the contents of that volume's root directory.

As the MacOS has evolved, a number of different schemes have emerged for specifying files and directories. The statements and functions in FB use a system which involves three different pieces of information, which interact in ways that are sometimes subtle. These pieces of information are: the Path Name, the Directory Reference Number, and the Directory ID Number.

=== The Path Name ===
In the MacOS, a path name is a string of no more than 255 characters, consisting of colons and/or names of files and directories in a particular format. It's usually identified as &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;path$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in syntax descriptions in the manual.

*A &lt;i&gt;full path name&lt;/i&gt; begins with the name of a volume, and ends with the name of a file or directory that is somewhere within that volume. In between is a hierarchical list of the directories leading from the root level to the final item; the names in the list are separated by colons. If the last item in the list is a directory, it may optionally be followed by a final colon. A full path name &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; contains at least one colon, but never begins with one. A full path name which consists of just the volume's name followed by a colon, indicates the volume's root directory.

*A &lt;i&gt;partial path name&lt;/i&gt; either begins with a colon, or consists of just a single item's name with no colons. It indicates a hierarchical directory path &lt;i&gt;relative to&lt;/i&gt; some &amp;quot;base directory&amp;quot; (discussed below). A partial path name that contains no colons indicates an item at the base directory's first level. A partial path name that consists &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; of a colon (with no item names listed) refers to the base directory itself. A partial path name may also begin with &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; colons: a leading double-colon indicates that the path begins at the base directory's &lt;i&gt;parent&lt;/i&gt;; a leading triple-colon indicates that the path begins at the base directory's &amp;quot;grandparent,&amp;quot; and so forth.

=== The Directory Reference Number ===
This is a peculiar concept which, for historical reasons, can be interpreted in a number of different ways depending on its value. It can also be interpreted as indicating either a volume, or a particular directory on a volume, depending on the value of another quantity called the &amp;quot;Directory ID Number&amp;quot; (discussed below). The Directory Reference Number is always stored as a &amp;quot;signed short-integer&amp;quot; number, so it can range in value from -32768 to +32767. It's usually identified as &lt;code&gt;''refNum%''&lt;/code&gt; in syntax descriptions in the manual.

Note: A Drive ID Number is assigned to each disk drive when the system starts up. A Volume Reference Number is assigned to each volume when it's mounted, and is valid until the volume is unmounted. A Working Directory Reference Number is assigned to a particular directory on a particular mounted volume at the request of your application, and is valid until your application &amp;quot;closes&amp;quot; that directory (as with the &lt;code&gt;CLOSE FOLDER&lt;/code&gt; statement), or your application quits.

=== The Directory ID Number ===
This is a positive number that the MacOS assigns permanently to each directory at the time the directory is created. On any given volume, no two Directory ID Numbers are the same; however, two directories on two different volumes might both have the same Directory ID Number.

In those FB statements that use a Directory ID Number (&lt;code&gt;OPEN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;KILL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NAME&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RENAME&lt;/code&gt;), you can use two different techniques to specify the number:

You can specify it explicitly as a parameter to the statement. It's usually identified as &lt;i&gt;&lt;code&gt;dirID&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in syntax descriptions in the manual. If you don't specify it explicitly, FB uses the number that you've specified in the &lt;code&gt;PARENTID&lt;/code&gt; statement. If you haven't yet executed the &lt;code&gt;PARENTID&lt;/code&gt; statement, FB uses zero. Also, the &lt;code&gt;OPEN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;KILL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NAME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RENAME&lt;/code&gt; statements always automatically reset the &lt;code&gt;PARENTID&lt;/code&gt; value back to zero after the statement executes.

Note: certain other FB statements and functions (such as &lt;code&gt;FOLDER&lt;/code&gt;) do not use a Directory ID Number and don't pay attention to the &lt;code&gt;PARENTID&lt;/code&gt; value. Another way to put it is: such statements and functions always behave as though the Directory ID Number were zero.

=== How These Three Things Interact ===
FB uses the Path Name, the Directory Reference Number and the Directory ID Number in the following ways to identify which file or directory you're indicating:

*If the Path Name is a &lt;i&gt;full path name&lt;/i&gt;, then the Directory Reference Number and Directory ID Number are ignored. The item is completely specified by the Path Name. (Note that if there are two mounted volumes which both have the &lt;i&gt;same volume name&lt;/i&gt;, then a full path name can be ambiguous.) If the Path Name is a &lt;i&gt;partial path name&lt;/i&gt; (or is not specified), then the Directory
*Reference Number and Directory ID Number are used together to identify a &lt;i&gt;base directory&lt;/i&gt;. The item, as identified by the partial path name, is then located relative to that base directory (or, if no Path Name is specified, the item is the base directory itself). The base directory is determined as follows:
**If the Directory ID Number is &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt;, then the base directory is determined entirely by the Directory Reference Number, according to the &amp;quot;Directory Interpretation&amp;quot; column in the table above.
**If the Directory ID Number is &lt;i&gt;nonzero&lt;/i&gt;, then both the Directory ReferenceNumber and the Directory ID Number are used to identify the base directory. In this case, the base directory's volume is indicated by the Directory Reference Number (according to the &amp;quot;Volume Interpretation&amp;quot; column in the table), and the Directory ID Number identifies a directory within that volume.

=== Other Ways to Specify Items ===
When you specify files or folders in calls to MacOS Toolbox routines, you don't always need to use the three data items discussed above. The preferred way to identify a file or folder in many Toolbox calls is by means of a fileSpec, which is a 70-byte record containing a volume reference number, a directory ID number, and the item's name. To track an item which may not be on a currently mounted volume, or which may have been renamed or moved to a different folder, the preferred method is to use an alias record. Refer to [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html  Inside Macintosh]: [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Files/Files-2.html  Files] for a complete discussion of fileSpec's and alias records.

Note that many MacOS Toolbox routines also support the use of Path Names, Directory Reference Numbers (usually called &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;ioVRefNum)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and Directory ID Numbers, using exactly the same rules of interaction discussed above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Variables ==
In FB, a variable can be thought of as a named container for data. The &amp;quot;container&amp;quot; has a specific size and (usually) a specific address in memory. Also, each variable has a specific type which determines how FB interprets its contents. You can copy data into a variable by putting the variable on the left side of the &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; symbol in a &lt;code&gt;LET&lt;/code&gt; statement; or by explicitly modifying the contents at the variable's address (through statements like &lt;code&gt;POKE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BLOCKMOVE&lt;/code&gt;). Certain other FB statements and functions (such as &lt;code&gt;SWAP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INC&lt;/code&gt;) may also modify a variable when you include the variable as a parameter. In FB, a variable can have any of the following forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;identifier[tiSuffix]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A simple string or numeric variable, such as: &lt;code&gt;myLong&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;theString$&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt; is the optional type-identifier suffix, such as &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, etc. See the &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement, and [[Futurebasic/language/data_types|Data Types and Data Representation]], for a complete list of type-identifier suffixes. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
myIntVar
xyz&amp;amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;stringVar$[offset]&lt;/code&gt; (Note: the square brackets are part of the variable)&lt;br&gt;
This variable consists of the single byte which is located at &lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt; bytes past the beginning of the string variable &lt;code&gt;stringVar$&lt;/code&gt;. (The &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; is required) This variable's type is &lt;code&gt;UNSIGNED BYTE&lt;/code&gt;. This kind of variable is normally used to quickly retrieve or alter a single character in a string. The statement, &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;x=stringVar$[offset]&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; is equivalent to: &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;x=PEEK(@stringVar$+offset)&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. The statement, &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;stringVar$[offset]=x&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; is equivalent to: &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;POKE@stringVar$+offset,x&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
firstname$[3]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pointerVar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A pointer variable. This is an identifier declared as a &lt;code&gt;POINTER&lt;/code&gt; type; it can be declared either as a &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; pointer, or a pointer to some other specific type. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
myPtr
anotherPtr
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;handleVar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A handle variable. This is an identifier declared as a &lt;code&gt;HANDLE&lt;/code&gt; type; it can be declared either as a &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; handle, or a handle to some other specific type. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
myHandle
thisHdl
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;recordName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The variable is an entire record. This can be either a &amp;quot;pseudo-record&amp;quot; (declared using &lt;code&gt;DIM recordName.constant&lt;/code&gt;), or a &amp;quot;true record&amp;quot; (declared using &lt;code&gt;DIM recordName AS recordType&lt;/code&gt;). Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
myTrueRec
iopb
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;arrayName[tiSuffix](expr1 [,expr2...])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The variable is a specific element of an array. This can be an array of any type, but &lt;code&gt;tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt; can only be used in numeric or string arrays. Note that an entire array is not considered to be a variable. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
firstName$(15)
recArray(3, x%)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pseudoRecordName.const1[.const2...]tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This variable consists of the bytes located at a specific offset from the beginning of a &amp;quot;pseudo-record.&amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;const1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;const2&lt;/code&gt; etc. are previously-defined non-negative symbolic constant names (minus their leading undersorce character), or non-negative integer literals. The address of this variable is at (&lt;code&gt;const1&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;const2&lt;/code&gt; + ...) bytes past the beginning of the pseudo-record. The size and type of this variable are determined by &lt;code&gt;tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt; (for example, if &lt;code&gt;tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt; is &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, then the variable is a 4-byte signed long integer). Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
House.streetName$
pBlock.ioDrUsrWds.frRect.left%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;psRecArray.const1[.const2...]tiSuffix(expr1 [,expr2...]) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This variable consists of the bytes located at a specific offset from the beginning of a specific element in an array of &amp;quot;pseudo-records.&amp;quot; The address of this variable is at (&lt;code&gt;const1&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;const2&lt;/code&gt; + ...) bytes past the beginning of the array element. The size and type of this variable are determined by &lt;code&gt;tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt;. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
HouseArray.streetName$(42,6)
pb.rect.bottom%(z)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;addressVar&amp;amp;.const1[.const2...]tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The variable consists of the bytes located at a specific offset from the address given in &lt;code&gt;addressVar&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. The address of this variable is at (&lt;code&gt;const1&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;const2&lt;/code&gt; + ...) bytes past the given address; the size and type of this variable are determined by &lt;code&gt;tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;addressVar&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;must be a (signed or unsigned) long-integer variable, or a generic &lt;code&gt;POINTER &lt;/code&gt;variable. &lt;code&gt;addressVar&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; must be a &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; variable; it cannot be an array element nor a record field. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
recPtr&amp;amp;.myField%`
genericPtr.rectangle.right%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;handleVar&amp;amp;..const1[.const2...]tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The variable consists of the bytes located at a specific offset from the beginning of the relocatable block referenced by &lt;code&gt;handleVar&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. The address of this variable is at (&lt;code&gt;const1 &lt;/code&gt;+ &lt;code&gt;const2&lt;/code&gt; + ...) bytes past the beginning of the block. The size and type of this variable are determined by &lt;code&gt;tiSuffix&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;handleVar&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; must be a (signed or unsigned) long-integer variable, or a generic &lt;code&gt;HANDLE&lt;/code&gt; variable. &lt;code&gt;handleVar&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; must be a &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; variable; it cannot be an array element nor a record field. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
recHdl&amp;amp;..thisField.thatField$
genericHandle..someField``
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Variables Involving Fields of &amp;quot;true records&amp;quot; ===
The fields of a &amp;quot;true record&amp;quot; are defined inside a &lt;code&gt;BEGIN RECORD&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;END RECORD &lt;/code&gt;block. A field's declared data type can be any valid type; if a field is itself declared as another &amp;quot;true record&amp;quot; type, then the field can have &amp;quot;subfields,&amp;quot; which are just the fields of that secondary record.

A field can also be declared as an array (of any type). In this case, whenever the field's name is included as part of a variable specification, it must be followed by subscript(s) in parentheses. Thus, in each of the variable descriptions listed below, each &lt;code&gt;field&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;subfield&lt;/code&gt; takes one of the following forms, depending on whether or not it's an array field.

For non-array fields:
&lt;pre&gt;
field/subfield ::= fieldName[tiSuffix]
&lt;/pre&gt;

For array fields:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
field/subfield ::= fieldName[tiSuffix](sub1 [,sub2...])
&lt;/pre&gt;
The type and size of each of the following variables is just the type and size of the last &lt;code&gt;field&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;subfield&lt;/code&gt; specified.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;trueRecordName.field[.subfield ...]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The variable is the specified field or subfield of the specified &amp;quot;true record.&amp;quot; Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
myTrueRec.myField%
stats.game(7).teamName$(1)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;recordPtr.field[.subfield ...]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The variable is the specified field or subfield of the &amp;quot;true record&amp;quot; pointed to by &lt;code&gt;recordPtr&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;recordPtr&lt;/code&gt; must be declared as a pointer to a specific type of record. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
ptr1.myField
ptr2.arrayField$(3)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;recordHdl..field[.subfield ...]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The variable is the specified field or subfield of the &amp;quot;true record&amp;quot; referenced by &lt;code&gt;recordHdl&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;recordHdl&lt;/code&gt; must be declared as a handle to a specific type of record. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
Hdl1..book(3).title$
Hdl2..phoneNum
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;arrayName(expr1[,expr2 ...]).field[.subfield ...]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This variable is the specified field or subfield of a specific element in an array of &amp;quot;true records.&amp;quot; Examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
HouseArray(42,6).streetName$
season(2).game(3).player(6)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ptrArray(expr1[,expr2 ...]).field[.subfield ...]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This variable is the specified field or subfield in a &amp;quot;true record&amp;quot; pointed to by an element in an array of pointers. The array must be declared as an array of pointers to a specific type of record. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;
myPtrArray(n).field3&amp;amp;
ptrArray(6,2).miscInfo.chapter(7).title$
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;handleArray(expr1[,expr2 ...])..field[.subfield ...]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This variable is the specified field or subfield in a &amp;quot;true record&amp;quot; referenced by an element in an array of handles. The array must be declared as an array of handles to a specific type of record. Examples:
&lt;pre&gt;myHndlArray(7,j)..map
myHndlArray(7,j)..map.quadrant(x,3).icon&amp;amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Limitations ===
There are some limitations on how many variables can be assigned.
#Arrays are limited to about 2 gigabytes (each).
#Simple variables inside of a local function are limited to 32K (per local function). In FBtoC the limit for local arrays is the same of global arrays (2 gigabytes). (See [[Futurebasic/FBtoC#Why_translate_to_C_when_I_code_in_BASIC | Why translate to C when I code in BASIC?]] ).
#The &lt;code&gt;.MAIN&lt;/code&gt; file of a project often allocates variables outside of local functions that are not global. These are treated as variables for a local function and are limited to 32K. In FBtoC the limit is the same of global arrays (2 gigabytes).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Data Types and Data Representation ==
Revised: May 30, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Integers ===
Integers can be represented as literals, as symbolic constants, or as variables.&lt;/p&gt;

==== Integer Literals ====
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Decimal: &lt;/i&gt;a string of decimal digits, optionally preceded by &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; 7244      -328442&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hexadecimal:&lt;/i&gt; a string of up to 8 hexadecimal digits, preceded by &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;H&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; (that's a zero-x). Hexadecimal digits include the digits 0 through 9, and the letters &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;. Letters can be either in upper or lower case.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; &amp;amp;H12a7      0x47BeeF      &amp;amp;42AD9
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Octal:&lt;/i&gt; a string of up to 10 octal digits, preceded by &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;O&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; (that's the letter &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, not a zero). Octal digits include the digits 0 through 7.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;amp;o70651      &amp;amp;o32277
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Binary:&lt;/i&gt; a string of up to 32 binary digits, preceded by &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. Binary digits include the digits 0and1.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;amp;x0100011      &amp;amp;x10110000111011001
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quoted:&lt;/i&gt; a string of up to 4 characters, surrounded by double-quotes, with an underscore preceding the initial quote. Each character in the quoted string represents 8 bits in the internal bit pattern of the resulting integer, according to the character's ASCII code. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 _&amp;quot;TEXT&amp;quot;      _&amp;quot;N*&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Note: Hexadecimal, octal, binary and quoted literals reflect the actual bit patterns of the integers as they're stored in memory. These may be interpreted either as positive or negative quantities, depending on which types of variables they're assigned to. If they're not assigned to any variable, they're generally interpreted as positive quantities.

==== Symbolic Constants ====
A symbolic constant is an identifier preceded by an underscore character. There are many symbolic constants which have pre-defined values in FB. You can also define your own symbolic constants within your program, either by using a &lt;code&gt;BEGIN ENUM&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;END ENUM &lt;/code&gt;block; or a &lt;code&gt;DIM RECORD&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;END RECORD&lt;/code&gt; block; or by using a &amp;quot;constant declaration&amp;quot; statement. A constant declaration statement has this syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
_constantName = staticExpression
&lt;/pre&gt;
where &lt;code&gt;_constantName&lt;/code&gt; is a symbolic constant which has not been previously defined, and &lt;code&gt;staticExpression&lt;/code&gt; is a &amp;quot;static integer expression&amp;quot; (see [[Futurebasic/language/numeric_expressions|Appendix D: &lt;i&gt;Numeric Expressions&lt;/i&gt;]]). The value of &lt;code&gt;staticExpression&lt;/code&gt; must be within the range -2,147,483,648 through +2,147,483,647. Once a symbolic constant has a value assigned to it, that value cannot be changed within your program. Like all constants, a symbolic constant has a global scope.

A constant declaration may also include pascal style strings using one of the following formats
&lt;pre&gt;
_constantName$    = &amp;quot;I am a string constant&amp;quot; 
_constantTab$     = 9      : REM CHR$(9) = tab character 
_constantCR$      = 13     : REM CHR$(13) = carriage return 
_twoByteKanjiChar = 10231  : REM KCHR$(10231)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Integer Variables ====
There are six different types of integer variables in FB; they differ in the amount of storage space they occupy, and in the range of values they can represent. An integer variable's name may end with a type-identifier suffix which indicates its type; alternatively, you can declare an integer variable's type by using the &lt;code&gt;AS&lt;/code&gt; clause in a &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement. If a variable has no type-identifier suffix, and wasn't declared with an &lt;code&gt;AS&lt;/code&gt; clause, then FB checks whether there are any &lt;code&gt;DEF&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statements which are applicable to the variable. Finally, if the variable can't be typed by any of the above means, FB assigns the type &amp;quot;signed short integer&amp;quot; to the variable. Arrays of integers, and integer record fields, are typed by similar means.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Storage&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Type identification&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; unsigned byte &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1 byte&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; 0..255 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &lt;pre&gt;
x``
DIM x AS Unsigned Byte
DIM x AS Unsigned Char&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; signed short integer &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; 2 bytes &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; -32768..+32767 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td &gt;&lt;pre&gt;
x%
DIM x AS Int
DIM x AS Word
DIM x AS Short&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; unsigned short integer &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; 2 bytes &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; 0..65535 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td &gt;&lt;pre&gt;
x%`
DIM x AS Unsigned Int
DIM x AS Unsigned Word
DIM x AS Unsigned Short&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; signed long integer &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; 4 bytes &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; -2147483648..+2147483647 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
x&amp;amp;
DIM x AS Long&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td &gt; unsigned long integer &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; 4 bytes &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; 0..4294967295 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
x&amp;amp;`
DIM x AS Unsigned Long&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Real Numbers ===
&amp;quot;Real numbers&amp;quot; are numbers which may have a fractional part. They can be represented as literals or as variables.&lt;/p&gt;
==== Real Number literals ====
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Standard notation:&lt;/i&gt; a string of decimal digits including a decimal point; optionally preceded by &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 17.3      -62.       0.03
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scientific notation:&lt;/i&gt; a string of characters in this format: &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;mantissa&lt;/i&gt;{E|e}&lt;i&gt;exponent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;mantissa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a string of decimal digits with an optional decimal point, optionally preceded by &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;; &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;exponent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a string of decimal digits, optionally preceded by &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;.
&lt;i&gt;Examples: &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 3e-20      -6.7E4      0.05E+14
&lt;/pre&gt;
The value of a number expressed in scientific notation is: &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;mantissa &lt;/i&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;exponent&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

==== Real Number variables ====
There are three types of real number variables in FB; they differ in the amount of storage space they occupy, the range of values they can represent, and their precision (number of significant digits).&lt;/p&gt;
===== Fixed-point Reals =====
A fixed-point real number variable must be declared in a &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement, using the &lt;code&gt;AS FIXED&lt;/code&gt; clause. It's accurate to about 5 places past the decimal point, and can handle numbers in the range of approximately -32767.99998 through +32767.99998. A fixed-point variable occupies 4 bytes of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
===== Floating-point Reals =====
FB supports two kinds of floating-point real number variables. A floating-point variable's name may end with a type-identifier suffix which indicates its type; alternatively, you can declare a floating-point variable's type by using the &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; clause in a &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statement. If a variable has no type-identifier suffix, and wasn't declared with an &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; clause, FB checks whether there are any &lt;code&gt;defsng &amp;lt;letterRange&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;defdbl &amp;lt;letterRange&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;statements which are applicable to the variable. Floating-point arrays, and floating-point record fields, are typed by similar means.

The methods used by FB when handling one of these variables can be modified by you. A set of constants is maintained in a file in the headers folder. (Path: &lt;i&gt;FB Extensions/Compiler/Headers/UserFloatPrefs&lt;/i&gt;). If you want to change these parameters for all of your projects, copy the file named &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;UserFloatPrefs&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; into the &lt;i&gt;User Libraries&lt;/i&gt; folder. The &lt;i&gt;User Libraries&lt;/i&gt; folder is located at the same level as the editor.
&lt;pre&gt;
//
// Required Floating Point Constants //
//
_NumberLeadingSpace = _True //FB II Default = _true &lt;br&gt;
_RoundUpFloat2Long = _true // Un-remark to round up Float to Integer
&lt;/pre&gt;
Double-precision floating-point variables occupy more storage, represent a greater range of values, and have greater precision than single-precision floating-point variables.

&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Type Identification&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
single-precision
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x!&lt;/code&gt; (4 bytes)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;dim as single  x&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
double-precision
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;x# &lt;/code&gt;(8 bytes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;dim as double  x&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Strings ===
A string is a list of up to 255 characters, which is usually interpreted as text in MacPascal encoding. Strings can be represented as literals or as variables.&lt;/p&gt;

==== String Literals ====
A string literal is a group of characters surrounded by a pair of double-quotation marks (note: in certain contexts, such as in &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; statements, the quotation marks are optional). If the string literal contains a pair of contiguous double-quotes, they are interpreted as a (single) embedded double-quote mark and treated as part of the string, rather than as a delimiter. Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
print &amp;quot;I said, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Hello.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Output:
&lt;pre&gt;
I said, &amp;quot;Hello.&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== String Variables ====
A &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statement specifies a string variable and its size in the following ways:
&lt;pre&gt;
dim as Str255 s  // s is a 255 character string
dim as Str63  s  // s is a 63 character string
dim as Str31 s  // s is a 31 character string
dim as Str15 s  // s is a 15 character string

dim s as Str255  // s is a 255 character string
dim s$           // s is a 255 character string
dim 3 s$         // s is a 3 character string [the custom size value can range from 1 to 255]

dim as Str31 s$  // s is a 255 character string [this anomaly, present in the old FB Compiler, may be removed from FBtoC]
&lt;/pre&gt;

If a variable has no type-identifier suffix, and wasn't declared with an &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; clause, then FB checks whether there are any &lt;code&gt;defstr &amp;lt;letterRange&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statements applicable to the variable. 

String arrays, and string record fields, are typed similarly to string variables.

Internally, strings are stored in Pascal format, beginning with a length byte indicating the number (0 through 255) of characters currently in the string. The length byte is followed immediately by the string's characters, one byte per character. FutureBASIC always allocates an even number of bytes for a string variable in memory; this is enough to include the length byte, plus enough character bytes for the variable's maximum string length, plus an exta &amp;quot;pad&amp;quot; byte (if necessary) to make the total come out even. Use &lt;code&gt;sizeof()&lt;/code&gt; to determine the number of bytes allocated to a particular string variable.



=== Containers ===
Containers are compiler-managed Handles that hold up to 2 GB of ASCII or numeric information. Containers may be identified by a double dollar sign (&lt;code&gt;dim myContainer$$&lt;/code&gt;) or in a &lt;code&gt;dim as&lt;/code&gt; statement (&lt;code&gt;dim as container myContainer&lt;/code&gt;). In FBtoC containers hold only ASCII information, numeric assignements and operations are not allowed.

Containers are always global. An attempt to dimension a container inside of a local function will result in an error message during compilation. When a container is first dimensioned, it is a long integer variable with a value of zero. Once data is placed in the container, a handle is allocated and the data is moved to that handle. To dispose of the allocated handle, set the container to a null string with &lt;code&gt;myContainer$$ = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.

Because a container may hold ASCII or numeric information, there are some trade-offs. The first is speed. Numeric values stored in containers are first converted to ASCII. When math operations are required, the data is reconverted before the calculation is performed. (In FBtoC containers hold only ASCII information, numeric assignements and operations are not allowed.)


Another limitation relates to how containers are filled. Since FB has no idea what data may be in the container, it has to evaluate the information on the other side of the equal sign to see what it should be doing. If this data is a series of Pascal strings, then the container must be limited to 255 characters.
&lt;pre&gt;
myContainer$$ = a$ + b$ + c$
&lt;/pre&gt;
If the information is to be a concatenated string and the right side of the equal sign contains only Pascal style strings, you must approach things from a different direction.
&lt;pre&gt;
myContainer$$ = a$
myContainer$$+= b$
myContainer$$+= c$
&lt;/pre&gt;
In some cases, the compiler will not be able to determine what type of operation you had in mind. For instance...
&lt;pre&gt;
a$$ = b$$ + c$$
&lt;/pre&gt;
The compiler has no clue as to whether it should concatenate strings or add numbers. You can force the correct operation by inserting an additional operator.
&lt;pre&gt;
a$$ = b$$ + c$$ + 0  : REM math
a$$ = b$$ + c$$ + &amp;quot;&amp;quot; : REM strings
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is not a problem with other math operators like the minus sign or the multiplication (asterisk) symbol as these cannot pertain to strings.

Containers may not be compared in the traditional sense. This is because a comparison by its very nature must return a numeric value. If you execute a statement like &lt;code&gt;PRINT a$ = b$&lt;/code&gt; the result will be zero (&lt;code&gt;_false&lt;/code&gt;) or -1 (&lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt;). We have provided a substitute function that can handle the comparison for you.
&lt;pre&gt;
rslt&amp;amp; = fn FBcompareContainers(a$$,b$$)
&lt;/pre&gt;
If &lt;code&gt;a$$&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;b$$&lt;/code&gt; then the result will be negative and will represent the character position at which the difference was found. If &lt;code&gt;rslt&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is -3000 then &lt;code&gt;a$$&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b$$&lt;/code&gt; were identical for the first 2999 characters, at which time the next character in &lt;code&gt;b$$&lt;/code&gt; was found to be less than the one in &lt;code&gt;a$$&lt;/code&gt;.

When &lt;code&gt;rslt&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is zero, the containers are equal.

When &lt;code&gt;rslt&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is positive, it points to the character position at which it was determined that &lt;code&gt;a$$&lt;/code&gt; is greater than &lt;code&gt;b$$&lt;/code&gt;.

Containers are stored in the application heap as relocatable blocks. You can extract the handle to these blocks as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
hndl&amp;amp; = [@myContainer$$]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Be aware that the handle may be zero if the container has been cleared or if it was never initialized.

A syntax similar to that used for filling edit fields may be used to pass information to a container. The percent sign (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) indicates that the container is to be filled with the contents of a &lt;code&gt;_&amp;quot;TEXT&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; resource. An ampersand (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;) tells FB to fill the container with information from a Handle.
&lt;pre&gt;
a$$ = %resID //  fill container with TEXT res ID resID
a$$ = &amp;amp; myHandle; // fill container with contents of myHandle
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note:&lt;br&gt;
You may not use complex expressions that include containers and/or Pascal strings on the right side of the equal sign. Instead of using:
&lt;pre&gt;
c$$ = c$$ + left$$(a$$,10)
d$$ = c$$ + a$
&lt;/pre&gt;
Use:
&lt;pre&gt;
c$$ += left$$(a$$,10)
d$$ = c$$
d$$ += a$
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Pointers ===
A pointer variable is always declared in a &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statement. It can be declared using the &lt;code&gt;as pointer&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;as ptr&lt;/code&gt;) clause, or an &lt;code&gt;as ptrType&lt;/code&gt; clause, where &lt;code&gt;ptrType&lt;/code&gt; is a type which was previously identified as a &lt;code&gt;pointer&lt;/code&gt; type (in a &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; statement). If the &lt;code&gt;as pointer &lt;/code&gt; clause included a &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; clause, then the variable is identified as &amp;quot;pointing to&amp;quot; a data structure of the indicated type; otherwise it's considered a &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; pointer.

The value of a pointer is actually a long integer; it's the address of a data structure. In some cases a pointer's value may be &lt;code&gt;_nil&lt;/code&gt; (zero), which indicates that the pointer currently isn't &amp;quot;pointing to&amp;quot; anything. 

If you declare a pointer variable as pointing to a particular record type, you can use the pointer variable to refer to specific fields within a record (see [[Futurebasic/language/variables|Appendix B: &lt;i&gt;Variables&lt;/i&gt;]], for more information). This is the main advantage of using pointer variables rather than long integer variables to store a data structure's address.

=== Handles ===
A handle variable is always declared in a &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement. It can be declared using the &lt;code&gt;AS HANDLE&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;AS HNDL&lt;/code&gt;) clause, or an &lt;code&gt;AS hdlType&lt;/code&gt; clause, where &lt;code&gt;hdlType&lt;/code&gt; is a type which was previously identified as a &lt;code&gt;HANDLE&lt;/code&gt; type (in a &lt;code&gt;#DEFINE&lt;/code&gt; statement). If the &lt;code&gt;AS HANDLE&lt;/code&gt; clause included a &lt;code&gt;TO&lt;/code&gt; clause, then the variable is identified as a handle to a data structure of the indicated type; there are also a couple of pre-defined types (&lt;code&gt;RGNHANDLE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TEHANDLE&lt;/code&gt;) which are recognized as handles to particular types of MacOS structures (specifically: to regions and TextEdit records). If the variable is declared simply &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;AS HANDLE&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; (with no &lt;code&gt;TO&lt;/code&gt; clause), it's considered a &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; handle.

The value of a handle is actually a long integer; it's the address of a &amp;quot;master pointer&amp;quot; which points to a relocatable block that contains a data structure. In some cases a handle's value may be &lt;code&gt;_nil&lt;/code&gt; (zero), which indicates that it doesn't currently refer to any data structure. You can use a long integer variable to store the same address as a handle variable, and for many purposes handle variables and long integer variables are interchangeable.

If you declare a handle variable as referring to a particular record type, you can use the handle variable to refer to specific fields within a record (see [[Futurebasic/language/variables|Appendix B: &lt;i&gt;Variables&lt;/i&gt;]], for more information). This is the main advantage of using handle variables rather than long integer variables to store a handle value.

=== Records ===
A record is a collection of data items that are stored together in memory. You can access an entire record as a unit, or access its data elements individually. Unlike an array, whose elements are all of the same type, the elements of a record (also called its &amp;quot;fields&amp;quot;) can be of differing types.&lt;/p&gt;

A record variable must be declared in a &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statement:
&lt;pre&gt;
dim varName as RecordType
dim as RecordType  varName
&lt;/pre&gt;
where RecordType is previously-defined record type. You can define a record type and its fields by using a &lt;code&gt;begin record&lt;/code&gt; ... &lt;code&gt;end record&lt;/code&gt; block. In addition, FB recognizes two built-in record types: &lt;code&gt;Rect&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt;. You use the &lt;code&gt; varName.field&lt;/code&gt; syntax to access the fields of a record variable (see [[Futurebasic/language/variables|Appendix B: &lt;i&gt;Variables&lt;/i&gt;]]).

=== Compatibility of Types ===
You can assign values of one type to variables of another type, sometimes with certain restrictions. The following table shows which kinds of values can be assigned to which kinds of variables.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:10px;margin:auto;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;th&gt;Record&lt;/th&gt;
 
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign. Byte&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Double&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;String&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5,8&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pointer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2,3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2,3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2,3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2,3,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2,3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2,3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2,3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2,3,8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;NO&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Notes ===
# Assigning a negative value to an unsigned integer type may produce unexpected results.
# Assigning a number outside of a type's range may produce unexpected results.
# Result will be rounded to the nearest integer.
# Some digits of precision may be lost.
# Make sure that the destination string variable is declared with sufficient storage.
# Both must be pointers to the same type (or both &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; pointers).
# Both must be handles to the same type (or both &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; handles).
# Automatic string/number translation requires a special preference setting; otherwise, use the &lt;code&gt;VAL[&amp;amp;]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;STR$&lt;/code&gt; functions.
# Both must be the same record type (if &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; records) or the same length (if &amp;quot;pseudo&amp;quot; records).
# Information about the type of thing referenced (by the handle or pointer) is lost when the handle or pointer value is assigned to a long integer variable. (This can sometimes be useful, if you want to &amp;quot;coerce&amp;quot; a pointer to point to a different type.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Numeric Expressions ==
Revised: May 30, 2000 (Release 3)

A numeric expression is anything that can be evaluated as a number. A number can be expressed in the following ways:

=== Simple expressions ===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A numeric literal, a symbolic constant, or a numeric variable. See [[Futurebasic/language/data_types|Appendix C:&lt;i&gt;Data Types and Data Representation&lt;/i&gt;]] , for more information.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;pre&gt; 17.3      _true      x&amp;amp;      Z%(14)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A reference to any user-defined function or Toolbox function that returns a numeric value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;pre&gt; FN theSum#      FN GETCATINFO(@pb)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A value returned by any built-in FB function whose name does not end with &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. (Note: the two exceptions to this are the &lt;code&gt;USING&lt;/code&gt; function and the &lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt; function, both of which return a string value.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;pre&gt; LEN(&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;)      DIALOG(0)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Data comparison expressions ===
Data comparison expressions always return the value -1 or 0. In many contexts, these values are interpreted as meaning &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;false,&amp;quot; respectively. Data comparison expressions have the following forms:&lt;/p&gt;

==== Equality comparisons ====
An equality comparison consists of two expressions of &amp;quot;compatible types&amp;quot; separated by the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; operator or the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; operator (you can also use &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; as a synonym for &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; as a synonym for &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;). The two operands must fall into one of the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A pair of numeric expressions;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A pair of string expressions (see [[Futurebasic/language/string_expressions|Appendix E: &lt;i&gt;String Expressions&lt;/i&gt;]]); 
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Any pair of variables of the same type.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An equality comparison using &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;) is evaluated as -1 if the two operands have equal values; otherwise it's evaluated as 0. An equality comparison using &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;) is evaluated as -1 if the two operands are not equal; otherwise it's evaluated as 0. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&amp;amp; == &lt;b&gt;LEN&lt;/b&gt;(acc$) * 3&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Bronson&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;gt; theName$(7,4)&lt;br&gt;
record1 = record2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

==== Order Comparisons ====
An order comparison can test the relative &amp;quot;order&amp;quot; of two numeric operands, or of two string operands; that is, it tests whether one operand is greater than or less than the other. In the case of strings, &lt;code&gt;string1$&lt;/code&gt; is considered &amp;quot;less than&amp;quot; &lt;code&gt;string2$&lt;/code&gt; if it precedes &lt;code&gt;string2$&lt;/code&gt; alphabetically. More accurately, string comparison depends on the ASCII values of the characters in the strings. An order comparison takes the form &lt;code&gt;expr1 operator expr2&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;expr1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;expr2&lt;/code&gt; are both numeric expressions or both string expressions, and &lt;code&gt;operator&lt;/code&gt; is one of the operators in this table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;appendix/Appendix_D-_Numeric_Expr02.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/Appendix_D-_Numeric_Expr02.gif&quot; width=397 height=177&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;blt&amp;amp; &amp;gt; ham% + rye%&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &lt;b&gt;MID$&lt;/b&gt;(testString$,x,5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Expressions with Unary Operators ===
A unary operator is an operator that takes only one operand. FB has three unary operators: &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. The unary operator always appears on the left side of the operand; the operand can be any numeric expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;appendix/Appendix_D-_Numeric_Expr03.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/Appendix_D-_Numeric_Expr03.gif&quot; width=467 height=121&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+n!&lt;br&gt;
-(x# + 12 / 7.3)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; found%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Compound Expressions ===
A compound numeric expression is any list of numeric expressions separated by one or more of the operators in the table below. A compound expression has this form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;expr1 operator expr2 [operator expr3 ...]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, any expression which is surrounded by a pair of parentheses is also an expression. When you surround an expression with parentheses, the entire expression within parentheses is evaluated before any operator to the left or right of the parenthetical expression is applied. This is useful when you want to change the default order in which the operators are applied. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3 * (7 + 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above expression, the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; operator is applied before the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; operator. 3 is multiplied by the sum of 7 and 1, giving a result of 24. But if the expression had been written like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3 * 7 + 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; operator would have been applied first. In this case, 1 is added to the product of 3 and 7, giving a result of 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;appendix/Appendix_D-_Numeric_Expr05.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/Appendix_D-_Numeric_Expr05.gif&quot; width=466 height=530&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;7 + 3 + 6 * 18.7&lt;br&gt;
x&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;AND&lt;/b&gt; (NOT BIT(7))&lt;br&gt;
ZZ &lt;b&gt;MOD&lt;/b&gt; (x% + 8)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Operator Precedence ===
When an expression includes more than one operator, the order in which the operations are performed can affect the result. When an operator appears to the left or right of a parenthetical expression, all of the operations within the parentheses are performed first. When several operators all appear within the same matching pair of parentheses (or outside of all parentheses), the order in which their operations are performed is determined by their order of precedence, with &amp;quot;higher precedence&amp;quot; operations being performed before &amp;quot;lower precedence&amp;quot; ones. For example, consider this expression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;4 + 7 * 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; operator has a higher precedence than the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; operator (see the table below). So, when this expression is evaluated, first 7 is multiplied by 5 to get 35; then that result is added to 4 to get the final answer of 39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table lists the operators in order of their precedence, from highest to lowest. When an expression contains several operators at the same level of precedence (and within the same depth of parentheses), their operations are always performed from left to right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;appendix/Appendix_D-_Numeric_Expr07.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/Appendix_D-_Numeric_Expr07.gif&quot; width=351 height=198&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Consider the following expression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;20 - 4 + 3 * (24 / (7 + 1) + 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following shows the series of operations that FB performs to reduce this expression to its final value, 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resulting expression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-4 = 16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt; + 3 * (24 / (7 + 1) + 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(7+1) = 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 + 3 * (24 /&lt;b&gt; 8&lt;/b&gt; + 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24/8 = 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 + 3 * (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; + 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3+2) = 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 + 3 * &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3*5 = 15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 + &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16 + 15 = 31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;31&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Static Integer Expressions ===
Many FB statements require quantities that are expressed as static integer expressions. A static integer expression may be a simple or complex expression, but its operands are limited to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Integer literals;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Symbolic constants;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OFFSETOF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TYPEOF&lt;/code&gt; functions.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are examples of valid static integer expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;762&lt;br&gt;
3 * _myConstant + &lt;b&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;(x&amp;amp;)&lt;br&gt;
44 / 11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are not valid static integer expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;126 + x&amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
3.14159&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SQR&lt;/b&gt;(49)&lt;br&gt;
85 + &lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; Zilch(36)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== String Expressions ==
Revised for FBtoC 15 February 2008

=== Description ===
A string expression is anything that can be evaluated as a string of 0 to 255 characters. (Note that FutureBASIC also provides &quot;Containers&quot; with 2GB text capacity that operate very similarly to a standard string). A string can be expressed in any of the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

=== Simple Expressions===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A string literal, or a string variable. See [[Futurebasic/language/data_types|Appendix C: &lt;i&gt;Data types and Data Representation&lt;/i&gt;]], for more information.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;pre&gt; surname$(23)      &amp;quot;Friday&amp;quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A reference to any user-defined function that returns a string value.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Example:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;pre&gt; fn MyStringFunc$( &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; )&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A value returned by any built-in FB function whose name ends with $&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;pre&gt; chr$( 7 )      hex$( z&amp;amp; )&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A value returned by the &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; function, or by the &lt;code&gt;str#&lt;/code&gt; function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;pre&gt; using &amp;quot;##.#&amp;quot;; pi      str#( 130, 5 )&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Compound Expressions ===
A compound string expression is a list of simple string expressions separated by the concatenation operator &amp;quot;+&amp;quot;. The syntax of a compound string expression is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;simpleExpr1 + simpleExpr2 [+ simpleExpr3 ...]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; operator builds a longer string by concatenating the operands. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Ex&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;tra&amp;quot; + mid$( &amp;quot;fiction&amp;quot;, 3 )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expression has the value &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Extraction&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
=== Notes ===
If a string expression is assigned to a string variable too small to hold it, the expression is silently truncated to fit.

When two string expressions are separated by a data-comparison operator (&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) the result is a numeric expression. See [[Futurebasic/language/numeric_expressions|Appendix D: &lt;i&gt;Numeric Expressions&lt;/i&gt;]].

&lt;span style=&quot;text-align:center;display:block;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Jan. 2008)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Although the FSSpec structure represents the current FB standard for specifying files and directories, it is outdated since years and should not be considered for serious new FB projects. There are at least two modern alternatives to the FSSpec structure, namely the opaque FSRef structure explicated in:

&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Migrating to FSRefs &amp;#38; long Unicode names from FSSpecs&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt; (Apple Technical Note TN2078, May 2003) [http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2078.html]

and the FileURL outlined in:

&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;The death of typeFSSpec: moving along to typeFileURL&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;  (Apple Technical Note TN2022, June 2001) [http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2022.html]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Revised: February 2002 (FB^3 Release 6)

=== Description ===
File spec records (FSSpecs) are the modern replacement for FB's time tested volume reference number/file name combinatons. You can create a file spec record as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; fs &lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt; FSSpec &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A file spec record is defined in the headers as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEGIN RECORD&lt;/b&gt; FSSpec&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; vRefNum &lt;b&gt;AS SHORT&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; parID &lt;b&gt;AS LONG&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; name &lt;b&gt;AS STR63&lt;br&gt;
END RECORD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the FSspec is used as a parameter in &lt;code&gt;FILES$&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;OPEN&lt;/code&gt; the information is passed to file handling calls as a single record, but you may extract information from the record as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; fs &lt;b&gt;AS FSSPEC&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;fileName$ = fs.name&lt;br&gt;
parentID&amp;amp; = fs.parID&lt;br&gt;
volRefNum = fs.vRefNum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== OS x vs OS 9 volRefNum ===
OS X does not allow the use of the older vRefNum/fileName combination. In order to insure that your programs work correctly without modification, the FB runtime creates a list of parent IDs and volume reference numbers and substitutes the list element number&lt;br&gt;
for the old volume reference number. Look at the difference between the calls below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;System 9&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;code&gt;fileName$ = &lt;b&gt;FILES$&lt;/b&gt;(_fOpen,_&amp;quot;PICT&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;Open a picture&amp;quot;, refNumVar%)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OPEN&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;,#1,fileName$,,refNumVar%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;OS X&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;code&gt;fileName$ = &lt;b&gt;FILES$&lt;/b&gt;(_fOpen,_&amp;quot;PICT&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;Open a picture&amp;quot;, fbElemNum%)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OPEN&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;,#1,fileName$,,fbElemNum%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your program won't require changes to move from the old to the new style calls, but will become OS X savvy without any additional coding.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Extracting Real Information From FB Indexed List Information ===
A utility function has been provided that extracts the true volume reference number and parent ID from FB's indexed table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; GetRealVolAndDir(vRefNum%,parentID&amp;amp;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pass the pseudo volume reference number to the routine in the &lt;code&gt;vRefNum%&lt;/code&gt; parameter. On return, the true volume reference number is placed in the &lt;code&gt;vRefNum%&lt;/code&gt; variable and the correct parent ID is place in the &lt;code&gt;parentID&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;

=== FSMAKEFSSPEC -&amp;gt; FBMakeFSSpec ===
A utility function provided by the runtime lets you build a file spec from individual components. This function has been designed to work with all versions of the system software. It's parameters are identical to those of the toolbox version of the call, but this particular function is smart enough to know when it id dealing with real parameters and when it has encountered the indexed element number from FB's substitute parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; fs &lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt; FSSpec&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; FBMakeFSSpec(inVol%,inDir&amp;amp;,name$, fs )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;name$&lt;/code&gt; parameter is a null string, FB returns information about the parent folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/* Not Supported by FBtoC */&lt;/p&gt;

=== Notes ===
You will not be able to use many of the file utility functions (like &lt;code&gt;FN GetRealVolAndDir&lt;/code&gt;) unless you include the proper header file as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Util_Files.incl&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;FBMakeFSSpec&lt;/code&gt; is unsupported in FBtoC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Duplicate channels may give bad recordings (if a poor quality duplicate channel is used) and may cause various problems with TAPs.  To delete a duplicate, old or unwanted channel, press OK to bring up the Channel List, select the channel, then press the Red button and choose the Delete option (note that you cannot delete channels while recording).

You may also want to [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Quick Channel Scan|rescan]] to include any new channels, especially if there's been a [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Freeview_Shuffle|Freeview reshuffle]] recently (which may have caused channels to appear to be duplicated).

There are TAPs available which can automate the process of deleting the low quality duplicates or other collections of channels (e.g. pay channels).

http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=33068

http://www.in7ane.com/psp/

Requires '''Microsoft .NET 2''' from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/

Unpack the gmdlXX.zip file and navigate to /bin/Debug subfolder


Google (and Local.Live) Maps Download is a replacement/supplement for the cygwin scripts originally included with Map This! it supports downloading map tiles from a variety of sources, as well as creating compatible tiles from custom maps. It also allows downloading and import of POI (Point Of Interest) and directions to be used with Map This!

== Manuals ==

Spanish: http://beta.pesepe.com/?q=node/8917

English: http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=60230

Thanks to outsider for doing these.

== Video Manual ==

I'm going to make an attempt at creating a video manual to show how the app works (mp4 videos created by Snapz Pro X, playable with Quick Time or VLC - videolan.org):

Downloading a map of LA with US GeoData (5:20 11.5 MB): http://www.in7ane.com/psp/manual/la_map.mov

(note: OpenStreetMap.org is used as the source - do '''NOT''' post videos of Google, VE, etc. being used as sources (USGS is fine), part of the area is deselected - that area is not downloaded at closer zoom levels to save space).

=== Toporama (Canadian topographic maps) ===

'''GMDL prior to 0.4.17a from 22-Jun-2007 only worked with MapCruncher 3.0.2, so redownload it to use with later versions'''

Downloading a Canadian topographic map with MapCruncher automatically rendering it: http://www.in7ane.com/psp/manual/toporama.mov

Note: probably best to try it on a small map first.

1. Install MapCruncher ( http://research.microsoft.com/mapcruncher/ )

2. Specify a map name at the top of GMDL

3. Select '''Canadian Toporama''' as the Map Source in GMDL, read and click OK on the message box

4. Navigate to your desired area (test using Preview 1x and 2x)

6. Click '''800x800 tile to MC.yum''' and click '''Yes''' to render automatically

7. Wait, the images are being downloaded

8. MapCruncher will pop up and render - it will show progress, while GMDL will be unresponsive

9. GMDL will come back into focus, build the GPSFS files (showing progress), and say that GPSFS is done (the GPSFS is in _map_name you specified, copy it to your PSP, _map_name_MC_rendered contained the rendered tiles, you can delete it, _map_name_source contains the source images, you can also delete it)

== Important notes that haven't been placed anywhere else ==

In Gimp: image &gt; mode &gt; RGB if transparency problems on save

YUM Assembler: alt lat is only for the bottom row images

Custom geodata: it's searchable as street


== Version History ==

'''0.5.15'''

Galileo (iOS app) 2.0.1 map export fix


'''0.5.14 - not dead yet'''

Galileo (iOS app) map and POI export

MBTiles map export (tested on http://developmentseed.org/blog/2010/oct/02/maps-stick-version-2-released/ not tested on the iOS app)

probably some other updates/fixes, since it has been a very long time since a release


'''0.5.13'''

Kosmsnimki in the process of being fixed

New custom sources and browser being worked on

x64 support (replace System.Data.SQLite.DLL in the Debug directory with the one from the &quot;x64 SQLite&quot; directory)

Google Maps Terrain fixed again (Mar 23, 2010)

Random tile delay (optional, on average 0.075sec)

More informative progress message (time remaining, tiles missed, updates when done)

Detail selection screen improvements (button to uncheck all, number of tiles)

Export of Transit Maps (iPhone app) compatible tiles from the View screen

Google Transparent source (just the streets part of hybrid, useful for Google Earth overlays (note: GPSFStileserver keys on the map directory having &quot;transp&quot; in its name for non-overlapping display))

Separate app: GPSFStileserver 0.3a (an http-server to serve GPSFS files as tiles and KML for Google Earth overlays) on http://www.in7ane.com/psp/


'''0.5.12'''

Confirmed as working with iPhone firmware 3.0.1 (make sure you click '''copy''' in, and use OfflineMaps_3.0_PREVIEW_iphoneos-arm.deb, move the map a bit if tiles do not load right away)

Google Maps Terrain (and others) fixed

binhusc's geodata changes from the 0.5.10b mod (southern hemisphere)


'''0.5.11'''

Google Maps fixed as a source (map, hybrid, China, MapMaker)

Output to iPhone fixed (hybrid and sat now work again) - nothing done for OS 3.0 yet


'''0.5.10'''

iPhone screen can now convert maps to xGPS format - works with 1.2.7 - choose the (new) option

Goole Maps fixed once again (including for China)


'''0.5.09'''

Yet another fix for a change in the format used by Google

Google Map Maker added as a source

Kosmosnimki fixed as a source

Canadian Toporama fixed as a source (and now uses 2000x2000 tiles which is faster)

MapCruncher fixed as a source for small maps (when 1/2/3/4 . jpg/png was missing)

iPhone firmware 2.2 compatible (tile size change from 64x64 to 128x128)


'''0.5.08'''

Another fix for a change in the format used by Google


'''0.5.07'''

gps.txt (GPS path recorded by Map This!) can now be read in (Direction tab) and saved as a POI file for use with Map This! or as a KML file for Google Earth

Fix for a change in the zoom numbering used by Google


'''0.5.06'''

Resume functionality (previously broken by the addition of FreeMap.co.il) is now fixed

Costa Rica (crmap.com) added as a source

Google now has the English version of the map as the default (switch back to local language by unchecking en)

Save 8192x8192 Tiles, in View, now have x&amp;y swapped (for convenience)


'''0.5.05'''

maps.yahoo.com is now partially supported (US - native 256x256 instead of 258x258, all works except for overlay)

Export to iPhone (SQLite 64x64 tile DB), pretty much done now, imports pins from KML, may add directions later; see: http://www.hackint0sh.org/forum/showthread.php?t=22320

Basic resume functionality, resume.txt stores: source, zoom, x, y, min_zoom, force_jpeg (create a map and read resume.txt for instructions)

POI now has a Limit: setting (100 by default) since Google seems to disregard area constraints

FreeMap.co.il is added (not really GPS compatible, but roughly in the correct map area)

Start of vector data - it's in the code - nothing works yet


'''0.5.04'''

Update in line with google maps page changes

Fixes a user-agent problem that seems to be caused by a recent windows/i.e. update


'''0.5.03'''

City names in geodata are now no longer padded with spaces

Google Terrain added as a source (fixes the problem with the terrain layer becoming the default)

A problem with the GPSFS viewer fixed (would crash on loading under certain conditions)


'''0.5.02'''

directions_translation.txt replace is now case insensitive thanks to dloading

YUM Assembler fix (, to .)

Custom CSV geodata now handles 3.583.333 as a decimal format (to 3.583333)

Pull and merge non 256x256 tiles (for use in MapCruncher) '''-&gt;''' then '''YUM''' then '''Tile Level Pull Merge''': http://www.in7ane.com/psp/posts/TileLevelPullMerge.png note: rendering large (30k x 40k) images takes days in MapCruncher, on a dual 3GHz Xeon with 2GB of RAM, due to scaling

Canadian Toporama no longer asks to set higher spans as MapCruncher (3.1.3) under .NET 3 seems to handle large (within reason) YUM files without problems (may be slow - just wait)

MapCruncher will now render JPEG tiles directly (from YUM Assembler and Canadian Toporama), greatly reducing the amount of space required (note - the JPEG checkbox needs to be checked/not checked throughout)

Ability to stop the downlaod of Google geodata (creates geodata.dat out of what downlaoded)

CSV to geodata.dat - option to supply your own zip codes, in the first column (will add states later)

All (including Tile Level Pull Merge) downloaded tiles are now checked (loaded as a bitmap) - this addresses 404/error pages that did not throw an error before

Google layer version numbers are now set on startup once again (I think something changed somewhere - wasn't really a problem, but fixed now)

New Canadian geodata statcan_rnf_v3 that may fill in some gaps (L and R ranges are now split up) - this is a minor change

Google (semi-auto) geodata with a local cache is in - there will probably be some fixes after somebody tests it (e.g. http://www.in7ane.com/psp/posts/ggeo_semiauto.png )

http://new.kosmosnimki.ru is now a source - but not GPS compatible (6m resolution instead of Google's 15 and 25m for parts of Russia e.g. http://www.in7ane.com/psp/posts/kosmosnimki_comp.png )

Downloading tiles in random order is now an option (Rnd checkbox under Advanced)

Updates are now fed from http://www.in7ane.com/psp/gmdl.html (which redirects to the latest zip) providing a permanent link

Icons swapped to comply with Map This 0.5.20 changes


'''0.5.01'''

Warns if can't find sounds.txt and icons

UK postcode geodata is fixed (single zip center was falling outside of the map area, it's now split by the first part of the postcode), temporary note: keep Street 1 checked and search for 1 post code (e.g. 1 EC4Y) to bypass the wide search reset bug in Map This! on subsequent searches

Note on the Google direction's dislike of pedestrian streets (also affects Nieko's web interface)

Ability to set the cookie from the web browser

The 4x zoom and area selection screen now has a size estimate based on the loaded tiles, allows deselection of 1x and shows an estimate of the map/layer sizes

directions_translation.txt for translating the part of directions that's in English (sounds.txt is applied before this)

Geodata from querying Google (all street numbers are 1) that seems to work with international encodings (please provide feedback)


'''0.5.00'''

Layout fixes (anchoring, map sources in tabs with translation.txt present)

YUM Assembler fixes (CSV changes, ; delimited CSVs - no ; in file names though, actual image counts) - now with a manual: http://www.in7ane.com/psp/manual/YUM_Assembler.pdf

Disabled the default copying of icons and sounds, and synced up the ones bundled with GMDL

Sloppy interface fixes - thanks zsc

WMS/NASA error handling fixed (failed tiles remained with the text error message)

Google Hybrid is a single option again (underneath it works the same, just an interface change)

New USGS TIGER geodata, now covering all states, you can delete C:/GMDL/usgs_tiger (usgs_tiger_v2 is now used)


'''0.4.17'''

Fully decoded Swedish geodata

Google directions option to avoid highways (multistage, and manually dragged directions work as well)

Toporama auto render now uses the latest version of MapCruncher, and allows to specify a drive other than C to look for it

Option to convert tiles to JPEG while downloading (but you are much better off using GPSFS_util by MIB.42)

Sounds are on by default (directions), see .zip in GMDL for mac scripts to create message mp3s

Custom geodata (from a CSV file), now with ; delimiter support

YUM Assembler for MapCruncher (contact me if you want a walkthrough) - see: http://www.in7ane.com/psp/posts/yum_assembler.jpg

Option to save directions at various encodings and UPPERCASE (e.g. Default and UPPER for the Russian Map This!)

Changes to keep up to date with the maps.live.com update

== Saving to a different location ==

If you do not put in the map/POI/directions name the set/save dialog box will now appear (allowing to save directly to the memory stick for example).

In 0.2.14a there was a bug that prevented saving to an existing/created directory, this is fixed as of 0.2.15a so you can now:

* specify a directory that does not exist - it will be created

* choose an '''empty''' existing directory

* create a directory (via the '''Make New Folder''' button in the '''Browse For Folder''' dialog box)

== Creating a POI File ==

Click on the '''POI''' tab

=== Local.Live/Google/Yahoo ===

1. Enter your search term into the '''Search for:''' text box

2. Navigate the map to your desired area (you can use the '''Search Maps''')

3. Move the map around a bit

4. Click &quot;Get Numbers&quot; and make sure '''Lat'''/'''Lon'''/'''S''' text boxes get populated

5. Click the '''Local.Live'''/'''Google'''/'''Yahoo''' radio button (if Google, choose relevant google.com/.co.uk/etc.)

6. Click &quot;List&quot; and make sure the datagrid is populated with your POIs

7. Enter a file name, starting with _, into the '''Save POI (start with _):''' text box

8. Click '''Save POI (start with _):'''

9. The file will be created in the same directory as the application, place it into the corresponding map folder


== Directions that follow the roads ==

Directions from Google now have the distance remaining to next way-point, and remove excessive path points (so you can have a long road mapped out without ending up with thousands of POIs).

1. Click on the '''Directions''' tab

2. Check the '''Google''' radio button

3. Check the '''Create intermittent every:''' check box

4. Either select a zoom level from the drop down list or enter the value by hand on the right (0.0001)

5. Enter '''From:/To:''' or search for the directions and click '''Get Values'''

6. Click '''List''', make sure you get less than 400 POIs, else increase the '''intermittent''' value and repeat this step

7. Click '''Save POI (start with_):'''

8. Place the resulting file into the corresponding map folder


== Translation ==

'''to load:'''


drop translation.txt into the application directory

run the application


=== German ===

0.4.0b courtesy of nforce100 [http://www.in7ane.com/psp/translation/german3/translation.txt]

'''older'''

0.4.0b (older) courtesy of nforce100 [http://www.in7ane.com/psp/translation/german2/translation.txt]

0.2.15a courtesy of nforce100 [http://www.in7ane.com/psp/translation/german/translation.txt]

=== Format of translation.txt ===

works as follows:

'''to create:'''

click Generate translation.txt

edit the translation.txt file, the format is as follows:


FORM_NAME.CONTROL_NAME(ORIGINAL_TEXT)=TRANSLATED_T EXT

ORIGINAL_TEXT is just there for your information, but does need to be there for the file to work, ()= is fine

lines without TRANSLATED_TEXT are fine - they are ignored


'''sample file:'''


GMdl.size(w)=

GMdl.UserMode(Advanced)=Other Options


'''to save after load:'''


move translation.txt out of the application directory

click Generate translation.txt

translated values are preserved

new/missing controls are added - this is so that you can upgrade your translation.txt files


'''What doesn't translate''': dialog boxes and other forms - will be in the next version

== Other Platforms ==

=== The short answer: ===

Writing for Windows was a decision based on the maximum number of people being able to run the application (while it is possible to run Windows applications on Mac/Linux using Wine/emulation/virtualisation the reverse is not the case unless you run an alternative OS in a virtual machine).

=== The long answer: ===

I looked at having a version written on Objective-C for mac at the start, and at porting using Mono more recently. Maintaining two branches - one in ObjC and one in C# would not have worked, while transitioning to Mono is something I would still like to do (this is not going to happen any time soon) - once the code becomes stable. 

In the meantime - it is not only the exe - the full (Visual Studio 2005 C#) source code is there if anyone wants to begin porting it. 

If you just want to run it - it works fine under Parallels and Windows XP SP2 on an Intel mac, and I would imagine you would also get reasonable performance under emulation in VirtualPC (there is not really anything processor intensive). 

As for working under Wine (already out for Intel Macs as well), and maybe http://darwine.opendarwin.org/ on PPC - I'd appreciate any reports on if it does. (No, it doesn't!)

== Creating a Custom Map (MapCruncher) ==

1. Align and render your map with MapCruncher ( http://research.microsoft.com/mapcruncher/ ) which has quite a comprehensive manual.

2. Launch GMDL and select MapCruncher as the Map Source

3. Click Set next to that and select the directory containing the tiles (Layer_NewLayer by default)

4. Read the informative message box (main part is that you click Pull Tiles under Advanced rather than Download The Map)

== Creating a Custom Map (old) ==

1. Click '''Advanced'''

2. Click '''Custom Map'''

=== Simple (without coordinates) ===

3. You need to have a source PNG file (without transparency)

4. Click '''Load Any PNG'''

5. Select your image file

6. Once it loads (you can see a close up by clicking on the image, click on zoomed in to close)

7. Specify/create the map directory via '''Set Dir''' or it will create one with the automatic name in the application directory

8. Click '''Save Tiles'''

9. Message box will tell you when it's done, then move the map directory to your memory stick

== Repairing an Existing Map Directory ==

1. Click '''Advanced'''

2. You need to know and specify '''zoom''', '''x''', '''y''' (these are not the ones in coords.txt), '''min zoom''' (this is in coords.txt), and set '''w''' and '''h''' to 2

3. Click '''Set Dir''' and choose the map directory

4. You need to have the map tiles in plain (non GPSFS) form, so, if needed, extract using '''&lt;-GPSFS''' and move the contents of '''GPSFS_Extracted''' to the map directory, delete '''GPSFS_Extracted''' and '''GPSFS''' through '''GPSFS4'''

5. Check '''Repair Existing Directory'''

6. Click '''Pull Files''' and the missing tiles (and coords.txt) will be created followed by the GPSFS conversion

7. Note: Checking '''Trigger Map Abort''' will not delete the map directory if '''Repair Existing Directory''' is checked


== Moon &amp; Mars == 

As of redownloading 0.4.0b in January 2007 or later

Navigate in earth equivalent and use preview or, in Advanced, just set x,y to 0,0 and zoom to 16 to the min you want.


'''Mars'''

elevation 16 to 9

http://kh.google.com/movl?ov=52&amp;t=ttrr

visible 16 to 8

http://kh.google.com/movl?ov=50&amp;t=ttqq

infrared 16 to 8

http://kh.google.com/movl?ov=51&amp;t=ttqr


'''Moon''' 16 to 11 (10- is cheese)

http://moon.google.com/kh?v=2&amp;t=tqrt

(careful - it's cheese all the way down)

16,0,0,11 is cheese free


Note to self: need (diff) sat test?

== sounds.txt ==

Place your sound files into the sounds directory named as following: message00N.mp3 (message001.mp3 ... message999.mp3), note that the mp3s need to be over one second (you may want to test them on your PSP first).

sounds.txt is a CSV that has the message number followed by the words it corresponds to.

the first line will be used for waypoints that do not correspond to anything else (but not for MIDPOINTS).

sounds.txt is read sequentially, so if you have 4,left then 5,left message005.mp3 will get used for directions containing left.

it is not indexed, so 4,left then 4,gauche is valid.

Note: you'll have to copy the message00N.mp3s to old map directories manually, and obviously any directions files will have to be rerun.

== Map Sources ==

=== Working ===

Whatever is in GMDL, pretty much anything that matches the google tile projection, see: http://mapki.com/wiki/Satellite_Tile_Layout (something like that, except with x,y,z addressing)


MapABC (the map source used by google.cn) seems to be significantly offset from Google Earth (this may be due to a different projection/grid in China, that was not converted correctly). http://www.in7ane.com/psp/posts/MapABC.kml

'''GMDT's map data incompatible with xGPS on iphone''' - fixed as of 0.5.10b (but may break if xGPS changes its database format again)

Hardware: iphone 3G/16Gb/international/jailbreaked

Software: xGPS 1.2.7

xGPS force quit to sprinboard when loading map data

= GeoData.DAT =

As of GMDL 0.4.4b the GeoData creation app is now part of GMDL, requiring pre-processed USGS TIGER or StatCan RNF files, a full set (550MB or 30MB) of which can be downloaded from http://www.in7ane.com/psp/mirrors.html

== USA ==

Covered via USGS TIGER.

== Canada ==

On version 2.

Covered via StatCan RNF and NRC GNSS.

== Sweden ==

'''Appears to be done as of GMDL 0.4.17a on July 1, 2007 - I would really appreciate some bug reports on this though.'''

You will need the .PBA files and lktab.txt if you want city names (101 files all together) - more details on that in the app.

1. Open GMDL

2. Click GeoData

3. Select the Sweden (PBA) tab

4. Set the directory containing the .PBA and the lktab.txt files

5. Click Process

6. Wait, and it will tell you where the geodata.dat was generated, place that into your map directory on the PSP


'''Where to get the files (once you got the Kartex app)'''

PBA files can be found on the Kartex CD:

Kartex\Tatorter\CITY NAME\CITY NAME.pba

It is probably a good idea to just search for *.pba and copy all 100 of them into a directory.

lktab.txt gets created after you install Kartex, and can be found in [C:\Program Files\ I think] Stadkart\lktab.txt


'''Technical notes:'''

The PBA files have RT90 coordinates (converted to lat lon via PROJ.4 in GMDL), however within the PBA files the coordinate data is mixed with some sort of index (looks like they wanted to get an even spread, probably due to the search algorithm that they are using). The format is roughly ENCODED.#CODE where ENCODED is the encoded RT90, # is redundant, and CODE is a code that translates into a DIVISOR to get RT90:

 x: RT90 = 6098185 + ENCODED * 2 / DIVISOR
 y: RT90 = 1098185 + ENCODED * 2 / DIVISOR

DIVISOR can be generated by using 4 (probably less, but will take longer, scan i up to 2000 for the 4 seeds below) seeds, as following: seed_code * i, take the last 3 digits, if they match the code, make a note of i, seed_divisor * i, take the last 3 digits - that's the divisor.

 seed_code    seed_divisor
 374          2
 61           3
 435          5
 809          7

== UK ==

Postcodes only, from various public sources, semi abandoned at this point.

== Custom ==

'''Appears to be done as of GMDL 0.4.17a on July 3, 2007 - I would really appreciate some bug reports on this though.'''

Get your data into a CSV with the following format (with column names by default, or you can uncheck that in GMDL):


Mandatory (this is so you can convert the same CSV into a POI file):

 lon,lat,name

Optional (extra columns, after city, are ignored for POI conversion):

 lon,lat,name,city (description),min number,max number


'''Note: city (description) is what the geodata file will be segmented by (it should be a geographical area, it is fine being the same for all rows if you have a reasonably small set), if it's not specified rounded lat/lon will be used'''


'''Note: If your CSV is delimited by ; instead of , (e.g. if the decimal point is a decimal coma, like in French, German, Russian, etc.) check the CSV is delimited by ;... checkbox'''


For example (the NZ txt extract), open Excel, open the txt, leave the import on Delimited, with Tab, and Finish, select all cells except the header row, and sort AtoZ (this eliminates the empty rows). Re-arrange the columns as follows: LONG, LAT, FULL_NAME and delete the others. Save-as a csv (Yes to keeping in the CSV format).


Open GMDL, click GeoData, select the Custom (CSV) tab, set the file and click process, place the resulting geodata.dat into your map directory.


Sample source: http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html

== Creating GeoData.DAT for an existing map ==

 1) Click GeoData (top left)
 2) Select the StatCan RNF tab if you are adding Canadian geodata
 3) Click 1/3 - Select map and select the map
 4) Click 2/3 - Select for map
 5) Click 3/3 - Save geodata.dat
 6) Wait, and that's it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Autoclip ==

=== Statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard  χ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
autoclip [=] booleanExpr
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;booleanExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; evaluates as &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; (zero), this statement turns off the &amp;quot;autoclip&amp;quot; flag for the current output window. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;booleanExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; evaluates as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; (nonzero), this statement turns on the &amp;quot;autoclip&amp;quot; flag for the current output window, unless the window was created with the &lt;code&gt;_noAutoClip&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

If a window's autoclip flag is &amp;quot;on,&amp;quot; things like buttons, edit fields and picture fields are excluded from the window's &amp;quot;clipping region.&amp;quot; This exclusion means that such object are &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot;--drawing commands won't draw over such areas, and the &lt;code&gt;cls&lt;/code&gt; command won't erase them. While leaving autoclip &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; is normally a good idea, it can slow down the execution of drawing commands, especially on older Macs.

Any FB window will have its autoclip flag &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; at the time it's created, unless the &lt;code&gt;_noAutoClip&lt;/code&gt; attribute is set in the &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; statement that creates it.

=== Notes ===
No special notes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Begin Enum ==

=== Statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
begin enum [start [,inc]]
  _constName1 [= staticExpression1]
  _constName2 [= staticExpression2]
  _constName3 [= staticExpression3]
  _constName4 [= staticExpression4]
end enum
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement begins a block of &amp;quot;enumerated constant&amp;quot; definition lines. The block must be terminated with the &lt;code&gt;end&amp;nbsp;enum&lt;/code&gt; statement. All of the constants defined in this block are global, regardless of where in the program the block appears.

The &lt;code&gt;begin enum...end enum&lt;/code&gt; block is &amp;quot;non-executable,&amp;quot; which implies that it won't be repeated or skipped if it appears within any kind of &amp;quot;conditional execution&amp;quot; block, such as &lt;code&gt;for...next&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;long&amp;nbsp;if...end&amp;nbsp;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;do...until&lt;/code&gt;, etc. (but it can be conditionally included or excluded if it appears inside a &lt;code&gt;compile&amp;nbsp;long&amp;nbsp;if&lt;/code&gt; block).

Each &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;_constName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents a symbolic constant name that has not previously been defined, and each &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;staticExpression&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents an integer expression which consists only of:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;integer literal constants;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;previously-defined symbolic constant names;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;operators (like +, -, *, /, &amp;gt;, =);
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;parentheses
&lt;/ul&gt;
(In particular, it can't contain variables, nor function references.)
The &lt;code&gt;begin enum&lt;/code&gt; block assigns values to each of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;_constName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; symbolic constants as follows:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;_constName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is followed by &lt;code&gt;= &lt;i&gt;staticExpression&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;_constName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is assigned the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;staticExpression&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;_constName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not followed by &lt;code&gt;= &lt;i&gt;staticExpression&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;_constName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is assigned the value of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;_constName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the line above it, plus the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;inc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If the very first &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;_constName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not followed by &lt;code&gt;= &lt;i&gt;staticExpression&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then it's assigned the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;start&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/ul&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;start&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;inc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters, if included, must each be a static integer expression. The default value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;start&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is 0, and the default value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;inc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is 1.

=== Example ===
In the following, the dwarves are assigned values of 1 through 7; &lt;code&gt;_snowWhite&lt;/code&gt; is assigned the value 100, and &lt;code&gt;_thePrince&lt;/code&gt; is assigned the value 101.
&lt;pre&gt;
begin enum 1
  _docDwarf
  _sneezy
  _grumpy
  _sleepy
  _dopey
  _happy
  _bashful
  _snowWhite = 100
  _thePrince
end enum
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Begin Globals ==

=== Statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
begin globals
  [statements including variable declarations]
end globals
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;begin globals&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end globals&lt;/code&gt; statements indicate the beginning and end, respectively, of a section of global variable declarations. A global variable is one which is &amp;quot;visible&amp;quot; to all parts of the program: that is, it maintains its value when local function are entered or exited. By judicious placement of &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;globals...end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; statements, you can also create variables which are considered &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; to some local functions but not to others.

&lt;code&gt;begin globals&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end globals&lt;/code&gt; are &amp;quot;non-executable&amp;quot; statements, so you can't change their effect by putting them inside a conditional execution structure such as &lt;code&gt;long&amp;nbsp;if...end&amp;nbsp;if&lt;/code&gt;. However, you can conditionally include or exclude them from the program by putting them inside a &lt;code&gt;compile&amp;nbsp;long&amp;nbsp;if&lt;/code&gt; block.

You may include any number of &lt;code&gt;begin globals...end globals&lt;/code&gt; pairs in your program, although typically global variables are all defined within a single section near the beginning of the program. You may also include &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;globals...end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; pairs in local functions. They must occur in matched pairs when they occur within a local function, and should normally be in matched pairs when they occur in the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; part of your program (the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; part consists of those lines which are outside of all local functions). When you include a &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;globals...end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; section in &amp;quot;main,&amp;quot; it should not enclose any local functions, or variables may be scoped in unpredictable ways.

When a variable's first appearance within &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; occurs within a &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;globals...end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; section, that variable is declared as global to all local functions which appear below that section. All other variables in &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; are local to &amp;quot;main.&amp;quot; Important: FB places an &amp;quot;implicit&amp;quot; &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; statement at the beginning of your program. That means that, by default, all variables declared in &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; are global. You must include an &lt;code&gt;end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; statement in &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; if you want any of the variables declared in &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; to be local to &amp;quot;main.&amp;quot;

When a variable's first appearance within a local function occurs within a &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;globals...end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; section, that variable is declared as global to that function and to all local functions which appear below that function. That variable is also global in &amp;quot;main,&amp;quot; if its first appearance in &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; occurs below the function in which the variable was declared global. All other variables in the local function are local to that function, unless they were declared global in some preceding &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;globals...end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; section.

=== Notes ===
With respect to global variables, the default behavior of FB is different from that of FutureBasic II. If you include neither a &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; nor an &lt;code&gt;end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; statement anywhere in your program, then the two versions behave as follows:

FutureBasic II: All variables declared in &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; are local to &amp;quot;main.&amp;quot;

Modern FB: All variables declared in &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; are global.

If you have a FutureBasic II program which does not contain an &lt;code&gt;end globals&lt;/code&gt; statement, you should add an &lt;code&gt;end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; statement to the beginning of the code (before any variables are declared) in order to make it run as expected in FB. If your FutureBasic II program already has an &lt;code&gt;end&amp;nbsp;globals&lt;/code&gt; statement in it, you should not change it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Begin Record ==

=== Statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
begin record typeName
  recDefnBlock
end record
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
July 19, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Description ===
Begins the definition of a &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; record type (as opposed to a pseudo-record type, which is defined using the &lt;code&gt;dim&amp;nbsp;record...dim&amp;nbsp;end&amp;nbsp;record&lt;/code&gt; statements). The record type definition must end with an &lt;code&gt;end&amp;nbsp;record&lt;/code&gt; statement.

A &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;record...end&amp;nbsp;record&lt;/code&gt; block is non-executable, so you can't change its effect by putting it inside a conditional execution structure such as &lt;code&gt;long&amp;nbsp;if/end&amp;nbsp;if&lt;/code&gt;. However, you can conditionally include or exclude it from the program by putting it inside a &lt;code&gt;compile&amp;nbsp;long&amp;nbsp;if&lt;/code&gt; block.

The record type defined in the &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;record...end&amp;nbsp;record&lt;/code&gt; block is global in scope, and can be used anywhere below where the block appears.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;typeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;is a name that identifies the record type. This name must be unique among all defined record types in your program.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;recDefnBlock&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;is a block of one or more &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statements. These &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statements have a syntax which is identical to that of an ordinary &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statement. However, instead of declaring variables, these &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statements declare the names and types of the fields in this type of record. The field names do not need to be unique to this type of record (that is, a different record type could use some of the same field names as this record type). A field can be of any data type, including a previously-defined record type. A field may also be an array of elements of any type.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
You can also use the following &amp;quot;leading dot&amp;quot; syntax within the record definition block, to declare &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; space; that is, some bytes within the record which are not identified by any field name:
&lt;pre&gt;
DIM .constant
&lt;/pre&gt;
...where &lt;code&gt;constant&lt;/code&gt; is an integer literal, or a symbolic constant name (without its leading underscore character). This declares the specified number of bytes as being &amp;quot;nameless.&amp;quot;

You can also use the &amp;quot;semicolon&amp;quot; syntax after the definition of a field name, in order to specify how many bytes should be skipped between the beginning of this field and the beginning of the following field. You can use this either to insert &amp;quot;nameless&amp;quot; bytes within the record, or to make fields overlap in memory. See the &lt;code&gt;[[Futurebasic/language/reference/dim | dim]]&lt;/code&gt; statement for more information about the semicolon syntax.

After a record type has been defined using &lt;code&gt;begin&amp;nbsp;record...end&amp;nbsp;record&lt;/code&gt;, it can be used just like any other data type. This means:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You can declare variables as having type &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;typeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You can declare arrays as having type &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;typeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You can declare fields in other record types as having type &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;typeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Anywhere below the &lt;code&gt;end record&lt;/code&gt; statement, you can use the &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt; statement, along with the &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; keyword, to declare a variable, array or field of type &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;typeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For example, if you have defined a record type called &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt;, then you can do the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
dim myHouse as Address, yourHouse as Address
dim relatives(15) as Address
begin record EmployeeInfo
  dim 50 name$
  dim 9 socSecNo$
  dim 20 hobbies$[9]
  dim empAddress as Address
end record
&lt;/pre&gt;
After you have declared a variable of a given record type, then you can use the &amp;quot;embedded dot&amp;quot; syntax to refer to individual fields within the record. Using the above example:
&lt;pre&gt;
dim mySecretary as EmployeeInfo
mySecretary.socSecNo$ = &quot;456-78-9999&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
==== Arrays of records and arrays of fields ====
When you use arrays of pseudo-records, you always write the array subscript at the end of the expression, whether the expression indicates an entire record or one of its fields. For example, if we have a pseudo-record array called &lt;code&gt;game&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;game(7)&lt;/code&gt; refers to element #7 in the array. If this record type has a field called &lt;code&gt;score&lt;/code&gt;, then we represent the &lt;code&gt;score&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;game(7)&lt;/code&gt; as:
&lt;pre&gt;
game.score(7)     'pseudo-record
&lt;/pre&gt;
Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
begin record StudentInfo
  dim 20 firstName$
  dim 20 lastName$
  dim 1 finalGrade$
end record
dim myStudents(35) as StudentInfo
'This represents the final grade of myStudent #14:
myStudents.finalGrade$(14)= &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
==== Arrays inside of true records ====
True records have the ability to hold arrays inside of each record. This special embedded array is designated by using a bracket instead of a parenthesis for individual elements.
The brackets are used for both dimensioning and accessing the sub-elements.

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
begin record StudentInfo
  dim 20 firstName$
  dim 20 lastName$
  dim grades[100]
end record
dim myStudents(35) as StudentInfo
myStudents.grades[1](5) = 96
&lt;/pre&gt;
In the final line of this example, the grade element number 1 of student number 5 is set to 96.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Begin Union ==

=== Statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
begin record recordName
  dim statements...
  begin union
    dim statements
  end union
end record
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
A union is used to set aside space in a record that may potentially contain more than one size variable. The following example sets aside two equal offsets within a record for variables of differing sizes:
&lt;pre&gt;
begin record RecordWithUnion
  dim beforeUnion
  begin union
    dim inUnion1`
    dim inUnion2$
  end union
end record
dim myTest as RecordWithUnion
myTest.inUnion2$ = &amp;quot;COW&amp;quot;
print myTest.inUnion1
&lt;/pre&gt;
The variable &lt;code&gt;myTest.inUnion1&lt;/code&gt; is a single byte which occupies the same space as the first byte in the string &lt;code&gt;myTest.inUnion2$&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, &lt;code&gt;myTest.inUnion1&lt;/code&gt; happens to be the length byte of the string and the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement will produce &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;. Such an overlap is not necessary and the two values may have no relation to one another except that they start at the same location in memory.

When FB encounters a &lt;code&gt;begin union&lt;/code&gt; statement, all &lt;code&gt;dim&lt;/code&gt;s up to the &lt;code&gt;end union&lt;/code&gt; statement are examined and the largest item in the union determines the amount of space set aside by the compiler. In the example above, the union would occupy 256 bytes since the largest element in the union is a 256 byte Pascal string.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== BeginAssem ==

=== Statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
BeginAssem
 assembly_statements
EndAssem
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Marks the beginning of a block of assembly-language statements. The block must be terminated with the &lt;code&gt;EndAssem&lt;/code&gt; statement. The statements are assembled directly into the compiled program and executed when the program is run.

Each line in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;assembly_statements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; block should be in this format:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;[label] opCode [operands] [;remark]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Note that there should be at least one space character separating each of the four fields of this line. In particular, if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;label&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is omitted, you must include at least one leading space in front of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;opCode&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. But if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;label&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is included, then there should be no leading space to the left of label. To make a nicely formatted listing, use the TAB key to separate the fields.

You can also create assembly-language statements without using the &lt;code&gt;BeginAssem&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EndAssem&lt;/code&gt; statements, by preceding each assembly statement line with a “grave accent” character (that’s the character to the left of the “1” on the keyboard. It looks like a “backwards” apostrophe: &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;`&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;):

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;`&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;[label] opCode [operands] [;remark]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This method has the disadvantage that you can’t specify a cpuType for each group of lines: assembly lines that begin with the “&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;`&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;” mark are always assembled according to the “preferred CPU,” using the rules given above. It’s important that you understand which CPU your assembly statements are being assembled for, and that your statements are appropriate for that CPU. You can use the &lt;code&gt;compile&amp;nbsp;long&amp;nbsp;if&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;cpuType&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement to exclude your assembly statements from inappropriate compilations.

=== Notes ===
&lt;code&gt;BeginAssem&lt;/code&gt; is not supported in FBtoC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bin$ ==

=== Function ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
binString$ = bin$( expr )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns a string of zeros and ones representing the binary value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, in &amp;quot;two's-complement integer&amp;quot; format (this is the native format in which integers are stored in FB). If &lt;code&gt;defstr&amp;nbsp;byte&lt;/code&gt; is in effect, an 8-character string will be returned. If &lt;code&gt;defstr&amp;nbsp;word&lt;/code&gt; is in effect, a 16-character string will be returned. If &lt;code&gt;defstr&amp;nbsp;long&lt;/code&gt; is in effect, a 32-character string will be returned.

=== Example ===
The chart below shows the results of &lt;code&gt;bin$&lt;/code&gt; on some integer values. (If a non-integer &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used, &lt;code&gt;bin$&lt;/code&gt; converts it to an integer before generating the string.) The chart assumes that &lt;code&gt;defstr&amp;nbsp;word&lt;/code&gt; is in effect.

(If a non-integer &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used, &lt;code&gt;bin$&lt;/code&gt; converts it to an integer before generating the string.) The chart assumes that &lt;code&gt;defstr&amp;nbsp;word&lt;/code&gt; is in effect.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
	&lt;th&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
	&lt;th&gt;&lt;code&gt;bin$(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;0000000000000001&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;1111111111111111&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;256&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;0000000100000000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;-256&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;1111111100000000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
To convert a string of binary digits into an integer, use the following technique:
&lt;pre&gt;
intVar = val&amp;amp;( &amp;quot;&amp;amp;X&amp;quot; + binaryString$ )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be a (signed or unsigned) byte variable, short-integer variable or long-integer variable. Byte variables can handle a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;binaryString$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; up to 8&amp;nbsp;characters in length; short-integer variables can handle a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;binaryString$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; up to 16&amp;nbsp;characters in length; long-integer variable can handle a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;binaryString$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; up to 32&amp;nbsp;characters in length.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bit ==

=== Function ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
bitValue = bit( bitPos )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns an integer whose binary representation has the bit in position &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;bitPos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; set to &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, and all other bits set to &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;. Bit positions are counted from right to left: a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;bitPos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; value of zero corresponds to the rightmost (&amp;quot;least significant&amp;quot;) bit. The maximum allowable value for &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;bitPos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is 31, which corresponds to the leftmost bit in a long-integer value. &lt;code&gt;bit&lt;/code&gt; is useful in conjunction with &amp;quot;bitwise operators&amp;quot; like &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;, for setting and testing the values of particular bits in a quantity.

=== Example ===
The following expression evaluates as &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt; (-1) if bit &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; is set in &lt;code&gt;testValue&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
( testValue&amp;amp; and bit( n ) ) &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0
&lt;/pre&gt;
The following assignment sets bit &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; in &lt;code&gt;testValue&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to 1:
&lt;pre&gt;
testValue&amp;amp; = ( testValue&amp;amp; or bit( n ) )
&lt;/pre&gt;
The following assignment resets bit &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; in &lt;code&gt;testValue&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to 0:
&lt;pre&gt;
testValue&amp;amp; = ( testValue&amp;amp; and not bit( n ) )
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Notes ===
If &lt;code&gt;_bitPos&lt;/code&gt; is a symbolic constant name, then you can use &lt;code&gt;_bitPos%&lt;/code&gt; (note the &amp;quot;%&amp;quot;) as a synonym for &lt;code&gt;bit(&amp;nbsp;_bitPos&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== BlockMove ==

=== Statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
BlockMove sourceAddr&amp;amp;, destinationAddr&amp;amp;, numberBytes&amp;amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Copies a range of bytes which begin at address &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;sourceAddr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, to the address range that begins at address &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;destinationAddr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numberBytes&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies the number of bytes which are to be copied. The copying works correctly even if the source and destination ranges overlap.

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
dim src%(79999), dst%(79999)            '80000-element arrays
'Copy one array to the other:
BlockMove @src%(0), @dst%(0), 160000
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Notes ===
For copying small amounts of data (80 bytes or less) into a variable, it is more efficient to use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var;length = address&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax of the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; statement. See the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; statement for more details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Box ==

=== Statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
box [fill] [h, v] to h1, v1 [to h2, v2 ...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Draws a rectangle which has diagonally opposite corners at coordinates (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h,v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h1,v1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). The rectangle's frame is drawn using the current pen size, mode, pattern and color for the current window or printer. If the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; clause is specified, then the rectangle is filled with the current window pattern.

If the &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; keyword is specified more than once, then several rectangles are drawn, each using (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h,v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) as one corner, and the coordinates following &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; as the diagonally opposite corner.

If the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters are omitted, then the rectangle's originating point is set to one of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h,v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) coordinates of the most recent &lt;code&gt;box&lt;/code&gt; statement (in any window) that actually specified the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The last point specified in the most recent &lt;code&gt;plot&lt;/code&gt; statement (in any window);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;(0,0), if no &lt;code&gt;plot&lt;/code&gt; statement has yet been executed, and no prior &lt;code&gt;box&lt;/code&gt; statement that specified &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has yet been executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Console Behavior ===
When you use the Console, &lt;code&gt;box&lt;/code&gt; always switches to the Graphics Window before drawing. You can't use &lt;code&gt;box&lt;/code&gt; to draw a box in the Text Window, or on the printer; use the Toolbox procedures &lt;code&gt;FrameRect&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PaintRect&lt;/code&gt; instead. Alternatively, you can activate the graphics window and select &lt;i&gt;Print&lt;/i&gt; from the &lt;i&gt;File&lt;/i&gt; menu.

=== Statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard  χ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
BUTTON CLOSE [#]btnID
BUTTON CLOSE [#]-btnID
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
May 5, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Description ===
The button or scroll bar specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;btnID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is removed from the current output window. This is one of two ways you can dispose of a button: the other way is to close the window, which automatically closes all the buttons and scroll bars in it.

If &lt;code&gt;BUTTON CLOSE&lt;/code&gt; uses a negative &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;btnID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the area previously occupied by the control is not erased or invalidated. No update event will occur as a result of close a button with a negative &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;btnID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
BUTTON CLOSE #1
BUTTON CLOSE #_radioBtn2
BUTTON CLOSE -1

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|1|1928|Outreach|General Conference}}

==1. From the Bible and writings of Ellen G. White, write a summary, at least 250 words in length, on the importance of the use of literature in leading people to Christ. ==
In Acts 20, Paul indicates that he operated by going house-to-house, as does the colporteur:
{{Bible verse
|book = Acts
|chapter = 20
|verse = 18-21
|version=NIV
|text=&lt;br&gt;
When they arrived, he said to them: &quot;You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia. I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, although I was severely tested by the plots of the Jews. You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house. I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.
}}

For Ellen White comments, see  ''Testimonies for the Church, Volume 6, pp 321-340.''

==2. Name five essential qualifications of a colporteur. ==
# A calling to the ministry.
# Passion for the work of Literature Evangelism.
# Perseverance.  
# Faith.
# Courage.

==3. How is the colporteur supported? ==
The term &quot;colporteur&quot; is an alteration of French comporter, &quot;to peddle&quot; as a portmanteau or pun with the word col (Latin collum, &quot;neck&quot;), with the resulting meaning &quot;to carry on one's neck&quot;. Porter, is from Latin portare, &quot;to carry.&quot;  It could also be interpreted to mean &quot;to carry one's neck&quot; which is not far from accurate. The colporteurs are self-supported, meaning that no money is provided to them by the church.  Their income comes from the literature they sell.

==4. What four steps are taken in the sale of a book or magazine? ==
# Prayer.
# Opening - the colporteur introduces himself/herself and tells the recipient (person being evangelized) what they are doing in that area.
# Information - the colporteur tells the recipient about the material.
# Close - the colporteur tells the recipient the average donation accepted for the books they have been given and where the proceeds would go.

==5. Briefly outline how to arouse an interest in purchasing a book or magazine? ==
;Know your material: One of the easiest ways to arouse interest is to know what your talking about. A good way of doing this is to read one of the books for your devotion every morning.
;Be observant: This is helpful because if you are observant you may notice things such as a small child's toys (indicating they most likely have a small child) or if you smell something cooking it might be a good idea to show them one of your cookbooks. And it doesn't stop there! While you are talking to them ''always'' be on the lookout for ''any'' hints that would show you which books they would be most interested in.

==6. Know how to meet objections to purchasing a book or magazine. ==
The most common objection that you will hear is &quot;I'm not interested&quot;. Most people have no other reason to be &quot;not interested&quot; except that they want you off their porch! Here are a couple of ways to get around that objection: 
# Be flexible. For instance, if I handed a potential recipient one of the books and they said that they're &quot;not interested&quot; I can apply that to the book that I handed to them and transition into another book by saying something like, &quot;well maybe you'll be more interested in this book instead&quot;.
# Ask them why they are not interested. Now this way is a little bit more forward and you would want to be VERY CAREFUL in asking them that because you DO NOT want to offend them.

==7. Do one of the following: ==
===a. Maintain a literature rack for four months, keeping a log of which books are the most and least popular. ===
The first thing you must do is decide where you will place your literature rack.  Laundromats, taxi waiting rooms, subway stations, bus stops, and doctor's offices are all good options, because these are places where people ''wait''.  You must then get permission to put your rack there.  Most private operations (doctors, laundromats, etc.) will welcome the addition of the rack, as it provides their patients with something to read at no cost to them.  They may already have a rack that they will let you use, or they may require that you provide one.  If you provide the rack, they may wish to approve of it (to ensure it does not clash with their other furnishings, for example).

Then you will be ready to stock the rack with literature.  Record a complete inventory when you do this.  Return weekly (at a minimum) and take inventory and to restock.  The reason for tracking which publications are the most popular is so that you may provide more of them.  You are there to meet the people's needs!

Be sure to speak with the proprietors and thank them ''every time''.

===b. Do a project of house-to-house or mail distribution of literature in your community for ten hours. Include in the literature a response card for addi­tional literature, Bible studies, and/or a Bible correspondence course. ===
The [http://reviewandherald.com Review and Herald] offers several editions of Ellen G. White's ''Steps to Christ'' at a price that facilitates large purchases (under $1.00 per copy).  This book is available with a number of covers, and you should select one that you think will have the best effect in the community in which you intend to distribute it.  

Determine how many copies you will need, then raise the funds to purchase the books.  You may use other literature other than ''Steps to Christ'' as well, but this book has a proven track record.  The next thing you must decide is whether you will distribute the literature door-to-door or via a mass mailing.  Door-to-door is by far the cheaper option.  You will probably not get the literature into as many homes as with mailing because each home must be visited, and some people will refuse to take the literature.  However, those who do take it will have the opportunity to meet you and evaluate your character.  For the receptive soul, this can make all the difference.

For mass mailing, contact your local post office for instructions.  They will tell you their requirements and even provide you with information necessary to send a mailing out to every address in a given zip code (including how many addresses there are).

If you choose to distribute the literature door-to-door, assemble the literature into plastic bags which can be easily hung from a door knob.  Do ''not'' hang the literature on any mailbox or put it inside one.  Doing so is a federal offence!  Don't forget to include the response card so that if the literature arouses an interest, the person will know how to get in touch with your church.

Before setting out, rehearse what you will say.  
{{TODO|Add a script here with some suggested words.}}

When you arrive, approach the house and knock on the door.  Do not walk on the grass unless there is no other option, and be mindful of flower beds.  If no one answers, place the literature where they will find it.  This usually means you must select the door they are likely to use rather than the &quot;visitor&quot; door that they may rarely open.  If someone does answer, you will have already practiced what to say.  Be polite, even if the person is rude to you.  If they tell you to leave, do so as politely as you can.  Remember that you are an ambassador for Christ!  Maintain a cheerful attitude throughout your day, even if you think no one is watching &amp;mdash; they might be!.

===c. Engage in selling Seventh-day Adventist books and/or magazines during a period of at least five weeks, for at least 20 hours each. ===
The main difference between this activity and the one described in section b above, is that you will be selling the literature instead of giving it away.  Even so, everything covered there applies here as well.  In addition, you must use the skills you learned in the rest this honor (remembering the essential qualifications, knowing the four steps in making a sale, knowing how to meet objections, etc.).  Above all, be kind and polite at all times!

We highly recommend that rather than attempting this on your own, you look into the [https://www.youthsummit.info/magabooks.php Magabooks] program.  From their website,
:''It is an evangelistic program that will give you the opportunity to work as a student missionary with a group of 15 to 25 youth.''

''Magabooks'' is a concatenation of the words ''Mag''azine, and ''Books''.  This program will provide all the training you need, and will provide you with a source of income for the summer.

===d. Do a project of distributing religious books to local government officials. Spend at least ten hours on your project. ===
===e. Do a project of supplying religious literature to patients in a hospital or nursing home. Spend at least ten hours on your project. ===
===f. Make a project of supplying a year’s subscription to Liberty magazine to the judges and/or lawyers in your community. Raise the money or get con­tributions for the gift subscriptions. ===
Contact the editors of Liberty magazine at http://www.libertymagazine.org/ (look for the &quot;contact us&quot; link).  You will also need a list of judges and lawyers in your community.  Lawyers will be listed in the Yellow Pages or in the business section of your local phone book.  Contact your local courthouse to get a list of judges.

Once you know how many lawyers and judges are in your community, you will be able to determine the cost of the subscriptions.  Then set a goal to raise enough money to cover them. Here are some ideas for fundraising:
* Car wash
* Yard Sale
* Bake Sale
* Recycle ink cartridges
* Rent a Pathfinder

For more fundraising ideas, see the [http://www.pathfindersonline.org/forumbb3/viewforum.php?f=9 fundraising section] of the NAD Pathfinder forum.

===g. Make a project of sending literature and/or Bibles to the mission field. Part of this project is collecting the literature and/or Bibles, determining where to send the material and packaging and sending the material.===
Before collecting any material, figure out where you are going to send it.  Your local conference office should be able to put you in touch with a missionary.  Contact them first, not only to get a shipping address, but also to ask what types of literature they can and cannot use.  Some countries limit the types of literature that can be imported, so it is important to check before you send anything.  You would not want all your hard work to be wasted by having your literature destroyed at the border of the country you are sending it to.

Once you have made contact with the missionaries and have a list of things they can use, ''then'' begin assembling the literature.

==Historical Notes==
This honor was introduced in 1928 with the name &quot;''Colportage''&quot;.  The name was changed to “Literature Evangelism” 1956.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==King positions==
King position is one of the most important things in chess (technically, it is '''the''' most important thing in chess). This is for the simple reason that no matter how much material advantage you have, no matter how much central control you have, no matter how weak your opponent's pawns are, if you are checkmated, all of these advantages amount to moot. King position is also the thing that amateurs constantly pay attention to, never seeming to understand the ideas behind queenside expansion, or a central pawn center. They always either become irrationally nervous about their own king, or they completely ignore the other part of the board, going all out for the attack.

==The castled king position==
The castled king position is one of the most effective defenses against attack. It is strongest when the king is covered by three pawns in a row, on (for Black) f7, g7, and h7 on the kingside, or a7, b7, and c7 for the queenside. This is because there is really no weakness for the opponent to focus on, and he will have to advance his pawns or sacrifice material to create weaknesses there, so that he can attack. The king can stay behind his wall of pawns, safe in the knowledge that the opponent will never get to him there.

==On attacking the king in general==
In the early days of chess, when Romanticism dominated, attacking the king was the most important idea of all games. There would often be a series of brilliant sacrifices to draw the king out from its cover. This all changed when an American master named Paul Morphy came along and crushed the opposition using positional principles, much in the way that Steinitz would thirty years later. However, today such attacks, known informally as &quot;barry&quot;, are rarely seen. Back in the 19th century, defensive chess was not yet well-known, and sacrifices would often work. Today, many defensive tactics are well-known, such as returning material in order to halt an attack.

===The king in the center===
Often it is suicidal to keep one's king in the center. Why? Look at it this way. The center is the most important part of the board. Logically, if one can gain influence in the most important areas, one will have an advantage. However, to get active play in the center, one has to open files there. And with the center of the board opening up, the king will feel very uneasy, as he is a sitting duck for all of the enemy pieces bearing down on him on the open lines.

Not only does the king itself become weak, but the squares around it become weak. You may notice, for example, that f2 (or f7 for Black) is the weakest square in the original position because it is only protected by the king. Piece sacrifices on this square are very common. Take for example, the game at right, Retí--Wolf, Teplitz-Schönau 1922.

|}

Here Black exploited the semi-open nature of the center and the fact that the king was stuck there with the shot '''15...Nxf2!''' Black exposes White's king position. '''16.Bh7+''' If ''16.Kxf2'' then ''16...Ng4+ 17.Ke1 Qxe3+ 18.Ne2 Bf5! 19.Bxf5 Qf2+ 20.Kd2 Rxe2+ 21. Kc3 Qxc5+'' and Black wins. '''16...Kh8 17.0-0 Nfg4 18.Nxa8''' White decides to grab material to compensate for the poor position he has acquired--but Black has seen more deeply into the position. '''18...Nxe3 19.Qe2 Nxf1 20.Bb1 Nxh2 21.Nb6 Nef3+!''' White must have overlooked this sacrifice. '''22.gxf3 Qg5+ 23.Kxh2 Rxe2+ 24.Nxe2 Qe5+ 25.Ng3 Qxb2+ 26.Rc2 Qxb1 27.Re2 Be6 28.f4 g6 29.Na8 h5 30.Nc7 h4 31.Nh1 Qd3 32.Rf2 Bf5''' and White resigned. Black has a decisive material advantage and a continuing attack.

In addition to the way the attack was conducted, one must also realize that the sacrifice was purely intuitive, backed up by a few short-term calculations. At the grandmaster level, there are many cases of such speculative sacrifices. The point is that grandmasters, with their great experience and extremely useful intuition, can easily evaluate a key strategic point of an attack, something that computers will never be able to do. Grandmaster intuition is a fantastic guide, and helps the masters play moves like 15...Nxf2! Also, note that Black was not playing for mate. If an attack leads to the win of material then you must call it a success. Don't just keep lashing out; regroup your material and then use your advantage in force, which will win the game. 


===The necessary preconditions for an attack===
Before the attack is conducted in full, one or more conditions must be fulfilled. This was the mistake that the Romantics and amateurs alike made: the conditions are not always fulfilled. In general, two or more of the following requirements must be met to conduct a successful attack on the king:
:1. Control of the center, or else that it is closed, so that the defender cannot land a counterblow there.
:2. A general space advantage in the area where the enemy king resides.
:3. General weaknesses in the opponent's king position.
:4. The number of attackers is more than the number of defenders.
:5. Open lines to the king.
:6. The majority of your army is posted in the king's sector, or if not, your army can easily get there with speed and efficiency.
Without these prerequisites, the defender will either have excellent chances for a successful counterattack or a successful defense. Note that most combinations of material will suffice to attack a king; in a game Reti--Alekhine, Baden-Baden 1925, Alekhine successfully attacked White's king even while the queens were swapped off.

===The pawn storm===
A pawn storm is the use of an avalanche of pawns to bust holes in the king's castled position. This is the slowest, but usually the most accurate, way to attack the king. For example, if you have a piece attack against a king, the only way to get in against a strong castled king position is by sacrificing material, or else inducing him to create weaknesses in the position. Pawn storms are usually good for the following reasons:
:1. They induce weaknesses in the king's position.
:2. The exchange of these pawns will create open lines for attack.
:3. They can support the attacking pieces.
:4. They can drive away enemy defenders of the castled position.
:5. Near the end of an attack, a pawn may promote after reaching the back rank to help continue the attack.
For example, the &quot;career&quot; of an h-pawn, as regards the attack, as described by Vladimir Vukovic in his classic, &lt;u&gt;The Art of Attack in Chess&lt;/u&gt;, goes as follows:
:1. '''h3''' A pawn drives a piece away from g4, so as to support another pawn or piece coming to g4 for the attack (supporting the &quot;little bayonet&quot;).
:2. '''h4''' The h-pawn becomes part of an attacking formation in conjunction with a knight on g5 and a rook on h1.
:3. '''h5''' The pawn goes to h5 to either drive away a defending piece on g6, or else exchange itself for a pawn on g6, weakening the king's position and opening lines for attack.
:4. '''h6''' The pawn drives a wedge into the kingside dark squares, forcing ...g7-g6 and allowing his pieces to exploit the weakened dark squares.
:5. '''h7(+)''' The pawn checks the king, creating an immediate threat to Black's position.
:6. '''h8(Q)''' The pawn promotes and continues the attack as a queen.

===Open lines in the attack against the king===
Open lines to the king are like highways. Your pieces can travel easily and efficiently down them to reach their goal. That is why it is essential that the king castle as soon as possible in an open position. The opponent can exploit these highways with his rooks, queen, and bishops, which will make attacking your king all the easier.

Take a look at it this way. Is it easier to attack a king on g8 that is surrounded by pawns on f7, f6, and h7, or f7, g7, and h7? The first one, of course, becomes a rook shifting to the g-file followed by the queen coming in will quickly mate. In addition, these pawns lose their defensive value as they advance, because the further advanced pawns are, the easier it is for pieces to get behind them. Pawn sacrifices to get to an enemy king are not rare, either, because no price is too high to pay as long as your last pawn delivers mate.

| '''Alekhine--Astalósź'''
'''Kećskemet, 1927'''
''Position after Black's 26th move''
|}

The position at right was excellently played by someone on everyone's list of &quot;greatest attacking players of all time&quot;, Alekhine. Amongst Tal, Morphy, and Kasparov, Alekhine was a rare bird who was a natural attacking player. As fourth World Champion, it was said that to beat Alekhine you had to beat him three times: once in the opening, once in the middlegame, and once in the endgame. In fact, it was Alekhine who established the tradition of extensive opening preparation that is a hallmark of the world's top GMs today. It seemed as if one only needed to give Alekhine a lime and he could make lemonade.

The first thing Alekhine took into account when looking at this position were the possibilities for attack. Black is cramped, and his bishop pair is quite meaningless in this closed position. He also noted that his knight was strongly posted on e5, and Black has no play on any part of the board. Perhaps if Black could open up the position, his two bishops would become meaningful in a central counterattack, discussed on the previous page. However, Alekhine also notices that such action is impossible in this position. Thus, he decides not to rush the attack, but to begin by advancing a pawn. '''27.h4!''' White plans to set up a battery of queen and bishop on the b1-h7 diagonal, threatening mate. The h-pawn advance discourages defense with ...g7-g6 because then White could answer with h4-h5. '''27....Raa8 28.Bb1 h5''' The threat was 29.Qc2 g6 30.h5. 29....f7-f5 would not be good, as it would leave Black with a permanent weakness on e6, upon which White could direct his pieces. '''29.Qf3 g6 30.g4! hxg4 31.Qxg4''' White has successfully used a pawn storm to break open lines on the kingside for attack. In addition, the pawn advance has created weaknesses on the kingside, which White can exploit with his knight and queen. '''31....Bg7 32.Ba2''' 32.h5 was stronger, although this move is also good, preventing Black from moving his f-pawn for lateral defence of the kingside. '''32....b4 33.Bc4!''' Black's last move was a bid for active play, which of course White refuses. '''33....bxa3 34.bxa3 Qa5 35.Qe4''' If 35.Nxg6 immediately, then 35....Rxd4. '''35....Qc7 36.Qf4 Rab8 37.h5!''' Opening the g-file for the rooks. '''37....gxh5 38.Kh1 Rb7 39.Rg1 Qe7 40.Rxg7+ Kxg7 41.Rg1+ Kh7 42.Nxf7!''' Black resigns because of 42....Qxf7 43.Bd3+ Qg6 44.Qf8!!.

When playing over this game, note not only how Black was denied all counterplay, but also how the pawn advances opened up lines to the enemy king. In this manner, White could slowly create weaknesses in Black's position. After a certain point, it was too much for Black to handle, and he could not survive it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cover Letters read after Resumes ==
Whenever I have taught about resumes in my vocational computer class for adults, I always ask if any of my students have done hiring previously, and I try to obtain feedback from them to make sure that I am teaching correct information, since truly every business does the hiring process differently.   One common trend I found from them, and from my own past experience in hiring people is that usually the resume is read first and then the cover letter.  I think this needs to be included in this article.  I'm only putting it here for discussion, because I know this goes against &quot;traditional wisdom&quot;.  But it makes sense that most people hiring read resumes, because they need to take a stack of potential employees, and quickly filter them, and the resume is the place that they look for key attributes that they know they want, and then after they have filtered out those who don't have those attributes, they start to look at the resume deeper, and then ultimately the cover letter.  If anyone wishes to make an argument, or has had different experience, please speak up.  If I don't get any counter opinions, I'll be bold and post my ideas. --[[User:Jacob Walker|Jacob Walker]] ([[User talk:Jacob Walker|talk]]) 04:55, 2 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;u&gt;'''Classroom Management'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

There are many strategies to help teachers become more effective at classroom management.
  
Our course text, '''&lt;u&gt;Educational Psychology (3rd Canadian Edition)&lt;/u&gt; Custom Edition''' suggests several practices and approaches. 

The ideas shared in this section reflect our reactions to Chapter 11: Creating Learning Environments.

===&lt;u&gt;Teacher's Casebook: Creating Learning Environments&lt;/u&gt;===
''What Would You Do?''

Two boys in your classroom are terrorizing another student. They are larger, stronger, and older than the boy being victimized, who is small and shy. There are incidents on the bus before and after school, in the gym, and at lunch including intimidation, extortion of lunch money, tripping, shoving, and verbal taunts -- &quot;fag: is a favourite chant. The other students in your class see what is going on and know you are aware of the problem too.

'''Critical Thinking'''

How do you handle this situation? What if the bullies were not in your classroom? What if the bullies and victim were girls? How will these issues affect the grade levels you will teach?

''What Would They Do?''

*I really liked what William Wallace had to say in the Teachers'Casebook section on pp440-441, esp. the beginning of the second paragraph - prevention, develop the relationship, mutual respect, so you can deal with conflicts on a human to human level. The book The Explosive Child is a great reference for the use of collaborative problem solving strategies.  Conflict is natural,  there is usually a reason why people are acting out, we have to rise to the challenge of teaching and helping our students learn to help themselves.

In the case of the above case study, &quot;prevention&quot; is the first order of business in my opinion. On a practical level, the student being victimized must be assured a safe and healthy space within the school and within the environments (such as a bus ride) that support the school. I am an educator who has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy when it comes to bullying, persecution, racism, discrimination, theft, and physical violence. From a societal standpoint, this is simply not acceptable in any shape or form.

Having stated the above and in alignment with “developing relationships”, I believe it is important for a teacher to attempt to understand the motivating factors behind the bully’s actions. As is explored later in this chapter, “knowing your classroom” includes knowing your kids and the various life factors that affect them daily. ''Empathy'' is a very strong tool for an educator to utilize in this case study.

A typical conditioned response from a teacher would to purely take punitive measures with the students, send them to the vice-principal, and have them removed from the class or worse - expelled.  This is merely a band-aid effort as there are definitely contributing factors to the bully’s behaviour. With the incorporation of empathy, a teacher digs deeper and strives to understand the underlying factors. Perhaps these bullies are victims of abuse within their own home environments including physical, verbal and/or psychological abuse.  Perhaps their only means of acting out is to victimize those around them that they perceive to be weaker and more vulnerable. It is a tragic but age-old scenario of reverse emotional projection. I myself was bullied by a student who was severely beaten up by his father daily. I did not find this out until many years later.

As other students in the class are aware of the situation and are aware of the teacher’s knowledge of the situation, it is paramount that modeling occurs in which the problem is confronted head-on with compassion and effective problem-solving strategies. Such bullies would need to be assessed emotionally and psychologically by the counseling staff of the school, with the hopes of developing mutually respectful relationships and best assessing what support can be provided for them.

If the scenario included female bullies, regardless of gender- the outcome would remain the same to me. Persecution simply does not have a healthy place in our society and as a teacher, I feel compelled to do my best to support students in any manner I am capable. - Christopher WIlson

===&lt;u&gt;'''The Need For Organization '''&lt;/u&gt;(pp. 405-408)=== 

In any given class, teachers encounter a multitude of challenges which must be juggled every day. For instance, classrooms are:

:*crowded with diverse people, of varying goals, preferences and abilities. 
:*environments where resources and tasks must be shared interactively and collaboratively. 
:*fast paced places of simultaneous activity. 
:*unpredictable, no matter how carefully we might plan. 
:*thoroughly public spaces where a teacher's behaviour, fairness, and consistency are always open to scrutiny. 
:*contexts with their own unique histories, where people adopt normative behaviours based on their experiences there.
 
Managing classrooms effectively therefore requires ongoing study and practice in order to develop proficient levels of skill. A basic challenge in this is to gain the trust and cooperation of students, who are essential partners in creating a productive classroom. And while some may choose not to invest themselves, those students should not be allowed to diminish or disrupt others' participation. Accordingly, then, a key management task is to establish productive, working relationships with students.



&lt;big&gt;'''The Goals of Classroom Management'''&lt;/big&gt;

Ultimately, the aim of classroom management is to maintain a learning environment that is positive, productive, and relatively free of behavioural problems. This is important toward facilitating:

*'''Increased Time For Learning''' 
:*Effective classroom management allows more time to be allocated for learning. 
::*Of course, to be valuable, such time must be used effectively, as time on task, where students are actively engaged in learning. 
:*Note, engaged time doesn't necessarily guarantee learning; the phrase academic learning time designates that students are working on task AND learning effectively. 
:*Academic learning time may thus be increased by keeping students actively engaged in worthwhile and appropriate learning activities. 

*'''Improved Access To Learning''' 
:*In order to participate successfully in a given task, students must understand the participation structure, that is, the rules defining how to participate. 
:*Thus, for students to understand, participation structures must be clear, straightforward, and consistently reinforced. 

*'''Encouragement of Student Self-Management''' 
:*Students need to be taught self-regulation and self-control to enable them to better manage themselves. 
:*They must learn to set goals and priorities, manage their time, make balanced choices, and deal with consequences of their decisions. They must learn to mediate disputes, reach agreements, and develop trusting relationships with others. 


=== &lt;u&gt;'''Creating a Positive Learning Environment'''&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 409-418) ===

Recent studies have confirmed an important link between effective discipline and effective learning. For instance, consider this statement: &quot;the most and least effective teachers were identified on the basis of the quality of classroom management and student achievement later in the year&quot; (p.409).


&lt;big&gt;'''Procedures and Rules Required'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Procedures''', though seldom written down, are prescribed steps for how activities and routines are to be accomplished in the classroom. For example, some recommended areas in which to establish procedures (Weinstein, 2003; Weinstein &amp; Mignano, 2003) include:

1. Administrative routines

2. Student movement

3. Housekeeping

4. Routines for accomplishing lessons

5. Interactions between teacher and student

6. Talking among students

Page 411 in particular contains many excellent suggestions for the creation of classroom procedures.


'''Rules''' are statements that specify expected and forbidden actions in the classroom; these are usually written down and posted. Professors Martin and Sugarman of Simon Fraser University (p.410) provide the following recommendations to help guide rule making:

1. Consider what type of atmosphere you want to create in your classroom

2. Consider what kind of student behaviour will help you teach more effectively

3. Consider what type of limits students need to guide their behaviour

4. Ensure classroom rules are consistent with the rules of the school, and are in keeping with professional principles of learning.


Emmer and colleagues (2003) suggest the following rules for secondary students:

1. Bring all needed materials to class.

2. Be in your seat and ready to work when the bell rings.

3. Be respectful and polite to everyone.

4. Be respectful of other people's property.

5. Listen and stay seated while someone else is speaking.

6. Obey all school rules.


Overall, it is beneficial to involve students themselves in the process of creating classroom rules. This collaboration will help ensure that they understand the rules, remain more responsive to them, and develop a better capacity to self manage. Also, since students at all levels learn in diverse ways, it is good to employ a variety of organizational and visual tools when teaching students about behavioural expectations - just as you would with other types of lessons.

So ... once you have established your classroom rules, what happens when students transgress them? First of all, it is important to remember that the rules are a means to an end, and not important in and of themselves. As the text notes, “… order for its own sake is an empty goal” (406). Relationships are the foundation of learning, and it is just as important to have established a positive rapport with your students, taken the time to get to know them, and allowed opportunities for them to see you as a person too, not only as an authority figure.

It is in this context that trust is established, and choices and consequences may be frankly discussed as a classroom community. Students need to be taught that every action is a choice with its own set of consequences. Some consequences follow naturally, in cause and effect sequence; for instance, the result of a young person's overindulgence with alcohol may be illness. Other consequences may be imposed by society; for example, getting drunk and disorderly many lead to suspension from school. Whenever possible, the most effective consequence will be an obvious result of the transgression; for instance, if a student intentionally damages another students MP3 player, a direct consequence would be for the offending student to take responsibility for replacing the broken item or restoring it to working order. This would exemplify a 'restorative justice' framework, rather than a 'punitive justice' model.

In any case, the consequences for breaking classroom rules must be clear and explained to all students before any rules are broken or consequences imposed. Page 412 of the text provides an excellent list of tips regarding the establishment of consequences.

=== &lt;u&gt;Creating a Learning Community&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 418-420) ===

&lt;big&gt;''' Classroom Community&lt;/big&gt;

How can we facilitate social responsibility among students? David and Roger Johnson have theorized &quot;three Cs&quot; for developing classroom community: '''C'''ooperative community, '''C'''onstructive conflict resolution, and '''C'''ivic values. While we strive for a state of &quot;positive interdependence&quot; (co-operative community) in the classroom, it is important to note that conflict is inevitable and can be a positive, or even necessary stage of learning. Constructive conflict resolution, in which outcomes are negotiated and agreed upon by all parties, thus becomes an important pedagogical agent. These negotiations will in turn be informed by the civic values developed within the classroom community through various means (direct teaching, modeling, discussions, and the airing of concerns.)

&lt;big&gt;''' Getting Started on Community&lt;/big&gt;

Clearly, this is an ongoing process in which each part informs the whole, and each teachable moment builds on the last. The classroom and school community evolves through each transition, over time creating a general culture of social responsibility. But before this process can even begin there must be input from teachers, parents and students. In the example of Blakeburn School, a leadership team developed a plan which related their philosophy with a provincial ministry document on social responsibility. It brought this plan to a larger group of stakeholders and ironed out a common language and set of expectations. Students and teachers then spent the first week of school working on their understanding of issues around personal agency and social responsibility, which were integrated into all levels of school life from curriculum to personal interactions. In this way, an entire school was brought &quot;on board,&quot; with seemingly lasting impact.

*While in a class of 30+ students, it often becomes difficult to ensure that every student is afforded equal opportunity for success.  I have often found that either too much time is spent encouraging less capable students or focused on engaging more capable students that one group or another gets neglected.  The guidelines on page 450 of the text, give great examples as to how to avoid this. One in particular that I found to be especially significant, is “monitoring your non-verbal behaviour.”  It is amazing how much we can communicate through our body language and the students are continually watching.  It is the teacher that needs to show what the atmosphere of the classroom will be.  Recently, I was faced with a situation teaching a Grade 12 University level course with a wide variety of mixed ability students, at least 3 had IEP reports with learning challenges.  Much of the class was based around group discussion and partnered work.  It was essential for a cohesive classrooms that each student felt valued and that they were comfortable to share their opinions.  From the very first day, I noticed that many of the students turned away and tuned out when we were having meaningful class discussions.  As the discussions began, usually it was dominated by two people without anyone else volunteering.  It was essential that I gave other people opportunity to speak as soon as they put up their hand.  By doing this, the other students realized that if they had a comment, they would be heard.  Also, I ensured that students who had a hard time expressing themselves had opportunity to clarify what they wanted to say.  After a few classes, students were more ready to engage in conversation from the beginning of class.  It actually became difficult to end the discussions and assign the work.  I also noticed groups of students working with a wider variety of people when choosing group work.  The students felt confident enough to choose topics that interested them rather than just working with their friends.  It is essential to ensure that each student feels like they are a valuable part of the classroom.  Also, I allowed the students to resubmit any work until a given deadline.  The students really appreciated this because those in need of good marks for university acceptance had opportunity to improve their marks, and those that may not have been as academically strong, had opportunity to receive feedback on their assignments and make any necessary changes without being singled out.  This allows for a fair means of evaluation and allows students to achieve higher learning because they don’t get discouraged over a low mark.  Overall, these guidelines allow for a happier well-balanced classroom.

=== &lt;u&gt;Maintaining a Good Environment for Learning&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 420-427) ===
&lt;big&gt;
'''Encouraging Engagement'''&lt;/big&gt;

It is really important to understand that the format of any lesson given in a classroom will affect the amount that the students involve themselves. As a teacher if you try and find a way in which to present a lesson that would address the students interest the level of involvement would increase. There are several ways in which a teacher can increase student involvement:

1. Guide the students with continuous cues on what to do next. (This might be very useful for the grade nine and ten classes)

2. Provide all the materials needed for the students to do the task laid out for them.(This is really important in the art and science classes)

3. Keep the students interests up. If you find that the levels of engagement in decreasing try to quickly modify your lesson to gain the students interest back.

4. Link the lesson to real life things. In other words try and make the lesson authentic.

5. Make all the instructions clear from the very beginning of the task.

These instructions include: 
:*work requirements 
:*rules about late and/or incomplete work 
:*the due dates 

6. Communicate the assignment. There are several ways in which a teacher can give out an assignment and the way in which you would do it would really depend on the needs of your students.

Some examples of how to give out an assignment might be: 
:*write the assignment on the board 
:*give out a syllabus at the beginning of the course 
:*remind students of upcoming assignments 
:*hand out an assignment sheet with the instructions on it 
:*demonstrate how to do the assignment 

7. Monitoring the students while they are working on the assignment. The teacher needs to make sure that the students get start on the task and is doing it right. It is important to not just check or help the students who raise their hands but to check if EVERYBODY is doing the work properly. It is really important to check the progression of the students.

Some things a teacher might want to do in order to check up on the students work is to: 
:*have weekly or biweekly meeting with the students 
:*have a midway discussion 
:*midway marks to illustrate where the students work is heading and how they might want to improve it. 

8. Give students constant feedback. This relates very much to number seven and should be done while you are monitoring the student’s progression. Feedback is really important because it allows students figure out where they are and if they are doing the assignment right. As we know, students like to have the freedom to do things on their own but as adolescents, they still need the reassurance that they are doing something right.

It is important to consider: 
:*Once an assignment is completed, it is important that you hand it back as quickly as possible. 
:*It is also a nice idea to put up the students work (if they want to show their work in the class) so they can each other work and possibly get ideas for omething they might want to do in another assignment. 
:*As a teacher it is also extremely important to have a record or marks. This is important because students might want to be able to see their marks on request or see what projects they still have to do in order to have everything completed. 
:*If a large assignment is given out it is really important to breaking it down into smaller phases. This will prevent students from getting confused and doing a poor job or getting to stressed out resulting in them not being able to do the work at all. 


&lt;big&gt;'''Dealing With Discipline Problems'''&lt;/big&gt;

Being effective with classroom management does not mean publically correcting all instances of misbehaviour. This type of public attention may may actualy reinforce student misconduct. Emmer and colleagues (2003) and Levine &amp; Nolan (2000) suggest seven simple ways to stop misbehaviour, moving from least to most intrusive:

1. Make eye contact with, or move closer to, the offender.

2. Try verbal hints such as name dropping, or asking the student a question to get him/her back on task.

3. You may consider asking the student if he/she is aware of the effect of their behaviour.

4. Remind students of class procedures. Quietly take away items that are a distraction.

5. in a calm voice, ask the student to recall the correct prcodure and then ask them to follow it.

6. Tell the student, in a clear and assertive voice, to stop the misbehaviour.

7. Offer the student a choice between following the procedures or accepting the consequences of their actions (e.g. removal from classroom).


&lt;big&gt;'''Special Problems With Secondary Students'''&lt;/big&gt;

Many secondary students fail to complete their work. What can we do to deal with this?

:*teach students how to use a daily planner 
:*establish and consitently enforce consequences for incomplete work 

Some students are repeatedly breaking the same rules. How can we handle this?

:*seat students away from others who might be a source of conflict or distraction 
:*establish and consitently enforce consequnces for misbehaviour 
:*teach students how to monitor their own behaviour (see ch. 6)
 
Guidelines for consequences:

:*delay the discussion until you and the students involved are calm and rational 
:*impose consequnces privately 
:*after imposing consequences, establish a positive relationship with the student 
:*set up a graded list of consequences that apply to the most common occasions
 
Dealing with hostile students:

:*remove yourself from the situation as soon as possible 
:*offer the student a moment to cool down outside the class -- talk to the student privately once he/she has calmed down 
:*if the student refuses to leave the class, send another student to call for a VP 
:*if misbehaviour persists, consider meetings with parents, school counselors, and administration 
:*speak with colleagues to see if this student is disruptive/hostile in other classes 
:*keep detailed records of students' actions 
:*in instances of violence of desctruction of property: 
:*do not attempt to break up a fight, or apprehend a student 
:*make a note of the students involved and any witnesses 
:*inform the school of the situation as soon as it is safe to do so

=== &lt;u&gt;The Need for Communication&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 427-434) ===

'''&lt;big&gt;Diagnosis: Whose Problem Is It?&lt;/big&gt;'''

''Ask yourself, &quot;Does this student's action tangibly affect my ability to fulfill my role as a teacher?&quot;''
:*You own the problem if you are blocked from reaching your goals by student action. You must confront the student and seek a solution. 
:*Your student owns the problem if they are blocking their own success. They must find a solution, but you can offer couseling. 


&lt;big&gt;'''Counseling: The Student's Problem'''&lt;/big&gt;
:*Once you have decided whose problem it is you can act. 
:*If a students brings their problem to you be an '''empathetic and active listener'''. 
:*Listen to their words and their emotions and paraphrase what they said being sure to capture the emotions, intent and the meaning behind them. 
:*By letting students realize that they have really been heard by their teacher, they can begin to trust that teacher and talk more freely. 
:*Avoid the tendency to jump in with advice, solutions, criticisms and reprimands before listening to their problem. 


&lt;big&gt;'''Confrontation and Assertive Discipline'''&lt;/big&gt;

''Assertive Discipline'' shows that you care too much about the student and the process of learning to allow the inappropriate behavior to continue. The Assertive Disciplinarian:

:*Makes expectations clear; 
:*Follows through with established consequences; 
:*Gives Students a straightforward choice; 
:*Is firm and unhostile when responding. 

In contrast, a teacher with a passive response style might ask the student to try or to think about appropriate behaviour, fail to follow through on consequences or ignore inappropriate behaviour altogether. They might ask questions such as: “Why are you doing that?” or “Don’t you know the rules?” or “Sam, are you disturbing the class?”

While a teacher with a hostile response style aggressively makes “you” statements such as: “You should be ashamed of the way you are behaving!” or “You never listen!” or “You are acting like a baby!” This response style also often includes threatening and vague consequences that are impossible to follow through.

Note: Critics have questioned the consequence focus of assertive disciple as undermining student self management.


&lt;big&gt;'''Student Conlicts and Confrontations'''&lt;/big&gt;
It is important for the teacher to communicate to the students that bullying is an unacceptable behaviour in the classroom. Clearly identifying the issue will help in its prevention. A common form of bullying that arises in the classroom is verbal assaults. When acknowledged by the teacher the behaviour is often excused as, “Just teasing,” when quite often it is much more hostile. Barbara Coloroso, author of “The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander,” suggests that it is helpful to use two different words to describe two different activities. These activities are teasing and taunting. Teasing is a fun thing to do with friends, where as taunting is designed to hurt another person. Barbara Coloroso created a list of ways to identify taunting:

Taunting:

1. Is based on an imbalance of power and is one-sided

2. Is intended to harm

3. Involves humiliating, cruel, demeaning, or bigoted comments thinly disguised as jokes

4. Includes laughter directed at the target

5. Is meant to diminish the sense of self-worth of the target

6. Includes fear of further taunting or can be a prelude to physical bullying

7. Is sinister in motive

8. Continues especially when targeted kid becomes distressed or objects to the taunt

(Barbara Coloroso, “The Bully, the Bullied, the Bystander,” p. 33)[1].

=== &lt;u&gt;Summing It Up: Learning Environments for All Students&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 434-437) ===

&lt;big&gt;'''Research on Different Management Approaches'''&lt;/big&gt;

The meta-analysis of three general perspectives on management (including: Influencing students through listening and problem solving; group management through class meetings and student rewards; and control through rewards and punishments) found no clear conclusions as to their impact on students' behaviours. However, research has shown that a combination of a variety of discipline approaches does have positive effects:

:*Recognition for appropriate behavior 
:*Hints about what is unacceptable 
:*Discussion about how behavior affects others 
:*Student involvement in discipline decisions 


&lt;big&gt;'''Culturally Responsive Management'''&lt;/big&gt;

The affects of culture on classroom management most commonly play out as a lack of cultural synchronization between teachers and students. These types of misunderstands might lead to the disciplining of unintentionally disruptive or disrespectful behaviours.

Strategies:

Consider cultural meanings and styles when planning how to manage and respond to students; 
:*Be a warm demander: show high expectations and great caring for students; 
:*Use humour and dialect to communicate expectations. 


&lt;big&gt;'''Communicating With Families About Classroom Management'''&lt;/big&gt;

1. Make sure that families know the expectations and rules of your class. (Ex: Provide families with a list of due dates and tips on how to encourage prompt and stress free completion.)

2. Make families partners in recognizing good citizenship. (Ex: Communicate successes, not only problems with parents.)

3. Identify talents in the community to help learning environments in your class. (Ex: Contact community members and parents to help find services, equipment and resources for the classroom.)

4. Seek cooperation from families when behavior problems arise. (Ex: Keep parents informed and listen to their input.)

=== &lt;u&gt;Responses&lt;/u&gt;  ===


*One of the comments that got my attention in the 'need for organization' comments at the beginning of our reading material was the final sentence:
 ''the history of the first few weeks of school affects life in the class all year.'' (p. 405)

:I can relate this to my practicum. I felt my first impressions were crucially important to develop the proper balanced relationship between the students and myself. Upon doing so, I would have a great chance at success with my lessons due to the trust and willingness of the students to allow me to fill their heads with knowledge. That being said, I'm not sure that everyone's experience is the same. I'm interested to hear what various people have to say about the value of &quot;the first few weeks&quot; of class, in reference to class management. Do you need to 'set up' that standard, and if so, how do you do that? As we discussed today, a teacher can have bad classroom management skills and still be considered one of the teachers who guided us to ''become'' teachers.

:How do we establish that &quot;behaviour standard&quot; from the beginning? 

:Comments? Experiences? 

:I know that the kids in my class over practicum where sooo good to me, they could have been monsters but they had a tough ass teacher who also showed them that they deserved excellent lessons and cared about them.  The thing that I have noticed over the years is that the kids do not assume the respect your elders stance, an &quot;elder&quot; has to gain the students respect, I think this is healthy!  Lance was right - know your student!!!  or try this; &quot;go ahead punk make my day&quot;

*I had an interesting experience trying to apply my own classroom management techniques in my practicum experience that directly relates to the history of the classroom.  One of my biggest challenges was trying to refocus thirty grade nine students in a drama class.  Their teacher used a countdown method that was very effective but was hard for me to adopt, so I established my own clapping approach.  The difficulty with applying my own method was that the students were already used to the procedures of their teacher and instituting something different was somewhat confusing for them.  Therefore I had trouble using my method and I regularly had to remind them of the new rule.  Reflecting back on my experience I think I should have maintained the techniques they were experienced with, to not only establish myself as their teacher but also in fairness to the class.


:I think this situation shows how effective it is to establish classroom management techniques at the beginning of the school year.  This class responded well to their teacher’s countdown because they knew what it meant, they understood the consequences for not paying attention, and they had become accustomed to it.  Their teacher had created such firm guidelines that when I tried to modify things, it did not work so well.

:I strongly believe that the first few weeks are fundamental to how the rest of the year will go, but similar to Jeff, I am unsure of how to establish those necessary rules and procedures in the classroom.  I like the idea of collaborating with the students to determine the guidelines so that they feel valued and part of the process.  But I do struggle with how to make the rules clear while still maintaining a positive, fun, and energetic environment.

*I agree with Jamie that seeking thoughts and ideas from students in regards to what the classroom expectations should be, is key.  This way, the teacher is giving the students a voice, which shows them that as a teacher, you value their input and suggestions.  In regards to Jeff’s quote, I feel that establishing classroom rules in the beginning of the semester is crucial because as an educator, you have to maintain some sort of structure in order for your classroom to run smoothly throughout the semester.  What is more important however, is following through and being consistent with your classroom rules.  What I found difficult during my practicum was how my associate teacher always expected me to control the class and ensure that students were following the classroom rules.  I was to never let any form of disruption go unnoticed.  However, I learned that doing this is absolutely crucial because what is the point of establishing classroom rules if you are not going to follow-through with them?  If a student gets away with misbehaving once, then he/she would be propelled to misbehave again.  This in turn, would influence other students to disrupt the class.  Thus, being consistent with your classroom rules and addressing disruptive behaviour is crucial for the general well-being of your classroom. 

:In regards to specific classroom-management strategies, I used many non-reactive approaches during practicum.  For example, when students were talking out of place, I found “the look” to be most effective when dealing with students who were disruptive, or I would just sit back and wait for students to settle down.  It was amazing to see how the students responded to this strategy.

:Another strategy I have learned during my practicum was how important it is to be proactive in trying to prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour in the classroom.  For example, if students keep busy and are always engaged with an activity, this leaves little time for them to disrupt the class and misbehave.  Also, I have learned that establishing a general rapport with students builds trust and respect, where students will show more respect towards you in the classroom. Like Jamie, I too am wondering how a teacher can enforce classroom rules while still maintaining a fun and enjoyable learning environment.

:Any thoughts?

*I agree with Jeff on the point that the first few days with a new class are crucial in establishing a positive environment for the rest of the year.  
:One problem I encountered during my practicum was not letting the pressure of making a good first impression (greatly) affect my interactions with the class. It was really difficult for me to put my own concerns about being successful out of my head and focus solely on the needs of the students.  I think it is important to remember that our students are often feeling similarly anxious in the first few days of a new year or semester. 

:I am not sure I was entirely successful in establishing myself as an authority figure during the first week of my practicum. This was partly because my associate teacher was still finishing up the previous unit and so I was not teaching all the time, but also because I was having trouble seeing myself as the (or an) authority figure. It may seem obvious to some but I think an important step in establishing effective classroom management is being able to see one’s self as “the teacher”. Students will definitely take notice if you appear uncomfortable in that role and, as was the case in my practicum, will respond accordingly. 

:To that end, despite the fact that developing a standard of student-teacher (and student-student) interaction is critical within the first few days, it ''is'' possible for these interactions to change as time goes by.  Once I became more comfortable in my role as the classroom teacher, I found that several classroom management techniques came almost naturally to me, such as “the look”, saying a student’s name out loud when/he she was talking, or asking questions to help re-direct the focus of the class.  These techniques were effective with all of my classes – the students (both those being disruptive as well as the rest of the class) seemed to respond to the fact that I was taking charge of the situation and not letting disruptions go by unnoticed. Once secure in both our roles in the classroom and interactions with one another, the atmosphere of the class definitely changed for the better. 

:Though I have seen it work successfully – and, in fact, my associate teacher used it for all of her drama classes – I am hesitant about the practice of establishing a “formal” set of rules at the beginning of the year. Rather, though I think this is an important step – as students need to be aware of what behaviour is simply NOT acceptable – in an ideal situation I would place more emphasis on ''demonstrating'' the rules and procedures of the classroom – and communicating my expectations to the students through my behaviour. 
:As a student, this is my own preference and likely this is why I take the same approach as a teacher. Despite my hesitancy to create formal guidelines for classroom behaviour, I will likely still use the practice in my classroom as – just as I prefer to learn about appropriate behaviour through observation – there will be students who need, and like, to be told ahead of time about what the teacher and the students should expect of one another.

*Also following the thread regarding the first few days of school, I believe that it is important to 'set rules', however I don't mean that one should 'preach' rules and expectations, but rather come up with a list of ways to give and earn respect with regards to classroom management.  I believe I would begin by having a class discussion about a positive learning environment: asking the students what type of classroom they work best in including various methods for taking attendance (maybe the teacher is not always the one to do it), activities to start with in order to gain focus and even transitions such as bathroom breaks, moving on to new activities, language, silence, etc.

:This would be a group brainstorming activity where I would validate all responses and comment on the pros and cons from my point of view, which I think would lead into further discussion.  I have done this approach with older campers, and it has worked well because you are in many ways allowing the students to have a say and at the same time, you may learn a thing or two.  I would end the discussion by establishing what practices will be put into place by using terms such as &quot;can we all come to an agreement?”  I believe that this method is not only a useful way to throw out positive reinforcement ideas, but it also allows you to 'manage' each of your classes differently as ideas could vary from class to class.  The beauty of this also lies in what other classes come up with - if you hear/find a better 'process', then suggest it the following class with enthusiasm and maybe the overall outcome will be better.  

:Let me also add that I would never begin my very first class with 'the classroom contract' (at camp we would write out all the rules and then campers signed the bottom...I think high school students are too old for this...), but rather I would begin with stating 'the entry routine'.  As a drama teacher, I wish to continue in the footsteps of each and everyone of my previous drama teachers by asking students to remove their shoes once they enter the class (socks are more than welcome, even dance shoes or a drama shoe) and we begin in a circle sitting on the floor.  Introductions are a must, followed by some ice breakers and name games...once people are starting to feel more comfortable we can move on to 'the discussion'.  I'm a big fan of those 'tell me about yourself' activities, whether they are in the form or presentations or on paper.  I would give homework the first day only because I don't want drama to ever be seen as a 'bird course'.  This being said, homework would be nothing more than we've done at OISE: another 'tell me more about yourself/your family/what you like and dislike' sheet so that I can start gearing my lessons to their interests-even the first week.

*In line with the various ideas that have branched from Jeff's discussion of the &quot;first few days of class&quot;, I would like to highlight the idea of establishing effective communication within the classroom; both between students and between students and teachers.  One theory of communication that I found rather interesting and unique was called the, ''Paraphrase Rule''.  As explained in chapter 11, paraphrase rule, is a form of practicing and receiving messages by which, a participant is permitted to respond to another participant only after they have summarized the ideas of the person who spoke before them (pg. 428).  

:At first, I found this strategy to be quite inventive and clever.  I thought it was a great way to get students to not only be active listeners, but to also acquire information summary skills. However, I soon began to visualize how this would play out in a real classroom setting and I quickly began to realize that this theory, although seemly clever and feasible, it is not very realistic.  

:From my experience in practicum, one valuable thing that I learned is that there is not enough time in a period to get through all the material that one would hope to accomplish.  That said, I can only imagine trying to get through an entire lesson with the PLETHORA of &quot;noise&quot; interrupting the process(ie. student whispers, students' note taking in slow motion, announcements etc.) and then after finally getting through the lesson (if you're lucky) beginning a class discussion with the intention of using this ''Paraphrase rule'' in order to teach effective communication skills. Given the attention span of youth today, I cannot see that students would even be listening to their peers' responses in order to effectively summarize a response; and if this process takes as long as I imagine it would, I feel that this strategy would take far too long to hold the students' interest.

:Again, I do enjoy this theory for the development of effective communication skills, however the ''paraphrase rule'' seems more of an idealistic vision than an realistic one.  Any thoughts?

*I am going to continue along the theme of the importance of establishing routine and organization in the classroom early on in the term. I remember feeling completely overwhelmed my first week of my practicum. I couldn’t understand why I felt this way, as I have taught in various institutions in the past. After some considerable reflection, I realized the difference was the fact that I was walking into someone else’s class. A class settled into their routines (or lack of) and expectations. Although I successfully taught my lessons, I never felt completely comfortable with the set up of the classroom.  Students were sitting next to their friends, coming in late to class, eating in class, leaving for long periods at a time and so on. I couldn’t gain control, because I was working on someone else’s ground. I decided to restructure the class to suit my teaching style. Immediately, the dynamics in the classroom changed. I was able to move easily around the classroom to assess and make eye contact with all students. In addition, I set up classroom rules and expectations. With these few changes, the class ran smoothly and the students reacted to the changes positively. I find it interesting that Jamie and I had completely opposite experiences. I suppose difference between the associate teachers would affect how the class would respond to new ideas or routines.

*I agree, it’s extremely important to establish classroom management techniques at the beginning of the school year. What I found to be most challenging during practicum was attempting to implement my own rules &amp; procedures, for example, a good majority of students had difficulty with self-management, they had an extremely difficult time working independently especially on homework assignments. I found that there was no concrete rules established that indicated the repercussions of their actions. Viewing this from the student’s perspective: If there are no consequences then why should I be responsible &amp; stay on task?

:I found the section “Prevention is the Best Medicine” (pg. 422-423) offered some good examples of effective teaching. “Group focus” indicated the importance for teachers to involve as many students as possible in activities so that all students have something to do- that’s wonderful! However, I dislike the example that was provided, I think that having the children hold up cards is good for involvement but is a poor method to check for knowledge/understanding. 

:If I recall correctly, some studies have shown that people go against their better judgment and agree with the majority in order to “fit in”; even when the answer was clearly wrong. With that said, I wonder if that pertains to children in the classroom as well.

*It would seem that we're all on board with establishing a set of classroom guidlelines early into the year.  This agrees with my practicum experience, where I took over five of my ATs classes in his absence because of a 3 day field trip that he had to attend.  Having been left with a room full of 'strangers' without a viable authority figure to turn to, I really felt the need to establish clear guidelines with the students.  The first line of defense, for me, proved to be the after class chat.  Pulling aside a disruptive student to discuss his actions, their effects on me and his colleagues, and the consequences of futher disruptions was very effective in my situation.  I also tried to appeal to the students sense of good will (&quot;help me out with this . . .), giving them more ownership and responsisbilty over their actions.  In retrospect, I think this clarity helped establish what the positive rapport we enjoyed together.  

:That said, this rapport developed slowly.  I wasn't unitil the second half of our block that I started to feel a relationship with the students.  This is essential, as students seemed less inlclined to act out because of their concern for me.  We only have 4 weeks in our classes, so we need to be aware of the effectiveness of some of the aforementioned techniques in that context.  We don't really hold any real clout during practicum, and the students know that.  That's when you can only hope that you have a supportive AT in your corner to help things along.

*My practicum experience gave me an interesting insight on just how pivotal &quot;first contact&quot; and the establishment of ground rules can be. Unfortunately, I developed this insight through the difficulty of trying to assert a &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; approach to classroom management than what my AT had established. His method of gaining attention of either an individual or the class was to yell at them, and I found it extremely difficult to get them to respond to anything else. In the end, perseverance did show results, and I was able to quiet the class by simply standing by the board and waiting quietly until I had half of them, then doing a silent countdown on my fingers. I felt that I also made progress with individual students through one on one consultations that tried to get at the root of their frustrations, while explaining how their behavior was effecting my ability to teach the class. It took a lot of effort to get to this point, however. I had expected the students to quickly respond to a &quot;nicer&quot; method, as they clearly disliked being barked at, but they literally had to be re-trained.

'''Proactive Classroom Management'''

*Although it is often viewed within its own context, prevention of bullying is a direct function of classroom management.  Teachers have the potential to influence the behaviours of their students in negative, neutral and positive ways, according to the behaviours they themselves display.  In other words, teachers have the power to encourage or discourage bullying through consistent modeling.  Thus, it is very important for teachers to be aware of the signals they send, intentionally or unintentionally, when confronted with critical situations.  They must also understand that promotion of tolerance and civil behaviours is an ongoing, proactive effort.

:According to Janet Markus (OISE), a teacher is a model of how to be any number of things.  He or she may demonstrate what it means to be a man, a woman, an adult, a leader, etc.  Because adolescents are in the process of finding/shaping their identities, the teacher as a role-model is crucial.  So, when conflict in the classroom arises, students will watch the teacher’s reaction for cues on what is expected and appropriate behaviour.  When a teacher encourages or part-takes in bullying (this still happens in some communities), it is obviously very bad news.  More frightening is the thought of a teacher who chooses to ignore hostile behaviours, allowing them to continue.  In this situation, aggressive students may not realize what they are doing is wrong because there is no intervention on the part of the teacher.  Moreover, victims are likely to feel alienated and vulnerable.  This is a scenario of an “absence of classroom management” and it happens for a variety of reasons, most of which are inexcusable.  However, it may also occur when a teacher wants to act but lacks the confidence and training to confront questionable behaviour.  Considering the persistence of challenges associated with bullying in schools, it is surprising that prevention training is not yet a standard component of teacher education programs.  Entering the profession, teachers must realize that providing a safe, student-friendly learning environment is not only a part of good teaching – it is a duty of care.

:For teachers dedicated to achieving enduring positive results, it is necessary to distinguish between reactive and proactive approaches to classroom management.  Only one is genuinely effective.  Reactive solutions are limited to “damage control” over situations which could potentially be avoided.  It is not enough to say “stop” and move on, because students need to understand why certain actions are unacceptable.  This understanding is gained over time and requires consistent proactive reinforcement from the outset.  For teachers, this means establishing a clear set of rules, expectations and consequences as a foundation for all classroom activities.  For example, many high school teachers try to develop a contract of mutual respect during the first day of school.   This is an effective way to appeal to the students’ sense of maturity.  Furthermore, teachers are in a unique position to shape the learning environment by modeling desired behaviours.  Something as simple as making a conscious effort to use the students’ names as often as possible can have a dramatic impact on the kind of classroom culture that will emerge.

*As many others have said, during my History practicum I had a little trouble feeling comfortable in someone else's classroom. Even though my associates and the students were very welcoming, it is challenging to find your own style, without deviating too much from the set classroom atmosphere. My associate was a bit more strict than I am, and as such did not tolerate any sort of chatting during her lesson. If it was a temporary situation I was usually content to let it go, unless it became a lengthy chat. At first, since it did not bother me, I left minor incidents alone. I soon realized that just because I was not bothered did not mean that other students were also okay with the chatting. Haven't we all been in a class where someone was talking in front of us and we just wanted to listen? (Or is this just me?) Anyway, I realized that out of fairness to the rest of the class I would have to be more proactive in stopping this behaviour. However, the aspect of classroom management I found most challenging was what the chapter calls &quot;Withitness&quot;, or conveying to the students that you are aware of everything going on in the classroom. At first I could not figure out how I was missing students not paying attention, chatting or taking extended washroom breaks. However I soon realized that often I positioned myself in such a way that I was not able to see pieces of the room, especially when stopping to help a student or group. I found that if I made sure to help students while still facing the rest of the class, the amount of chatting and disruption decreased dramatically! As long as students saw me facing the classroom, they knew I was monitoring them and that they could not get away with anything. I also made an effort to create smooth transitions between activities, which kept more students involved and therefore less likely to cause trouble. Overall, once I realized my students needed me to be less laidback things began to run more smoothly. This is definately one of the more challenging aspects of teaching for me.  - Liz

*As most people have mentioned, it is crucial to develop ground rules right from the start. The first few weeks are essential in establishing respect within the classroom.  I really appreciate the comment on rights versus rules (p.412). Teaching there is a rule for something because it is wrong instead of reinforcing something is wrong because there is a rule is essential in the classroom. It is very important when working with children and youth to help them understand the reasoning behind issues. A better teacher-student relationship and overall classroom culture will be able to be cultivated by allowing students to critically assess information and reflect on the reasoning. It establishes a sense of maturity and allows them to become self-managers as they are given the opportunity to make a decision based on their knowledge of the facts and the consequences of their decisions.  I found it interesting to read that although studies have shown students respond in a more positive manner when they feel cared by their teachers, historically, North America schools have tried to regulate behaviour through rules rather than relationships (p.419). 

:During my practicum I found it very difficult to come into a classroom mid-way through the semester after ground rules and classroom expectations were already in place.  Although, my AT was very supportive and the experience was positive, I never felt entirely comfortable in the classroom in the beginning. I really commend Michelle for being able to establish her expectations midway through her practicum. I desperately wanted to state my expectations midway during my practicum but I was not able to envision in what manner I could present it. I felt as if it was too late to introduce my expectations. Nevertheless, after the first two weeks of my practicum my AT was away for a few days. During his absence I was given full responsibility of the classroom. This allowed me to be more at ease with the students and actually run the classroom the way in which I felt suited me. Allowing the students to see me in that setting with full control of the classroom and the material, gave them a chance to better connect with me, and propelled our relationship to a much better state. They were able to see I was sincere about my efforts in helping them.  After this incident I found they were much more respectful towards me and listened to what I had to say. I also found my confidence in my ability to control the classroom had increased, thus once my AT had returned I was able to be more assertive with my expectations for the group.  
:One of the keys to classroom management is that students should be able to detect you are comfortable and have the confidence to maintain control within the classroom however that may be. Therefore, It is vital to identify your own personal pedagogical style and be able to execute it, so that you can be as comfortable as possible in front of the class.

*For me during my practicum, classroom management was an interesting topic. From the outset I could tell things were not going to be quite as difficult as even your average math class, because my grade 11's and 12's were there by choice, rather than by default (arts courses beyond grade 9 are all 'electives'). Hence, my kids were mostly self-motivated and maintaining and orderly classroom was pretty easy. Yet, there were a few strategies that I found to be very effective that I feel I ought to share (ones I didn't see mentioned in the text).

:&lt;u&gt;'''Humour'''&lt;/u&gt;

:I realize that this doesn't come naturally to everyone, but I see it as an integral part of classroom management, especially when it comes to conflicts with students. There is obviously a time for being staunchly firm and unmoving, but before getting there, one can often be firm but employ the use of a joke or some sarcasm that lightens the atmosphere considerably, giving the same effect as a gentle admonition. This works wonders in classes with behavioural problems. In fact, the LAST thing you want to do is get into open conflicts with kids in front of the whole class, because kids will often escalate matters in order to save face--all of their friends are watching. So I believe that the rule of thumb is never to embarrass kids in front of their friends; take them outside into the hall if things are getting out of hand.

:&lt;u&gt;'''Know Your Class'''&lt;/u&gt;

:What motivates your kids? This was huge for me. My kids were at an all academic school that had no applied streams. Obviously, my kids were motivated by marks. For example, I found that introducing daily activities with the idea that they were going to be worth marks was a hugely motivational factor. Day one (unmarked), they all did half-assed jobs. Day two (marked), they went crazy. Later I managed to get most of the kids improvising (many who had never tried to before), by offering bonus marks. Technically we're not supposed to grant bonus marks, so I couldn't REALLY count them, but hopefully this will remain the best kept secret in existence...

:Kids who aren't motivated by marks are often motivated by the idea of 'life choices'--that everything we do has a consequence, and working hard is in their best interest if they want to become employed. In fact, I think this works much better with older kids (gr 11-12) in spite of their academic stream.

*There is actually a really useful article on classroom management in our TES course pack called “In Good Discipline, One Size Doesn’t Fit All.”  I think that as new teachers, many of us are afraid of dealing with classroom management because we want to focus on teaching rather than disciplining our students, but what this article points out is that “sound discipline is a prerequisite for student learning.”  

:However, discipline isn’t just detentions, and classroom management doesn’t have to mean demanding silence.  For example,  rather than yelling at a student who is not on task for “wasting their time,” the article suggests that a good discipline method would be a low-profile intervention, such as walking over to the student and reminding him to start, or offering them assistance with the assignment.  This was a method that I found very successful in my practicum, especially with special education and ELL students who needed a little extra one-on-one attention and generally appreciated the assistance.  Even if students had missed the instructions because they were talking, I preferred to walk over and explain the task to them, rather than interrupt my lesson by yelling at them for talking.  I think it shows more respect for the students, which encourages them to show more respect for the teacher.   

:The idea of the “low-profile” intervention also goes along with what Terry Alderman refers to as “Cruise Control.”  This is the technique of moving around the room to maintain classroom management.  I found this an incredibly effective preventative tool in my practicum.  By moving about the room, students refrained from talking and focused on their work; they also felt more comfortable asking questions.  The majority of students really appreciate a teacher who cares about them and will respond well when the teacher comes up to them individually to ask them if they have any questions or concerns.  In my practicum, my AT encouraged me to call out students names, stand at the front of the room with my arms crossed, or make comments like “if you waste my time I’ll waste yours,” but I found it was much more effective to walk over to groups of students who were talking, and ask them if they needed any help.  It may be more work for the teacher and it may not result in instant silence, but in the long run, I think students will be more interested in behaving well and working hard in the class. 

:In the article, Alderman also discourages teachers from using their voice as a discipline method for a similar reason, it only encourages student resentment.  Therefore, it is better to be positive than negative.  Alderman suggests that teachers emphasize the rules as opposed to the problems.  For instance, a teacher could yell at a student who calls out an answer instead of raising their hand, or simply thank the student who does remember to raise their hand.  However, if students are talking while you are trying to give instructions, it may be necessary to draw attention to them and ask them to be quite for the sake of maintaining order, but this can be done in as respectful a way as possible.  

:Finally, teachers need to be consistent with their discipline and need to administer negative consequences when necessary, keeping in mind that fairness isn’t sameness and some students will need more assistance for improvement than others.  Alderman encourages teachers to give themselves “permission to use different consequences with different students” and points out that “consistency with individual students is more important than always following the same consequence with every student in the class all the time.”  Setting out the rules from day one and letting students know that negative actions will result in negative consequences are essential elements of classroom management.  Students will see a teacher who does these things as a teacher who cares about whether or not they are learning.  Being “strict” doesn’t make you the bad guy if your students know that the rules are there out of respect for their learning and well-being.

*On Classroom Management and Establishing Rules 
:Growing up and learning from my experiences from high school definitely had some correlation between the readings we had for this week. In terms of managing the classroom, I always saw the teacher as part messenger, part guide, and part performer. Going to the front of the class everyday and having a handful of eyes on you definitely takes a lot of courage and determination.  And if the teacher is aiming for longevity in his/her career, he or she will need a ton of planning. Students really only have a fraction of that already small period given for each subject where they’re actually learning something, and from an entire chapter of material, they might have only retained a few key sentences (or at least you’re hoping that they’re the key ones). In order to limit the amount of chat time, fidget and fuss time, and simple organization time, it is best to have a clearly laid out plan that both the students and the teacher can see, whether it be a list on the board or books/handouts on the tables. That way, the only physical thing that the students are required to do is to pull out a pen, some paper, and make notes. Time is precious in a school classroom, but teachers are expected to be flexible enough to expand/contract the same amount of material to accommodate certain changes or unpredictable events (i.e. late students, students getting called out of class, etc.) And the most tricky and difficult task I think is the rules that teachers have to establish. I agree with the author’s point in that the rules should be laid down right at the beginning of the year, and I also believe that the rules should be flexible but never overridden. Part of the whole “gaining respect” part mentioned earlier in this discussion I think relies on making these rules firm and fair, and by letting the students know that you’re a professional and that you will not tolerate certain things allows them to recognize that you have already set a standard or value to their learning and that their safety, learning, and comfort in the classroom is important to you. The minute students start to see a teacher not care or cave in on a certain student just to maintain peace for that period or moment in class is when the students find a crack in the teacher’s structure, and as I remember in school, if the students start to find certain things in the class difficult they will take it out on the teacher and start to take advantage of the teacher’s weaknesses.   At the end of the day, students would rather be at home or with friends, talking about their own lives rather than what happened in class.  It is for this reason that teachers need to make their classes exciting, engaging, and interesting for the students in order to keep their attention and help them remember the material.  Finally, setting a routine is another helpful strategy that is vital in elementary systems but as teachers move into the higher years it starts to dwindle.

*'''SOME DIFFICULT QUESTIONS'''
:Wow! This is the first opportunity we’ve really had, for the most part, to read each others’ work, and I’m impressed with how thoughtful and well articulated everyone is. People’s commentaries were very stimulating, especially (for me), Lisa’s, Malexander’s, and Artur’s. Key concepts that I see over and over here include: consistency, follow-through, reflection, routines, fairness, and ‘intelligent discipline’ rather than reaction. People made some really good points. 

:I agree (i.e. w/ Lisa) that nipping misbehaviour in the bud is important, and that following through with expected consequences is essential if the rules are to be taken seriously, and people respected all ‘round. But it’s true that’s hard to do in someone else’s classroom. 
:In my first practicum placement (although in almost every other respect my AT was great), I noticed that my AT did not exhibit that ‘withitness’ quality. Instead, she would either not notice, or not respond, to rising levels of horseplay from the other side of the room from where she was occupied, while I couldn’t imagine how she wouldn’t notice it. It would build and build until she suddenly became aware and then yelled at the kids. Which was not very effective, and not preventative in the least, and really was unfair given that she allowed them to escalate their rule breaking. After which she would proceed to lecture/complain, asking rhetorically why they just wouldn’t behave, why they had to do such silly things, etc. Again, not effective and just caused even me to want to tune out – she wasn’t even giving them a directive, just venting, really. 

:As Artur noted, reactive solutions are limited to “damage control” over situations that could have been prevented. Many times in that context I wanted to intervene with something more firm and consistent, and eventually (after some candid discussions with her, and after developing some classroom rapport) I got comfortable enough to do so from time to time if necessary. Results were mostly positive, though they didn’t always heed me; I think one of the most effective techniques in that art classroom was simply to circulate and move myself sometimes into the proximity of whatever ‘event’ was going on until they felt uncomfortable carrying on like that with an adult nearby. 

:I think Malexander made some brilliant points: “discipline isn’t just detentions”, and “fairness isn’t sameness”. Most importantly, there is never a good reason to embarrass or humiliate a student. Apart from the fact it is unethical for our profession, it is also not effective. For, not only will it likely have a negative effect and just sow resentment and future resistance, but it can also be extremely damaging, depending on the person and the circumstances (i.e. might reinforce a larger pattern in which they have been similarly devalued, labeled, have low self esteem, and continue to act out – vicious cycle). But sadly, we have all seen authority figures – parents, teachers, cops, etc.- who seem to indulge in that kind of humiliation of people they don’t like. Which is really more about their insecurity and need to control. As Patch Adams (well, Robin Williams) said – ‘you don’t have to be a prick to get results’! Problem is that in the general population discipline is too often seen as synonymous with punishment (if imposed from outside), or as self-denial (if self imposed). The French philosopher Michel Foucault, who was a historian of the development of social institutions like prisons and asylums (which schools bear more than a passing similarity to) actually wrote a book called ‘Discipline &amp; Punish’. In it, he traces the cultural evolution of prison systems in Western societies, along with the generalization of their values &amp; principles in the creation of similarly functioning institutions like hospitals, schools, factories, police, military. The key concept here is '''REGULATION'''. The kind of pervasive, rational (but not necessarily reasonable) regulation which inspires rebellion; which “…cannot fail to produce delinquents.” (Foucault, 1977:266)

:In this sense, I think Artur’s discussion of bullying and alternately modeling as positive human beings is terribly important. Simply because bullying often goes on in very nuanced ways, with subtle, not very obvious causes and effects. Indeed, I tend to think that in some ways, the attitudes underlying bullying are almost inherent in the social system (especially the kinds of institutions we will work in), even if that is often subtle or submerged. I mean, where does bullying come from? Do we locate it only in the individual and see it as a result of a character flaw and maldevelopment? Everyone is a product of his/her environment, after all. What about the social formation of bullies? There really is not a fixed boundary b/w an individual mind and society, but rather a constant intersubjectivity with alternating moments of relative solitude. 

:The point? That our society, founded as it is on competitive, individualist, indeed aggressive principles, communicates something in the way of values and permissiveness that shapes institutions like schools and their ‘inmates’ (teachers &amp; students alike). Indeed, it has been said that capitalism, if left to it’s worst impulses, essentially becomes fascism. 

:Farfetched? I remember watching with a sense of absurd horror on the news yesterday as George Bush wound up his mid-east ‘peace’ tour by selling billions in advanced weaponry to Israel and Arabia. There’s something out of kilter that I’m trying to put my finger on, something very sick, that makes me ask, ‘why are we so surprised at the kind of bullying and behaviour problems that go on with our youth’? And, how do we instill civil, cooperative, creative, compassionate values in them surrounded by much more dominant, conflicting messages and examples in society, as above. More pointedly, is conflict inherent in the school system, in the structures we are being trained to reproduce, and thus compelling the very misbehaviour we are talking about managing? Related here is Chomsky’s notion of ‘cultural managers’ (teachers, professors, police, lawyers … professional classes with their own special privileges) who are often so invested in (and rewarded by) the system that they can't or won't see the underlying nature of the system they administer. 

:Very relevant I think to notions of classroom management, as through this, we’re also creating future citizens who are not only learning math, or art, or drama, or history, but are learning more than anything else to be disciplined according to the needs of a mobilized workforce.  
:And who may (as teenagers at least) rebel against that. Weinstein notes that “teaching children that something is wrong because there is a rule against it is not the same as teaching them that there is a rule against it because it is wrong, and helping them to understand why this is so” (Weinstein, 1999) (412). Nice point. alternately, does this mean , as authority figures, we assume the school system and curriculum is always benevolent, always ‘right’? Can we justify that? Do we even question it very deeply? Because many of the ‘problem’ students probably do, often being bright enough to see and experience the systemic contradictions for themselves. As Chomsky said: 

:“These [hierarchies] all have to be questioned. Sometimes I think you can find that there's a legitimate claim to authority … But the burden of proof is on the authority. So for example, some form of control over children is justified. It's fair to prevent the child from putting his or her hand in the oven, let's say, or from running across the street in traffic. It's even proper to place clear bounds on children … They want to understand where they are in the world. However, all of these things have to be done with sensitivity and with self-awareness and recognition that any authoritarian role that one plays, or that someone else plays, does require justification. It's not self-justifying. (Noam Chomsky, 1994: http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/rab/rab-8.html). 

:So there, I’m taking a critical view and playing the devil’s advocate, throwing the gauntlet down, as there are things said between the lines here that are not at all explicit in the reading itself or in our commentaries on the reading. I’m speaking, of course, about … the hidden curriculum – underlying institutional values and priorities that may be more in the interests of society’s ruling classes than the average student – particularly those from more disadvantaged backgrounds or communities who attend inner city schools in TDSB. Lance got us thinking about some of this, including concerted cultivation and class differences … 
:But I also want to admit that I really like this text – very accessible, and I find the concrete examples of problem situations (i.e. Teacher’s Casebook, and Stop/Think/Write scenarios) very practical, posing challenging and realistic dilemmas for the emerging teacher. - James C


*'''Class Management through Progressive Discipline &amp; Differentiated Teaching'''

:Here's a couple of things I tried with a 'difficult' grade 9 English class. A bit of background first. My AT had told me that this class was her worst in years, and that somehow, prior to my arrival, she had &quot;lost&quot; them, and could not get them back. To this day I'm not exactly sure what she means by that. In her defense, yes, there were 4 or 5 very disruptive students—one of whom, D, she told me to not waste any time on because she was sure he was going to be suspended any day—and, from what I could tell, the class ''was'' lost, although I'm not entirely sure why...but I'll guess: one, my AT was afraid of them, literally scared that  they might physically harm her; two, my AT didn't want to put in the time and effort necessary to try anything more sophisticated than &quot;just getting through it&quot; to quote her.  

:Here's a few things I tried.

:'''Progressive Discipline''' 

:I learned their names in two days (admittedly, this is much harder in a non-semestered school), and did the attendance daily. I greeted as many students by name as I could each day as they entered the classroom. I rearranged the desks in a circle and reassigned seats due to a random draw of numbered slips of paper. When I was not teaching the class, I sat at the front and made eye contact to quell disruptions which worked only some of the time, or, I would circulate to help out when they were doing deskwork. I did not actually do a lesson with this class until the third week of my practicum, however, once I did start, I set out to try a few new things. I roamed the classroom and tried to solicit response from students by calling on them by name. (Yes, the best way to do this is to use the students name at the ''beginning'' of the question.) And, I used physical proximity on occasion when certain groups grew disruptive. All of the above tactics had a positive affect. It never got to the last stage as indicated in the text book, the part about sending the student to the VP. Even if it were my classroom, this would be an absolute last option.

:My problems with this approach were three-fold: 1) My AT was critical of any approach toward discipline as being ''confrontational'', anything outside of learning their names and changing the seating plan that is; 2) I had so little continuity with this class that I never really felt as if they were ''mine'' for long enough establish any degree of intimacy which is, I feel, an important aspect of ''effective'', or ''nuanced'', progressive discipline;3) I was a Student Teacher with no real ''punitive authority'' so I had little to say when the students challenged a request I might make with an &quot;is this being marked?&quot;, or &quot;but what if I don't want to?&quot;   

:One last word on my above comment on ''nuanced progressive discipline''. I did have a chance to do a little of this, and will definitely try this in the future. In fact, it was the one part of my curriculum which came close to something like an authentic teaching voice I would like to develop once in the field. 

:Here's what I did. In the first two weeks my hands were full with the other two classes I was with, so I couldn't really be front and centre with the grade 9's, but, I did ask my AT if I could mark and hand back an early quiz they did. I paid attention to the marks and came away surprised by the good test results with a few of these ''troubled students'', D, in particular who scored a surprising 8 out of 10. As I handed the papers back I made a point of complimenting the disruptive students who scored well. From then on I frequently reminded these students—especially when they'd become exasperated over a deskwork task—that they were smart, that I knew so because I had marked their tests, and that they could do the work in front of them if they put their mind to it. These personalized comments generally motivated them to put their heads down and get to work for a little while at least. I'm confident that, with prolonged contact and repetition I could have got them ''self-motivated'' in a meaningful way. It takes time though.  

:'''Differentiated Teaching'''

:My AT had a pretty ''comfortable'' routine with this class. She sat at the front of the room and asked for volunteers to do class reading in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliette. Day after day she did pretty much the same thing. Yes, there was one field trip, we took the class to see a production of the play at Hart House, which was a good idea. It meant that there was at least some academic frame of reference (a shared experience enjoyed by at least half of the class) the teacher could draw upon with subsequent discussions of the play. 

:When I came in we started to do ''activities'', which she saw as a way of having some fun. For some reason ''fun'' was what she thought the class needed. There was no discipline, no respect, no expectations, and very little learning going on from what I could see, so I was not very optimistic about &quot;fun&quot; as a solution to her many problems with this class. She pulled a few activities off the internet which were fun-ish momentary diversions that offered no real teachable moments and did little to either build confidence or motivate her students...things like Make Your Own Shakspearean Insult, or competitive games of tag and such. 

:The one activity I had some success with was something like a choral reading activity in which I made a script out of two similar speeches from the play intercut with one another. The students were broken into two groups and instructed to perform the script in whatever way they wanted. I suggested that they could assign parts, or read in unison, or repeat key words, or treat it like a song lyric, then gave them 10 minutes to work on it before their presentations. The presentations were not very good, although a few of the afforementioned ''troubled'' students really did rise to the challenge and display skills I had no idea they possessed. One student—a smart-alecky and oafish football player—proved himself to be an excellent director. He asked me for clarification about my &quot;objectives&quot; (his word), then took out a pencil, marked the script up, and assigned parts. Another student, one with a severe &quot;impulse-control&quot; problem, became extremely focused for the performance and did what actors do, stand still, face front, speak clearly, and project. Because I had used a threat to initially motivate them—&quot;Yes, this will be marked&quot;—I had to make good on my promise, sort of. My AT said it was stupid to make such a threat because she had no idea how I would mark such a thing so there was no way she could possibly assign a mark. Further, she thought the exercise was a complete failure, so why dwell on bad news. Not much ''fun'' in that is there? So I struck a compromise. I asked if I might be able to simply site a few cases of exemplary effort. I did that. I complimented both of these bad boys, and mentioned 3 specific points of ''on-task'' behavior for each student in front of the class, and that was it. It had an immediate effect on their mood and focus for the rest of the class which, unfortunately marked the last day of my practicum.

:Classroom management, like management of all types, involves the development of rountines, policies, and organization.  We have all been in a management position at one point in time.  Whether it was managing ourselves, or managing our kids, we all have the potential to create an environment where our students, employees, kids, or ourselves can stay focused and achieve goals.  In the case of classroom management it is important to understand that we are in a controlled environment, and therefore have to make up our own rules.  These rules should be consistent with our expectations of how we think our students should act.  It is therefore imperative that the &quot;rules&quot; of the classroom are well known and clear.

:The dynamic of the classroom is very similar to that of an environment in the workforce.  The first few days at a new job consist of learning the policies, rules, and consequences of failing to follow the two, that are unique to that job.  The students need the same immediate guidance so they understand what is expected of them.  As time goes on it is imperative that these rules and regulations are consistently followed so they don't become laughable.  A habit will build in the students if they recieve positive or negative feedback in relation to the rules.

:The difference to the workforce becomes apparent when classroom management breaks down.  A student can not be &quot;fired&quot; like an emplyee can and it shouldn't be a teachers goal to give up on them.  It is in these cases that classroom management becomes difficult.  As a teacher and a leader , we have to understand and believe that their is a solution to almost all of these situations.  However, in any extreme case it is the external resources that will benefit us the most.  Pin point the problem that is evident in a particular situation of classroom management and search for a solution.  A great manager is not only a guide but also the path that the guided walk on.

:In my experience, I’ve found there are many different forms of effective classroom management, and these vary from teacher to teacher. I’ve met teachers who see any peep from a student as an unforgivable act of defiance, and seen teachers who don’t bat an eyelid at seeing students talk openly while the they're lecturing, as long as the students aren’t being “openly disruptive.” I think that part of the first year or three of being a full-time teacher is spent finding out our comfort zone for management. After we’ve found this comfort zone (through a lot of trial and error of course), then we can start to determine how to properly create a classroom structure that enforces our ideas about a classroom, and try different techniques to reach our desired goals for classroom management. 

:My AT had an interesting story about finding his footing in classroom management. In his first few years as a teacher, he tried to be as “nice” as possible, because that was what he thought a teacher should be. He would never raise his voice, he would allow extensions for material well past the due date, and generally behave doormat-ishly. After a few years, he was completely exhausted and frustrated. He then realized that he was being inauthentic in the classroom, and the students could sense this, and when he made the decision to be more authentic in his teacher personality, and allow himself to act like a normal human being instead of a “teacher,” he could then focus more energy on creating an atmosphere of genuine inclusivity and teamwork in the classroom. 

:Of course, throughout our careers, we’ll be learning different classroom management techniques, and learning more and more about what we feel constitutes good classroom management. But the important thing, in my opinion, is to always be “checking in” with yourself. Know where you’re coming from, and allow yourself to be constantly modifying your procedures and rules as the years go on. Of course, it would probably be wise to modify them on some sort of schedule – maybe a yearly or bi-yearly “control review” would be a good way to check in with where you are currently on classroom management policies.

*During my Practicum I was responsible for a fully integrated class, which was comprised of wonderful group of students possessing diverse inherited characteristics, differing levels of ability, and facing unique individual challenges.  

:One such student, &quot;X”, had been going through rough times.  X had a violent temper, and earlier in the year had been briefly institutionalized.  X was still undergoing psychiatric assessment, and had difficulties behaving and maintaining focus in many classes.
	
:To this point, I hadn’t had any run-ins with X. This was in part because of my anticipatory approach to classroom management, having well-laid guidelines and addressing escalating issues before they occur.  I also pride myself in being a calm and even-tempered individual, with a kind and gentle demeanor.  I was always able to direct the class without raising my voice; no doubt this helped me to “win them over”.  I made regular use of a “Tibetan Singing Bowl” to capture their interest and attention, and signal transitions between tasks.  This tool worked remarkably well in quieting down the class.  

:One day, X had an altercation with another student.  I saw X being escorted to the office as I headed to my next class.  I asked X what had happened; X responded “That (expletive) was bad-mouthin’ my friends, so I got in their face!”  
	
:My teacher associate was not able to come to school that day, and so a substitute teacher was provided for my fourth period class.  I informed the substitute in advance that my third period class was on the opposite side of the school, and I had to rush to get to class. The substitute teacher volunteered to take attendance.  
	
:X got to class moments before I did.  X made a grand entrance, swearing up a storm, expressing frustration with the school staff and the student whom they had fought.  The substitute took exception to X’s behavior; X became mouthy with the teacher as well.  

:When I arrived in class, I had to diffuse the situation.  I asked X if he/she wanted to talk to me in private; X did not.  Rather, X immediately began to launch on a tirade.  I allowed X to voice their frustration, and that diffused much of their anger.  I acknowledged that I could sense X's frustration, and that I would let X sit out some of the day’s activities, if it made them feel better.  I was very calm and reassuring, and X quieted down.

:I pointed out that it was inappropriate to have challenged the supply teacher, and I asked X to apologize to him.  X refused.  I told X that I recognized they had been having a really rough day, and that I empathized.  However, if their challenging behavior continued, I would have to send them down to the office.  X relented, and said that they would apologize to the teacher, but “didn’t really mean it.”  X also expressed a desire to “get on with the class”.  I persisted, and suggested that when they made a proper apology to the teacher, we could get on with things.  X apologized, and we moved on.  The class progressed smoothly, and the students seemed to approve of the way I had handled the situation.  Because of this, I must admit, I felt more assured and confident in my role as teacher.  

:My class wanted to have a party for me on my last day, both as a going away present and to celebrate my birthday.  The children indicated that they would miss me, that they thought that I would make a great teacher, and that they wished I would return to their school.  X was surprised to discover this was my last day, and  wrote a note for me: “Happy Birthday.  Sorry for all the troubles.  Hope you had an amazing day!”  

:I think that the approach I took with X was the correct one.  I did not allow their behavior to get me upset, and I realized that it was motivated by factors outside of the classroom.  Ultimately, X seemed to recognize my patient, persistent, and gentle demeanor as benevolent and genuine.

== Managing an Arts Classroom - Whole New Ballgame ==
:I had it so easy during my first (English) practicum.  These Grade 10s already respected my AT, for the most part, and all I had to do was pick up where she left off.  My teaching style was just different enough from hers for the students to buy in easily, even if it was just out of curiosity to see where this student teacher was going.  I think I also came across as more hip and generally pop-culture savvy, which seemed to score a lot of points with my classes.  The class' attitude was so predominantly positive that the few disruptive kids were easily handled without ever having to stray too far from the lesson.  I though I was some kind of classroom management genius.

:Then came my second (Drama) practicum.  I'm not sure if the Music and Visual Arts teachers experienced the same thing, but running my Arts classroom was something else entirely.  Order had to be created and maintained without the literally structural support of academic classroom architecture.  Most of my smooth management techniques from first semester were now useless.  My biggest challenge turned out to be what the textbook calls &quot;movement management&quot; (p. 423).  With the Grade 10 classes doing either solo or group work towards performance presentations, keeping lessons and the in-class work moving smoothly required vigilance unlike anything I had to do in my English class.  I was amazed at my AT's high level of withitness and frustrated at my lack of it.  It took me until the end of my third week to start picking up on the signals flying around the room while I worked with one individual or group.  Eventually, I found withitness matched with overlapping.  Keeping all thirty students in their five groups busy meant I had to be aware of what everyone was up to in every corner.

:As at least of couple of others have mentioned in this section, this took time and the first week and a half felt like pulling teeth.  However, once I stopped rushing into delivering information, activities actually started flowing more quickly.  My AT pointed out that I was starting to give instructions for activities or assignments before I had the whole class' attention.  Clouds parted, angels sang, and I experienced what &quot;epiphany&quot; means.  The next day, I started establishing a routine of not beginning any new thing until the whole class was quiet.  This often resulted in the more motivated students shushing the less motivated ones so that we could move forward.  This made my life easier because the students were starting to police their own behaviour.  Although at first it felt as though this strategy took more time than before, I realized I was actually saving time through not having to repeat myself multiple times to those who hadn't heard me when I spoke over top of their conversation.  Not rushing into the lesson is now part of my bag of tricks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;u&gt;'''Motivation'''&lt;/u&gt; ==



=== &lt;u&gt;What is Motivation? &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 359-361) ===
''&lt;big&gt;Define Motivation. &lt;/big&gt;''   
    
'''Motivation''': An internal state that '''arouses''', '''directs''', '''maintains''' behaviour.   
    
''&lt;big&gt;Traits or State?&lt;/big&gt;''   
   
* Motivation can be the result of personal ''traits'' (ex: an inherent desire to achieve);   
* A ''state'' that is the result of a temporary situation (ex: a test);   
* The motivation we experience at any given time is a combination of both ''trait'' and ''state''.   
   
''&lt;big&gt;What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation?&lt;/big&gt;''   
   
* ''Intrinsic motivation'' is associated with activities that are rewarding in itself. This motivation stems from internal factors such as needs, interests, curiosity, or enjoyment.   
*''Extrinsic Motivation'' is created by external factors such as rewards, social pressure, or punishment. We are not compelled to complete such an activity for its own sake.    
   
''&lt;big&gt;What type of motivation should teachers encourage?&lt;/big&gt;''   
   
* In school, both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are useful. Teaching can encourage students' intrinsic motivation by stimulating their curiosity and making them feel more    
competent as they learn. Encouraging intrinsic motivators also fosters the development of critical thinking skills and a passion for life-long learning. However, in some situations, incentives and external supports are necessary.    
   
''&lt;big&gt;How does locus of causality apply to motivation?&lt;/big&gt;''   
* Offers an explanation or reason for acting/ behaving a certain way;   
* It is the cause for motivation that can be either internal (intrinsic) or external (extrinsic).

=== &lt;u&gt;Four General Approaches to Motivation &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 361-366) ===
&lt;big&gt;1) Behavioural 
2) Humanistic   
3) Cognitive   
4) Sociocultural&lt;/big&gt; 

'''1) BEHAVIOURAL APPROACH:'''   
* Relies soley on '''extrinsic''' motivation;   
* Rewards are objects or events that we think are attractive and act as consequences of certain behaviours;   
* Incentives are objects or events that encourage or discourage behaviour. 


'''2) HUMANISTIC APPROACH:'''   
* Relies on '''intrinsic''' motivation   
* also referred to as, third-force psychology because it was conceived in the 1940's in reaction to behaviourism &amp; psychoanalysis theory;   
* Assumes that people are continually motivated by inherent needs to fulfill their potential for &quot;self-actualization&quot;;   
* Emphasis on personal choice, needs, and self-determination;   
* Maslow's hierarchy: seven levels of human needs, from basic physiological requirements to the need for self-actualization 

'''3) COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE:'''   
* Focus is on thinking;   
* Emphasizes intrinsic motivation;   
* People are active and curious;   
* Behaviour is dependent on: plans, goals, schemas, and expectations. 

'''4) SOCIOCULTURAL APPROACH:'''
* Emphasizes participation in communities of practice;   
* Motivation derives from discovering one's identity within a community of people;   
* Legitimate peripheral participation - immersion in group work, despite one's under developed abilities and small contributions; 

'''MASLOW'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS:'''
'''DEFICIENCY NEEDS: (LOWER ORDER NEEDS)'''  - * must be satisfied first;   
'''Pre-requisite:'''   
* Survival   
* Safety   
* Belonging &amp; Love   
* Esteem   
With deficiency needs ''motivation '''decreases''' as needs are met.''   
    
'''BEING NEEDS: (GROWTH- HIGHER ORDER NEEDS)'''  
* Endlessly renewed   
'''Whole person:'''   
* Intellect/achievement   
* Aesthetics   
* Self-actualization   
With being needs ''motivation '''increases''' as needs are met.''

'''Note:''' theorists after Maslow have, while accepting his taxonomy of needs, recognized that such needs do not necessarily unfold or progress in as hierarchical, linear a fashion as Maslow seemed to indicate. For instance, different needs may be pursued simultaneously , and a 'higher order' need could be pursued and satisfied before a lower order need (page 362).



*So, how does hierarchy affect motivation?  According to the text, as it refers to Maslow's needs, if we as teachers foster community and collectivism in our classrooms the lower order needs will be addressed and the student can focus more on attaining the higher order needs.  That is great!    I am sure there are many creative ways to create community in the classroom, one example is group work were the groups are made up of students who have various skills.  I think that creating community it is just something to always be cognizant of in teaching-an organic process.  It is nice to image a perfect world on the inside of my imaginary classroom.  However, hierarchy makes me think of situations outside of striving for self-actualization.  I think that creating a community is great BUT need to first consider, what is the POWER hierarchy in any given classroom or school, and how does that affect motivation and the classroom atmosphere?  Maybe the challenge here is to re-evaluate the roles that we are all too familiar with, i.e.; the authoritarian teacher figure, the class clown, the rebel...and somehow create an &quot;equal playing field&quot;.  Even with the whole hierarchy of needs thing, some students are more ready than others to move onto knowing and understanding.

*The thing that worries me as an educator about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is being able to fulfill all of the higher order needs of the students. As a teacher one can create a safe community within their classroom but if a students' higher needs are not being met in other classrooms or at home with their family and friends, how can a teacher help motivate that student. Teacher have no control over what goes on in a students' personal life and family and friends play a huge role in students' lives. My fear is that even if a teacher can create a good learning environment in the classroom that it won't matter to the student who is not having their higher needs met in their personal life outside of the classroom. Can 75-minutes a day be enough to help motivate that student? Will the student still not show any motivation in the class or will the student only be motivated in that particular classroom and nowhere else?

It is very easy as an educator in our current educational climate to become very cynical, bitter, or even burned-out. We are highly conscious and aware of the many social issues that plague children in our classrooms today, and the emotional and psychological ramifications that manifest in work ethic and classroom behaviour.  

Upon closer inspection, I see a truly holistic quality within Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It would be foolish to imagine that any one teacher could facilitate meeting all the needs of any one student. Within our own means and experiences, we do our best daily as educators to inspire, nurture, and support our students through the creation of community and collectivism. However (as was pointed out above), there are many contributing factors to a student’s life outside of the 75-minute period.

I think then that ''Holistic'' approaches to education are therefore one of the most powerful tools in shaping young minds. It is a profound awareness of self that best allows an individual to become “renewed, whole, explore intellect, and achieve self-actualization”.  This awareness of self will further help a student to connect with factors such as attention and personal motivation.

An educator has the potential ability to provide students with the tools to be self-aware (i.e. motivation, visualization, journaling), and I believe the qualities acquired from self-awareness will follow through in any aspect of an individual’s life including professional, educational, and personal aspects. - Christopher Wilson

:To expand upon the point made above, although Maslow's theory may not be airtight, since it does require humans to act and respond in the same manner every time, the link between it and holistic educational perspectives is clear and worthy of support.  Three of the four deficiency needs are met when a school and/or classroom promotes a positive atmosphere.  A school's administration sets rules to keep everyone on that property '''safe'''.  Promotion of school spirit and even classroom community ideally gives the student a '''sense of belonging'''.  A classroom environment where all points of view are respected and deemed worthy of being heard helps a student to develop '''esteem'''.  To a lesser degree, I suppose schools can also meet the need for '''survival''' through practices such as staff members staying alert for signs of neglect or abuse and informing the authorities in such cases but I do not feel this need is as strongly fulfilled, nor should it be, by public schools.  Independent boarding schools are, obviously, an exception.  But already, just through running a school in a professional manner and teaching with compassion, Maslow's deficiency needs are met.

:The being needs are where holism really becomes advantageous to students.  With emphasis placed on learning through discussion and through questioning, students are encouraged to continue following a path of inquiry until they fully grasp it.  Need for '''knowing and understanding''' satisfied.  '''Self-actualization''', Maslow's term for &quot;realizing personal potential&quot; (p. 362) is what holistic education is all about; helping the student to grow in the cognitive sense, the emotional sense, and the spiritual sense.  My limited observations as a teacher candidate have led me to believe that a student, in fact any person, is not capable of completely fulfilling their potential if their growth in one of those three areas is stunted to too great a degree.  Holistic education works to foster growth in all areas, enabling the students to self-actualize.  I admit, there is not much a teacher or a school can do to satisfy the need for '''aesthetic appreciation'''.  However, as with the need for survival, I would dispute whether it is the teacher or school's responsibility to satisfy that particular need.

:For more information about holistic educational perspectives, I would encourage you to visit [http://www.pathsoflearning.net].  Ron Miller and his colleagues elaborate on this approach to education in a clear and precise manner.

=== &lt;u&gt;Goal Orientation and Motivation &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 366-370) ===
''&lt;big&gt;What kinds of goals are the most motivating? &lt;/big&gt;''   
 
'''Effective Goals Are:'''   
* Specific   
* Challenging   
* Attainable   
* Focused on the task   
* Supported by social relationships   
* Reinforced with feedback   
* Accepted by the student   
   
   
''&lt;big&gt;Describe mastery, performance, work-avoidant and social goals. &lt;/big&gt;''   
   
'''Mastery goal:''' A personal intention to improve abilities and understand, no matter how performance suffers. (Relates to &quot;task-involved learners&quot;: Students who focus on mastering the task or solving the problem).   
   
'''Performance goal:''' A personal intention to seem competent or perform well in the eyes of others. (Relates to “ego-involved learners”: Students who focus on how well they are performing and how they are judged by others).   
   
'''Work-avoidant learners:''' These are students who want to avoid work. They try and complete assignments/activities as quick as possible and with little effort. Rather then be concerned with looking smart in front of peers and teachers, these students feel successful when the work is easy, or when they can &quot;goof off&quot; (Woolfolk et al., 368)   
   
'''Social goals:''' A wide variety of needs and motives to be connected to others or to be part of a group. As students move into adolescence, non-academic activities such as athletics, dating, etc., compete with school work and can hinder learning. An example can be seen if a student's goal in the classroom is to maintain friendly relations in a cooperative learning group. If the friends are afraid to challenge the student's wrong answers and misconceptions for fear of hurting their feelings, then this can interfere with learning. Another example relates to &quot;fitting in&quot;. Rather then being labeled a &quot;geek&quot;, students would rather go out and have fun with peers and classmates. This however, can get in the way of learning.    
 

'''Rewards to Motivation: Negatives and Positives'''
 
*In the Chapter on Motivation it really caught my attention when the author was talking about rewards as tool to motivate students.  What caught my attention was the fact that I have been reason a fair bit on the positives and negatives of using a reward system when trying to motivate students.  The article which I was really interested in was called &quot;Beyond 'wonderful': Authentic Interaction in the Art Classroom&quot; by Masayuki Hachiya.  She wrote this paper as her doctoral thesis at OSIE

:In this paper, the author brings attention to the idea that there are negative aspect of rewards and positive aspects.  She first examines the positive.  An example of a positive reward would be the praise of the teacher. In term of a positive outlook on rewards teachers and academics believe it provides positive feel back to students who learn a skill properly, are behaving properly or obtaining and showing they understand new knowledge.  Rewards as a positive motivational tool, the author continues, provides a way in which the teacher of the class would be able to encourage classroom management.  With rewards, classroom management would be maintaining because it reaffirms the authority of the teacher.   A teacher would praise a student when the student shows the appropriate behavior or does something properly when developing a new skill.

:On the other side of the spectrum, some critics of rewards believe that they are not always positive.  In the paper, the author introduces another critic of motivation Kohn Albeit.  According to Albeit, when you motivate a child by using rewards as a way to encourage them to do a project in comparison with a child who is given the same assignment he has noticed that the child who was not motivated with an award does better work.  Overall, he believes that the reward system is an ineffective way to encourage students to do work. As a result, he argues, students who are given rewards are not as ambitions to learn because they feel like their work is not good enough to get the reward.

*On pg. 368 of the text book the authors describe what they call performance goals. By their definition a performance goal is a personal intention to seem competent or perform well in the eyes of others. The authors write that performance goals cause students to only care about outdoing other students, rather than what they are learning.  

:This concept made me think about the use of competition in the classroom as a way to motivate students to learn. In my practicum I had to teach a unit on drama vocabulary; in the past it consisted of giving students a booklet full of terms and definitions and reading through it with them. I decided to create a drama vocabulary activity challenge. The students were divided into teams and over three days competed in different activities. The challenge was highly competitive, with points given out after each activity and in the end a prize was rewarded to all students. This unit was a huge success. The students absolutely loved it! They were engaged the entire time and at the very end of the unit they were given a test on the material and they were all highly successful!

:So in my experience competition was a very useful tool to motivate students.  Although the whole challenge was about beating their classmates, the students learned the material through the activities. The authors seem to portray performance goals as the worst method of motivation, but I found it very effective. 

:'''''What are other people’s views on the use of competition as a form of motivation?'''''
:--[[User:JollyJamie|JollyJamie]] ([[User talk:JollyJamie|talk]]) 15:39, 20 January 2008 (UTC)

*Jamie, like you I found the part about '''performance goals''' a little peculiar, especially as it relates to ''performance oriented studies in the arts'' like Drama, or Music, or Dance, or maybe even something like Public Speaking. Most of the accomplished professional artists I've had the pleasure/pain to work and/or associate with are highly competitive and extremely self-centred people. Many of these people are award-winning and highly public figures who create socially-progressive work and regularly appear in the media espousing noble ideals about equity and social justice. Many also do great work along these lines...''really'', effective, sincere, and life-changing work. Go figger. Maybe one has to ultimately separate the art from the artist...but how do you do this as a teacher teaching Arts students who are not yet artists, who have no real body of work to speak of? ''Showing off'' is what artists do, and having a ''killer instinct'' is absolutely essential to having any kind of career in the arts. 

:Granted, not many of our students will actually become career artists, but I don't know how one avoids fostering strong ''performance goals'' through competition while teaching a performance-oriented arts course, especially to students in the higher grades who are considering post-secondary Arts education. To do otherwise is to do a disservice to the student.

:I have no teaching experience to relate on the subject, though I can offer a student's perspective on '''the downside of competition''' for marginalized students. By the age of 13 'd lived in 13 different neighborhoods and had not had the chance to spend an entire academic year in any one school. I was ''the new kid'' in every school I'd been in up until grade 7. Competitive activities killed me because I could not compete...I could barely understand the rules, let alone devise strategies for success. Further to this, my parents were low-achieving and uneducated couch-potatoes who despised virtuosity of any stripe because it made them insecure. There was no room for competitive anxiety at my kitchen table. I'm not kidding here. Also, I'm sure that my situation is not unique. 

:As I read the description of your Drama Vocabulary exercise I could understand fully how it could work and be very effective. After I read it I tried to imagine myself as one of your students in that situation. I'd want to be on the winning team.

*I used competition to an awesome end on my practicum. I created an interval face-off game in my instrumental band music classes, where I would place to opposing chairs at the front of the room, sit myself in between them, and then draw two names out of a hat. Those two people would then come up to the front, and face each other in an interval challenge: I would have another student (or my associate) play an interval on the keyboard, and then the first to identify it correctly would win. Both contestants were only allowed one answer, so if one answered incorrectly, the other often got it because she was allowed to sit and think about it. A maximum of three guesses each was allowed until both were eliminated.

:After having done it twice, I was able to identify some pros and cons about the activity. The advantage was that, due to the nature of competition, nearly everyone in the whole class was completely engaged, right through to the end--even despite the fact that some had been 'eliminated' and were not actively playing anymore; those individuals seemed to chat a bit in between rounds, but the competitive tension in the air as the contestants grew fewer tended to grab their attention, since they had various allegiances within the class, and also because they wanted to know the intervals themselves so that they could officiate my decisions. So even the eliminated participants were engaged, still listening intently to the intervals.

:The disadvantage was that there were a few who didn't engage because they considered themselves to be of too poor ability to compete. Their expressions were resigned, and they were somewhat loathe to be summoned up to the front, to demonstrate their 'incompetence'. However, since humans are always prone to error, there were many occasions where demonstrably superior guessers were beaten by their opponents, which provoked the class to more enthusiasm and engagement. 

:I think overall it was an awesome way to motivate the classes. Throughout the rest of the whole practicum, they asked me to play that game over and over, every day!

*I think the notion of friendly competition can spur students into trying harder. For teenagers the worst thing in the world is to look bad in front of a group of people and often this can be the only thing that motivates them to try. I think that in Jamie's case, even though students were competing against each other during the task, they were all rewarded for their effort instead of only singling out the &quot;winners&quot; of the task. As long as the students who did poorly aren't made to feel as if they don't measure up then a bit of competition can be healthy. The key is providing a reason, besides looking good in front of their peers, for students to want to do well. As long as the intrinsic motivation is worked into the task then the extrinsic motivation of the competition could be entirely positive.

:'''Does anyone have any ideas about how to work intrinsic motivation into a competition task?'''
:--[[User:Liz P|Liz P]] ([[User talk:Liz P|talk]]) 02:57, 21 January 2008 (UTC)


*'''Meaning and Motivation'''

:Hmmm. Working intrinsic motivation into a competitive task ...? Well, first thought is that if you were able to 'push a button' to activate a student's intrinsic motivation, it would no longer be intrinsic but extrinsic. A second thought is that hair-splitting aside, intrinsic motivation being internal is hidden and not known to us unless a student discloses it candidly (or maybe an experienced teacher can spot it after knowing a student for some length of time). The closest I can imagine to a student being intrinsically motivated in a competitive task is if they were somewhat of a perfectionist, and actually saw the task as competing with ''themselves'' to better their performance. 

:There are certainly no shortage of theories in this chapter. Interestingly, the various views of motivation are not presented as mutually exclusive, and may be complimentary. There is also a contradiction I find intriguing. Namely, that  a) identity making among students depends on conventional integration into community structures and values, and also that  b) students forming their identities may reject conventional social goals and values. 
:For instance, the text alternately notes that: 

:''“… motivation arises from identity and identity develops through legitimate participation [as] students can progress from positions of legitimate peripheral participation to become full participants in the community” (366)''

:And that: 

:''“Sometimes social and academic goals are incompatible. For example, academic failure may be interpreted positively by some minority-group students because non-compliance with the majority culture’s norms and standards is seen as an accomplishment. Thus it would be impossible to simultaneously succeed in both school and the peer group (369).”''

:This begs several questions about teachers' methods, goals and values, and about our own professional identities: 

::* In what ways might we conceive that social and academic goals could be incompatible?
::* How (and for whom) might maintaining a peripheral identity be seen as an accomplishment? 
::* Do peer groups - even gangs - sometimes provide something valuable or meaningful that schools generally do not?
::* How well do curriculum and academic goals honour students' issues of personal meaning and purpose? 
::* How do factors such as inherited wealth, cultural capital, patronage or talent shape how we as 'public servants' approach student differences, and how we teach?
::* In terms of motivation and meaning, are students receiving contradictory messages in domestic and public domains? For instance, at home, receiving familial values such as cooperation, compassion, mutual responsibility, respect for elders, and concern for juniors. While at school &amp; work, receiving commercial values promoting rational, non-emotional, calculable choices, punctuality and obedience, limitless expansion of production and wealth, ambition &amp; competition, pragmatism, opportunism, multitasking, and avoidance of moral questions. 
::* How do we reconcile institutions and curriculum that presume equality of opportunity, equality of preparation, and equality of social standing with the social realities of class tensions and the differential distribution of status and power between peers and social groups? 

:In this light, it's worth considering the paragraph from page 369: 

:''“Generally, students are more willing to adopt goals that others set when the goals seem realistic, reasonably difficult, and meaningful … and if good reasons are given about the value of the goals.”''

:I am thinking about this statement in relation to the kind of apathy which many of us have seen in the schools during first practicum. So ... 

::* Who determines what learning and goals are valuable and meaningful for students? 
::* How (and why) do we convince students about the meaning and value of institutionalized goals and civic participation, if they are well aware of embedded power differences, and social injustices stemming from race, class, gender, education, ethnicity, labeling, etc., not to mention the (frequently enough) unethical nature of public institutions like government, and commercial monopolies?

*Ya! The paragraph from p.369 about feedback and goal acceptance, I think is one of the most valuable pieces of info in this chapter!  
On Goal Acceptance, I programed and facilitated a therapeutic recreation program for seniors with special needs at the YWCA.  One session I thought it would be good to teach them about nutrition, 5 food groups- yada- yada, I made a game up and everything!  Well one of my participants starts yelling &quot;I'm not doing this, this is boring, you can’t make me…&quot; Can you imagine what kind of effect this would have on the motivation of the other group participants?  Lucky for me I recognized that this was not meaningful for my participants and, even though I still wanted to try to motivate them to eat their veggies, I enthusiastically told Nancy that she was right and asked her what her favorite junk food was.  After talking about junk food around the group, including myself, we somehow managed to play my healthy choices game- and it was good.

*I think to understand the difficulty in motivating students you have to look at why we have to motivate someone.  Motivation is the carrot we put in front of someone to get them to do something they would otherwise not do.  Although it would be nice to say that people do things for intrinsic reasons, the truth is that people do things that in some way or another give them benefit.  

:Take something as selfless as giving blood.  We give blood to help people that might need it in the future.  What could possibly be the motivation for this?  Even without monitary benefits of some kind, most people would benefit from the feeling of satisfaction they got from helping others.  It also demonstrates why people put voluntary work on their resumes.  I don't want to be pessimistic, but I can't think of a activity that people do that doesn't result in them getting something out of it.

:So how does this apply to students?  Well it seems to me that what we need to do as teachers is express to our students why they go to school, and how they are going to benefit.  The students that are academically stable have already done this for themselves, because they realize that school will lead to better things for them. It is the students that are at risk that don't understand how they will benefit from education.

:The problem with the at risk students is that they are probably more apt to need immediate gratification for them to be motivated.  That is where feedback will be extremely useful.  These students need positive feedback all the time so they constantly feel good about what they are doing. It isn't a simple issue though.  I'm even going to say it is an issue that I don't have a clue how to combat.  I was at a school for at risk kids during my practicum and that was one of my greatest struggles and reason for frustration.  The students didn't see how they were going to benefit from an education so they had little reason to make an effort to succeed let alone show up to class.

:So how do we motivate those who don't motivate themselves?  I don't know.  Look at me; I could barely motivate myself to write on wikibooks because I don't see how I'm benefitting from it.  Then I realized that it's a significant part of my mark for this class and will ultimately dictate how my transcript looks after I'm finished my B.Ed, so that is why you are reading the words that are in front of you. It was a means to and end.  Perhaps if we know the students end or goal is we can motivate them to work towards that goal.  I do believe everyone has a goal.

*The question of how to motivate our students becomes much more complex at the high school level.  Students are not generally motivated by a desire to please or be praised by the teacher, and we can't hold pizza lunches for the students who consistently complete their homework anymore.  If students are not motivated by their own desire to succeed or marks, it can be tempting for high school teachers to feel like there is nothing they can do about it.  I think the only answer is to ensure that our students see a purpose in what they are doing and feel that their learning is meaningful.  This ties in to what Hassan mentioned about students at-risk.  

:During my practicum, I taught a unit on writing and reading newspaper articles for a grade 12 literacy class.  One day, as I was passing around handouts a student asked me that terrifying question: “Why do we have to do this?”  You might expect that this student was being rebellious, but his question was actually quite sincere and I think, legitimate.  This was his last credit to graduate, which he only needed because he had failed the grade 10 literacy exam.  He already worked full-time in construction and was very satisfied with his job, but felt it was important to him to have a high school diploma.  All he wanted was an assignment that he saw as practical to his life. 

:I explained that the assignment would give him an opportunity to develop his writing skills and that communication skills are very important, especially if one day he wanted to run his own construction business.  I added that learning to express an opinion allows us to be active citizens.  He seemed to appreciate the effort I put into my response, but I don’t think he bought it.  In the back of my mind, I couldn’t help but agree with him.  I think this is where getting to know your students and the idea of backward design really come into play.  As educators, we need to figure out the needs of our students, and devise the enduring understandings we want our students to leave with accordingly.  Then we can use this as the basis for lessons that our students are actually interested in.

&lt;big&gt;'''EXPECTANCY X VALUE THEORY'''&lt;/big&gt;   
    
The Expectancy X Value Theory combines cognitive with behavioral approaches (see below).  + *I think to understand the difficulty in motivating students you have to look at why we have to motivate someone. Motivation is the carrot we put in front of someone to get them to do something they would otherwise not do. Although it would be nice to say that people do things for intrinsic reasons, the truth is that people do things that in some way or another give them benefit.  

    
&lt;big&gt;'''Side Bar: Fixed Mind Set vs. Growth Mind Set&lt;/big&gt;'''  + :Take something as selfless as giving blood. We give blood to help people that might need it in the future. What could possibly be the motivation for this? Even without monitary benefits of some kind, most people would benefit from the feeling of satisfaction they got from helping others. It also demonstrates why people put voluntary work on their resumes. I don't want to be pessimistic, but I can't think of a activity that people do that doesn't result in them getting something out of it.  
In a study of 100 seventh graders, all doing poorly in math, psychologists randomly divided the group into two workshops.    
The first workshop was given lessons on how to study well. The other taught about the nature of intelligence and the brain.   
Students in the latter group &quot;learned that the brain actually forms new connections every time you learn something new, and   
that over time, this makes you smarter.” By the end of the semester, the group who had been taught that the brain can grow   
smarter had significantly better math grades than the other group. (...Referencing for this study and this quotation are   
coming. I am contacting the speaker of a workshop who quoted it...)   
''Teacher Tip: Carol Dweck’s &lt;u&gt;Mindsets&lt;/u&gt; has a great chapter to use in you classroom describing these functions of the brain.''[http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/Mindset-New-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck 


*I agree with the Expectancy x Value Theories that motivation stems from the individual’s expectation of reaching a goal and the value of that goal (p.365). As the textbook mentioned, at the high school level students’ social goals are in constant competition with their schoolwork (p.368). Most of the time students do schoolwork as a result of the extrinsic motivational factors forced upon them. School is seen as an obstruction to life for many students. I believe this is because many subjects fail to establish how the material relates to every day life. Students are unable to identify how the subject material is pertinent to them; therefore it has no value for them. 

:Assigned coursework helps develop and hone essential skills that are required for students to succeed later on in life. However, the correlation between the work and their lives is never clearly exposed. How many times have students been told, “It will help you later on”. Yes it is true that it will help them later on if life but WHY/HOW! Why not explicitly articulate what skill the activity will develop when introducing a topic or an assignment?

:Also, it is important to give students leeway/choices in their assignments so that they can pursue topics that interest them while developing life long skills. In a math class a student could research data on a topic that appeals to them and develop graphs based on their findings. Students could also search through photographs at home and answer geometrical questions based on their photographs. Science students could study the combination of elements in soap and create their own soap–everyone uses soap. In english, history, geography, sociology, anthropology, and the arts the possibilities are limitless. Students want to progress; however, at times the cost of pursuing it is to high.

*I'm curious to find out if anyone agrees/disagrees with my understanding of the different types of learners described in the book, specifically those supposedly dreaded ego-involved learners.  Wouldn't everyone in some way be considered an ego-involved learner in some respect, simply because self-actualization, getting good grades, receiving appreciation, and whatever kind of goal/reward associated with motivation is already tied to the ego right from the start?  Cheating from tests, for example, could be motivated by something else outside of personal satisfaction/selfishness (i.e. maybe the student is worried he/she might get in trouble with his/her parents if he/she fails a test, maybe the student is ill/did not study hard enough but needs the grade to pass the course, etc.).  And characteristics such as &quot;seeks attention for good performance&quot;, &quot;works hard on only graded assignments&quot; , and &quot;chooses tasks most likely to result in positive evaluations&quot; sounds a lot like the entire Secondary School student body to me.  Does that mean I should anticipate getting entirely ego-driven learners in school who won't lift a finger/make an effort if it doesn't benefit them first?  I surely hope not.

'''Feedback and Goal Acceptance make goal setting effective.''' 

Feedback: to achieve a goal, students must have an understanding of where they are and how to get where they want to be. When feedback tells the student that their effort falls short of the goal and tells them how to improve, the student can exert more effort and has a better understanding of what to do. When feedback describes accomplishment in relation to goals, the student can feel satisfied and competent, which in turn, would boost their self-confidence.  + :--[[User:Irenedongas|Irenedongas]] ([[User talk:Irenedongas|talk]]) 20:32, 23 January 2008 (UTC)  
* Goal Acceptance: students can only achieve goals that they willingly accept; generally, students are more willing to adopt goals that seem realistic, reasonably difficult, and meaningful to them.

=== &lt;u&gt;Interests and Emotions &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 370-375) ===
''&lt;big&gt;Do interests and emotions affect learning? &lt;/big&gt;'' 

Researchers say that emotion (hot cognition) can contribute to learning and the processing of information (Woolfolk et al., 370). Students are more likely to be engaged, to learn, and remember material that provokes appropriate emotional responses or that relates to their personal interests. It is important to balance the inclusion of &quot;seductive details&quot; (interesting bits of information that are not central to learning) into lessons/activities becaues this can hinder learning. 

'''Two kinds of interests:'''  

*'''Personal interests:''' These are enduring/lasting aspects of the person, such as an interest in astronomy, music, or ancient history. These interests will continue.  

*'''Situational interests:''' These are more short-lived aspects of the activity, text, or materials that catch and keep the students attention.  

''&lt;big&gt;What is the role of arousal in learning? &lt;/big&gt;'' 

* Related to curiosity, which motivates a person to pursue information they lack and are deprived of   
* We can thus increase arousal by stimulating curiosity   
* One way to do this is through using a variety of approaches: &quot;individuals are naturally motivated to seek novelty, surprise and complexity.&quot;   
* Note that arousal can be too high for optimum learning. Severe anxiety is an example of arousal that is too high for optimal learning.   
* Generally, higher arousal is helpful on simple tasks and less arousal is better for complex tasks. 

''&lt;big&gt;How does anxiety interfere with learning? &lt;/big&gt;''  

Anxiety has been described as feelings of uneasiness, self-doubt and tension (Woolfolk, Winne and Perry, 373). This feeling can hinder a student's ability to learn in school at three levels: focusing attention, learning, and demonstrating learning on assessment (Woolfolk et al., 374). In order for students to learn new material, they must pay attention. The dilemma that students experiencing anxiety face is that their attention is split between the new material and their internal worries. The majority of their attention is given to thoughts about failure, being criticized and feelings of embarrassment (Woolfolk et al., 374). For instance, during my practice teaching I encountered one student who was identified with anxiety problems and this was seen quite clearly in the time I spent with him. Every time that I would conduct my lesson, I made sure to be clear and thorough. But with my one anxious student, I was never quite clear enough. After every lesson he would approach me, in his own nervous way, and ask for the transparency notes so that he could copy them down, or he would ask me to repeat the expectations of an assignment over again, after I had already repeated them TEN times prior for the entire class. The one thing that I realized with this student was that I had to offer him individual attention and I did this later on in my practicum by photocopying notes that the rest of the class had to copy down and copying homework questions down for him because he could not focus long enough to do it himself. Thankfully, my strategy worked, and I think I helped to lower his anxiety levels.

Unlike this student that I encountered, some students are able to pay attention. However, even when students with anxiety do pay attention, they still experience difficulty learning new material that is disorganized and challenging -specifically material that requires them to recall material from memory (Woolfolk et al., 374). These students also tend to focus their attention on insignificant details of the material and miss the most important facts of the material (Woolfolk et al., 374). Fortunately, there is light at the end of the tunnel for students with anxiety. They are capable of learning material and they can become knowledgeable in whatever they have learned, however some cannot demonstrate this on tests as they may &quot;blank out&quot; on test day due to their anxiety (Woolfolk et al., 374). 

It may be difficult to understand sometimes why a student experiences anxiety over a certain task, assignment, or subject, and for this every teacher should be available to the student and open to hear what their concerns may be. If, for example, a student experiences trouble or difficulty in group presentations because he or she has difficulty speaking in large groups, the teacher needs to be sensitive to this challenge for the individual student. Of course, it may be difficult sometimes to believe whether the student is sincere about their anxiety (or whether it is just an excuse to get out of a presentation) but teachers should not force their students to become big-time performers or presenters and put them on the spot when they would learn more effectively by doing something else. In my own teaching practice experience, I found that a lot of students shied away from presentations but because they were forced to do one in a group, there would be one speaker, and the rest would mumble. In individual presentations, there was a lot of reading on projection, a lot of mumbling, and in one of my classes the boy just completely backed out at the last minute and would not present. He was very shy, and every subsequent class he would say that he couldn't find his powerpoint presentation, but had this handy, neat essay ready to submit in its stead. My teacher chastised him (alone, in her office) for failing to produce a presentation, and said that the ability to do presentations is essential to his opportunities in future careers. I have heard this statement many times before, but does it really apply? What if that boy wants to become a skilled carpenter, tool and dye maker, computer technician, or even a writer? How often do carpenters, technicians, or writers have to make powerpoint presentations? There are a myriad of career options available to the shy dude or dame, and teachers should motivate their students to expand their repertoire without being imposing. In the end, the boy did fail the presentation, but the teacher made a separate mark for him, to allow for his well-written and researched essay.  

'''Coping with Anxiety (pg. 376)'''  

*Students with anxiety often select extremely difficult or extremely easy tasks. Thus, teachers should guide anxious students to set realistic short- and long-term goals (Woolfolk et al., 374).    
*Teachers should eliminate time limits on important tests because students with anxiety will often make careless errors for fear of not finishing in time.   
*Avoid situations in which highly anxious students will have to perform in front of large groups.   
*Make sure that all instructions are clear. Uncertainty leads to anxiety.   
*Teach students self-regulation strategies. 


*In my own experience, I found that the reason why students were not motivated to learn was due to a lack of engagement/interest into what was being taught.  For example, when I was teaching my class a lesson on tones and semitones, the students’ attention and interest seemed to dwindle, to say the least.  However, I then infused modern-day musical examples to explain the differences between tones and semitones (such as playing the Jaws theme on the piano), and the students responded well.  As teachers, we have to make learning fun and inspire curiosity/inquiry into our students.  Especially with the arts, we can easily focus our lessons around the interests of our students by relating our lessons to pop culture, for example.  However, in a subject such as math or science, creating a relevant curriculum or lesson might be difficult.  Making your lessons relevant and interesting to students will increase their level of engagement, which in turn, will keep them motivated to learn and discover.  

:On the other hand however, if we focus on including “seductive details” (pg. 373) into our lessons, are we diverting the attention of our students to less meaningful ideas?   For example, if we are teaching students about Vincent Van Gogh and mention how he cut off his left ear, would students remember this detail or the fact that Van Gogh was one of the leading post-impressionist artists?  Thus, if we focus on what is “interesting” for the sake student engagement, are we weeding out information that is valuable for students to know?

 How can we find a balance between incorporating a student’s interests into the lesson, while still ensuring that they are learning what is valuable and meaningful?

* This may be cheesy of me to say, but I think the best way to achieve this coveted balance is to create a lesson (or choose a piece, monologue etc.) with lots of depth and possibility for exploration. First of all, this will usually give the students some options in terms of their own learning – so even if an individual is not interested in the general “topic” of the lesson he/she will still be able to latch onto something valuable/meaningful. 
:During my practicum, providing students with options was something I used with great success. In our grade 12 English classroom, the students’ final assignment with me was to create a blog. While many were initially sceptical about they idea, they warmed to the concept once they realized they could essentially express themselves in any form and about anything. The assignment had guidelines, of course, but I tried to design it so that – while adhering to certain criteria -  the students had as much control over their own actions as they desired.

:On another note, I think emotions can be a powerful way to make a particular topic, lesson or song – just to name a few examples - more meaningful to our students. While the motivation behind a particular feeling – be it anger, sadness, or any number of things – may be different for everything person, the emotion itself is something everyone can relate to and I’ve found that understanding something on an emotional level can really increase students’ engagement and motivation to participate in a particular endeavour. 

:I also think the principle of backward design comes into play here. Often students are disengaged in the learning experience because there’s no “point” to the lesson/test/assignment etc. If the teacher designs a lesson or unit with a larger goal in mind (ie. increase students’ awareness of and sensitivity to cultures other than their own) not only will he/she be better able to design the lesson, he/she will also be able to “justify” the lesson to his/her students. I don’t know how many times during my practicum I had students say, “Miss, why do we need to do this?!” Unfortunately, while teachers may instinctively feel that something is valuable, we may not always be able to articulate why this is the case. Thus, having a larger goal in mind – of knowledge that we want students to take with them throughout their lives – is valuable on a long-term basis to both the students and the teacher.

*I'd like to follow up on a comment made in the previous post regarding the difficulty of creating interesting and emotionally engaging lessons in the maths and sciences. Last year, my math professor, Ron Lancaster, received the &quot;Professor of the Year&quot; award for his ability to encourage this exact kind of teaching within the math field. One of his assignments is to create a series of math questions based on real world things, which he calls viewing the outside with a &quot;mathematical lens&quot;. In effect, rather than leaving students to feel completely disconnected as to the relevance of their subject material, this at least gives students a basic connection to that which they are learning.

:Another aspect of his pedagogy is the &quot;catchy opener&quot; that, while not necessarily always reflecting the proceeding lesson 100%, aims at grabbing kids' attention at the beginning. Videos, games, pictures, news articles, social justice issues, or any other types of things rooted in the outside world, and described in the context of math, make for an excellent example. I think these strategies are completely possible and they enable emotional interest, even in the math classroom.

*Harp and Mayer state that the aim at increasing emotional interest failed to improve understanding- that “seductive details” interfered with the student’s comprehension. They conclude, “The best way to help students enjoy a passage is to help them understand it”. (Pg. 373)

:To elaborate on the question pose by Colillis, we can incorporate a student’s interest into the curriculum by doing just that, plain and simple. Seductive details can be used as part of an introduction to the unit- so that we may “hook” that student’s attention, in order to prepare them to receive vital information. 

:For example, during practicum I was responsible for teaching students Early Christian &amp; Byzantine Art History, it was suggested that I provide the students with a HEAP the juicy details of Theodora’s life, however I failed to see the relevance of teaching students unimportant information for purely entertainment value. I sifted through their text, condensed it, and then designed an interactive game that we played in class. I found that the students were engaged and enjoyed the competition. This was a great way to spark their interest in the unit but I definitely felt the need to follow-up with an assignment &amp; in-class activity in order to provide them with an in-depth understanding. FOR THEIR ASSIGNMENT: I had the students identify the characteristics and symbolism of Early Christian and Byzantine Art and then they had to create a painting using signs &amp; symbols, which represented “the self”. Having the kids learn the information and then apply their knowledge is a great way to test for understanding while giving them the freedom to express themselves and enjoy the material being taught.

*Someone I know, who is perpetually intent on summing up the world in a nutshell (you know the type) insists that &quot;intelligence is finding interest.&quot; Nothing, of course, is ever that simple, but I do find a lot of value in it as a pedagogical guide. As educators we are working to develop and expand students' (multiple) intelligences, not just to satisfy immediate curricular requirements, but to build skills for life-long learning and achievement. In developing engaging lesson plans and facilitating access to course material, are we not also modeling ways in which to find interest that may well inform students' future learning strategies? 

:I do agree that we need to avoid putting on a dog and pony show at the expense of content, if for no other reason than that students will feel patronized by it, and possibly even interpret it as a comment on their lack of ability (see p.364). However, there are multiple ways to stimulate interest, from the simple to the complex, and these can be utilized at different stages in the unit. We just need to maintain awareness of what knowledges and skills are being engaged through our various strategies.

:Another point to keep in mind is that some interest-based pedagogical strategies may effect motivation for socio/cultural reasons that lie outside of the curricular aims of the course. For example, biographical information about female mathematicians may not be relevant to the equation at hand, but could very well encourage young women to find interest in pursuing math as a subject.

* I absolutely agree with Tearney - while 'seductive details' may not be linked specifically with curriculum expectations, they can certainly encourage interest in a subject area, and hopefully lead to a lifelong interest in learning.  

:When I read this part of the text, I thought back to a great alternative school I attended in grades 7 and 8.  Many subjects were taught using games, role-playing and other 'fun' methods, and I remember enjoying my time there more than at any other school.  So what DO I remember from that time?  Do I only remember the fun parts and none of the important information?  Do I remember any dates of historical events, math formulas or geographic locations?  I don't.  I also don't think it matters.  What I gained from that experience was a love of learning - which will last far longer than mere bits of information.  

:If we can foster a love of learning in our students (by making lessons fun), this will lead to skills and traits that will serve them well in any arena - not just school.  When you love what you're doing you generally work harder and achieve more, which leads to a boost in self-confidence.  

:Is the point of education really to ensure that students remember pertinent details?  Wouldn't you rather that your students understand overall concepts, and develop important personal skills such as a good work ethic and self-confidence?  Really - if kids need to know a quick fact these days - they can Google it.

* Absolutely! How does a good story (or any piece of art) work? Art is all about ''seductive details'', or, as I prefer to call them, ''points of access''. A writer--I don't remember who it was--said something along these lines, &quot;if you've got something ''serious'' to say, you better make it funny&quot;. Though I don't always agree with this, I do get the point. Further, I think the point is relevant to teaching, extremely relevant when it comes to things like '''differentiated teaching strategies''' which cater to diverse aptitudes in an effort to make every lesson as accessible as possible to all the students in a classroom. In that vein, wouldn't an auditory learner (and latter-life pedegogical academic) find visual and/or kinesthetic learning activities to be superfluous ''seductive details''.

=== &lt;u&gt;Self Schemas &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 375-384) ===
&lt;big&gt;How do beliefs about ability affect motivation?&lt;/big&gt;''

Adults use 2 basic concepts of ability:  

*'''Entity view''': Ability is unchangeable. (What we're born with is what we have.)   
**Students with learning disabilities are more likely to have this view   
**Causes students to set 'performance goals' rather than 'learning goals' to avoid looking stupid   
**Causes students to avoid putting in too much effort - to work hard and fail is devastating   
**Students with this view tend to stick to tasks that they can do well   
**Teachers with this view are more likely to make judgments about students and keep them, even in face of contradictory evidence 

*'''Incremental view:''' Ability is a set of skills that can be changed and improved. 

**Young students tend to have this view, believing that working hard and being smart are the same thing 
**At about 10 or 11 years of age students begin to see the difference between effort and ability, and this begins to affect motivation   
**Students with this view set goals to improve skills   
**Students with this view see failure as meaning more work is needed, not as a threat to their ability 

&lt;big&gt;What is self-efficacy, and how is it different from other self-schemas?&lt;/big&gt;''

'''Self-efficacy''' refers to the beliefs about our personal competence or effectiveness in a given area. This is more future oriented than other self-schemas, and refers to a person's assessment of his/her ability to complete a specific task. 

'''Self-concept''' is broader, referring to a variety of perceptions about the self, ''including'' self-efficacy. Self-concept develops through comparing oneself to others and comparing one's own abilities in different areas with each other. 

'''Here are some key differences between self-efficacy and self-concept:'''  

*Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of behaviour, while self-concept is less so

''&lt;big&gt;What are the sources of self-efficacy, and how does efficacy affect motivation? &lt;/big&gt;'' 

There are 4 sources of self-efficacy:   
   
'''1)Mastery Experiences'''   
*Our own direct experiences - most powerful source of self-efficacy   
'''2)Physiological and Emotional Arousal'''   
*Affects self-efficacy through the attitude the student has going into the task   
*Anxiety would lower self-efficacy, while looking forward to a task would heighten self-efficacy   
'''3)Vicarious Experiences'''   
*Accomplishments modelled by someone else   
*Children may rely more on this than on mastery experiences   
*The better the model does on the task, the higher the student's self-efficacy   
*Vicarious experiences are more effective when the student can identify closely with the model   
'''4)Social Persuasion'''   
*A pep talk or performance feedback   
*Can't create enduring increases in self-efficacy, but can motivate students to try new things or try harder   
*Can counter self-doubt, but effect depends on the trustworthiness and expertise of the persuaders   
   
   
   
''&lt;big&gt;How does self-determination affect motivation?&lt;/big&gt;''   
* self determination is the need to experience choice and control in what we do and how we do it   
* self determination = intrinsic motivation = greater interest and achievement   
* teachers can help develop    
   
   
   
''&lt;big&gt;How does self-worth influence motivation?&lt;/big&gt;''   
* There are 3 kinds of motivational sets: mastery-oriented, failure-avoiding, and failure accepting   
* '''Mastery-oriented''' students have an incremental view and tend to set learning goals. Their self-worth is not tied to success or failure, so these students are able to deal constructively with performance outcomes   
* '''Failure-avoiding''' students have an entity view and tend to set performance goals. Their self-worth is tied to how well they perform, and thus failure is not seen as an opportunity to improve   
* '''Failure-accepting''' students also have an entity view, but do not set any goals. These students give up and are likely to become depressed and apathetic   
  
   
   
''&lt;big&gt;Define motivation to learn. &lt;/big&gt;''   
* The tendency to find academic activities meaningful and worthwhile and to try to benefit from them   
* Can be both a general '''trait''' and a situation-specific '''state'''   
* Includes positive views about learning, and constructive strategies towards learning   
* Three goals for teachers: start by creating a ''state'' of motivation, then help students develop the ''trait'' of being motivated, and finally encourage them to participate deeply and actively and become ''thoughtful'' 


*According to Stipek, people with learning disabilities are more likely to hold an entity view rather than an incremental view of ability. I believe other factors contribute to a person's view of ability. My brother has a learning disability. When he was in elementary school, he would come home from school frustrated because he could not read, no matter how hard he tried. His classmates all assumed he was unintelligent and would often isolate him from the group. Fortunately, my mother could see my brother's interest and had confidence in him.  She helped him adapt to his learning disabilities. Aware of his interests, she was able to find appropriate books and resources to motivate him. Eventually, he developed his own learning style and gained confidence in his abilities. He is now finishing his Masters degree in computer engineering. If it wasn't for my mother's hard work and dedication, I believe my brother would have easily fallen into the &quot;entity view&quot; mindset and given up on his education.  I remember him telling me that he just didn't think like everyone else, he was never going to make it through school. He was listening to his peers negative comments and comparing his abilities. Thankfully, my mother could see his great potential. As a result, my brother had strong support from my family- encouraging him to pursue his interests and trust his abilities. Without a doubt, my brother is now working in with an &quot;incremental view of ability.&quot;  As a teacher, it is imperative to never undermine a student by categorizing them. Perhaps they are struggling in your class, but at home, they are tearing apart a computer and creating a new design. Challenge yourself by getting to know each student and truly support them in their passions.

*“Jere Brophy descirbes motivation to learn as ‘a student tendency to find academic activities meaningful and worthwhile and to try to derive the intended academic benefits from them.  Motivation to learn can be construed as both a general trait and a situation-specific state.’”  To accomplish this, teachers should pursue three goals: to create a state of motivation in the classroom, help students develop the trait of motivation to learn, to invite students to be active learner and be thoughtful about what they study.  This presents the teacher with some major challenges, how do you get students to be motivated about learning?  There is not an easy answer, but allowing the students some say in the material that they cover is one first and important step.  By drawing on themes or topics that students are already engaged in learning about, they will likely be more motivated to complete any task related to it.  Also, by teaching skills and techniques that students feel are valuable to learn and know in the future, possibly to accomplish one of their own personal goals will create a more motivated environment.  But most importantly, to motivate your students you must create authentic tasks; i.e. task that have some connection to a real-life problem the students may face outside the classroom.  If a student feels that the subject matter is relevant to his/her personal life, they will be motivated to find out more.  Once there is this state of motivation in the classroom, it is essential that students have opportunity to become independent learners and seek knowledge from outside that classroom environment.  This can easily be accomplished by assigning students an independent project that can be related to a subject of their choosing.  Also, to get students to be thoughtful about what they study, having them keep a journal and allowing class time for personal reflection is very important to engaging the students.  Often times, students will come into class, regurgitate the information they needs to and then leave.  Encouraging them to form opinions and reflect on the meaning of what they are doing will help to motivate them to accomplish the tasks. If the student can find a personal importance for the subject matter being covered, they will want to learn.

=== &lt;u&gt;On TARGET for Learning &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 384-391) ===
&lt;big&gt;'''TARGET'''&lt;/big&gt; is an acronym outlining the six areas of a teacher’s decision making that influences student motivation.  
'''&lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;asks''' 
'''&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;utonomy''' 
'''&lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt;esponsibility / &lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt;ecognition'''
'''&lt;big&gt;G&lt;/big&gt;rouping''' 
'''&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;valuation'''   
'''&lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;ime'''    
   
   
   
'''&lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;asks'''   
   
There are three different types of ''tasks'' which can be either interesting or boring for students depending on their individual values:   
'Attainment value' - the importance of doing well,   
'Intrinsic or interest value' - the enjoyment of the activity itself,   
'Utility value' - achieving a short or long-term goal   
   
*Encourage instruction that relates to students' backgrounds and expertise   
*Avoid monetary or other forms of payment for attendance, grades, or achievement   
*Foster goal setting and self-regulation   
*Assign authentic tasks   
*Have a wide range of visitors from careers related to the subject come in and offer a workshop or share their experience   
   

   
'''&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;utonomy / &lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt;esponsibility'''   
   
*Give alternatives in making assignments   
*Ask for student comments on school life and take them seriously   
*Encourage students to take initiative and evaluate their own learning   
*Establish leadership opportunities for ''all'' students   
*During the introduction of an assignment, have the students create a rubric all together with the teacher in class, and use that rubric in their assessment   
   
&quot;...[C]ompared to controlling teachers, autonomy-supporting teachers listened more, resisted solving problems for students, gave fewer directives, and asked more questions about what students wanted to do.&quot;   
   
   
'''&lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt;ecognition'''   
   
*Utilize and foster an appreciation of &quot;personal best&quot; awards   
*Reduce emphasis on &quot;honour rolls&quot;   
*Recognize and publicize a wide range of students’ school-related activities   
   
   
'''&lt;big&gt;G&lt;/big&gt;rouping'''   
   
*Provide opportunities for cooperative learning, problem solving, and decision-making   
*Encourage multiple group membership to increase range of peer interaction   
*Eliminated ability-grouped classes   
   
   
'''&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;valuation'''   
   
*Reduce emphasis on social comparisons of achievement   
*Give students opportunities to improve their performance   
*Establish grading/reporting practices that portray student progress in learning   
*Encourage student participation in the evaluative process   
   
   
'''&lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;ime'''    
   
*Allow students to progress at their own rate whenever possible   
*Encourage flexibility in the scheduling of learning experiences   
*Utilize block schedules, when possible, to increase time for engaged and persistent learning   
   

&lt;big&gt;'''Authentic Performance Tasks'''&lt;/big&gt;   
   
(Gini-Newman, G. (2008, January 15). Using Authentic Assessment to Nurturing Critically Thoughtful Students. [OISE/UT Workshop.] Toronto, ON.)    
   
'''Authentic:''' Simulating life outside of school and having an audience beyond the teacher and classmates.   
   
'''Performance Task:''' A task which requires students demonstrate their learning through a performance or the creation of a product.   
   
''&lt;big&gt;What do authentic performance tasks do and why are they effective? &lt;/big&gt;''    
   
*Ask students to perform, create or produce   
*Tap into higher-level thinking and problem solving skills   
*Place emphasis on process (assessing both the process and the final product)   
*Change the meaning of knowing and being skilled (it is not about gathering isolated facts but rather applying knowledge)   
*Contextualize learning   
*Recognizes the various abilities and talents of students   
   
   
'''Examples of Authentic Performance Tasks for a I/S History Class'''   
   
*Create a sandcastle/snow sculpture of architecture that encapsulates a civilization and call local media   
*Create a War of 1812 commemorative project of your choice   
*Create a Life Box from New France   
*Re-create cranium using the grade curriculum   
*Create a visual alternative time line of Canadian history   
*Design a castle to specs   
*Put a historical character on trial (re-try Louis Riel, William Lyon Mackenzie – hero or traitorous rebel?)   
*Host an ancient Greek symposium   
*Take the headlines from newspapers from the past year and have the student's vote on which ones were &quot;historical events&quot;   
   
   
'''Examples of Authentic Performance Tasks for a I/S Visual Art Class'''   
   
*Create an album cover for their favorite musician's albums or a book cover for their favorite book   
*Design a website for that art class' own &quot;blog site&quot;, with rotating editors and writers in the class   
*Create posters for the school play, or certain events in the community   
*Create artwork around the school, rotating throughout the year, on a number of school-related issues (i.e. discrimination, bullying, pollution, etc.)   
*Have the class collaborate on a theme or title for a gallery show, and have all the students create one individual piece to go with the show's thesis   
*Apply the student's ability to be critical visual thinkers by designing an anti-magazine, complete with photo spreads, commentary, and anti-ads (not dissimilar to ad busters)   
*Tie current events that interest them to the art projects, using their artwork as social commentary (i.e. on the re-vamping of T.O., on the destruction of the wall in Gaza, etc.)   

   
&lt;big&gt;'''Grouping, Evaluation, and Time'''&lt;/big&gt;   
   
'''Goal Structures''': The way in which students relate to others who are also working toward a particular goal.   
   
&lt;u&gt;Cooperative&lt;/u&gt; : &quot;I reach my goals only if others reach theirs&quot;   
   
* Can lead to higher achievement than competition by;   
* Learn to see from another person's point of view   
* Enhance relations among different people in classrooms   
* Increase self-esteem, and willingness to help fellow students   
* ''Teams-Games-Tournaments'': Competition in a tournament game between number of groups where each group works cooperatively.    
   
&lt;u&gt;Competitive&lt;/u&gt; : &quot;I reach my goals only if others do not reach theirs&quot;   
   
&lt;u&gt;Individualistic&lt;/u&gt; : &quot;Reaching my goals is unrelated to others achievements&quot;   
   
   
'''Effects of evaluation'''   
* Too much emphasis on evaluation and grading can lead students to focus on performance goals rather than mastery.   
* Teachers should emphasize 'understanding' than 'finishing'   
   
   
'''Effects of time pressure'''   
* Teachers should not force the students to work faster or slower since it can interfere motivation   
* Train the students to engaged and persistent learning (EX: DEAR - Drop Everything And Read) 



*I have an example that 'the number of students in a group' and 'the method of conducting the competition between the groups' is crucial when applying ''Teams-Games-Tournaments''.
:During my practicum, I tried to adapt the ''Teams-Games-Tournaments'' into a Music History Jeopardy in Grade 9 band class. 
:Since the class was so big (about 50 students in a class), I divided them up into four groups of 12-14 students. The rule of the game was that when each questions shows up on the screen, the first group that raises their hands will get the chance to answer the question. Then the following problems occurred;
:::* Only two or three strong students were participating, while the others just seat back and watch.
:::* The groups were too big to have a discussion 
:::* It was hard to be fair to all groups since I could not see which group raised their hand first.
:The class was a disaster; those disengaged students were talking; and students were complaining that I was not fair to every group by favouring one group.
:Fortunately, I had three Grade 9 band classes a day (in same sizes) so I could do better in the second and third class by fixing the problems. The rule that I learned was &quot;Do not make a group more than four students for a classroom work&quot;, and &quot;Make sure to set fair rule and procedures for the game that everyone can agree&quot;.

*I really like the idea of fostering “personal best” awards and reducing the emphasis on “honour rolls”. I have been thinking about the idea of placing more emphasis on the progress of the student as it relates to evaluation in visual art, or the arts in general.  I am just not sure how one would go about this type of assessment.  I imagine that you would have to establish a base line ability for each student, which would involve more diagnostic assessment…it sounds complicated. ''' Any ideas?'''

*In music, we have been talking about how to measure growth by using rubrics.  The idea is that you would have the students play their test piece in September, record it and use a rubric.  The following day you would have the students listen to their test (individually) and discuss their rubric with them - give them a copy of this rubric, and make a copy for yourself.  Then, use the same rubric for each playing test but mark it in a different colour.  Follow the same 'reflecting' process as before in order to show students their growth.  At the end of the semester/year, you can have them listen and compare their first playing test with their last.

*That sounds like a great idea. In effect, the students are competing with themselves. The cynic in me wonders if that system might be corrupted by mark-oriented students who might purposely under-perform their initial piece because they realize that their final mark will be judged relative to their progress. Just a thought, and a nasty one at that...though not beyond the realm of possibility.

*Another thought, as it relates to evaluation, specifically the sidebar on Authentic Tasks. Garfield made a few great points during his presentation. 
:::*Evaluation should serve students, not teachers looking to justify themselves on Parent-Teacher Night, meaning that a poor mark should come with an opportunity for the student to either redo or modify  an already-evaluated assignment for a better mark. 
:::*Failure should be destigmatized by having the students '''&quot;fail forward&quot;''', that is, by grading the product (the essay, the project, whatever) independent of the process (rough drafts, notes, sketch), so that a failure of the final product does not sink the whole assignment. Also, an evaluation of the entire timeline filled by any one project may offer the student a good idea of where they might have gone astray in their process and offer them the chance to fix it for credit.

=== &lt;u&gt;Bringing it all together: Strategies to Encourage Motivation and Thoughtful Learning&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 391-396) ===

''&lt;big&gt;What four conditions must exist in a classroom so that motivational strategies can be successful?&lt;/big&gt;'' 

''&lt;big&gt;What can teachers do to motivate students? &lt;/big&gt;''   
   
'''1. Necessary Classroom Conditions'''   
* Organized classroom   
* Free from interruptions   
* Safe-to-fail environment   
* Challenging but reasonable work   
* Authentic, worthwhile tasks   
   
'''Staying Focused on the Task'''''   
   
When students face challenges with their work, they will often lose focus. It is important to help students keep this focus so they will still be motivated to learn. These are some tips to focus learning:   
   
   
1. Give students frequent opportunities to respond through questions, short assignments, demonstration of skills   
   
2. Have students create a finished product   
   
3. Avoid heavy emphasis on grades and competition   
   
4. Reduce the risk of the task, without oversimplifying the task   
   
5. Model your own motivation to learn   
   
6. Teach the learning tasks that will help students with the material   
   
   
“[T]he classroom must be relatively organized and free from constant interruptions and disruptions.” (391)   
   
   
It seems like a no-brainer, but so many teachers I’ve come across leave the door open to their classroom. Maybe for the first few minutes of class to let in the late students, but for the most part there will always be wandering students/teachers in the halls and they will distract your class’ attention (especially if one of the students walking the halls has a friend in your class). Move around the classroom and get students conscious that you’ve got eyes on them (kind of like what our class felt when we had M.Tudor visit our class). For teachers in the Arts, you can decorate and have motivational/inspirational things in your class, but in one area, especially the work area (i.e. the desks, near the instruments/tools) everything should look clean and organized. Students are great at catching weaknesses in teachers and taking advantage of them, and if they get the impression that you’re disorganized or scattered, then the motivation to keep their own notes/things from your class will not be strong.   
   
   
'''2. Encouraging and Understanding Teachers '''   
   
*The classroom should be an environment where it is safe to make a mistake, and no student should feel embarrassed or singled out for such reasons   
*The teacher should be flexible and patient enough to let the small things (individual disruptions) slide off their shoulders and not distract them from motivating and keeping the rest of the class focused   
   
“[T]he teacher must be a patient, supportive person who never embarrasses students for mistakes.” (391)   
   
   
Teachers are not meant to embarrass anyone in their class, although embarrassing yourself can offer some comic relief for the students and show the class that you’re willing to show some flaws and not take yourself too seriously, especially when you make a mistake. In regards to patience and support, it is important to remember your students and how they act; sometimes you need to let the talkative boy just let things out at the beginning of class in order to keep his attention throughout the rest of your lesson, or when you have a student who is upset/preoccupied with something else and is not focusing, give them a few extra minutes to regroup and come back to you and your lesson. Sometimes students really need just a few minutes of buffer time, where their mind just processes things, in order to be truly focused for those precious “teaching” minutes in the class.    
On my practicum I came across a teacher who fit into her lesson about 5-10 minutes buffer time at the beginning of her class so that late people and chatty people can do their thing and let it out right at the start, so that the remaining 60 minutes were all hers. From what I saw it worked out pretty well, because it showed the class that she understood that their social needs, etc. are important to them and by giving them a little they should return the favour.    
  
'''3. Challenging but Realistic Workload'''   
*The work should not be too easy nor too difficult; create a range of difficulty levels in your class workload so that everyone has the opportunity to be challenged and succeed in completing the task.   
   
    
'''4. Make the Tasks Authentic'''   
*As described earlier in the book, authentic tasks increase individual intrinsic motivation because the interest level is higher and students can relate the task to their own lives and/or pursuits. 

'''&quot;Can I do it?&quot; How to Build Student Confidence'''

*Start at the students level and move up with small goals they can achieve one at a time 
*Keep the goals clear, focused, and attainable over time, with a range of levels in difficulty   
*Emphasize self-reflection rather than comparison with the progress of others    
*Express to students that their abilities can improve and that each success/failure is relative to the specific task and not reflective of their capabilities overall 


'''Motivating Circumstances'''

*In a competitive society, motivation is often mistaken for ambition.  Furthermore, ambition is viewed as a choice and a virtue rather than a trait dependent on personality.  Within a school environment, this notion is problematic because its implication is that lack of motivation is a surefire indicator of indolence and poor character.  For decades, teachers have placed blame on underachieving students for being lazy and unwilling.  Such assertions are poorly informed and do little to improve the students’ sense of self-efficacy. (p 377)  Consider, for example, the case of specialized learners who may fear putting forth effort in activities they associate with failure.  They may withhold effort deliberately in order to avoid embarrassment and personal disappointment.  This is in line with Bernard Weiner’s concept of controlability, where a perceived lack of ability perpetuates feelings of hopelessness, withdrawal and declining performance. (p 363)

:Motivation is not a matter of choice because every person would naturally choose to belong and be successful.  Rather, motivation is an outcome, dependent on factors such as security, inclusiveness and achievement.  First of all, students require a supportive learning environment, where mistakes are ok and effort does not equal risk. (p 391)  Secondly, students respond well when their strengths are recognized, encouraging them to utilize their best-honed skills (multiple intelligences).  Finally, students are motivated by experiences of success.  Authentic accomplishment can serve as a foundation for the development of higher order needs, nurturing an increasingly intrinsic motivation to learn. (p 392, 362, 359)  For a student who has previously struggled with mathematics, a newfound proficiency in geometry can bring tremendous satisfaction and a strong desire to continue understanding.  (“I enjoy understanding.” – George Costanza)  Real sparks happen when students realize that favourable results are attainable.

:Despite the wealth of insight available on the topic, motivating others remains a challenging task.  In order to succeed, teachers must be sensitive to the needs and concerns of their students.

:--[[User:Artursedov|Artursedov]] ([[User talk:Artursedov|talk]]) 03:30, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

:I found that motivation techniques are tough things to tack down. Every student has different factors that motivate them, as detailed above, but how do we cast a wide enough net to engage as many students as possible? I think these four strategies outline many effective ways to motivate students, and I’ve seen them in practice many times during my practicum and volunteer teaching experiences. 

:I’ve seen many teachers whose love of learning is infectious for students. These teachers either take an interest in the material being taught, or have adapted something that they feel strongly about into the curriculum. In both my practicum experiences, for example, my ATs felt very strongly that the graphic novel should be included in the English curriculum, so they incorporated graphic novels into their classes as a form of media literacy, or just to get the students started along the path to enjoying reading. These teachers’ enthusiasm was infectious, and because the teachers were genuinely interested in the material, the students picked up on this, and were interested in finding out more about literacy. 

: I myself found that the teacher can act as a powerful motivational force for groups. In my drama practicum, there was a group having difficulties working together to rehearse their children’s play. They weren’t invested in the characters, nor did they seem to have any energy at all. I put myself into the rehearsal, in the role of a student who was absent that day, in the hopes that in putting myself in role in the play, the students could pick up on my energy. I was happy to see that they did, and after I rehearsed with them for a while, when I left them to rehearse on their own, I found that they had a stronger sense of focus, and were more energetic in their rehearsal. 

: A motivated, energetic and consistent teacher, who demonstrates to the students that they  care about the class, and genuinely interested in making an engaging classroom, cause students to be motivated to understand the course material. An inconsistent instructor may hinder the comprehension of even an entire class full of the most energetic, outgoing, friendly and gifted individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Precision and Accuracy ==
&quot;Roughly&quot; in the preceding paragraph should have made some people uncomfortable, and rightly so. To make it a little more precise, we say &quot;roughly&quot; because we cannot expect any data set to have an ''exact'' &lt;math&gt;D \propto T^2&lt;/math&gt; relationship. Even if the theory is absolutely correct, a lot of things can go wrong in the experiment: perhaps, when we measure the height, we measure off 51.2 cm, instead of 50 cm that we were supposed to. Or, more likely, we press the &quot;stop&quot; botton on the stopwatch a little bit after the marble falls.

This can happen because of our reaction time (time between when we hear the marble fall and when we press the button) and this results in an error in '''accuracy'''. There is another type of error, called '''precision'''. When the stopwatch records 1.52 seconds, we do not know whether it's not really 1.5187 seconds, because our equipment, assuming it works perfectly, measures reliably only up to 0.01 seconds. The difference between &quot;accuracy&quot; and &quot;precision&quot; can be described in analogy with target-shooting in this way: &quot;high precision&quot; means each shot hits relatively closer to each other; the spread of points is smaller. &quot;High accuracy&quot; means that all the shots are close to the mark. Given a set of data, it can have &quot;high precision&quot; but &quot;low accuracy&quot;, for example if we got a better stopwatch that records to four digits past decimal but did not solve the problem with the reaction time, all our measurements would be relatively close to each other, but still their average will be 0.1 second away from what it should be. We can also have &quot;high accuracy&quot; but &quot;low precision&quot;, if we solved the reaction time problem by concocting an arrangement where the stopwatch will be pressed automatically when the marble fell, but the stopwatch itself measures reliably only up to 1/10th of a second. 

It is a common goal in any experiment to achieve &quot;high precision&quot;, &quot;high accuracy&quot; measurements. Generally, reducing the error in accuracy is regarded as part of a good experimental technique, but there is less we can do about the errors in precision. While a better equipment would help, in various situations, there are several types of fundamental noises that limit even the state-of-the-art instruments. In fact, it is a fundamental fact of physics, partly due to quantum mechanics, that ''it is impossible to make an absolutely exact measurement.''

So, this is what we mean by &quot;roughly&quot;. For each measurement, one defines error boundaries which indicate how much one estimates the measurement can be off by (using statistics, concepts like &quot;confidence level&quot; and standard deviation is often used to make this meaning more precise). This is often written as something like &lt;math&gt;1.21 \pm 0.02&lt;/math&gt; s. If one finds a curve &lt;math&gt;f(t) = at^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, that goes near all data points, relative to the error of each point, and the error is relatively small, then one says that the theory has been confirmed in this instance.

== Significant Figures ==

Because all experimentally measured quantities have a certain uncertainty, or error, associated with them, we should also state how precise we expect the measurement to be. While this can be a somewhat complicated matter when conducting a thorough experiment, for us, a convention called significant figures, allows us to indicate the error in a concise manner. Simply put, '''significant figures''' indicates how many meaningful digits are present in a measurement, with the error taken as &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; on the last digit. For example, when we say a stick measures 1.25 m, this measurement has three significant figures: We are pretty sure about the first two digits, 1 and 2, but because we don't know what comes after the last digit, we have &lt;math&gt;\pm0.01&lt;/math&gt; uncertainty (because, for example, if the actual number was 1.256, after rounding off, it would be 1.26 m). On the other hand, if we said that it measured 1.250 m, then we have four significant figures.

The convention is, &quot;the number of significant figures is equal to the number of digits written, including the zeros after the decimal&quot;. However, this convention does not say how many significant figures &quot;5000 m&quot; has. It could mean that it is accurate up to the meter or it could also be a rough estimate accurate only up to a 1000 m---because there is no other way to write 5000 m, we simply can't know. One way to resolve this ambiguity is to use '''scientific notation''', and in scientific notation, &lt;math&gt;5000~\mathrm{m} = 5.00 \times 10^3~\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;, if it had three significant figures. 

The number of significant figures matters to us when we calculate another quantity from measured quantities. Suppose, we have a rectangular piece of foil and we want to know its area. We measure the sides to be 12.1 cm and 27.2 cm. And, as we know from geometry, the area of a rectangle is given by, &lt;math&gt;A = wl&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; represent the width and length, so we multiply the numbers together to obtain, &lt;math&gt;A = 329.12 cm^2&lt;/math&gt;. However, the precision of this result is misleading, and &lt;math&gt;A = 329 cm^2&lt;/math&gt;, which has the same number of significant figures as what we started with, represents the value of the area and our confidence in the value better. The general rules is, &quot;when we take a product or quotient of two numbers, the number of significant figures of the final result is equal to that of the number with less significant figures&quot;. So, when we multiply 12 cm and 27.2 cm together, we should state our answer is &lt;math&gt;A = 330~\mathrm{cm}^2&lt;/math&gt;, or in scientific notation, &lt;math&gt;A = 3.3 \times 10^2~\mathrm{cm}^2&lt;/math&gt;. 

When we add or subtract two numbers, the rule is slightly different: Instead of trying to keep the number of significant figures the same, we try to keep the decimal place the same, taking after that of the less-precisely known number. For example, &lt;math&gt;12.3 + 421.5234 = 433.8&lt;/math&gt;.

In applying these rules, one thing to keep in mind is common sense. These rules are meant only to be rough guidelines, and as such, we have to apply these rules as it makes sense. For one, when we calculate the mass of two marbles from the measured mass of one marble, 25.2 g, then we don't say &lt;math&gt;25.2~\mathrm{g} \times 2 = 50~\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; because 2 has only one significant figure&amp;mdash;rather, we consider the number 2, which is a discrete value, to have infinite number of significant figures and say two marbles weigh 50.4 g.

Also, when we make a series of calculations, it is often preferable to wait until the very end before rounding off to the correct number of significant figures. Otherwise, you will get what is known as a &quot;round-off error&quot;.

=== &lt;u&gt;Understanding Learning&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 197-199) ===

'''Knowledgeable Behaviour'''

*In the text, learning is defined as a change in knowledge and/or behaviour that occurs exclusively through experience. (p 197)  For example, the experience of reading a textbook brings about additional factual knowledge.  This learning is deliberate.  On the other hand, the experience of placing one’s tongue against a frozen metal post for the first time may prompt the avoidance of a similar situation in the future.  Interestingly, in the latter example, both new knowledge (tongue sticks to frozen metal) and new behaviours (don’t do it) are gained.  This learning is inadvertent.

:Thus, learning may be intentional or unintentional; however, it is always initiated by the learner’s interaction with his or her environment.  It follows that changes attributed to natural development, such as maturation, do not qualify as learning. (p 197)  This condition is logically sound with respect to physiological developments such as growing taller or turning gray.  However, it could also be understood to suggest that learning benefits often associated with mental maturation are actually a product of experiences accumulated with age.  While it is clear that neurological development does not in itself constitute the act of learning, its exclusion undermines the significance of the constantly-changing adolescent brain.  For example, if the ability to reason is associated with the development of the frontal lobe, can critical thinking be considered a learned skill?  What are the implications for abstract thought?

:Given the dichotomy of knowledge and behaviour, the study of learning is divided into cognitive and behavioural points of view.  Cognitive psychologists emphasize internal mental processes such as thinking, remembering and problem-solving.  Conversely, the behavioural perspective assumes that learning causes observable changes in behaviour.  (p 197)  It is not clear why there is such an insistence on favouring one position over the other – both knowledge and behaviour are clearly essential to learning.  Furthermore, it could be said that behaviour is enacted knowledge and that knowledge is potential behaviour.

=== &lt;u&gt;Early Explanations of Learning: Contiguity and Classical Conditioning&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 199-202) ===

*  I was very intrigued by the discussion in the chapter about classical conditioning and how it can relate to learning in the classroom.  Discovered by Ivan Pavlov, who was able to train dogs to salivate at the sound of a tuning fork, classical conditioning is described as an association of automatic responses with new stimuli (Woolfolk et. al, pg. 199-200).  In the classroom students’ emotional reactions to different situations are often viewed as a result of classical conditioning. In particular, I was interested in how emotional reactions will often disrupt learning.  For example, the stress and anxiety that many students feel during tests or presentations, which can often result in a poor performance.  I wonder if there is a way to apply the theory of classical conditioning to eliminate the stress and possibly evoke a different emotion during a test or performance time.  In the Guidelines on page 201 of the text book, the authors suggest giving un-graded tests so that students can practice daily.  My concern with this suggestion is that firstly it seems unrealistic to test students so frequently, and also that perhaps this continuous testing will just perpetuate the anxiety for the student.  Perhaps pairing a test with a positive stimulus could decrease the stress that is created in this situation.  In my own experience my high school sociology teacher would give us candy as we took a test.  A testing day was much less dreaded by the class because we knew that we would be given a treat.  In theory this seems like a potential solution to the negative emotions that a test can produce.  However, is it merely setting up students to perform poorly in a testing situation that doesn’t provide a positive stimulus? 
 
:'''Can a teacher use classical conditioning to reduce negative emotional reactions, or would the use of reinforcements, such as in operant conditioning, be more effective?'''

:--[[User:JollyJamie|JollyJamie]] ([[User talk:JollyJamie|talk]]) 06:40, 28 January 2008 (UTC)
 

:* In response to the above question, I think that the use of both methods can be effective. However, since an example of operant conditioning has already been provided I will touch upon classical conditioning. I think testing can be something not feared if it is introduced from the very beginning of classes as a positive experience so that it creates feelings of pleasure instead of pain.  One way that this could be accomplished is by providing an atmosphere that is peaceful and calm as well as providing tests that are fair (i.e. including material that has been taught, and not providing trick questions). The former can be accomplished in two ways. The first is the the teacher's demeanour.  If the teacher is calm, cheerful and optimistic she can help to alleviate some pre-test anxiety. Secondly, if the test space provided is peaceful and comfortable while the testing is being administered (ex. soft relaxation music) this can also help.  If from the very beginning of the year, the setting for testing is associated with positive variables, the students should not associate testing with fear.

::* Perhaps a way to overcome this sense of fear is by continually assessing students. By incorporating small quizzes, tests, or  assignments, which will simply be used as an assessment tool by the teacher and students (and not graded), students may begin to feel comfortable and more at ease during a graded quiz/test. People often feel anxious in unfamiliar environments. They especially feel anxious when they are being evaluated. I remember the first time I had to play in a recital, I was so nervous I could not control my shaking hands and made countless mistakes from over-thinking. However, over the years, I have had many opportunities to perform in public. Now, not only am I relaxed and comfortable when I play in public, I actually enjoy the experience. By providing students with ungraded tests (written in the same format as their upcoming-graded tests), students may be more relaxed during the graded tests. They are now familiar with the format, phrasing of questions, and have a firm understanding of the types of questions the teacher may ask. Another option to overcome fear is to change the format of the tests. For example, open book tests, take home tests, or allow students to bring in one small-cheat. All of these formats still require the students to apply their knowledge, however, students may feel more control over their end product.

::* In response to the two above postings, (especially the one on operant conditioning)I think that making testing more positive for students also ties into the section on Mastery Learning on pages 215 and 216 of the text. This idea that all students can master a skill, or achieve an 80-90% mark in a testing situation, before moving onto the next level. I know one teacher who does not allow her students to fail an evaluation. She allows them multiple tries of a similar task, until they get it right. Instead of going in thinking they will fail, these students know that they will eventually succeed, which eliminates some of the pre-test panic. As the text states, there are problems with this system, but I have seen this system work when it is adapted for only certain struggling members of the class. As students know they will have many tries to succeed, this could be another way to condition students to associate tests with positive consequences instead of the negative consequence of failing.

They are now familiar with the format, phrasing of questions, and have a firm understanding of the types of questions the teacher may ask.    

:::*In accordance with Liz's response, I have seen a similar system work where a teacher has allowed for students to re-submit their work once the teacher has done a 'basic' marking on the assignment.  This practice was particularly used in music theory class for those students who were able to grasp the concepts, but were having trouble applying them to the 'big picture'.  This way students were able to see their mistakes, and were given opportunities to re-write the assignment, this time making a connect as to why their result was wrong, and could seek further help how to do it properly.  Assignments became more than just a 'grade', because it was the satisfaction of mastering a technique and being able to move on to the next step.  This was a very smart idea as the teacher encouraged not only independent learning, but also it was a form of operant conditioning (touching on the next topic-pg. 202), as the students would learn as much as they wanted to (i.e. could choose to re-do the assignment or be satisfied with the original mark) and because of the constant learning in music theory, students would realize sooner or later that they would need to fully grasp concepts before being able to move on. 


::::'''As teacher's, how far should we go to see our students succeed?'''


::::To make matters more interesting, this same teacher allowed students to bring in a 'cheat sheet' into their test.  One single-sided, blank piece of paper where they could write anything except for examples.  Because students went to such detailed lengths when filling up this piece of paper, when it came to the test, students no longer needed to use this sheet, as they had done a through job of studying and already new the material inside and out.  Obviously this method would not work with all students, but for those students who have the tendency to 'freeze' in test situation, it was the perfect way for students to feel more competent.

* As a music major in university we were given as many chances to perform in a friendly, supportive, low-stress environment as possible.  Though my instructors never used the term &quot;Classical Conditioning&quot; I believe that this is exactly what they were attempting, in hopes of aleviating performance anxiety in students.  The problem with this is that a performance situation is an unconditioned stimulus which evokes a very primitive &quot;fight or flight&quot; response that is hardwired into every human individual.  In short, when a person is experiencing performance anxiety part of their brain is telling them that their lives are in danger.  This is obviously an irrational, unconditioned response, but overcoming such a strong basic instinct is near impossible for some people.  Some performers are able to channel the &quot;fight&quot; instinct into creative energy that drives their performance, while others devote several hours before a performance to meditation in order to convince their mind that what they're about to experience is not a life or death situation.  

:'''Are there methods we, as teachers of the arts, can use in the classroom to extinguish the unconditioned responses associated with performance anxiety?'''
:--[[User:Elewis|Elewis]] ([[User talk:Elewis|talk]]) 03:36, 29 January 2008 (UTC)


* It is interesting to explore how a teacher can best use conditioned stimulus defined as &quot;stimulus that evokes an emotional or pshychological response after conditioning&quot; (Woolfolk et. al, pg. 200) in the classroom to promote focused learning and also eleviate anxiety. The desired result is a conditioned response from the students, defined as a &quot;learned response to previously neutral stimulus&quot; (Woolfolk et. al, pg. 200), to optimize their learning potential in the classroom setting.  In response to the above question regarding performance anxiety, I believe the power lies with the teacher and their ability to create an environment condusive to support and comfort for students in the performance setting.  Simply put, I believe the teacher needs to put the subject on the &quot;table&quot;, which is so seldom done in the context of performance classes, and discuss the subject in a group context.  By shifting the conditioned response within students, an environment is created condusive to open, creative, and artistic expression. - Christopher Wilson

* In response to Eli's question above, I think there are some things you can do.  I suffered (still do, I guess) from performance anxiety and I tried many different strategies to combat it.  One that helped was practicing a concert program in a big, open room--ideally, the room where the actual concert will be performed.  I think this helped because part of the anxiety comes from the performance environment: the nerves REALLY start kicking in when you walk through the doors, hear your footsteps echo through the hall, you can't see anyone but you hear a roar of applause--once I sat down and looked up, I usually felt pretty small in this giant hall.  The idea is if you perform in a big, open space, practice in a big, open space (whether it's the performance hall during off hours or somewhere else).  Your relationship to the practice space mimics the performance situation.  I would often practice in a normal practice room and when I felt ready, walk straight into a lecture hall (ensuring beforehand that there was no class in there, of course!) and perform my concert program beginning to end, just as if it was the real thing.  

:The conditioning comes into play get used to performing in that environment without any stress--you're dulling the conditioned response.  Of course, the audience won't be there (although inviting friends to watch you practice certainly helps), but it's a start.

=== &lt;u&gt;Operant Conditioning: Trying New Responses&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 202-208) ===

*There were a variety of themes in this reading that I found interesting in relation to teaching. One theme in particular dealt with positive/negative reinforcement (which both promote a particular behaviour) and punishment (which weakens and suppresses behaviour) (Woolfolk et. al, pg. 203-204).  In my own experience both as a student and as a teacher, I find that teachers overlook the importance of reinforcing positive behaviour among his/her students and focus on punishment.  I find that a tendency of teachers is to only catch students being “bad”.  Instead, teachers should try and catch their students being “good”. For example, if a student who has been talking throughout the entire class has finally quieted down, then the teacher should use this opportunity to acknowledge that student’s compliance either through praise, a reward (such as more computer time), etc.  This acknowledgement will encourage the student to continue with the desired behaviour which in turn, will minimize the teacher’s need to manage/punish that student during class-time.  

:During my practicum, I was amazed with how easy it was to implement punishment over positive reinforcement. When students were behaving, I had to consistently remind myself to acknowledge this through a reinforcer of some kind, such as praising them, or playing a piece that they loved.  

:'''Why is it that punishing students seems to be a more of a natural tendency for teachers rather then implementing positive/negative reinforcement?  Also, is it possible for a teacher to run a successful classroom on positive/negative reinforcement alone? Or, at times, does punishment need to be enforced? Is it possible to find a balance between the two?'''

:Thoughts, ideas, comments?

:--[[User:Colillis|Colillis]] ([[User talk:Colillis|talk]]) 20:55, 27 January 2008 (UTC)


*I'd like to quote an outside text in response to your question, '''“Why is it that punishing students seems to be a more of a natural tendency for teachers than implementing positive/negative reinforcement?”''' In his article “&lt;u&gt;''Rewarded by Punishment: Reflections on the Disuse of Positive Reinforcement in Schools''&lt;/u&gt;” (cf. [http://www.aea11.k12.ia.us/spedresearch/res0501/research-maag_article.html] [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=866874]), author John W. Magg proposes multiple reasons for punishment having traditionally been a preferred form of treatment.


:First, Maag believes that  positive reinforcement is often misunderstood because it is rarely associated with discipline. (Maag, 178) Furthermore, positive reinforcement is assumed by many to be coercive; bribing students to behave well, rather than motivating them intrinsically.  Because of this, techniques based on positive reinforcement are often understood to threaten personal autonomy.  Ironically, punishment seems more acceptable in this sense.  People assume that they are free to choose to behave in a responsible way to avoid punishment.  (Maag, 173) Moreover, our society views punishment as a highly effective way to control its members. Punishment often can produce a rapid suppression of undesired behaviours.  (Maag, 176)  I’d like to suggest that positive reinforcement is  proactive, rather than reactive, and may not demonstrate immediate, identifiable changes in behaviour.


:Secondly, Maag proposes that teachers do not use reinforcement effectively because they do not understand important terms related to behaviour modification.  The terms and concepts addressed in this section are covered in greater depth by our text, &lt;u&gt;Educational Psychology&lt;/u&gt;.

:As teachers, our actions and interactions encourage behavioural responses, whether we are conscious of them or not.  It is important that we recognize the differences between ''reinforcing'' and ''punishing'' behaviours.  A reinforcer encourages a particular form of behaviour, whereas punishment discourages it.  Because of our traditional understanding of these words, we may all too readily assume that punishment has negative connotations, and that reinforcement is preferable.  This is not necessarily the case.  

:Similarly, the terms ''positive'' and ''negative reinforcement'' carry their own baggage.  They are two means to an end, two ways to modify behaviour.  One method is not necessarily preferable to the other.  Our text proposes that positive reinforcement occurs when a behaviour has been strengthened “by presenting a desired stimulus after the behaviour”.  In other words, a teacher encourages said behaviour by their response (or lack of response) to it.   It is possible that positive reinforcement may not be “positive” in the traditional sense. 

:Positive reinforcement is a more complicated process than simply giving praise to students.  During my practicum, I praised a student’s work on a diorama, hoping that she would respond to my “positive” encouragement.  Rather, she seemed embarrassed at being singled out for her achievement.  As I did not encourage her, I failed to reinforce her behaviour.  Simply because verbal praise sounds like a reinforcer does not mean that it will function as one.


:Maag notes that when punishments are effective, they are used infrequently, because they serve to reduce inappropriate behaviours.  However, students who repeatedly misbehave and receive reprimands, suspensions and the like are not being punished for their actions.   They are instead being positively reinforced. “Teachers expect students to behave well, and consequently ignore them when they do so, but they usually give them negative attention when they do behave poorly.  Adult attention, even if it is negative, is a powerful reinforcer - especially for students with the most challenging behaviours who typically receive very little positive attention.”(Maag, 179)


:Maag suggests that many teachers do not use reinforcement to their advantage.  Effectively changing students’ behaviours also requires teachers to modify their own behaviours; but first, they must recognize how positive reinforcement is congruent with the values and techniques they need to apply.  “These goals can be addressed when teachers prioritize their values” (Maag, 183).  Changing ingrained techniques are hard.  Accordingly, as new teachers, we have an advantage.

:Maag concludes his article by providing a series of '''easy-to-implement techniques to encourage positive reinforcement''', which I thought I'd share.


::::'''1) Catch students being good.'''  Teachers often take for granted when students behave well, and often only react to inappropriate behaviours.  Some students have learned that the only way they will receive attention from teachers is to misbehave.  Maag suggests that the second time a teacher gives a student a verbal warning, they should also be sure to catch the student behaving appropriately.  Whereas punishment is most effective when delivered consistently, teachers only have to catch students behaving well occasionally to generate desired behaviour modification.

::::'''2) Think Small.'''  Set small goals for students and reinforce incremental strides towards that goal.  For instance, if a student is usually ten minutes late for class, provide positive reinforcement if he is only five minutes late.  Once he begins to make improvements, it is more likely that he will achieve your desired result.

::::'''3) Have a Group Management Plan.'''  Its easier to manage specific students with challenging behaviours when the rest of class is well behaved.  Control the class before focussing on an individual. 

::::'''4) Prevent Behaviour Problems.'''  Establish classroom rules and the positive reinforcement that will follow them.  Dedicate your attention to academically engaging your students, rather than dealing with problems.  Monitor your students behaviours and subtly reinforce them.

::::'''5) Use Peer Influence Favourably.'''   Students realize that the easiest way to get peer attention is to misbehave.  Teachers should find ways to use peer influence to encourage good behaviour.


:I find this last suggestion the least straightforward.  '''Does anyone have any suggestions how we may use peer influence to promote good behaviour? '''

:'''Can anyone provide examples of having used positive and negative reinforcement to their advantage?'''

::* This story is extreme but gives '''a powerful example of positive peer influence'''.  

::: Jacob was withdrawn and pretty low-achieving from an academic standpoint.  His home life was not the best and outside of school he tended to hang with the &quot;wrong&quot; crowd.  At the very end of practicum Jacob was arrested for aggrevated assault when he got into a fight with the owner of a SUBWAY restaurant who had accused Jacob of stealing.  Jacob was transfered to another school, but before he left Vanier my associate teacher sat down and spoke with Jacob about why the fight at the restaurant was maybe not a good idea and why the people he chose to run with weren't necessarily the best choice in friends.  

:::This teacher continuously let Jacob know that he was capable of good things, and that the transfer was a chance for a fresh start with a clean slate, a chance to make better choices and do positive things.  He let him know that from this bad situation, good things could arise.  At the end of this conversation, another student was brought in and asked if he would take Jacob to church with him on Sunday.  The student—who knew Jacob but was not real tight with him—agreed, and was genuinely thrilled at the idea of helping Jacob get back on his feet.  Jacob also seemed convinced that good things were in store for him, and started to make better choices for himself.  

:::This practicum placement was in the ''One World Youth Arts Project'' at George Vanier. My AT regularly made connections like this for his students, usually not on such a large, life-altering scale, but, little connections that did wonders for students' self-image and appreciation for fellow classmates.  

:::The OWYAP setting focuses on musical composition, and lends itself very-readily to these kinds of collaborations, but the power of peer influence in any classroom is a tool we can all use to positively affect to motivate our students. Self-image is a huge issue for adolescents and is often the reason for bad behavior.  Facilitating peer connections that promote positive self awareness will often diminish disruptive behaviour and foster academic success.

::* Here is another example of positive peer influence.  

:::In my practicum, I tried a number of methods to &quot;tame the beasts&quot;.  I tried to make a connection with the students who enjoyed challenging me.    One way that I did this was to try to understand where they were coming from. I also tried to get to know them (i.e. interests etc.) so they wouldn't see me as just another authority figure. Once I became familiar with these specific students, I tried to personalize my lessons.  For instance, in one lesson, I asked the students to mime their favourite thing ''free-time'' activity. This allowed some of the more unruly students to put a bit of themselves into my lesson.  As a result, these &quot;problem&quot; students became engaged with the material, which created a ripple effect throughout the class. In turn, the students who usually followed the bad behavior, began to follow the  good behavior.  In turn, I  acknowledged the good behaviour by thanking them individually for their great work in my class.  As far as I'm concerned, positive peer influence really does promote good behaviour.

::* When contemplating Mark's question, I came across a discovery that may seem cynical, but practical in reference to peer motivation for positive behaviour. My conclusion is that you can't have it. I've read many a chapter on psychology and 'school and society' and have come to the realization that a student's behaviour in the classroom is ever-evolving, and the notion that this can be controlled by a theory or a set of standards is preposterous. 

:::My first notion to reinforce good behaviour was, &quot;why don't I praise a group that is doing an assignment well, therefore enacting positive reinforcement by promoting the good behaviour&quot;. I believed that this would lead to other students to recognize this praise and cause them to strive to do better in hopes of receiving praise themselves. However, I found the opposite reaction occurs. 

:::Under-praised students are repulsed by the praised students for their conforming nature. The symbol of a class &quot;goodie two-shoes&quot; can alienate the rest of the class into a &quot;whatever, I don't really care&quot; attitude. This creates a dangerous learning environment. The teacher loses credibility and any sense of control they may have had. 

:::What's the solution? Generalized reinforcement. The old teacher's college adage of &quot;what's good for some is good for all&quot; applies to our classroom dynamics when dealing with reinforcement. By generalizing your reinforcement, students will not single a student out as the prize student creating less social stigma within the classroom.

:::That being said, I don't believe this will completely solve the situation, but it will help for a more equitable classroom. To conclude, I realize  that you can try to balance your positive and negative reinforcement techniques, but the more balanced you try to make it, the greater the l imbalance amongst students. I realize that my opinion is based on my high school experiences, both as a student and teacher, and, the fact that they are only a few years younger than myself.

::* The power of positive reinforcement shows up in my personal life daily with my fourteen year old daughter in grade nine, especially as it relates to her study habits, and her ability to concentrate on her homework.  She responds well to positive energy. Period. An intermittent reinforcement schedule (page 204) is the most constructive approach to her attitudes towards study, and schoolwork. 

:::During my practicum, I was faced with an unruly, yet talented, grade ten performance vocal class.  By encouraging their individual abilities, their skill set, as well as their ability to work as a group, they quickly developed a focused work ethic during class. This was accompanied by positive energy and overall enthusiasm for musical task at hand. I was fortunately able to &quot;accentuate the positive&quot; (page 208) in order to clearly communicate to the students which behaviour I was reinforcing to promote positive, repeated classroom patterning. The results were tremendous and highly rewarding!  - Christopher Wilson

:::*I agree with Chris. It is vital to highlight students’ individual strengths. 

::::I found that during my practicum students began to respond better to my lessons once I began to develop some sort of relationship with each of them individually. I found walking around the classroom and conversing with them while they were doing seatwork to be a great tool for me in terms of classroom management. Engaging with students during that time allowed me to develop a strong mutual respect between the students and myself. 

::::I remember at the beginning of my practicum I got weighed down by constantly attending to those students who required a lot of personal attention.  They would monopolize class time and time with me, with their never-ending questions. At first I didn’t realize the impact it was having on the class because I was so overwhelmed by the mechanics of teaching a lesson. I was more worried about what I was doing. Then, as I began to feel more comfortable with the class and started to observe the dynamics within the classroom, I started to notice that those students—apart from the four or five extremely extroverted students—had shut down mentally; some even physically! It was then that I realized I had to start becoming more even-handed in my teaching. 

::::After that, I made it a point to say at least one thing to every student every day, especially the introverted students. One student was so astonished, dazed even—not surprizing, because I think I woke him up. He said “I don’t know”.  I said, &quot;ok&quot;, and continued my lesson. Immediately after, he sat up in his chair and began to look on with the person sitting next to him. After awhile I came back to him with another question and he answered it perfectly! Because I made that small gesture of grace towards him, he became engaged.

:::* Something I learned while on practicum to go along with this point, is to always have one ear on the class and one ear with your students.  Being in a drama setting, the class was often divided into groups for group projects and I would circulate and give feedback to groups.  My AT told me to use, what she called, &quot;The Cowboy Method&quot;; this is always keeping your back to a wall when talking with a group so that even though your focus is on a couple individuals, your always facing the entire group.  This allows you to still have some attention on the rest of the class and give the needed attention to individuals.

::::In regards to postive or negative reinforcement, I have always found postive reinforcement to be the most effective, especially when dealing with behavioural students.  When I was volunteering as an Advisor with a program called Junior Achievement, we had one grade 9 student that was continually disruptive and halted the work of the rest of the members.  The lead advisor tried various methods of discipline, until one day I stepped in and took this student into the hall for a one on one discussion. When talking to him, I addressed the areas of his disruptive behaviour that were concerning me and reinforced the great potential I saw in him and asked if he could be my ambassador in the company and use his outgoing and vibrant personality to rally the company to be more productive.  My focus was to highlight his postive qualities and instead of putting him down encourage him to use his skills to the best of his abilities.  I let him know that I believed in him and wanted him to succeed and that the only person he was failing was himself.  This was very effective in managing his behaviour.  I'm not saying that he did not act out again, but when he did I was able to just say &quot;Max, can you focus?&quot; and he would start working towards the task at hand.  Kids never want to fail, but sometimes they lack someone to believe in them, so they stop trying to succeed.  I know this may not work with every student, but I did witness my AT use a similar method in my practicum with one of the more difficult students and it proved effective in that case too.  It is the difference in saying &quot;No, you're bad.&quot; to &quot;You're really good, why are you being bad?&quot;

=== &lt;u&gt;Applied Behaviour Analysis&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 208-214) ===

*This section addresses methods for encouraging existing behaviour, such as praise, the Premack principle, shaping and positive practice. It states that to increase a particular behaviour, we must reinforce it. I was particularly interested in the part about '''reinforcement with teacher attention.''' Many psychologists advise teachers to “accentuate the positive”- to literally praise students for good behaviour.

:I would like the address '''“Using Praise Appropriately”''' (on page 209), it suggests not to single students out for praise because it tends to backfire (because you risk embarrassing the student you have chosen to praise.) During my practicum experience, I was asked by my Associate Teacher to single out students that were doing the assignments as asked/a phenomenal job. Basically, I was asked to hold up a students work (in front of their peers) and to point out what aspects were working well (E.g. For gesture drawing- good use of line, fluid movement etc). I was hesitant to use this technique because some students may be more technically skilled than others and I felt like I was being ask to compare students work rather then assess them on their individual growth and development. In conclusion, some students appeared to like the attention and others were embarrassed. The entire class did in fact work harder, they were extremely focused and their individual drawings improved drastically by viewing the work of their peers. 
:However, after class one of the students that didn’t receive '''public praise''' approached me and said: “I’m sorry Miss that I didn’t do a good job for you”. My heart was absolutely shattered- I suddenly thought: “This is a horrible technique”; I had to reassure the student that she worked hard, did a great job and that I noticed a tremendous amount of growth within the period (which was true). I found that this girl in particular was always seeking my help and looking for affirmation. This sort of demonstrates what the book states: “Psychologists have suggested that teachers’ use of praise tends to focus students on learning to win approval rather than on learning for its own sake”.

:It makes me wonder, the kids worked harder and improved but did they do it to win my approval? I didn’t particular care for the technique of singling out individual students but obviously there was major benefits to having the students examine each others work during the “creation process”. Later during practicum I tried a different method, I began to have students casually take turns walking around the class to examine each other’s work. I found that this approach was extremely affective because no one was depicted as superior to the other. They were able to learn from one another without feeling bad about themselves or embarrassed in front of their peers.

:'''Q: What type of experiences have you all had with praise?'''

*In response to the above question, I believe in the power of praise and agree that it needs to be handled with care, especially when it begins to promote a dependency on the student’s part.  As teachers we are responsible for facilitating the growth and independence of our students and praise is one of the tools we can use to help us facilitate this.  Unfortunately, some institutions do not fully understand the power of praise and rely solely on systems such as token economies to shape behavior.  In some situations this system of earning tokens to be turned in for rewards works, however only for a short time, then it usually becomes meaningless (unless the reward is money that can be accumulate and spend on numerous seductive consumer goods…).  This is where the power of praise comes in.  In reviewing an individual students progress on the token system I observed that they did well for a while until they stopped buying into it, then their behavior took a turn for the worse.  On interviewing the student I discovered that the rewards were meaningless to them, the student viewed the system as “for a one year old”.  When I surveyed the student on what was interesting or meaningful for them they told me that they wanted to earn quality time with their teacher and E.A. as an alternate to items. This student was looking for interaction, opportunities to learn, and feel good about himself, buying trinkets from the treasure box at the end of the week just didn’t cut it for him.  I mentioned that praise is one of the tools we can use to develop growth in our students, the above example shows not only how ineffective a reward system can be if you do not know what motivates the individual but also the value of consciously adding praise to such a program.  As the parent of this individual student I was proud to see that human interaction was my sons main motivator.
:I have worked in situations where the staff working with extremely behavioral individuals wore buzzers that went off every five minutes, for example, to remind the staff to praise that individual.  It is my understanding that it is best to praise for the correct behavior in ABA.  However, their is another element to this whole behavior modification phenomenon, one that is often overlooked in the sciences, a human element being that in this example the staff were required to interact with those individuals in a positive way.  They were all on a program where they were responsible for filling their clients emotional tanks on the basis that this would have a positive effect on their overall behavior.  Pretty simple!

*I find the amount of consideration and intentionality with which we need to oversee our classrooms incredible. Many times now we have all heard that more than half of the emotional battle for teachers is classroom management, and such skills are valued highly by employers.

:In addition to the above, I want to mention that the praise guidelines on p.208 make a lot of sense. Specifically, praise needs to be given appropriately--not sporadically. To add to this, I would assert that there also needs to be consideration for individual student personalities. For example, in my years of piano teaching I have noticed that while all students require at least some amount of praise, there are some students (usually those who are especially gifted) for whom there sometimes comes a point when praise can actually become detrimental. Such kids are typically praised by their parents and circle of peers 24/7 and have completely lost their sense of humility within their area of giftedness--an effect I have seen as the catalyst to the complete atrophy of a students' motivation and ability to function independently.

:This dangerous consequence of indiscriminate praise is also known as '''performance addiction'''--a state in which students' self-esteem is linked to the tone of feedback they receive from those in positions of authority over them. Those of us who followed the music path (and also those who didn't, I am sure), know full well the danger of this mindset, and many of us (including myself) have had to break free of it in order to gain an independent, healthy self-motivation with which to fuel our development as artists (or still have yet to break free of it!) 

:Of course, when it comes to teaching teenagers the arts--people whose identities are still very liminal--we can only praise and hope to encourage them into the kind of rigorous pursuit that one day might enable them to transcend that issue. Ahhhh the joy of music for its own sake!!! I think that only in that place have we truly reached freedom, and the fullest expression of our artistry.

*Like many others, I have difficulty with the concept of a '''token reinforcement''' system, as I worry about the fact that many students will place emphasis on the reward and not the task itself.  One possible solution to this problem was mentioned briefly in the text book on page 210, “The best way to determine appropriate reinforcers for your students may be to watch what they do in their free time.”  This seems almost deceptively simple and, depending the approach, does have the potential to degenerate into a simple material reward system. However, it holds great promise because it provides the teacher with the opportunity to “reward” students with classroom-based, learning focused activities. 
:This idea works very well with the '''Premack principle''', wherein low-frequency behaviours must precede those of high-frequency.  As a gymnastics coach, this is something I use fairly frequently. There are some skills (or even apparatuses) on which my students are hesitant to work – for a number of reasons, and others that my students favour and consistently request. I often let my students know that while we will begin with one of the less-preferred activities, once this has been accomplished we can move on to some of their favourite things to do. I find this strategy extremely effective and students seem to respond fairly positively – if only because the “end is in sight”.  The thing I most appreciate about this approach is the fact that it demonstrates recognition of the students needs and desires on the part of the teacher.  I know that, though they may be unhappy with the order in which I have assigned the tasks, my students appreciate the fact that I am aware of and acknowledge their preferences.  

:Additionally, if the teacher is able to observe the students preferences – without his/her students articulating them at all – students may also, though likely not consciously, be appreciative of the fact that the teacher knows and understands them as individuals.  Furthermore, students may also enjoy having input and control over their own learning.

* At the risk of sounding repetitive, I agree with a lot of what's been said here, including the principles for Using Praise Appropriately.  In general, I believe praise, appropriately used, is a great way to build a positive self-image and positive experience in general for students.  Yet, I'd like to echo Jonathan's point about praise sometimes being detrimental to certain students, and add to it that sometimes while it's not detrimental, it doesn't seem to make a difference.  I'm thinking of my practicum when I would praise certain a high-achieving student and she seemed rather indifferent to it.  I kind of got the impression that she received a lot of praise and that although she wasn't being smug or anything about it, it seemed like it didn't make that much of a difference to her.
:I think ultimately, you just have to know how to give praise to certain students--some students will thrive with even a minimal amount, while other students don't even seem to notice it (I should stress that &quot;seem&quot; is key here--I'm not suggesting you stop giving praise to these students).  As another example, there was another student--a student my AT had mentioned to me as having a few academic/engagement issues--who I gave some praise to early on and I found that I had no problems at all with her.  I should mention the context of the praise: I was distributing a handout in the middle of a class when I noticed that all the &quot;writing&quot; she'd been doing was actually an illustration that had nothing to do with my lesson.  When I saw it, I instantly told her how cool I thought it was; when she looked up, she seemed pleasantly surprised and said &quot;thanks.&quot;  I asked her about the drawing after class and spoke with her briefly about her drawing skills and that type of thing.  At the end of the conversation, I politley mentioned that as cool as it was, I'd still like her to at least TRY to pay attention to the lessons.  She smiled and said &quot;ok,&quot; and I never had any problems with her after that.  I think there were two things going on here: 1) I opened up our relationship with praise (my comment about her illustration was the first thing I'd ever said to her).  By simply praising her genuinely (I truly was impressed by the drawing) and unconditionally (I made no mention of the fact that she shouldn't be ignoring the lesson or whatever) I think I created a positive space for us, so that when it came time to discuss that she needed to pay attention to the lessons, there was little resistance; and 2) I think there was some of what Ayanda mentioned above about taking an interest in their lives outside the classroom (or at least the course content).
:I also use the Premack Principle in structuring my private music lessons: I almost always do the &quot;not-so-fun&quot; stuff first, and finish with the &quot;fun&quot; stuff.  I find that when if I finish with something &quot;dry&quot; like some kind of intense theory stuff, or something really difficult (learning bar chords for beginner students) the students become quite disengaged.  Eventually I took this a step further and began telling the students the format of the lesson at the outset and this helped--once they knew that whatever difficult task was over, they could enjoy or sail through the rest of the lesson.

*The notion of '''shaping''' (or '''successive approximations''') struck me as particularly relevant to students of the arts.  Woolfolk et al describe shaping as a method of reinforcing progress through the successful attainment of smaller goals in order to achieve some larger goal (211).  Student scan often become frustrated because they do not receive any reinforcement from their efforts because the end goal is not yet within reach.  

:'''Task analysis''' (the system of breaking down skill hierarchically into sub-skills) would seem to be particularly relevant in artistic areas that are governed by the reproduction/creation of repertoire and specific techniques.  My experience as a music student and teacher has shown me the benefits of using shaping as a strategy to employ positive reinforcement.  Perhaps because music practice is readily dissectable across a multitude of planes (temporally, vertically through pitch/harmony, spatially through a performer’s location in the ensemble), it seems to yield itself intuitively to an array of shaping strategies.  Musicians are often isolating smaller sections of a piece, or groups of instruments within a larger band, in order to master an isolated element of a piece before moving on to its larger elements.   

:More difficult are the individual problems that occur with students that do not yield themselves as obviously to task analysis.  Let’s take ear training as an example.  How do you help the student who is having trouble identifying or singing various intervals?  Or perhaps a student might be having trouble with a rhythmic passage because their counting gets mixed up.  In some cases, the overall goal does not necessarily yield itself to hierarchical sub-division.  What then?  In music, we often call on additional types of exercises that isolate and strengthen a skill.  For example, if you having trouble singing a major 6th, try ‘hearing’ a perfect 5th first, and then moving up a tone to the major 6th.  After some practice, one eventually begins to hear the 6th without having to go the 5th first.  

:I don’t think this is necessarily at odds with what is being suggested by task analysis.  It would be a misnomer to equate task analysis directly with ‘chunking.’  Often the identification of the sub-skills entails understanding the skill set in a more abstract manner.

=== &lt;u&gt;Behavioural Approaches to Teaching and Management&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 214-219) ===

*The section offers a variety of methods for encouraging good behaviour, aimed at controlling and changing behaviour by offering a reward of some sort. Two methods with which I have come into contact are the '''group consequences''' and the '''token reinforcement''' program. First, I volunteered in a math classroom where the teacher was attempting to curb lateness by offering 5 bonus marks if all students were in class on time for the term. Any student who came to class late resulted in a half-mark being deducted for the entire class. Though this program seemed to motivate students to arrive in class ontime, often students who were always on time were made to lose marks because of their punctuality challenged peers. Naturally, this frustrated students who made greater effort to follow the rules. As well, some students, fearing the annoyance of their classmates did not bother coming to class at all if they were running late. This is an example of Woolfolk et al.'s warning that group consequences should not be used when students do not have influence of the group. Perhaps this idea could be tweaked slightly, so that each student was responsible for their own bonus marks, which would only be deducted if they were late. This way students who used the bonus marks as extrinsic motivation would continue to be motivated to be on time, even when their peers were late. 

:I introduced a form of the '''token reinforcement''' while running a reading program last year. I learned that the children in the program were often extremely reluctant to read and that their behaviour was difficult to control. In hopes of rewarding the behaviour of those who read more, I set up a program so every student who read 5 books got a small prize. If they got to 10 or 15 books they got a bigger prize. This definately motivated them to read, however, I soon discovered that students were often choosing short books below their reading level or adding false entries to their log sheets to get prizes.  After having read this section of the book, I realized my experience was a very good example of this type of system's strengths and weaknesses. First, since the group I was working with was difficult to control, unmotivated and were not making progress in school the token system gave them a reason to change their behaviour and set reading goals. Secondly, after a few months, and far too many prizes, I recognized that I needed to offer the rewards less frequently, so I required students to read more books before receiving any prizes. (I wish I had read that sooner!) Though this system worked for me, it would not work in every situation.

* I have always been hesitant of using obvious forms of reward or punishment with my students because I worry that it could inhibit the development of intrinsic motivation by taking the students attention away from the importance of the task itself.  I find the approach that works best is to assume that all students want to do well and find ways to help them do that.  This involves what our text refers to as cueing, prompting, applied behaviour analysis and praise (206-8).  Firstly, the teacher needs to clearly set up the expectations and then using cueing (and prompting and feedback) to assist students in developing an understanding of how to implement the expectations.  In my mind, feedback is the essential aspect of applied behaviour analysis or any learning goal for that matter.  Students need to have a clear idea of what they are doing right and how they can improve.  Providing students will clear feedback gives them the impression that you care about their success and that whatever criticism you give them is for their benefit and whatever praise you give them is genuine. 
 
:I think that in most cases it is better to avoid obvious positive or negative reinforcements with secondary students.   If you set things up so that you are helping them to achieve the high level of learning (which they will likely see in terms of the highest possible mark), they already have a reward to work toward.  Even in situations where students are having behavioural issues, I think encouraging students to develop metacognitive skills by having them reflect on their behaviour and giving them feedback is more effective.  For example, if a student is often late to class, assume they would rather be on time.  Talk to them about what cause them to be late, have them write ways to avoid this, and then give them encouraging feedback on their plan.  I use a considerable amount of praise in my teacher because I think it is more useful for students to start from what they are doing right and work toward improvement.  I do agree however, that there are risks with overusing praise and I think the Guidelines for Using Praise Appropriate in the text are useful (15).  Teachers need to be careful that students do not get the impression that the teacher is just “being nice.” Giving empty praise could undermine the encouragement you have given students in previous experiences.

=== &lt;u&gt;Recent Approaches: Self-Regulation and Cognitive Behaviour Modification&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 219-224) ===


*As I see it, the central problem with the behavioural approach to learning is one of oversimplification. In its understanding of pedagogical dynamics, teacher and learner are reduced to the roles of controller and controlled, with learning and the pursuit of knowledge a secondary concern. Chomsky has critiqued Skinner as a reductive empiricist because his theoretical framework is limited to &quot;observables.&quot; In other words, he ignores the complex inner processes of the the human psyche, instead reducing them to their lowest common denominator -- that which can be addressed (figuratively speaking) by a pat on the head or a slap on the wrist. 

:This section of the book would seem to validate the above critique. Its point that &quot;students taught with classic behavioral methods seldom generalized their learning to new situations&quot;(218) is highly relevant, especially in today's classroom where the notion of transferable skills and lifelong learning are becoming more and more pertinent. Clearly we must do more than encourage students to exhibit &quot;good&quot; behavior through a system of rewards and punishments. Students need to learn how to manage their own behavior. What interests me about the &quot;cognitive behavior modification&quot; approach is its potential ability to give students the tools by which they can adjust and improve their behavior, and through this their academic performance. This is done through a partnership model, so both teacher and student are in a position of control. And, as we learned in Chapter 10, when students feel that they are in control they are more likely to be motivated to succeed.

:Unfortunately, the text doesn't give many concrete examples of this in action in a secondary school context, and I have had no first hand exposure to it as a methodology in the classroom (although it's pretty amazing to watch my 5-year old &quot;self-talk&quot; himself out of an emotional melt-down.) I can envision integrating various goal-setting mechanisms into a future classroom, as well as guiding students individually or as a class to self-generate various checklists. Any other ideas? Has anyone seen &quot;cognitive behavior modification&quot; in action?

:--[[User:Tearney|Tearney]] ([[User talk:Tearney|talk]]) 22:08, 28 January 2008 (UTC)


The idea of cognitive behaviour modification is very intriguing, especially since it allows the student to actively monitor or coach their behaviour by themselves.  I can imagine a teacher using this strategy when it comes to independent lessons, and self-instruction can be encouraged in the way that lessons or assignments are delivered.  They work especially well when creating rubrics that are formulated as questions.  For example, you can create a checklist as part of the rubric or lesson; here are some sample questions: “Is my spelling and grammar correct?”, “Have I re-read this assignment?”, “Does my argument hold up against opposing viewpoints?”, etc.  Having the students ask themselves these types of questions on their own helps them put themselves in the teacher mindset during the process of an assignment or lesson.

'''The Difficulty of knowing WHEN to use Punishments'''

*I have a strong belief that one of the hardest things to deal with as a teacher regardless of how many years experience you have is the choices you have to make in regards to punishment. Page 215 of the Educational Psychology textbook illustrates the complexity of the use of punishment within the classroom.  It illustrates how complicated the understanding and use of punishments are.  What was interesting to me was how many things a teacher can do to avoid punishing a student by provide the student with options.  Many of these things are things we learn about when dealing with children of any age but for me I never really think about it when I am doing it.  When I am dealing with a student and they are doing something that I do not really like I usually provide that student with options in order to avoid &quot;punishment.&quot;  According to the textbook I now know that what I am doing is called negative reinforcement.  When the student does not accept one of the options provided and I need to enforce some form of punishment, the hardest things that I find I have to deal with is keeping with the punishment and not being persuaded to change the punishment.  Maybe I am being stereotypic by saying that perhaps what I am doing in terms of not sticking to the punishment is something a lot of women teachers tend to do.  One thing I have learned this year is how to evaluate a situation and when to step in.  As we have always heard, when a situations comes up in our classroom we have to think to our selves &quot;does this behaviour disrupt the other students ability to learn or does it prevent me from teaching.&quot;  I think this is really key but so hard to learn because every situation we are presented with is different and as a result the reaction you have to the situation will be different.  For me even though I do think about the misbehaviour and how it affects the students or my ability to teach I still find it really hard to determine the response to the infraction. 

:--[[User:Naddles|Naddles]] ([[User talk:Naddles|talk]]) 23:36, 28 January 2008 (UTC)

*I agree with the above comment that dealing with punishment is one the hardest things for a teacher.  I find that teachers, especially beginning teachers or teachers that are beginning to burn out, have difficulty in knowing if they are inadvertantly reinforcing the misbehaviour and also with maintaining the consistency. This will especially become the case during very stressful times of the year when both the teacher and the students become very busy with school assignments and activities. When I was a kindergarten teacher at a very small private school, I noticed a real lack of consistency in punishment between the different teachers at the school and also a lack of follow through with threatened punishments. The teachers spent most of the time threatened the students rather than teaching because the students knew that the threats were empty and continued to misbehave. As a result, the teachers at the school were becoming very tired and stressed and making escalated the nature of their threats in an attempt to scare the students. A colleague and I attempted to implement a new school wide system of punishment that all teachers were required to follow. This system meant that all classes faced the same punishments and rewards for the same behaviours in every class with every teacher. It was an uphill battle, for the students did not like that the punishments were actually being issued and became worse in their behaviour for a period of time, but evetually the students began to change their behaviour and in the end became more happy and productive. There were teachers that wished to quit the new system during the beginning stages due to the escalation of bad behaviour, but after sticking with it they did see the improvement in the students. This just shows that punishment must be thought about and planned prior to beginning a class and not something to dole out randomly as the class progresses.

=== &lt;u&gt;Problems and Issues&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 224-229) ===
'''&quot;What do you think about using rewards and punishments in teaching?&quot;''' (pg.225)

* I had some concerns regarding the overuse of rewards in the classroom.  We hear quite a lot about not being overly critical of students so as not to damage their fragile sense of self.  While I think this has merit, I also think that students will quickly see the diminishing value of reward or praise that is handed out too frequently.  It is often the case, especially in the arts, where students would rather hear an honest opinion about their work rather than empty praise that does not help them learn or improve in the least.  Woolfolk, Winne and Perry substantiate my concerns by stating, &quot;some psychologists fear that rewarding students for all learning will cause them to lose interest in learning for its own sake.  Studies have suggested that using reward programs with students who are already interested in the subject matter may, in fact, cause students to be less interested int the subject when the reward program ends...&quot; (pg. 221, 1st Ed.).

*1. Rewards can be used to celebrate student achievement or to motivate students to aim for higher goals. However, it is problematic when the reward becomes the purpose of learning.

:Few years ago, I got a beginner Grade 1 boy as a private piano student. The boy was pushed by his mother to learn piano, and I had to find some way to engage him into music. Then I started to use sticker as reward - giving one sticker after completing one piece. Giving sticker seemed like a successful attempt at the first few weeks. After a month, I realized that the boy was spending more time on choosing sticker from my sticker book rather than playing piano. He wanted to play piece through once and move onto another piece in order to get more sticker when there were much more music elements that had to be polished in the piece.

:2. Teachers must be careful about what to use as rewards.
:The example of exempting students from homework as a reward (pg. 225) is a bad example of choosing the right rewards. By making homework exemption as a reward, the teacher implies that homework is a punishment rather than a learning practice. A teacher must consider the implication of the reward before presenting it to the class.

:3. Punishment should be used carefully. 
:Classroom should be an enjoyable place with quality learning experiences for the students. Therefore, a teacher must be aware of the negative emotional reactions that punishment might bring. The teacher should start from positive approaches to more complicated procedures (pg. 227). Firm punishment should be used only in the situation with the issues that cannot be tolerated.

:4. Give constructive feedback to students.
:I totally agree with Eli's idea of giving 'an honest opinion about student work rather than empty praise'. If reward encourages certain behaviours and punishment suppresses, constructive feedback should be used effectively to guide students into the right direction which helps them to higher achievement.

The use of rewards in any teaching strategy often has a tricky catch to it at the end of the day.  The ultimate reward one would assume a teacher hopes to inspire in his or her students is that of knowing one’s stuff and being able to use the information wisely. It may sound redundant, but usually the only reward students are looking for in a secondary situation is the marks and the break.  No matter what kind of other incentive the students are given (i.e. free resin for your violin, gift certificates, food, paint brushes, tickets, etc.), if the marks don’t follow up, your reward will seem like a gimmick and will fall flat if attempted again.  As a teacher who likely will enjoy the material he or she is teaching, especially since we have our respective teachable subjects in the secondary program, there will likely be no need for any reward other than the student’s success at completing the task.  Only as an act of desperation to try and hook the students to do an assignment would rewards help.  The students will likely see this, however, and will get the impression that the lesson itself is not good enough to stand on its own.  At the end of the day, perhaps rewards work as unexpected perks, but should not carry the lesson.


*Rewards and punishments come in all shapes and sizes.  As a teacher it isn't our job to decide whether or not we need to give rewards or punishments, but mearly when and how we should do it.  In my opinion a reward can be broken down to positive reinforcement.  A positive response to a positive behaviour is the basic idea of a reward.  On the other hand, a punishment is the exact opposite.  A negative behavior should be met with negative reinforment, or in other words a clear response to that behavior, that pin points it as being unacceptable.  The decision lies in the &quot;size and shape&quot; of the reward or punishment.

:The simplest reward in education is a good mark for the effort of studying and applying that knowledge to a test or assignment.  Is this enough?  If the expectation is that the students should be doing this then that should be reward enough to motivate the students to continue that behavior.  The difficulty presents itself when a student exceeds expectations.  In this case it is questionable whether or not a reward will be necessary for that behavior to continue.  It seems to follow that it will lead to future expectations being exceeded if this type of behavior is reinforced in a positive way.  

:The reason I think this topic is vital in today's classrooms is because of the ever increasing move towards the need for youth to have immediate gratification.  It isn't enough to have a reward, it needs to be given right away.  That is why connections to future rewards should be an emphasis on a consistent basis.  As with the example of a student that exceeds expectations they will most probably be rewarded in the future with a better job, a schlarship, etc.  Rewards and punishiments therefore need not be something physical and immediate, but instead can be in the form of a reminder that rewards come with hard work and patients.  

:In the case of punishment the same idea can be applied.  If a student can be taught to appreciate what will happen if a negative behavior continues they will actually be pushed in the direction of positive behavior.  It becomes a case of knowing the consequences and being able to understand how those consequences will come about.  Anti-smoking advertising is a great example of this.  These types of commercials focus on what will happen if the behaviour continues and have been known to be effective, even though in the short run it is extremely difficult to quit smoking.

:It is important to remember that a reward or punishment need not be big, extravegant, or extreme.  A positive word and a smile can go along way.  In turn, a frown and a word of disappointment can have a lasting effect as well.

:I think that conditioning comes into play in classrooms in many different ways. In both of my practica, the teachers had different cues that they used to maintain their classroom management. One of my ATs kept the classroom set up almost like a stage, which gave him physical prominence in the classroom, and gave the students the impression that they were there to observe him. 

:My other AT showed me his conditioning of his students that they were trained to recognize signals when he wanted attention. He uses several cues that clearly re-enforce his position of authority in the classroom, but don’t CLEARLY say “hey students, I’m the boss here.” When he wanted the students’ attention, he would stop talking. By not overusing this technique, and only using it when he was telling them important information, the students realized that it was a cue that he was telling them something important and they needed to listen. Also, to get students’ attention, he would clap his hands in a rhythm, which the students would echo. There are a lot of benefits to this method of conditioning – it illustrates a hierarchy to students without having to spend time dictating it. It’s a little sneaky, but perfectly effective, I’d say. 

: And it was interesting in both practica, coming into a class where they had been conditioned to certain behaviours as signals for “please listen.” Both times, I realized very quickly that it was important for me to work within the conditioning of the students that I’d been given, especially because it’d been built up for a long time before I started teaching at the school, and it’s hard to break conditioning like that. When I tried to do a drama activity with the English class, I had them move their desks the clear a space for the activity, and naturally,  after that, chaos held sway. I wonder how much of that came from breaking their classroom conditioning?

Dear classmates: The editors this week would like to supply the class with summaries from each section of the chapter, as was done in the first week. We decided this in hopes of encouraging content discussion between members of the class, while keeping our (the editors') weekly contribution to the presentation of theoretical materials and subsequent discussion moderation. We have divided the chapter into sections and assigned each editor a part of the reading.

*Note: Since there are various editions of textbooks circulating throughout the class, page numbers may vary. Refer to subject headings when page number don't match.
*Note: The above paragraph is provisionary and shall be removed at the end of the week. Thanks! ~ The editors.

=== &lt;u&gt;Teachers' Casebook: What Would You Do?&lt;/u&gt; (pp.233) ===

In this week's case, a group of students in a senior history class has become reliant on memorization as the sole method of learning in a class. Their information farming leaves them with isolated strands of knowledge, unable to synthesize their learnings into a broader context of understanding. The questions the text poses in regard to this scenario are:

* What do these students &quot;know&quot; about history? What are their beliefs and expectations, and how do these affect their learning?
* Why do you think they insist on using the rote memory approach?
* How would you teach your students to learn in this new way?
* How will these issues affect the grade levels you teach?

--[[User:JonathanisFTMFW|JonathanisFTMFW]] ([[User talk:JonathanisFTMFW|talk]]) 23:51, 31 January 2008 (UTC)8&lt;u&gt;'''Discussion'''&lt;/u&gt;

The cognitive approach to learning offers many tried and true tactics to processing, storing, and retrieving knowledge.  In a lot of ways reading this chapter has been like a review of how I have been taught to approach teaching here at OISE.  P. 255(Woolfolk): “Using Information Processing Ideas in the Classroom”, and p.263- Fig. 7.3 (Woolfolk): “Gagne’s Phases of Learning and the Instructional Events That Support Learning at Each Phase”, are excellent summaries of how to approach a lesson.  What seems to be emphasized here is making connections meaningful.  So what would I do if my history students where hooked on the textbook?  First I would reevaluate the way they were being evaluated.  Students are generally motivated to do well on the test, even if it means memorizing the glossary to be prepared for the multiple choice questions. The sad but true part is that students have been trained to be rote learners.  In University I had an Italian Renaissance Art History professor whom had lived in Italy for 15 years. He knew so much about the architecture and art that every week, through the modern phenomena of armchair travel; he took us to Italy with his beautiful slides and colourful commentary, lights out, our pens and paper away.  This approach was such a welcome break from the mad hurried synthesis of lecture after lecture…we were on tour and although he did not encourage note taking I retained more in that class than some others.  Why?  Follow the check list: 1.He had my attention; it was beautiful, like being in a theatre, large screen, great slides, comfortable seats…2.I didn’t take notes; this action did not signal to me that nothing was important, it told me that it was all important and that I would learn it better if I just focused on the slide show and his commentary.  3. He used those seductive details, interesting stories, to make connections to what I already knew and to help me remember what would be relevant to a test or assignment.  4. What a great way to review a chapter, go on vacation!  5. The slide shows were presented in a clear and organized way, it was an open form, we could comment, ask questions, be human, it was authentic and relevant to what we were learning, the goals were clear.  6. In this teaching example it is apparent that the focus is on meaning, not memorization, a lesson that would make some students twitch, but when it comes around to the test and the questions are more open ended, not the kind you feed into a machine to mark, I’m sure the experience would have a happy ending.*--[[User:Lisa chupa|Lisa chupa]] ([[User talk:Lisa chupa|talk]]) 03:13, 7 February 2008 (UTC)

Many teachers often use the rote approach because it was the way they were taught or because it many ways, it seems the easiest option.  Lecturing names and dates and then forcing students to memorize them for tests will only give students short term knowledge of the content.  Like most students, they will immediately forget the memorized information as soon as the test is finished maybe remembering only some of the seductive details.  Fortunately, like mentioned above, schools like OISE are trying to educate future teachers on how to use the cognitive approach.  The cognitive approach includes meaningful activities that create skills while students are learning about a topic.  This approach requires much more student engagement and until the teacher is confident, much more effort from the teacher in terms of planning, preparation and marking.  It is sometimes also difficult for an educator to think of activities that can engage students and teach the content.  Students might also have trouble with this approach in the beginning stages, especially if they have never done anything like this before and have been trained, and are good at, rote memorization.--[[User:Ali.dormady|Ali.dormady]] ([[User talk:Ali.dormady|talk]]) 12:40, 15 April 2008 (UTC)

=== &lt;u&gt;Elements of the Cognitive Perspective&lt;/u&gt; (pp.234-237) ===

Discussions of the nature of knowledge, reason and the mind have dated back to the earliest Greek philosophers.  Cognitive studies fell out of vogue from the late 1800s until the late 20th century, when “behaviourism” became a more popular concept of learning.  Since then, evidence has accumulated indicating that people do more than simply respond to reinforcement and punishment, and that learning also involves active mental processes (p 234).

The '''cognitive view of learning''' assumes that mental processes exist, that they can be measured and studied, and that people are active participants in learning.(p 234) “The cognitive view sees people as active learners who initiate experiences, seek out information to solve problems, and reorganize what they already know to achieve new insights”(p 235).


&lt;u&gt;'''Comparing Cognitive and Behavioural Views'''&lt;/u&gt;

Behavioural View: a behaviour is adopted unconsciously.  Reinforcement strengthens responses.

Cognitive View: Knowledge is learned, and advances in understanding encourage us to modify our behaviour.  Learning is an active process, which requires participants to reinterpret their experiences and gathered knowledge to achieve new insight.  In contrast to the behavioural view, reinforcement is recognized as a source of feedback which lends credence to an initial theory.

Whereas behavioural researchers try to identify general laws of learning which apply to all intelligent organisms, cognitive psychologists study human learning, with all its variables.


&lt;u&gt;'''The Importance of Knowledge in Learning'''&lt;/u&gt;

Cognitive psychology places primary importance on the acquisition of knowledge, which forms a “scaffold that supports the construction of all future learning” and determines what learners will perceive, remember and forget in future experiences (p 235).

A strong basis in a field of knowledge may prove more important to cognition than sound learning strategies.  For example, when presented with an article on baseball, unskilled readers with a background in the sport may have an advantage over skilled readers who know little about it.


'''Types of Knowledge:'''
*'''General:''' This type of knowledge is generic in nature, such as reading or writing--skills and information that apply in many different situations.

*'''Specific:''' This kind refers to isolated facts such as knowing that shortstop plays between second and third base.

*'''Declarative:''' Declarative knowledge means information that can be communicated verbally, such as concrete facts.

*'''Procedural:''' This means having the ability to act in a certain, knowledgeable way, such as translating knowledge, or posting to this wikibook.

*'''Conditional:''' This type of knowledge refers to the ability to know when to use other types of knowledge, such as a doctor who diagnoses a specific treatment for a patient.

&lt;u&gt;'''Discussion'''&lt;/u&gt;

*It seems that in education, there had previously been a focus on only certain types of knowledge. Educators would focus on teaching &quot;Specific&quot; or &quot;Declarative&quot; knowledge that would only give their students the necessary information to perform well on an exam or test. Some teachers would argue that this is necessary to prepare the students for university and the real world of academia. However, while most universities still focus on those types of knowledge and many university students are forced to memorize the exact teachings of the professor and regurgitate it back to them via an exam or paper, only 25% of students actually attend university after graduating high school. The rest will chose apprenticeship, college or the work force. Should teachers be teaching to prepare %25 of students while leaving the other 75% with specific details that are both uninteresting and useless to them? It is only in the past few years, especially in elementary and secondary schools, that there has been a real push toward more &quot;Conditional&quot; knowledge and the ability to apply knowledge and skills learned in the classroom. There is now a desire to reach all students, no matter what their post-secondary destination, and give them knowledge that that they can take and apply to their own lives.

=== &lt;u&gt;The Information Processing Model of Memory (pp.237-245)&lt;/u&gt; ===

The most common theory of memory is '''information processing''' defined as &quot;the human mind's activity of taking in, storing, and using information&quot; (p. 237).

&lt;u&gt;An Overview of the Information Processing Model&lt;/u&gt;

This process involves: (computer model)

*Encoding: Gathering and Representing information.

*Storage: Holding information.

*Retrieval: Accessing information.

*Control Processes: How and When information flows through each part of the system.


'''Sensory memory''' is the system that processes and transforms incoming stimuli (sights, sounds, smells) received by our receptors (&quot;mechanisms for seeing, hearing. tasting, smelling and feeling&quot; p. 238). Sensory memory is very large in capacity and very brief in duration. &quot;The content of sensory memory resembles the sensations from the original stimulus&quot; (p. 238). Various sensations are ''coded'' so the information remains intact and can be processed using '''perception''' and '''attention'''.


* It is said that smell is the sense most strongly tied to memory, and yet in schools we rely much more heavily on sight (textbooks, chalkboard) and sound (teacher’s voice).  Is there a way we can use smell to help our students learn and remember important details?  In my experience a smell can immediately bring to mind a location or person, and I wonder if smell can be used as a study aid.  To answer this question, I had to go beyond our textbook.      


:It seems that not a lot of research has been done in this area, but there is some material to be found.  Trygg Engen has written a book called ‘Odor Sensation and Memory’, which purports that our scent memories are largely psychological – i.e. we will associate a smell with either negative or positive emotions, depending on the situation in which we first encountered the smell.  I can see how this could be troublesome if smells were to be used as study aids.  For example, if a student were to be surrounded by the smell of cinnamon while studying for a math exam, she might forever after associate cinnamon with test anxiety, as opposed to something more pleasant, like home cooking.  


:Another interesting source of information is the article: ‘Study Uncovers Memory Aid: A Scent During Sleep’ by Benedict Carey in the March 9, 2007 edition of The New York Times.  http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/science/09sleep.html  This article talks about a study in which students were exposed to the scent of roses while playing a concentration game.  They were then exposed to the same scent during sleep.  The next day the students scored an average of 97% on the game (compared to 86% without the scent).  


:All of this raises many questions:

: - Is this just a bunch of ridiculous speculation?
: - If not, is using scent as a memory aid a form of cheating?
: - What are the potential benefits and side-effects?
: - How can we, as teachers, practically apply the use of scent as a memory aid in the classroom?


--[[User:Littlelaura|Littlelaura]] ([[User talk:Littlelaura|talk]]) 01:55, 5 February 2008 (UTC)

The use of multiple sensory stimulation is an intriguing possibility to use in a classroom, however it is hard to figure out how to use it effectively.  There is a lot of research that supports the link between memory and smell, especially when it produces an emotional response.  The smell of oranges, for example,  according to some reminds one of childhood memories.  Using smell in this respect could be useful in the following situations: the teacher wants to make the experience of the class memorable so that the theme, information, and the experience stick in their consciousness; or, the smell of a certain object/experience becomes connected with a particular lesson or subject.  For example, the smell of some poisonous gases have a nice aroma to it, and the scents could be incorporated into a lesson on WWII or the Vietnam War (this article from Slate magazine describes some of the scents [http://www.slate.com/id/2148198] ).  One can also bring in some type of food to associate with an experience in history, like super-saccharine sweet cake during a lesson on Absolutism.  For a Visual Art class, one could put a fragrance of something next to a piece of art and students can interpret; say, a Toulouse-Lautrec painting and the smell of Wormwood or Absinthe, or the smell of Bulgarian Roses next to a Renaissance sculpture, or the smell of ketchup or cotton candy next to an Oldenburg or Koons piece.   For a Drama class, maybe have students practice reactions according to taste that is the opposite of what they're actually tasting.  For an English class, maybe link a scent to a particular chapter/section of a novel, essay, or poem; near the end of Hamlet, for example, infuse the class with a subtle scent of Rosemary (&quot;for remembrance&quot;, scene 5).  There are tons of options, but at the same time, whether it will work is really unknown.  Also, some students may be sensitive to food/scent in class, and you may have to watch out for any allergies.  Overall, though, there is no harm in trying.

'''Perception''' is defined as the &quot;interpretation of sensory information&quot;. Theories of perception processing include:

*Gestalt: A pattern or whole; people organize perceptions into coherent wholes.

*Bottom-up processing: (''feature analysis'') Perception  based on noticing separate defining features and assembling them into a recognizable pattern.

*Top-down processing: Perceiving based on the context and the patterns you expect to occur in that situation.

Knowledge in perception is therefore processed from sensory memory, to working memory, to long-term memory, to be later retrieved and directed attentively.


'''Which above theory of perception or combination therein, is most effective for a student to perceive information?  What would be an example illustrating application of the three various theories?'''


*Gestalt psychology is the study of our “tendency to organise sensory information on patterns or relationships” (Woolfolk,  p. 239).   This branch of psychology has obvious relationships to the visual arts, it has also been used extensively in the field of psychoacoustics (an area of scholarship concerned with the physiological and physiological manners in which we perceive and organise sounds).   

:Gestalt organising principles such as those illustrated in Figure 7.2 (Woolfolk, p. 239) may be applied to the auditory realm:  

::*Figure-Ground = Melody-Accompaniment
::*Proximity = Phrasing
::*Similarity = Theme &amp; Variation
::*Closure = Perception of Pitch and Harmony

:Interesting things can happen when one chooses to base creative exercises in music (through composition and improvisation) that manipulate and play with these principles.  How much does a theme have to be manipulated before it is no longer recognised as a variation?  How can we blur the dividing perceptual line between melody and accompaniment?  How close do sound events need to occur in time for them to be grouped into a gestalt?  

:Composers such as James Tenney have spent much of their careers exploring these areas with fascinating outcomes.  Similar explorations were often the foundation of many improvisational exercises in my undergrad improvisation courses.  One of the benefits of such endeavours is that they focus a student’s active listening skills, providing an engaging alternative to traditional ear training exercises.

'''Attention''' is defined as the &quot;focus on stimuli&quot;. To process effectively, certain stimuli are focused upon while others are ignored guided by previous knowledge and knowledge needed to be acquired. Processes &quot;that initially require attention and concentration become automatic with practice&quot; (p. 240). Research describes four aspects of attention in developing children:

*Controlled: Young children develop longer attention spans and ability to focus on important details.

*Tailored to task: Older children focus attention on most difficult material being learned.

*Directive: Children develop a feel for cues telling them when/how to direct their attention.

*Self-monitoring: Children learn to decide if they are using the right strategy and to change it if it's not working.


Attention plays a powerful role in teaching in terms of a student's attentiveness to the learning at hand. A student is incapable of processing if they do not first &quot;recognize or perceive&quot; (p. 240). Appealing to a student's senses is a practical means of gaining initial attention in the classroom. - Christopher Wilson


'''How can a teacher best gain and maintain student attention during instruction?'''

--[[User:chuckstopher|chuckstopher]] ([[User talk:chuckstopher|talk]]) 17:50, 1 February 2008 (UTC)



When designing lesson plans and offering differentiated instruction, teachers must be mindful of the sensory memory system that each student possesses, specifically, '''the role of attention''' in a high school arts classroom. When presented with a classroom with a wide variety of talents, maintaining attention can prove troublesome and hinder engagement. 


Woolfolk states that &quot;''what we pay attention to is guided to a certain extent by what we already know and what we need to know''&quot;. Attention can be tied into on-task behaviour, as Woolfolk explains that &quot;''knowledge is learned, and changes in knowledge make changes in behaviour possible''&quot;. However, when prior knowledge &lt;u&gt;does not&lt;/u&gt; change, how does that affect student behaviour? Woolfolk states that long-term memory affects sensory memory through previous knowledge. In theory, the ability to remember past concepts influences your attentiveness when those concepts are presented once again.


The surrounding issue addresses the need for the teacher to constantly introduce new knowledge into a classroom. Kern &amp; Clemens' article &quot;''Antecedent Strategies to Promote Appropriate Classroom Behaviour''&quot; addresses the need for antecedent strategies to keep the attention of the class. ''Antecedent strategies'' are preventative teacher strategies to avoid disengagement, disinterest and lost attention. One of the strategies proposed is appropriate work difficulty for students. Kern and colleagues ''(2006)'' conducted studies revealing that students posses greater attention spans and accomplish more work when the academic demand is appropriate. 


The difficulty for a teacher is meeting the appropriate demand of each student. 


'''How can a teacher teach engaging material and keep the attention of all our students if they function at various skill levels?'''

Furthermore,

'''How can a teacher teach a boring concept and attract student attention by creating a 'what we need to know' atmosphere?'''

--[[User:Mr. Magoo|Mr. Magoo]] ([[User talk:Mr. Magoo|talk]]) 01:28, 1 February 2008 (UTC)


Once a teacher has the student's '''attention''', the door for learning is opened.  But, then how is what is learned kept in the student's memory (or working memory as referred to by Woolfolk et al.)?   Woolfolk et al. (2006) highlight three ways in which information can be maintained indefinitely in working memory (note: working memory is &quot;the 'workbench' of the memory system...where new information is held temporarily and combined with knowledge from long-term memory&quot;; Woolfolk et al., 240-241).

The first noted by Woolfolk et al., (2006) is, '''maintenance rehearsal''' in which information is maintained by repeating it over to yourself.  The second is termed, '''elaborative rehearsal''' which involves making a connection with the new information and information that is already stored in your long-term memory.  The final form of memory retention is called, '''chunking''' which occurs when information is grouped into small pieces (ie. like a phone number is divided by dashes, 905-555-2569) (Woolfolk et al., 243-244).  

:* The above methods for memory retention seem so obvious and redundant to me as I practiced these forms religiously throughout my educational career.  What I realized while I was in my practicum however, is that these tools for memory retention are not that obvious for high school students.  In the early phases of my practicum, I was quite insensitive to how students learned/retained their information.  I just assumed (which as teacher's is very bad form) that they automatically would know how to remember the things that I was telling them.  However, after frequent episodes of student's forgetting to follow my requests surrounding school assignments, I knew that I must be doing something wrong - and I was.  I was not practicing information retention techniques with the students, and this was the main reason why most of them were forgetful.  So to remedy the situation, I became Ms. &quot;Broken Record&quot;, as I would be repeating myself constantly to the class.  Even, after repeating the important information to the class, I would ensure that what I said sunk into their busy brains by asking them to repeat the information back to me in unison.  I also incorporated the idea of chunking as the class would not hesitate to let me know if I was giving them too much information at once. Ironically, I was using these techniques without even realizing it.  Through my experience with my students, I was able to help them remember information in ways that worked for them. Unfortunately, this technique did not cross all barriers, as I was not able to fully help those students who had identified learning disabilities or those students who were diagnosed with a developmental delay.





'''Practical Tips: How to Capture and Maintain Students' Attention'''


''Develop signals to get their focus:''

* Standing in a specific spot

* Flicking the lights

* A Tibetan singing bowl, chimes, novelty horns and bells

* Begin each class with a piece of music that will tie into the lesson

* Keep directions recognizably short and clear


''Make sure that the purpose of the lesson or assignment is clear:''

* Write goals or objectives on the board 

* Have the students write goals and objectives on the board

* Ask students to summarize goals or objectives

* Tie new material to previous lesson with an outline or map

* Play “Runner Review” (fig. 1)

* Play “Topic Investigation Bingo” (fig. 2)

* Explain reasons for learning or even ask students to explain what they think the reasons are.


''Emphasize variety, curiosity, and surprise:''

* Arouse curiosity with a big title on the board when they walk in, or an interesting set up of furniture

* Create shock by staging an event related to your lesson

* Use movements, gestures and voice inflection to keep them guessing

* Shift Sensory Channels by giving a lesson that requires students to taste, touch and smell 


''Ask Questions and provide frames for answering:''

*Ask students why the material is important, how they intend to study, and what strategies they will use

*Give students self checking or self editing guides that focus on common mistakes or have them work in pairs to improve each other’s work--- sometimes it is difficult to pay attention to your own errors.


 '''Figure 1.'''
 '''Runner Review''' 
 1.	Create a list of questions to review previously covered material.
 2.	Come up with a specific name for the runner review based on the material. 
 3.	Arrange tables and chairs to the sides of the room. 
 4.     	Divide the class into four teams place each team in a corner of  the room.  
 5.	Place chair in front of each team and tell them they can not pass that chair.  
 6.	Have each team choose a runner.  
 7.	Stand in the centre of the room, being sure you are an equal distance from each team.  
 8.	Ask a question and once the team decides on an answer, the runner runs to you.  
 9.	First runner to give you a high five and the right answer gets the point.  
 10.	(You could also use noise makers or tasks to complete first.)


 '''Figure 2.'''
 '''“Topic” Investigation Bingo''' 
 1.	Create a list of questions related to the learning of your specific unit and organize your questions onto a BINGO card.
 2.	Create answer cards (one for each student, there might be some repeats).
 3.	Give each student a bingo card, one fact card and a pencil.  
 4.	Explain that they are going to investigate ”topic” as if they were in the time/place of these facts.
 5.	(IE: a time in history, a community dealing with an issue, mathematicians in Greece, etc.) 
 6.	Students ask each other, “Do you know… (one questions from the chart)?”  
 7.	If the question aligns with the other's fact card, the question is answered and the investigator records the fact.  
 8.	If it does not align, they simply answer “no” and move on.  
 9. 	Aim to get a line of five for a “Topic” Investigation BINGO!

=== &lt;u&gt;Long-Term Memory: The Goal of Teaching (pp 245-250)&lt;/u&gt; === 



'''Working Memory''' (Active knowledge) VS. '''Long-Term Memory''' (Permanent storage of knowledge)


&lt;u&gt;Capacity, Duration, and Content of Long-Term Memory&lt;/u&gt;

What are the five main differences between working &amp; long-term memory?


Once information is securely stored in long-term memory, it can remain there permanently. Access to information in '''Working Memory''' is immediate because we are thinking about that information at that moment, whereas, access to information in '''Long-Term Memory''' takes time &amp; effort because we are searching to retrieve that information. Psychologists suggest that working memory is part of long-term memory- working memory is about PROCESS rather than storage. Alan Paivio suggests that visual images and/ verbal units are stored in long-term memory. Information that is coded both visually &amp; verbally is the easiest to learn. Critics state that the brain is not large enough to store all images that we encounter. They suggest that images are stored as verbal codes &amp; then translated into visual information when it’s needed.

&lt;u&gt;'''Discussion'''&lt;/u&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Learning:&lt;/u&gt;

* Dual Coding
* Limited Capacity
* Generative Learning

Dual Coding: humans posses separate information processing channels for visually represented material and auditorily represented material.

Limited Capacity: humans are limited in the amount of information that can be processed in each channel at one time.

Generative Learning: humans actively engage in cognitive processing to construct coherent mental representations of their experiences; therefore, generative learning strategies are aimed at helping the learner to integrate presented information with existing knowledge and experience.

'''Mayer suggests that learning is better if visual &amp; verbal information is paired at the same time, because it can be held in working memory; otherwise it puts too much strain on working memory.'''
:
'''SIDEBAR:''' Give students multiple ways to understand pictures &amp; explanations. But don’t overload their working memory- “package” the visual &amp; verbal information TOGETHER in bite-size piece.


&lt;u&gt;Two Categories of Long-Term Memory:&lt;/u&gt;
* Explicit Memory (Semantic &amp; Episodic)- conscious knowledge
* Implicit Memory- unconscious knowledge
:
&lt;u&gt;Explicit Memory:&lt;/u&gt;
* Semantic (facts &amp; general knowledge)
* Episodic (keeps track of your own life &amp; experiences)
:
&lt;u&gt;Implicit Memory:&lt;/u&gt;
* Classical Conditioning Effects (conditioned emotional reactions)
* Procedural Memory (motor skills, habits, tacit rules)
* Priming Effect (implicit activation of concepts in long-term memory)
:
'''SIDEBAR:''' Researchers do not agree on exactly how many images are stored in memory, some believe they are stored as pictures while others insist that we store propositions in long-term memory and later convert them to pictures in working memory when needed.
:
:'''Images:''' Representations based on the structure or physical appearance of information. Faraday &amp; Einstein reported creating images to reason about complex problems
:'''Schema:''' A basic structure for organizing information; concept. It’s a personal pattern or guide for understanding an event, concept or skill.
:'''Story Grammar:''' (schema for text or story structure), helps students understand &amp; remember stories (For e.g., murder mystery schema- searching for clues). Without implementing the appropriate schema in the classroom it becomes difficult for students to understand a story, textbook, or lesson plan.

'''How can we make the most effective use of our unlimited capacity to learn and remember?'''

The ways in which we learn and process information seem to affect its recall later. It is essential that we integrate new information with information that is already stored in our long-term memory to construct an understanding.
:
&lt;u&gt;Processes that Improve Learning:&lt;/u&gt;
* Elaboration
* Organization
* Context
:
'''Elaboration-''' Adding meaning to new information by connecting it with already existing knowledge (by applying our own schemas), this will make it easier for students to recall information later.
:
&lt;u&gt;Help students elaborate by...&lt;/u&gt;
* Asking them to translate information into their own words.
* Creating examples
* Having them explain to peers
* Drawing relationships
* Applying the information to solve new problems

'''Organization'''- Material that is well organized is easier for the student to learn and to remember- STRUCTURE serves as a guide back to the information when needed.
:
'''Context'''- Aspects of physical and emotional context (places, rooms, our feelings on a particular day) are learned along with the information. There is a CORRELATION between physical/emotion environment and performance on tests. Students who learned the material in one particular room did better on the test that was taken in a similar room than they did when the test was taken in a different-looking room.

* Utilizing learning processes such as elaboration, organization,and context has a great impact on students’ success.  I have noticed a large increase in the amount of templates out there for students to use for written assignments.  These make it much easier for students to grasp the requirements and to organize the work into a comprehensible parts of a whole.  Even advanced students will find it gives them a clear place to start and makes it easier for them to formulate their ideas.  Because they are still free to write their own individual thoughts within the template, I don’t think that they limit students’ creativity.  An ESL student I tutor recently brought in an assignment that I thought did a great job of providing structure and context to help students learn. For this assignment, students were required to learn the meaning of poetic terms and devices and use them when they wrote their own poems.  While the structure of the poem was left entirely up to the student, they had specific guidelines (a template TP-CAST--tone, personification, connotations etc) to analyze their own poem according to, which were then marked.  This gave them clear requirements to include in their poem and the structure they needed to learn to analyze poetry.  In terms of context, the class took a trip to a local lake for a day of creative writing where students were encouraged to let the scenes of nature inspire their poetry.  This environment was conductive to learning.  A visual component was also included in the assignment as students then wrote their poems onto T-shirts along with an image to represent it.  I thought that this was a great alternative for teaching poetic terms.  Students who have had the opportunity to analyze their own poems as part of a creative assignment will have a much better understanding of what the terms and devises really mean and also a better chance of remembering them.  The experience of going to the lake would help students who find it hard to come up with ideas for creative poems as well as helping them see the pleasure of writing.  The task of turning this all into a T-shirt not only gives them a lasting memory of the assignment (and the incentive to do a good job since everyone will read their poems), it gives them the chance to create a visual image to represent the abstract ideas they have tried to communicate in their poetry.  Students who are more visually oriented might first create the image and then the poem.  This assignment gives validity to both the image and the poem.  The assignment used a cognitive approach to learning because it emphasized the steps involved in the process of writing a poem and provided structure and context to help students work through the learning process.

*: One thing that makes processing information more difficult is the presence of extra information or conflicting information from different sources. I attended a volunteer training session this year in a museum. One training exercise we used to learn the collection was to divide into pairs, with each pair coming up with a real and fictitious story about an artifact. Then each pair presented both stories and the rest of the volunteers choose the real story. Though entertaining, this method was not very effective in learning the information. Instead it is a classic example of &quot;interference&quot; (page 253), where remembering certain information is hampered by the presence of other information. In this case, the presence of the fictitious story prevented me from remembering the real details about the artifact. We need to be conscious of interference when presenting information to our students as this could hamper their ability to process important information. Keep it simple.

&lt;u&gt;'''Discussion'''&lt;/u&gt;

* The text talks about memories as being stored either verbally or visually (p. 245); my question is how would musical memory fit into that model?  Memory is a big issue for musicians (and any other performance artists), but &quot;verbal&quot; or &quot;visual&quot; is not how I would describe the memory storage or retrieval processes for music.  Is it possible that musical memory functions sonically?  I personally think of the melody (or other dominant musical element depending on the piece) while I'm performing, as well as other things (see below).  I'm not really picturing anything or thinking of anything linguistically speaking--I'm watching my fingers as they play the notes and thinking about what sounds should come next.

: A big danger when memorizing pieces for performance is having it stored as &quot;auto-pilot,&quot; which sounds similar to what the text describes as &quot;procedural memory&quot; (p. 250).  It's almost as if your fingers have memorized the piece instead of your brain--as if you could be thinking about what's for dinner tonight while playing the piece.  This danger becomes real especially for those with performance anxiety, because when the anxiety kicks in, procedural memory, in my experience, breaks down.  

: One way to combat this is to build a deeper understanding of the piece (as per the &quot;Levels of Processing Theory&quot;, p. 252) by, for example, doing a harmonic analysis of the piece and thinking of it in those terms when you're playing (&quot;ok, so this part is a I chord... here are some inversions...now it's moved to a V,&quot; etc.).  Perhaps this helps not only because of a deeper level of processing, but also because you can think of it not only in sonic terms, but you can also now &quot;talk&quot; yourself through the piece, that is, store and retrieve it verbally.

:* I suspect that the issues surrounding memory (how we store and retrieve them) are more complex that simplifying them solely to verbal or visual memories.  Rather, I think memory is tied much more closely to our five senses.  We can readily remember things like sounds, tactile sensations, tastes, smells, and visual images/sensations without having to consider them in terms of visual or verbal signifiers.  I suspect that Woolfolk’s et. al’s privileging of verbal and visual communication within memory is a reflection of the tendency in Western scholarship to prioritise visual and linguistic signs/communication.  

:: To complicate matter further, some memories might be a composite of these different sensory categories.  One might remember an event like a concert in terms of the sounds that were heard, the visuals that were seen, and perhaps even the smell of the venue.  Also interesting is how a memory form one sensory category and trigger another memory from a different sense.  Smell seems to be particularity effective with this, often triggering a visual memory of a place or person.

* Reading Gavin's comments about memorization for music got me thinking about memorizing for acting and why some students seem to have a great natural capacity to learn lines and others struggle mightily.  Almost without fail, those with the &quot;natural&quot; skill aren't able to verbalize their method or why it works for them.  &quot;I just do it, sir.&quot; was something I heard from two of my students during my Drama practicum.  Are they transferring their lines directly into long-term memory and then pulling it back?  Are those struggling keeping that neural pathway blocked so that the information (the lines of dialogue) doesn't move past their working memory?  &quot;I knew this a minute ago.&quot; and its variations are often heard in acting classes.

: Similar to Gavin's example of examining the harmonic structure of a piece of music to generate deeper understanding and prevent &quot;auto-pilot&quot;, I have always encouraged actors I coach to figure out what the character is actually talking about, the ideas, in addition to the words.  The &quot;chunking&quot; concept (p. 244) has proven very effective.  Having an actor memorize the five thoughts their character has to verbalize during Monologue X means they will never draw a blank.  The absolute worst thing that can happen is they improvise the lines conveying that thought, but they know where the piece is going next and therefore have that much greater chance of getting themselves back on track.

: Another interesting observation about memory within the Drama classroom comes from the student who, always unconsciously, has glued their verbal memory of the scene to the physical choices they have made.  This is the student who will sit down in the chair by the door at exactly the same word in their speech five times in a row.  This would seem to be the mark of a good actor.  However, when asked to change the physical blocking so that their character never sits down, they find themselves forgetting their lines.  They have not learned what the piece is about, only the order of the words as they relate to one interpretation.  It makes me wonder if there is something in the transition from working memory to long-term memory that needs to opened manually, so to speak, for some students.

=== &lt;u&gt;Metacognition, Regulation, and Individual Differences (pp.254-259)&lt;u&gt; ===

This section examines metacognative skills (elsewhere labeled &quot;executive control processes&quot;) as a partial explanation of &quot;why some people learn and remember more than others.&quot;

*  Simply put, '''metacognition''' is an individual's awareness of their own thinking and learning processes. This is an important pedagogical concept, as it is a person's metacognative skills that enable them to monitor and regulate their learning through the &quot;strategic application&quot; of knowledge (declarative, procedural, and conditional.) In undertaking a task, a person's metacognative skills are employed through what is essentially a self-checking process: 1. planning (how will the task be accomplished? what do I need?), 2.monitoring (how am I doing?) and evaluation (is it done? does it need more work?) As discussed in the previous chapter, one could help students improve their metacognative ability through assisting them in the development of charts, diaries, and checklists. As well, the setting of clear and achievable goals is important as &quot;metacognition is most useful when tasks are challenging, but not too difficult.&quot;(252) Eventually, the ability to utilize these skills will become more ingrained, to the point where they are more like second nature.

*Metacognative skills are partially but not always related to development, so older and more developmentally advanced students may have greater capacity in this area. Biological, cultural and environmental factors also play a part in metacognition differences. However, what I find really interesting here is that &quot;superior metacognitive skills can compensate for lower levels of ability.&quot;(253) In other words, working on this particular skill set with academically challenged students might really help them improve their performance and self-esteem. Moreover, it is not subject specific, but acts as a form of transferable knowledge that students can apply to other contexts.

* '''destigmatizing metacognition for students from diverse socio-cultural backgrounds'''

:This entry concerns a few queries and a case study from a classroom of ESL Transitional students from a grade 12 university prep English course.

:On page 256 of the Woolfolk text a number of reasons are given to explain the divergent abilities a student might have in developing metacognative skills: age—as most students do not develop this ability before the age of five; raw metacognative ability independent of intellectual ability (''innate'' metacognition?) in students who have been mislabeled 'learning disabled'; biological differences (again ''innate''); and, variations in learning experiences. The last category, &quot;variations in learning experiences&quot; is the tough one because it could encompass a wide variety of very real problems for teachers in urban areas such as Toronto. 

:The study cited on page 256 (Perry et al.) in which a primary grade teacher named Nancy gets her grades 1 and 2 students to become more metacognative by asking them two questions—What did you learn about yourself as a reader/writer today?, and What did you learn that you can do again and again and again?—seems a little simplistic in my experience of having to deal with &quot;at-risk&quot; youth, and students from conformist and/or fundamentalist backgrounds. Many of these students I refer to come from households or societies which reward compliance, and punish independence. To these students—many of whom are over the age of 18—the very concept of &quot;self-reflection&quot;, let alone full-blown metacognition, has to be taught and modeled. A simple question about their feelings or opinions would force half my class to 'hide' by dropping their gaze to their desk and diminishing their posture. 

:If I discussed this vital thread of the curriculum at all with them it was to call it &quot;critical thinking&quot;, and I would have to work my way towards it by a number of strategies:

:::1) Socratic teaching. Each lesson is delivered in a rigorous dialogue (like the kind Socrates and Plato engaged in) with students, and half the questions are put to specific students whom are queried by name, with their name coming at the beginning of the question. A good place to start is at the top of a lesson (particularly useful in mid unit of a lengthy study on a novel or play) in the 'where-are-we?' summary. Play dumb. Have the class bring you up to speed on where the last class left off, and what the next topic of discussion is. Effective use of this technique requires care on the part of the teacher to not intimidate students by 'putting them on the spot', and sensitivity to personal issues that students may have around performance. The most effective type of learning in this vein happens once the teacher has established a rapport with students, and, can even call to memory, previous discussions on related topic matter. Referencing past discussions is the best way to draw out most students who tend to hide when the light is cast on them. In all instances the teacher must be rigorous enough to guidepost the dialogue in order to keep the students on-task and moving forward.

:::2) Activities. Debates are particularly useful at getting students to develop their critical faculties, and engage in metacognative reflection, and they're pretty simple to execute. Pick a topic, break the class in half, moderate the conflict, then have the teams switch sides. Other activities which force the students to go deeper into their personal connection with the material are &quot;role-playing&quot; and &quot;hot-seating&quot; in which the student is forced to incarnate a character or personality and defend their actions. Again, sensitivity to potential personal issues is required of the teacher. If these activities are entirely new to a class the teacher may model participation by &quot;taking the heat&quot; for the first round or two.  

:::3) Curriculum alternatives. Current affairs brought up for discussion in class can be powerful icebreakers in terms of getting students to form and take critical opinions. In many cases lifted from the news there is a very simple purpetrator/victim paradigm which makes polarization, then contextualization, easy to achieve. Three recent stories come immediately to mind: African-centred schooling; the tasering of Polish immigrant Robert Dzykanski; the trial of Omar Khadr.  Another option—don't laugh, I had to resort to this a few times—is to stimulate critical reflection through anecdote. Some of my students were confounded by my requests for personal reflection until I reminded them that their own personal tastes in music, movies, clothes, and even dating, were expressions of critical thinking and the processes required in full-blown metacognition. Mind you, I never actually used the &quot;M&quot; word with them. In fact several of the full-time teachers at my first practicum school did not understand the word, or ''claimed not to'' at least.

* '''Metacognition as a learning tool'''
:Woolfolk et al. bring up the point that metacognition can be a powerful tool for improving children’s memories.  This is a crucial point because, all too often, teachers and classrooms seem to emphasize students’ achievement of educational goals rather than their development as life-long learners.

:'''How can teachers incorporate metacognition into their classrooms in a way that will be both valuable and meaningful to their students?'''

:1.Declarative knowledge – provides students with the opportunity to consider and articulate factors that influence their learning and memory, as well as the skills, strategies and resources required for success in a particular task.

:2.	Procedural knowledge – beyond recognizing those strategies which are most effective, students will learn how to apply these strategies to a variety of practical situations

:3.	Conditional knowledge – once the student is able to identify both the learning strategies and their means of application, he/she will explore when and why these strategies should be employed.

:Metacognition is an important part of students’ development as learners and individuals. Not only does it require problem solving and analytical skills that will be needed in all walks of life, it can also make the learning process itself more meaningful.  Students will gain a deeper understanding of their own needs, strengths and weaknesses and be better able to adapt to a constantly changing environment and/or set of circumstances.

=== Becoming Knowledgeable: Some Basic Principles (pp.259-268) === 
&lt;/u&gt;
Real learning is holistic and interrelated.  Understanding a concept involves ''declarative knowledge'' and ''procedural knowledge''  (Woolfolk, p.259).  

&lt;u&gt;'''Development of Declarative Knowledge'''&lt;/u&gt;

To learn declarative knowledge is to synthesize new ideas with existing knowledge in order to construct an understanding.  Some of the techniques used to develop this integrated understanding are ''rote memorization'' and ''mnemonics''.
*'''Rote Memorization''' is remembering information by repetitions without necessarily understanding the meaning of the information.  Effective methods which provide a greater amount of time for processing learned material and the chance to move information into the long-term memory include:
::'''Part Learning''', breaking large volumes into smaller segments
::'''Distributed Practice''', practicing more frequently but for shorter periods
:One negative aspect of rote memorization is referred to as the '''serial position effect''', where the learner remembers beginning and ending information but forgets the middle content.  This is often the result from a single, extended period of study referred to as '''Massed Practice'''.      
*'''Mnemonics''' are systematic procedures or techniques used to enhance the memory.  There are several types of mnemonic devices that have been used with varying degrees of success.  Some of these devices are:
::'''Peg-type Mnemonics''' associate memories with a list of cue words or pegs.  
:::'''Loci Mnemonics''' are a specific type of peg mnemonic that associates items with specific places.
::An '''Acronym''' is a mnemonic device in the form of an abbreviation, where the first letter of each word in a phrase is used to form a new word.
::'''Chain Mnemonics''' link one item in a series to be remembered with the following item, and so on.
::'''Keyword Mnemonics''' is a system of associating new words or concepts with similar-sounding word cues.
'''&lt;u&gt;Development of Procedural and Conditional Knowledge&lt;/u&gt;'''
*'''Automated basic skills''' are skills that are applied to a certain task without conscious thought.  There is generally thought to be three stages in the development of automated skills: ''cognitive, associative,'' and ''autonomous''.
:The '''Cognitive stage''' is when we are first learning a particular skill and rely on general problem-solving approaches to make sense of the procedures involved.

:'''&lt;u&gt;Discussion&lt;/u&gt;''' 
*A common fear among teachers is that their students will not truly understand the material being taught to them, and instead, will rely on memorization techniques in the hopes of retaining the information. Although “memorization strategies eventually build meaning by connecting what is to be learned with established words or images”, I strongly believe that the information being taught to students in the classroom should be delivered in a way that is meaningful to and can be understood by all students (Woolfolk et al. pg. 259).  This, however, is a challenge for teachers to overcome because all students have different skills and learn in different ways, whether it be visually, aurally, kinesthetically, etc.  For example, if an educator teaches a lesson aurally, the student who learns aurally will most likely understand the information being presented.  However, a visual learner will not benefit by this type of instruction and may not understand the meaning behind the lesson.  Thus, in order to retain the information, the visual learner may rely on some form of memorization such rote memorization (remembering information by repetition without necessarily understanding the meaning of the information) (Woolfolk et. al pg. 259).  One solution to this challenge is for educators to implement differentiated instruction.  This is where an educator accommodates/integrates the abilities, interests, and learning needs of all students in the classroom when developing/presenting concepts so that all students have a chance at understanding the material.  


'''However, is this idea of universal design (designing a plan that is suitable for all students in the classroom) even achievable/attainable?  Is it even possible for an educator to teach in a way that can accommodate all learners in the classroom so that all students can understand the material and not just rely on memorization?'''

*For many years students have been learning for the test and teachers have been teaching for the test. Now, although this is probably the quickest way to obtain immediate results, it is not the best way to develop knowledge.  Students are unable to be supported by their previous knowledge when encountering new concepts in the future, if they only acquire information by means of memorization. Memorization only ensures that students are able to regurgitate information for questions requiring surface level understanding. Consequently, when asked to apply the knowledge or the idea of the concept in a capacity of higher-order thinking students will be unable to perform. As the student progresses he/she will not possess the knowledge necessary to comprehend the new material presented due to the lack of their conception of the foundation.  Hence, it is crucial students develop strong insight into material presented before them. For the learning to be meaningful and engaging students must become active participants in the education process (p.261).  Thus, it is crucial the opportunity for a meaningful experience within the classroom is presented to the students. 

:I believe the process of discovery learning to be an empowering tool for students. It helps them draw on their own experiences and develop life-long skills. As students unveil properties for themselves they will be able to observe minuscule attributes and reconcile hypotheses as they make their conclusions. Thinking in this capacity will strengthen their knowledge/confidence on subjects and allow them to achieve a much better understanding in comparison to what they would have attained by just listening and accepting the teacher’s explanation. 

:Students/teachers need to conceptualize the purpose of the curriculum—is to know a number of facts or is it to help develop lifelong skills? It is up to each individual to decide for themselves where the balance lies between the two.

: I totally agree that the idea of &quot;memorization as learning&quot; needs to be re-examined (if not chucked out completely like those disgusting black bananas that my mother keeps in the freezer that she says she's going to use for some sort of mysterious &quot;baking project&quot; - those things creep the bejeezus outta me), I think that we need to take into account the reasons why there is a demand for these quantifiable results. We live in a world that demands results - if test scores go up, then students are getting better, Q.E.D.

: While I think almost all of us can agree that the regurgitation method is not the one most conducive to future success (remember that article about C+ students running the world that was printed in a recent issue of Time (source?) magazine recently - testing doesn't always indicate real-world success), I think it's important to accommodate this sort of testing in our classrooms. While I personally believe that a classroom is a place that should place a premium on community building and inclusivity (it's true - just look in my portfolio!), at the same time, I understand that testing has been an important part of classrooms since time immemorial for good reason. People face tests every day, where information recall is key - at work or in their personal lives (woe be upon the person who forgets a family member's birthday). 

: So while I'll admit I'm echoing a lot of points that were said in the post above, and I'm agreeing with the main argument - it's up to us to find that personal balance between the two sides of education, process and results - I think that we need to accept that it's only partially what we as individuals want, but also whatever the school board/PTA/etc. requires us to do. It's this &quot;colouring within the lines,&quot; where teachers manage to import their personal beliefs into the pre-prescribed curricular goals of the board, that are truly successful.

=== &lt;u&gt;Social Learning and Social Cognitive Theories&lt;/u&gt; (pp. 317-324) ===

The studies of Canadian behaviourist Albert Bandura (1977, 1986, 1999) present his theory of social cognition using observational learning as a means for students to develop behaviours and understand their consequences. Bandura proclaims that students act a certain way when incentives are provided, thus explaining why some students don't perform &quot;bad behaviours&quot; such as swearing or smoking due to their understanding of the personal consequences. However, this can work against students as well.


In a high school, the brand new student is constantly engorged with ''vicarious learning'' strategies as they attempt to understanding their place in the social atmosphere. The student is trying to learn how to adapt by observing the world around them. As Bandura mentioned previously, &quot;incentives affect performance&quot; and therefore, a student's perception of 'the cool kids' or 'the jocks' may cause them to act differently. 


While attending parent-teacher nights during high schools, have you ever noticed that parents are shocked when they learn of the behavioural habits of students at school? This is due to the social incentives that fill the air throughout the social environment. Teenagers develop a certain attitude of their own, whether it be positive or negative, away from the household caused by ''vicarious learning'' desires. 


This can become dangerous when vicarious reinforcement takes place. When students realize that a certain group is reinforced for a particular behaviour, and cause them to increase their production of this behaviour. An example of this is when a student swears in class and the other students find it humourous. While the positive incentive isn't present from the teacher (as Bandura described in his smoking example), the incentive is their to entertain the student masses. This would cause an increase in this behaviour in the individual, and in other students as they see that other students praise this action. 


'''How can teachers prevent a negative vicarious reinforcement cycle in the classroom?'''
--[[User:Mr. Magoo|Mr. Magoo]] ([[User talk:Mr. Magoo|talk]]) 00:50, 8 February 2008 (UTC)
* It is very difficult to prevent negative vicarious reinforcement.  At first it seems simple, if students act a certain way when incentives are provided, then provide incentives for them to behave appropriately (317).  However, it comes down to what the student values.  A teenager who is interested in impressing his peers with his bad behavior isn’t likely going to respond well to positive or negative reinforcement from his teacher.  Negative reinforcement will only make him think he is winning and looking even more “cool”, and positive reinforcement might cause him to feel the need to over compensate with the “bad” behavior.  I think the only answer is to take the student out of the social environment and talk to him one-on-one about having respect for himself and behaving maturely.  Find ways to appeal to his sense of self-worth and let him know that you think he is capable of doing well.  Also, talk to the student about those things that are influencing his behavior and why they are not really worth it.  The student will appreciate that you did not embarrass him in front of his peers and that you do believe in him.

&lt;big&gt;'''Learning  By Observing Others'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''''Observational learning:'' ''' learning how to perform an activity or behaviour through imitation.

Bandura proposed four important elements to be considered in observational learning: 

:*'''Attention''' – To learn through observation, students have to pay attention.
:*'''Retention''' - To imitate behaviour, you have to remember it.
:*'''Production''' – You may need a great deal of coaching and feedback before you can reproduce observed behaviour. 
:*'''Motivation and Reinforcement''' – if we anticipate being reinforced for copying a task, we are more likely to pay attention and retain information.  Furthermore, a person who tries a new behaviour is unlikely to persist without reinforcement. 

Bandura recognized three types of reinforcement:
:*'''Direct reinforcement:''' The tutor compliments the student for his or her effort.
:*'''Vicarious Reinforcement:'''  an observer sees someone being reinforced for a particular behaviour, and so decides to increase production of that behaviour.  (Punishment can also be vicarious.)
:*'''Self-Reinforcement:''' providing yourself with positive consequences, contingent on accomplishing a particular behaviour (543)

Factors That Influence Observational Learning:
:*'''Developmental Status''' – including increases in attention span, ability to process information, and memory 
:*'''Model prestige and competence''' 
:*'''Vicarious Consequences''' – valued consequences motivate observers
:*'''Goal setting''' 
:*'''Self-efficacy''' – a person’s sense of being able to deal effectively with a particular task (543)

*Albert Bandura’s theories that people can learn “by observing others’ actions and consequences resulting from their actions”, social learning theory, are very interesting and very important to the classroom environment.  As teachers, it is important to remember that students learn in a variety of ways and many learn through visuals.  By demonstrating the actions or task you wish the students to complete, it allows that students to gain a clearer understanding of the process and goal they are expected to accomplish.  This approach can be particularly useful in classes where students are introduced to a new technique, equipment or approach to accomplishing a task.  If students are required to use a new computer program, for example, and need to create a project with this program, it is in the best interest of the teacher to take the students through the steps and functions they need to use by using a projector and an example.  This way, students can follow along and gauge their level of success.  Social cognitive theory is also influenced by a number of other factors.  Three main examples are: developmental level of the learner, the status of the model and how similar the model is to the learner.  This can be utilized in the classroom by noting which members of the classroom have the most social influence and engaging those students so that they are more willing to participate and “be on your side” when it comes to classroom management decisions.  This will, by association, attribute some of that social power to you.  If the other students hold this person in high regard and see that they are actively engaged in what you are teaching, and in turn, you are giving this person praise and positive reinforcement, it will likely encouraging them to emulate the same behaviour.  The same can be said for disciplining students.  It is important to know where your allies and enemies lie in class and use ways of manipulating the social culture of the classroom to your favour.

:Very eeeeenteresting. I think that this theory is totally applicable to any classroom that we enter. As the teacher, we enter a classroom as the default figure of authority; their attention is ours to lose, in most cases. In this role, it's up to us to demonstrate what we expect, behaviour-wise at the very least - of the students. I think we as teachers have a stronger ability to influence the class dynamic simply through our behaviour than we think. 

:If we show ourselves to be genuinely interested in the material, and show that we are putting a genuine effort forth to teach the material, I think that students react to that. If we're excited to be there, they will be, too. Of course, you can't reach EVERY student like this, but, like AJ said above, some students need to be shown it's ok to enjoy what you're doing, and instead of tryng to hook the alpha-teens in the class, I think the easier, and more effective thing to do is to at the very least, take steps to bring some positive energy into the classroom. Students are a cowardly and superstitious lot (10 points for whoever gets this reference), and a teacher who's genuinely engaged in the material and clearly WANTS to communicate their love of the material to the class will at LEAST be respected. Probably. Hopefully. Well, they at LEAST stand a better chance of not having their Acura egged on Devil's Night. 

:But the question that gets raised from this is, I think, how do we teach &quot;authentically&quot;? Most kids are like bears (or is it dogs? I know it's not mongoose ... mongeese?) and fear - they can smell &quot;fake&quot; coming from a mile away. So I think the imporant thing is to take steps to bring yourself into the class. Bring in aspects that you're passionate about. If you're teaching English, and you love comic boo - I mean ''graphic novels'' - bring 'em in. If you have a particular faviourite composer or art style, bring 'em in to the class! I think that most of the time, you'll find your energy is infectious.

* In &lt;u&gt;Antecedent Strategies to Promote Appropriate Classroom Behavior&lt;/u&gt;, authors L. Kern and N.H. Clemens list praise as one of many class-wide strategies that may be used to promote good behavior. “Research has demonstrated that behavior-specific praise, or that which specifically identifies the particular desirable behavior the student is performing, is most effective in promoting appropriate behavior”(Kern, 68).  Praise also has a vicarious effect, and students who observe others being praised for a particular behavior are more likely to adopt that behavior. However, as suggested above, the benefits of praise can be short lived if others are not reinforced as well (Kern 68).
:Praise and reinforcement are but two ways to encourage positive behavior.  There are other structures available for students with challenging behavior, from class aids to intensive individual student supports.  
:R.C. Pianta discusses alternative supports in his book &lt;u&gt;Enhancing Relationships Between Children and Teachers&lt;/u&gt;. 
:Pianta suggests that teachers, counselors and psychologists rely on verbal processes to mediate social and emotional situations (Pianta, 129).  “However, for many children… language is not the medium through which social conflict and difficult emotional experiences can be negotiated.” (Pianta, 130) Fortunately, there are other ways to build teacher and student relationships, such as through “group consultation, individual consultation, and even through forms of self-evaluation” (Pianta, 135). Regardless of the format, interactions must be flexible and differentiated, contextualized, allowing for student interpretation, positive, and without blame. “Together, these features would characterize a representational model that is more open to new information, more responsive to the child, and more integrative and balanced” (Pianta, 135). Pianta also advocates an intensive individual support method called “banking time”, whereby a teacher dedicates a regular time to one-on-one interaction with a student. During “banking time”, the student directs the teacher’s involvement, which is neutral, attentive, and supportive.  This helps to show the student that the teacher is there to help.  Banking time is neither a reward nor a punishment, but a consistent demonstration of support, interest and accessibility.

=== &lt;u&gt;Constructivism and Situated Learning&lt;/u&gt; (pp.324-329) ===
'''Constructivism-2 different types'''

Constructivism was defined by Bruning, Schraw, and Ronning in 1999 is &quot;the learner's contribution to meaning and learning through both individual and social activity.&quot; The Woolfolk text indicates that the term has been used by many people in the psychological and social sciences to imply different things which all have to do with the way we construct our own cognative structures to interpret experiences and information. Although precise definitions of the term vary, there are two essential varieties of constructivism:

:*'''first wave, or ''solo'' constructivism''' - Essentially concerned with how individuals construct knowledge, beliefs, self-concepts, or identities by processing information through their internal psychological mechanism. This definition of constructivism, as put forth by Piaget, focuses on meaning as the individual constructs it, and not on ''correct'' representations. Piaget believed that we construct universal knowledge that cannot be learned directly from the environment.

:*'''second wave, or ''social'', constructivism''' - An individual's development and learning is shaped by social interaction, cultural factors and activities, as expressed by Lev Vygotsky. He believed that students appropriate learning by working together in social groupings.

*I am interested in the commonalities and differences between '''individual''' and '''social/sociological constructivist''' theories. As stated above, the similarities revolve around a focus on the learner's role in constructing knowledge. The differences lie in the way in which this process is attributed. Individual theories view internal psychological factors as the primary determinants of knowledge construction, whereas social and sociological theories emphasize the role of external, cultural and sociological factors. Taken to its extreme, the individualist perspective results in '''radical constructivism''', a highly post-modern position wherein no knowledge or truth is absolute and all positions are relative. This may be viable in theory, but is problematic in reality (most particularly, for our purposes in relation to teaching practice, see text example re: bigotry p320.) In contrast, Sociological constructivism sees all knowledge as a social construct, and looks at the social power relations at work in the meaning-making process. This is particularly valuable to keep in mind when developing pedagogical strategies; we need to be aware of how we are reinforcing or contesting these power relations as we participate in the educational institution. As well, as a part of our teaching process we need to facilitate our students' ability to examine the ways in which knowledge and power interact in our society. However, I don't think that we can see knowledge as a totally social entity. Individuals filter and interpret in different ways, and these need to be seen as existing both within and beyond social/cultural influence. Otherwise, we deny individual agency and the possibility of creating positive change. As an educator I am particularly drawn to the notion within Vygotsky's social constructivism that &quot;cognition creates culture.&quot; Seen this way, education is a collaborative process in which teacher and learner work together to create new knowledge. While this framework is invariably influenced by its social/cultural context, within pedagogical interaction there lies an exciting transformational potential.

:: According to Piaget, and his focus on logic and knowledge, &quot;he saw the social environment as an important factor in development but did not believe that social interaction was the main mechanism for changing thinking&quot; (Moshman, 1997).  This being said, why is it that teenagers today (and before) follow trends?  What better way to describe how a teenager acts than to say that they 'follow in each other's footsteps' depending on the modern trends and what is currently considered to be 'cool'.  Take fashion for example.  Within the past few years, an Australian company who makes boots meant to be worn after surfing has become a popular trend for teenage girls and even young adults.  Uggs can be seen throughout the year on girls' feet from the winter months (when boots are required), right up to summer, when they are seen to look 'cool' with a particular outfit.  The ironic part is that not only were they never meant for winter (especially Canadian winter's!), but also they are a very flat boot which is definitely the worst type of footwear to be worn for long periods of time as it can cause many foot problems throughout one's life.  Furthermore, Uggs are one of the most expensive 'brand' boots on the market today, and yet they are sold by the millions.  


::If it were not for teenagers to get 'hooked' on fashion because they see it on another girl, when out shopping, and its commercialized everywhere.  A friend of mine, who has been a dancer for most of her life and therefore suffers from the common foot problem of fallen arches, recently bought a pair of Uggs as her winter boots, after taking such great care of her feet with customized orthodics and proper running shoes.  When I asked it why she bought these particular boots she said, &quot;they're just so comfortable looking and I kept admiring them&quot;.  Fashion before care just like trends before practicality.


::'''If social interactions between friends is not the main reason why teenagers give up their true identity to 'fit in', then what is?'''

*Social interactions between teenagers may not be the main reason why teenagers give up their true identity to 'fit in', but it seems extreme to pin any one factor as being the main reason as to why teenagers change their identity.  Teenagers today live complicated lives where their time is divided between many commitments like family, school, social clubs, part-time employment, religious circles, etc.  Any or all of these influences can contribute to a teens' identity choices, not to mention the constant bombardment from media outlets like magazines, television programs, the internet, and music that can be associated with these influences.

=== &lt;u&gt;Applications of Constructivist and Situated Perspectives on Learning&lt;/u&gt; (pp.329-349) ===

: In our time at OISE we are encouraged to develop student centred learning strategies. Wolfolk et. al suggest 5 teaching approaches listed below:

'''1) Inquiry Learning'''
: In this strategy, the teacher presents a puzzle, question or problem and students formulate a hypothesis, collect data to test this hypothesis, draw conclusions and reflect on the original problem and process needed to solve it. This method is the basis for scientific research, but could it work well in an arts classroom?

'''2) Problem Based Learning'''
: In problem based learning students are given a real problem, with meaning to their lives and they collaborate to find a solution. In this style the problem is real and the students actions actually matter. The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt University uses a term called &quot;anchored instruction&quot; (page 332), where a complex, interesting situation is used to anchor the learning and develop useful, flexible knowledge.

Thinking back from my own educational experience, I can remember numerous times becoming disinterested, disengaged and dissatisfied with a project or a course. However, whenever I had a teacher who challenged the class with authentic problems and provided clear objectives, I became engaged with my studies and excited to learn more. I enjoyed seeing how my actions made a difference. I was motivated to branch out and try new solutions. My learning experience was enhanced as I worked along with my group members to understand the problem, synthesize and apply our information. Without a doubt, by incorporating problems based on realistic situations, students are better able to direct their focus on a goal and gain personal satisfaction when they see the impact of their actions. They become personally invested in the problem and are accountable for their actions. As a result, they are more engaged in the learning process. Hopefully, new information may be retained longer. In addition, students will have gained valuable self-directed learning skills and practiced group problem solving skills which will benefit them in future projects (academically and professionally).--[[User:Belshawm|Belshawm]] ([[User talk:Belshawm|talk]]) 16:53, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

'''3) Cooperative learning''' 
: In this classic strategy, students work in groups of mixed ability and are rewarded on the basis of their work as a group. Research has shown this strategy to have positive effects on students' tolerance for others, feelings of acceptance, self-confidence and attendence. However, this approach can also be ineffective without careful planning and monitoring by the teacher.

'''4) Dialogue and Instructional Conversations'''
: In this strategy students learn through interacting with teachers and/or their peers. This strategy provides scaffolding for student learning through a conversation, rather than a lecture or traditional discussion.

'''5) Cognitive Apprenticeships'''
: Less experienced learners acquire knowledge from an expert or more experienced learner. This approach is most commonly seen in high-school co-op programs, where students are paired with community experts to learn about a trade or career. Students are guided while participating in real tasks and both parties often benefit from the partnership.

'''Does anyone have experience with any of these methods or good examples of these? Is there one method or combination of methods that is best?'''

::Although I didn't realize why it was working so effectively at the time, I got to both observe and participate in my English AT's use of instructional conversation as a method of discussing the novel her Grade 12 classes were studying.  I found the textbook's transcription of the Grade 3 conversation a little funny because, with a different vocabulary and subject matter, this was very similar to the conversations that occurred during our &quot;round-table&quot; discussions of Timothy Findley's &lt;u&gt;The Wars&lt;/u&gt;.  Having everyone re-arrange their desks to form one big circle brought the focus to the class as a whole, not just focused on Ms. W. or myself.  Also, it broke the &quot;geographical&quot; setup of the classroom into something communal and not connected to any sort of evaluation.  The students had received the questions that were going to be used as starting points during the previous class, which meant they had time to start thinking about their opinions.  At first, these discussions were dominated by the three or four alpha-achievers in each class, but I watched Ms. W. draw the quieter or weaker members of the class into the conversation gradually.  By the third round of these discussions (and luckily for me, the point at which I took over running them), barriers were coming down for most of the students.  In fact, one of the most engaging discussions occurred primarily between myself and a boy I'll call A.  A. made a comment wondering if it modern young men would experience the same sorts of things if military service was viewed the same way now and there was a surge of people wanting to serve in Afghanistan.  I cajoled him to go further and give an answer to his own question.  He responded on a very personal level, from the point of view of the individual soldier.  Someone else lept in with the perspective of the government sending young men to war.  A. responded to that opinion and the three of us briefly explored the tangent before I guided them back to the novel and asked others to join the conversation again.  I was very impressed with A.'s ability to express his thoughts clearly and mentioned this to Ms. W.  She told me how surprised she had been during that interaction because A. was academically one of the weakest students in the class who practically never volunteered to speak.  He had conditioned himself to stay quiet to avoid criticism, assuming his answers to questions would be wrong.  But in this instructional conversation framework, he was able to let his guard down.  On a side note, after that class, A. started saying hi to me whenever we passed each other in the hall.  This is a boy heavily into the materialistic aspects of commercial hip-hop culture who always hung out and navigated the school with the same group of five male friends, a loud, boisterous, slightly intimidating group; the kind of group that walks six abreast down the hallway and expects others to make way for them.  But after having a positive experience through instructional conversation, A. wanted to say hi to the white male representative of the Establishment who tucked in his shirt and had no knowledge of Soulja Boy whatsoever.  And what does that tell you about academic experiences informing social experiences?

I believe that cooperative learning can be one of the most effective tools for learning if it is used properly.  Listed below are important factors to take into account when using cooperative learning: 

&lt;u&gt;'''Key Elements for Cooperative Learning'''&lt;/u&gt;

Cooperative learning must be distinguished from traditional “group work.”  According to Woolfolk et. al group work just refers to students working together; this does not necessarily indicate that they are cooperating.  Cooperative learning requires all students to participate in the task.  Cooperative learning should also encourage critical thinking and reasoning so that a deeper understanding of a topic or problem is developed.

Woolfolk et. al provide five elements that define true cooperative learning groups:

:1. Face to face interaction

:2. Positive interdependence
::*Feeling among group members that they have to work together toward a common goal

:3. Individual accountability
::*Individuals must be aware that they will be accountable for the learning (ex. Individual evaluation of the task)

:4. Collaborative skills
::*Ex. Giving feedback, reaching consensus, involving all members

:5. Group processing
::*Group members make sure that the group is working effectively 


In the article “Cooperative Learning: An Inadequate Introduction,” OISE instructor John Myers identifies three key elements that need to be in place for cooperative learning to be successful.

:1. Goal Interdependence 
::*All members of the group recognize that they must work together to achieve a common learning goal

:2. Role Interdependence
::*Group members are given interconnected roles to perform
::*Helps to ensure full participation

:3. Resource Interdependence
::*Members have a portion of the resources required to complete the task

A common argument against cooperative learning is that students are able to “hide” within the group and not participate in the work. A simple way to use cooperative learning but ensure individual accountability is to have students work in pairs.  The classic “Think-Pair-Share,” always works.

:Woolfolk et al. identify six features that most cognitive apprenticeships share – modelling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection and exploration. 

:During my undergraduate work in music education, these educational strategies were discussed frequently as they are an important component of the praxial method of music education developed by David Elliott.  Elliott’s primary goal was to ensure students’ constant engagement in the music making environment and each of the previously identified approaches were to be implemented by the teacher in a classroom setting.


:As such, I find it interesting that the text book frames cognitive apprenticeship as something that is primarily used ''outside'' of the classroom – in a cooperative education setting, for example.  While they are undoubtedly useful in any educational environment, I think these strategies are most important in the classroom environment itself – with the teacher serving as ‘mentor’ or ‘master’. 

:This is not to say that other types of constructivist learning cannot be used as well – they both can and should be a part of any classroom.  Rather, the previously identified features of cognitive apprenticeship, are a crucial part of the regular actions of the teacher and his/her students.  It has been my experience, particularly in an arts based setting, that this is in fact the case.  It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which a teacher would ''not'' use modelling, coaching or scaffolding. I have found that the other features – articulation, reflection and exploration are used less frequently.  However, I think arts-based classrooms or programs provide a great opportunity for the implementation of these teaching/learning strategies.  Articulation, reflection and exploration tie in very well with the idea of metacognition, explored in the previous chapter. With support from the teacher, students should develop these abilities in terms of the learning challenges they face in the classroom (ie. Problem solving) as well as with regard to their learning process – considering how and why they learn (and learn most successfully.)

=== &lt;u&gt;Looking Back at Learning&lt;/u&gt; (pp.349-351) ===


	Responding to a question like “what is your conception of learning” (Woolfolk et al, p.349) would have to synthesise and take pieces out of different theories and perspectives from the behavioural, cognitive, social cognitive and constructive camps.  
	
There is a lot of value in what Skinner contributes in terms of the “cause-effect” relationship between behaviours and their reinforcements, and Anderson’s viewpoint builds upon Skinners in that he acknowledges the “consequentiality” of behaviour, but also points out that one’s background can influence how behaviour is interpreted and reinforced.  

	The constructivist viewpoints are clearly responses to the previous two, behavioural and cognitive, but in this respect the importance of the social environment plays a pivotal role in learning and understanding.  Piaget would likely see the impact the social environment has on learning, but the main variable and agent of learning lied within individual logic and one’s ability to “make sense” of stimuli or information on their own.  As the text states, Piaget was especially curious about “how people construct universal knowledge that cannot be learned directly from the environment—such as conservation or reversibility.” (Miller, 1993; Woolfolk, p. 325)  Students are therefore part of the learning and teaching process as knowledge is in flux and there can be a reinterpretation of previously accepted theories and formulas.  This type of situation could easily work in a Mathematics class, as all the new theories; formulas come from students and professors alike.  In an art class, the possibility for this to occur is even more likely, because the majority of the time students are encouraged to be critical thinkers in terms of art history and theory.  

	When it comes to actual projects, however, the contributory element of this type of knowledge acquisition gets tricky simply because it is the teacher who has to attach a mark to the student’s learning.  Constructivist approaches to learning in this case would not support the marks system as it functions right now in most school boards, simply because it breaks apart individual-driven learning and emphasizes standards and norms.  Students can be, and are encouraged to think for themselves and develop their own understanding and interpretation of different bodies of knowledge, but with the system as it functions right now, they would prefer the teacher just tell them what is right and wrong so they can get the appropriate mark.   

	Vygotsky’s approach seems, from the artist perspective, the most radical and appealing, since he allows the individual student agency in the construction and acquisition of knowledge.  The “socially situated” approach still is built upon individual variables, but cognition is “steered” through cultural “tools and practices” (Woolfolk, p. 325).  Very often students and teachers alike forget the fact that culture is a constantly changing and morphing entity that they are contributing to every day.  From the arts perspective, students should be given the opportunity to reflect upon their own culture and see how they are actively forming it through their own understanding, behaviour, and actions; this acknowledgment, even if implied in the classroom, will likely engage them more in learning. 

	Culture in general seems like the kind of subject that is often looked at retrospectively or from far away (as in the case of &quot;other&quot; cultures), but students seem to respond pretty well to subjects or areas of interest where they feel they are a part of and can contribute to.  Looking at the university campus life for just a moment shows how students, once they’ve understood their ability to create change with their knowledge, become activists, protesters, artists, entrepreneurs, etc.  

	This Terry Goodkind quote seems to fit this idea pretty nicely, or if anything as a promotional slogan for learning: “Knowledge is a weapon. I intend to be formidably armed.”

Dear classmates: Since we lost our class this week due to cancellation, I thought I'd kick start the headings from each section of the chapter.  As before, the hopes of encouraging content discussion between members of the class continues, while keeping (the editors???) weekly contribution to the presentation of theoretical materials and subsequent discussion moderation. Also as before...

'''Note:''' Since there are various editions of textbooks circulating throughout the class, page numbers may vary. Refer to subject headings when page number don't match.

=== &lt;u&gt;Teacher's Casebook - ''What Would You Do?''&lt;/u&gt; (pp.22-23) ===

Everyday, within the classroom setting, we as educators are constantly accessing our student's reactions to the instruction we impart, and making judgments on what determine to be their level of critical thinking and comprehension.  An interesting question bears relevance: is it in fact the student's cognizance in question or the methodology of instruction?  As we approach students through the concept of differentiated instruction, we must assure that we impart abstract concepts in a manner to which the students can relate.  In the case of the example lesson plan involving symbolism, I would first explore several examples of symbols, their associative meanings, and what they represent societally (some examples might include a cross, a ribbon, a heart).  Once we had established a working knowledge and vocabulary with visual items, I would then extend the concepts to a psychological approach with the students.  Critical thought can not necessarily be expected to be inherent, but rather can be developed with students in a systematic manner. In terms of accessing their developmental readiness at the grade 5 level for this concept, this would become swiftly evident during this subject exploration.  - Christopher Wilson

=== &lt;u&gt;A Definition of Development&lt;/u&gt; (pp.23-27 ) ===
'''Development''' is defined as the orderly and adaptive changes that humans experience throughout their lifetime.  There are four basic aspects

1. &lt;u&gt;Physical Development&lt;/u&gt;: changes in the body structure as one grows

2. &lt;u&gt;Personal Development&lt;/u&gt;: changes in personality as one grows

3. &lt;u&gt;Social Development&lt;/u&gt;: changes in the ways in which one relates to others over time

4. &lt;u&gt;Cognitive Development&lt;/u&gt;: gradual, orderly changes which develop into more mental complexity


When considering the four above aspects of development, it is interesting to consider which aspects are most integral to what an average educator may define as an ideal student.  Does the body need to be fully physically developed to grasp complex concepts?  Does a students need to be openly interactive with his/her peer group in order to efficiently and productively work in a group learning context?  Is cognitive development predominantly genetic, or are there systematic, theoretical approaches that educators can apply to develop these skills within students?  regardless of age and stage, the diversity within a classroom setting will be equally mirrored by the diversity of development between students.  This is why approaches such as differentiated instruction are so critical in meeting the class medium while still maintaining curriculum requirements.



'''Maturation''' is defined as genetically programmed, naturally occurring changes over time.  Such changes are relatively unaffected by environment such as physical development, while other changes occur through learning and environmental interaction.

&lt;big&gt;'''General Principles of Development'''


There are three general principles of development that most theorists support.

1.  People develop at different rates.  The rate that individuals change physically, personally, socially, and cognitively differ  within a group of students, these differences are normal except in rare cases of very rapid or slow development. (P.23)

2.  Development is relatively orderly.  People develop some abilities before they develop others, for example; babies sit before they walk.

3.  Development takes place gradually.  Children need time to develop their abilities.(p.24)

'''The Brain and Cognitive Development'''&lt;/big&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;Piaget's Theory of Cognative Development&lt;/u&gt; (pp.27-37 ) ===

&lt;big&gt;'''Influences on Development'''&lt;/big&gt;

According to Piaget we are constantly striving to make sense of the world, through 4 factors that interact to influence changes in thinking. The four factors are: biological maturation, activity, social experiences and equilibrium. I would like to comment on the second factor, activity, where students act on their environment and learn from it. This is one factor that we often overlook in our schools. So much of what students encounter in their daily school lives is theory, concepts that have little application to their daily lives or their environments. According to Piaget's theory then, by not connecting our class material to the &quot;real world&quot; we are not developing this factor to benefit our student's development. In order for students to be productive citizens once they graduate, they not only need the concepts but also need to explore how to develop these in their daily lives. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to do this?
--[[Special:Contributions/216.99.49.113|216.99.49.113]] ([[User talk:216.99.49.113|talk]]) 22:07, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

'''&lt;big&gt;Basic Tendencies in Thinking&lt;/big&gt;'''

Piaget believed that all species inherit two basic &quot;invariant functions&quot; or tendencies:
Organization; towards forming coherent systems of behaviour and thought, and adaptation; adjusting to the environment.
Piaget postulated that people construct schemes; mental systems or categories of perception and experience.  As these schemes become more organized and new schemes develop the individual adapts, their behaviour becomes more mature and suited to the environment or situation.  
Piaget theorized that people adapt by assimilation; tring to understand new information by fitting it into what they already know (existing schemes)and changing existing schemes when a new experience does not fit into the schemes they know, referred to as accommodation.(p.28-29)

An interesting point mentioned in this section is that when people encounter something that is too unfamiliar they ignore it!  Imagine the implications that this may have on teaching and learning.  In most cases learning is scaffolded, this is a natural process as mentioned on page 24 with regards to development occurring in stages, development naturally builds upon itself, a baby sits, crawls, creeps, then walks.  However imagine all of the information that is lost on students when it is presented in a way that lacks meaning, purpose and familiarity.    

Piaget believed that what motivates people to develop cognitively is something he referred to as equilibration, the search for mental balance, if an existing scheme does not work for a current situation then their is imbalance, or disequilibrium. (p. 29)

&lt;big&gt;'''Four Stages of Cognitive Development'''&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;big&gt;'''Do We All Reach the Fourth Stage?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Piaget suggests that as adults we only engage in our formal-operational learning when we are engaged and interested in the material.  How are we to address this when exploring different study aids in our classes to encourage “enduring knowledge”?  The text reinforces several time the value of visual cues and experiential references, but this can be difficult, say, in a class instructing or applying abstract or more theoretical logic.  In the daily pattern of teaching a curriculum, we cannot expect our students to be engaged with absolutely everything we teach, but perhaps there are suggestions we can use ourselves and colleagues in order to help engage the students more with the material so that they can take it the next step further.  

Suggestions for increased engagement in a classroom for “enduring knowledge” and formal-operational understanding:

English: 
 
1. Formal reading/analysis of a script from a popular movie scene; extension from plays 
	
Math: 

1. Joint project with tech class (if available) or creating an object useful to the students using algebra/geometry; field trip to a place where students can do this (Harbourfront?)

Science:

1. Making a dramatic skit to express how molecules are formed

Geography:

1.  Drawing assignment: make up your own map

History:

1.  Writing assignment: Family history essay; allowing students to express some aspect of their own history or history of their neighbourhood/community

2.  Dramatic assignment: Choose an inspirational/colourful character from Canadian History and make a skit/ “history minute” about their accomplishment(s)

Art:

1.  Dramatization of a famous painting that they enjoy (group project)

2.  Outreach to/from community; have students’ work displayed in local centres, with permission;

Drama

Music

Phys Ed

Civics

Any Other Suggestions?

=== &lt;u&gt;Implications of Piaget's Theory for the Teacher&lt;/u&gt; (pp.38-42 ) ===


&lt;big&gt;'''Understanding and Building on Student's Thinking'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Activity and Constructing Knowledge'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''The Value of Play'''&lt;/big&gt;

In Woolfolk's text he explains Piaget's theory on how to understand children's thinking process.  In this section of the text it explains that with children even when they are playing they are working and learning.  This is because the brain is being stimulated.  

In order to explain the theory they really looked at the development of very young children while they are playing but they do not look at the value of play with high school students.  With that being said, it is really important to understand that when children are playing regardless of age their brains are being stimulated.  As a result, they learn new skill and understand the possible results from a situation.  For examples, if a history teacher where to stand in front of a class to talk about trench warfare the students would listen for a short period of time but eventually they would lose concentration and end up not learning the ideas in its full complexity.  But if a teacher, on the other hand, where to use the ideas and the feeling of men in the trenching during WWI by create an activity where students have to play our the role of trench warfare they will gain a better understanding of trench warfare.  Students will learn the feelings such as the fear and the strategies involved while at the same time they will learn the content of this type of warfare.

--[[User:Naddles|Naddles]] ([[User talk:Naddles|talk]]) 00:22, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

Piaget’s levels for cognitive development prove very useful as a teacher, it helps to understand how much students can handle at various stages of their lives and also what type of work would be best suited for their current level of cognitive development.  An area that I feel is sometimes lost, is the utility of play when teaching.  Play can be used as an amazing tool for helping students learn and retain important information.  Not only do children learn through play, this is a technique that can be used at any age.  By allowing someone to do a fun activity or “play” around with new technology, it gives them opportunity to discover applications that they may not have in a more structured way.  Play allows people to take risks with new material that they may not otherwise, because they do not feel the pressure to get it right, they can explore, try and discover and there is no need to achieve a specific standard or worry about grades.

I experienced a great example of this in my last practicum.  I was involved with a Grade 12 Geomatics class, where students were learning a new type of GIS mapping software.  The first activity students were responsible for had nothing to do with mapping or geography. It was called “Fun with Shapes”.  Students were required to play with the program and create various shapes, drawings and images using the tools the program offered.  The grade was based solely on the amount of different things each student tried with their final result, encouraging the student to try more things and take risks.  The experience was a great introduction, because it allowed each student to get used to the program and learn the basic tools and uses through their own trial and error and discovery, without the pressure of creating a specific outcome.  The final products were outstanding.  Students even discovered tools that my AT was unaware the program was capable of and encouraged the students to share their findings with the rest of their classmates.  It really set the overall tone for the course and encouraged a positive classrooms environment.  Also, it alleviated some of the apprehensions or anxieties some of the students may have felt about using a new program.

&lt;big&gt;'''Some Limitations of Piaget's Theory'''&lt;/big&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;Vygotsky's Sociocultural Perspective&lt;/u&gt; (pp.42-48 ) ===

I don't think we can underestimate the importance of Vygotsky's theory that learning is inextricably linked to cultural context. As educators we should always be cognizant of the fact that our students' classroom behaviour and aptitude is in many ways informed by their culture at home, and that this may well be unfamiliar to us. It is equally important to understand the school as a hugely influential social and cultural context, and recognize that the interactions which take place within it will work to develop new cognitive structures and ways of thinking in students. 

In this view, teaching is seen to be about something beyond the transferral of particular sets of knowledge, it's efficacy is fundamentally based in the pre-existing cultural framework in which it takes place. 
--[[User:Tearney|Tearney]] ([[User talk:Tearney|talk]]) 21:12, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;'''The Social Sources of Individual Thinking'''&lt;/big&gt;

I would like to comment here on the perceived incompatibility between Piaget and Vygotsky. While both theorists agree on the &quot;importance of social interactions in cognitive development,&quot; they differ as to whether peer/peer or peer/mentor interaction is the most educationally productive. Both would seem to have a point. Piaget's, that peer equality fosters a safe environment for challenges to another's line of thinking, can be supported by observation. I'm sure many of us have experienced vibrant and productive classroom discussions when the teacher takes a back seat and acts to facilitate, not instruct. On the other hand, Vygotsky believes that cognitive development comes from learner interactions with someone &quot;more capable.&quot; This is of course the basis of the educational system as it stands: &quot;more capable&quot; teachers instruct student-learners. But we need to remember that teachers are also always learners, and that students have been shown to benefit from variety in teaching methods. A truly effective pedagogical understanding should encompass both Piaget's and Vygotsky's views on the value of social interaction. They are not incompatible so much as they are complementary. Combining the two will work to create a dynamic learning environment, one which avoids stagnant dichotomies between teacher and student.      
--[[User:Tearney|Tearney]] ([[User talk:Tearney|talk]]) 21:12, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

Recognizing that learning is a social process, teachers can find ways of helping students help one another through the learning process.  The acquisition of language is just one example of the social sources of individual thinking.  Vygotsky conceptualized development as the transformation of socially shared activities into internalized processes (43).  Vygotsky contends that at first learners depend on others with more experience to teach them step by step, but as they internalize the process of learning, they gradually develop the cognitive skills to learn on their own.  This suggests that there is great benefit in encouraging students to get involved in peer-tutoring and group work and gives validity to class-discussions that allows students to be involved in the process of learning and to draw off one another as opposed to the traditional lecture style teaching methods that allow students to disengage from the process of learning.

&lt;big&gt;'''Cultural Tools and Cognitive Development'''&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;big&gt;'''The Role of Language and Private Speech'''&lt;/big&gt;

Vygotsky’s claim that “language is the most important symbol system in the tool kit [of cultural tools and cognitive development]” as “it is the one that helps fill the kit with other tools”( p. 45) is a strong argument and I think that as teachers practicing in Toronto we will experience pretty often.  For students being enriched in more than one language, they are given more opportunity for applying deductive reasoning (knowing when to speak in one language/form or another) but also helps them achieve multiple understandings over one subject.  The textbook example of the myriad of ways one can describe a shade of red shows how language can really help students expand their own vocabulary and express themselves more effectively.  Encouraging this in your classroom is very easy, I think, since most of the time when students are learning a new subject there will often be a new definition/vocab word that goes along with it.  By teaching the majority of our subjects in English, every class in one way or another is an “English” class because they will all at some point reinforce literacy.  


In my practicum experience, I was helping one student with her vocabulary limitations, encouraging her to find words to help clarify her point in a sentence.  I used the example of carrots and oranges, describing how weird it is to have a fruit the same name as its colour.  “What about the other things in the same colour?  Carrots are orange too, but why aren’t they called oranges?  What if everything that was the colour orange was called an orange?  Would that not be confusing?”  She laughed, obviously realising her teacher is a little crazy.  But she got the point, I think.  She said, “I see your point, miss…” and went back to her writing.  I may have been totally out on a limb with my analogy, but sometimes it helps. 

--[[User:Irenedongas|Irenedongas]] ([[User talk:Irenedongas|talk]]) 19:25, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

Vygotsky's theory of private speech points to many practical ways  that language may be used to guide learning for both the teacher and the student.  As it is pointed out in the chapter, when students are &quot;thinking out loud&quot; they are expressing that they are having difficulty in some way with the task,  the teacher may diagnose that the student needs help, or that something in the learning environment needs to be adjusted.  &quot;Cognitive self-instruction&quot;, using self talk to guide learning, is an example of scaffolding.  When a student is having difficulty or learning something new, using language to direct attention and problem solve is something that we may take for granted.  One of the most important tasks as teachers is to teach students how to learn.  We can incorporated this structure into the high school class in age appropriate ways; through modeling these thought processes, i.e. writing the agenda on the board, and reading it through with the class, breaking activities and assignments into step-step formats, using mind maps and checklists, reflecting on the process as a problem solving tool by discussing what was learned or what could be improved on (art critique)and encouraging open student lead, teacher guided class discussion. As a student teacher in visual art I found myself verbalizing a step-step mantra-cognitive process with students all day long.  Where I found a visual parallel to the use of private speech sequences useful was with ESL students.  The use of visual strategies to improve communication is necessary where a language barrier exists.  --[[User:Lisa chupa|Lisa chupa]] ([[User talk:Lisa chupa|talk]]) 01:45, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;'''The Role of Learning and Development'''&lt;/big&gt;

So what came first, the chicken or the egg?  Considering that we are looking at theories here  one could postulate that both Piaget and Vygotsky are correct to some degree.  Two examples lead me to believe this hypothesis, one is the differences between children and their ability to acquire the skills to read for example and the other is brain development, particularly synaptogenesis and the strengthening and pruning of neuro- pathways.  Elementary teachers are doing excellent work with their students through balanced literacy programs and after school programs.  Parents are working hard to find ways to help their children learn to read. There is a lot a unnecessary stress involved in this process especially when little Johnny is just not at the reading level he should be at in grade one!  And then one day little Johnny gets it and he is reading like crazy, reading chapterbooks and learning all kinds of stuff!  So was it all the remedial assistance strengthening his neuro-pathways or was it that Johnny's cognitive development of his semiotic functioning skills have finally clicked in, or is it both?  Consider the development of the brain.  According to current research there is a rapid growth stage during the first few years of life, a synaptogenesis that paves the way for a multitude of possible strengths.  This is a process that occurs rapidly during adolescence as well however may continually be occurring at lesser degrees through out life.  The pathways are there to begin with, exposure to specific experience like learning how to read, strengthen those pathways while other pathways become weak and are pruned away.  As Vygotsky seems to be saying that, neurologically, the child is potentially ready to learn with the right amount of exposure. I think that the question that Piaget is addressing is cognitively, when is the child ready to learn. We are comparing apples and oranges, or Chickens and eggs.  This is complicated stuff, I don't think that you can rely on one or two theories here.  There are many many variables when it comes to learning and development, environmental factors; nutrition and pollution, stress, abuse, sleep patterns, and developmental factors; heredity, abnormal development, to name a few that must be considered when assessing what and when a child should be able to perform a cognitive task like read.

&lt;big&gt;'''The Role of Adults and Peers'''&lt;/big&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;Implications of Vygotsky's Theory for teachers&lt;/u&gt; (pp.48-51 ) ===




&lt;big&gt;'''Assisted Learning: Strategies to Scaffold Complex Learning'''&lt;/big&gt;



'''Assisted Learning: Strategies to Scaffold Complex Learning in A High  School Drama Classroom'''

(Adapted from Table 2.3, Educational Psychology, p 50.)


''Using Procedural Facilitators''

These provide a “scaffold” to help students learn implicit skills.  For example, a drama teacher might encourage students to use “signal words” such as who, what, where, when, why and how to generate questions after reading a passage from a play.


''Modeling use of Facilitators''

The teacher might, in the above example, might model the generation of questions about the reading, before asking the students to do so on their own.


''Thinking Aloud''

This models the teacher’s expert thought processes, showing students the revisions and choices the learner makes in using procedural facilitators to work on problems.  For example, while blocking a scene, vocalize your thought process.  Although you have gone beyond the need to do so, this vocalization will instruct the students through the steps they would need to block their own work and encourage your students to use the same facilitators.


''Anticipating Difficult Areas''

During the modeling and presentations phase of instruction, for example, the teacher anticipates and discusses potential student challenges.  A set of anticipatory questions can help prepare students for challenging themes or issues that might arise in the dramatic text.  These types of questions can open discussion and also provide a base point from which they can reflect back upon after working through the unit and see how far they’ve come.


''Providing Prompt or Cue Cards''

Procedural facilitators are written on “prompt cards” that students keep for reference as they work.  As students practice the cards gradually become unnecessary.  This is a great tool for line memorization.


''Regulating the Difficulty''

Tasks involving implicit skills are introduced by beginning with simpler problems, providing for student practice after each step, and gradually increasing the complexity of the task.  To teach sophisticated techniques, such as the Stanislavski Technique, begin with small simple exercises with many opportunities to try them out and then gradually add more complex teachings.


''Providing Half-done Examples''

Giving students half done examples of problems and having them work out the conclusions can be an effective way to teach them how to ultimately solve problems on their own.  Read a scene and ask the students to predict what will happen next or direct part of their scene, using procedural facilitators such as thinking aloud, and then allow them to finish blocking the scene on their own.


''Utilizing Reciprocal Teaching''

This means having the teacher and students rotate the role of teacher.  The teacher provides support to students as they learn to lead discussions and ask their questions.  While teaching improv, give a student the responsibility of hosting the jam, while you join the class in participation in different games.


''Providing Checklists''

Students can be taught self-checking procedures to help them regulated the quality of their work.  What are the different criteria they should consider when blocking a scene?

:I'm not quite sure which heading (above) of scaffolding this fits under, but it's an example from my practicum I thought I'd share.  I was teaching a beginner guitar course (grade 10) and the students were learning to play the melody from &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; by the Beatles.  There is a difficult rhythm in that song (a dotted eighth note/sixteenth note tuplet for you music kids out there) that most students couldn't get quite right each time.  I tried all the standard methods--getting them to clap the rhythm, get them to play it on a single note, etc.--with little progress.  One day I asked who knew the song and to my surprise, NO ONE did (!), so I promptly got out my iPod to play them the original version and pointed out that they were playing the notes that were being sung.  After two listenings, the improvement was remarkable because--surprise, surprise--the troublesome rhythm made a lot more sense to them when they could connect it to the rhythm of the words of the song (which they hadn't heard up to that point--they music they had didn't have lyrics). &quot;In the to-o-w-w-n...where I was bo-o-r-r-n...&quot;--it was like the rhythm of the words made more sense to them than the black dots on the page.  Admittedly, I didn't plan this as a type of scaffolding, but in hindsight, I think it functioned as such.

&lt;big&gt;'''The Zone of Proximal Development'''&lt;/big&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;The Development of Language&lt;/u&gt; (pp.52-55 ) ===

&lt;big&gt;'''Diversity in Language: Dual Language Development'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Language Development in  the School Years'''&lt;/big&gt;

:I find it interesting that &quot;at around the age of five, students begin to develop metalinguistic awareness...their understanding of language and how it works becomes explicit&quot; (54).  Some of you around my age (30 in a few more days) who are also from the Toronto area may have experienced what I did in primary school: a total lack of grammar instruction.  The first time it was pointed out to me was while I was still in primary school and my dad was blown away that I didn't know the basics of grammar.  I didn't care about it at that time, but much later on someone told me that it was part of a curriculum experiment conducted on students from that time/place.  Enough people from various and independent-of-one-another contexts have confirmed this for me to lead me to believe that it's more than an urban legend.  

:I distinctly remember for the longest time hearing the word &quot;verb&quot; being used as if I was supposed to know what it meant, but having no clue. (I eventually took Grammar 101 at university.  I think the fact that a ''university'' was offering multiple, overflowing sections of ''introductory'' grammar is a good indicator that this experiment indeed happened.)  I also remember these &quot;Reading Comprehension&quot; books--stories followed by questions--which, if memory serves, were intended to teach us things like sentence structure and other related elements of grammar through association.  I wonder if the idea behind the experiment was to teach grammar through imitation?  

:On one hand, I suppose it worked for me, because I've never had trouble writing (even before my university grammar course).  Yet, getting back to the metalinguistic awareness, if we could at least potentially understand grammatical structures at age 5, why remove them from the curriculum and hope we &quot;pick it up along the way?&quot;  I really wonder what the relationship is between educational psychology and curriculum experiments, especially the ed. psych. theories behind this particular experiment.  Perhaps it was to see if grammar really is universal??--i.e. let's not explicitly teach it to them and see if they pick it up along the way anyway.

:*I've heard this approach to language referred to as the &quot;whole-language&quot; approach.  It's based on the premise that an individual will pick up much of a language and syntax of that language if they are surrounded by it.  This approach does not seem as concerned with ironing out grammatical details too soon, at it might overwhelm the student with what may be argued as trivial details (or at least, details that can be dealt with later on in a student's development).

::In Gavin's case, like most children, he most assuredly knew what verbs were early on in his development even though he may have not been able to offer a definition of the word upon request.  This immersive approach is likely the way most of us learned our first language.  The question remains, when we should prioritise issues of grammar and syntax in a child's development?  Is there an age (or stage of development) that marks when a child is ready to focus on such matters?  Or, is it an individualised process that differs between individuals?  

::I think I relate more to the latter, something that would be reinforced by my casual discussions about this with colleagues.  I have heard many similar accounts of students who did not receive much in the way of grammatical instruction in primary and secondary school, and were thus more inclined to learn it themselves in university (either independently or though self-selected courses).  It would seem that once there was an intrinsic motivation within the student to learn the rules of grammar and extrinsic motivation in form of higher grades, many students would take the appropriate steps to ensure that they could get the knowledge they needed.  

::Of course, I know many other people who have had very little grammatical training because they were not post-secondary students for long (if at all).  They saw very little need to put that much effort into developing a skill that had very little use-value (i.e. people working in the trades do not generally have to write that many academic essays).  That said, their verbal communications skills do not seem be contingent upon this gap in the knowledge, and they are quite capable of expressing themselves fluidly and insightfully.  If we consider this in conjunction with the statistics regarding the amount of high school students who continue to study in college or university, it really makes one question what priorities need to be made in language and literacy skills in our curricula.

*One may have far more grammar knowledge than they are aware of.  While a person may not be able to define the word verb or adjective, they would instinctively know where to place it in a sentence because of the &quot;whole-language&quot; approach.  They have knowledge of grammar without being aware of it.  If a young English speaking student were given the sentence &quot;The dog brown is barking&quot; they would recognize that the sentence is wrong but would be unable to use exact terms to describe the error and say ''why'' it is wrong.  By giving a student grammar lessons, you would be giving the words to express what they already have knowledge of.


:When I first began my contract as an ESL teacher, I had only basic grammar knowledge.  However, I could always tell if a sentence was wrong because it would not 'feel right', but I would be unable to explain to my students why it was wrong.  It was only after I took the time to learn the grammar terms that I was able to communicate these things to them.  It took me a very short time and very little effort to attach words or rules to things that I already knew because I had been speaking and surrounded by English my whole life.

&lt;big&gt;'''Partnerships with Families'''&lt;/big&gt;
:I feel that family involvement is crucial when it comes to literacy, but this is much easier in elementary school than high school. I remember my parents reading to me every day and taking me to the library once a week to encourage a love of reading. To this day I am an avid reader and writer. By the time students get to high school, their habits on literacy can be largely formed. It can also be hard to get students and parents together to work on projects, as the text suggests. So what can we do to encourage literacy and reading in our schools?

:The ministry publication Think Literacy offers many good strategies for incorporating literacy in our classrooms. There are even subject specific guides in this series. Also, my practicum school implemeted a reading program called DEAR: Drop Everything And Read, which allocated 40 minutes every week for silent reading. Every student in the school would be reading during this time. I found this to be helpful because it establishes time for students to read, which they might not find otherwise and it promotes reading of non-school materials as a source of fun, learning and entertainment.
* Does anyone else have any suggestions for incorporating families?

It is crucial for the parents to be '''good role-models''' to their children. It is far more effective to 'show' them what to do rather then 'tell' them. My parents never told me or forced me to read, but I vividly remember my mom reading at the table when I was very young. The role-model that I saw from my mom naturally led me to the love of reading, which helped me to be literate much earlier than the others. This might sound like it only applies to little kids, but it is not. It would not make any sense for teenagers if parents are providing private tutoring in essay writing or force them to read one book per week, when the parents are not reading at all. I believe that teaching is valid and more effective when the teacher is role-modelling it to the students.

What really struck me about this chapter is how well an arts classroom (specifically a drama classroom) can address the issues of personal, social and moral development faced by teenagers.  

Adolescence is a time of searching for identity.  Through  work in a drama class, students are exposed to characters with a wide range of experiences, viewpoints, values and beliefs.  Students can safely test out what parts of various characters they connect with, what parts they aspire to incorporate into their own identities, and what parts they do not connect with.  It is possible that a student who is confused about her own identity will recognize a part of herself in a character, thus leading her on a healthy path to '''identity achievement'''.

A drama classroom is also a great place to develop '''emotional competence'''.  By considering dramatic situations from the perspective of all characters, students develop both '''empathy''' and '''sympathy'''.  Students also explore the many ways in which people manifest their emotions, such as facial expressions, body language and tone of voice.  This leads to various emotional competence skills such as: the ability to read emotions in others, and an awareness that relationships are defined in part by how emotions are expressed.

Being exposed to theatre from various time periods and countries allows students the chance to develop morally.  For example, a play set during a time when slavery was acceptable could show students how societal morals have changed over time.  A play set in a country where women are still viewed as inferior would show students how morals are different all over the world.  Being exposed to a variety of moral norms allows students the chance to discuss, consider and explore their own developing '''moral reasoning'''.  Theatre also exposes students to fictional '''moral dilemmas''', and shows how various characters would act when confronted with such a dilemma.
  
Finally, a drama classroom is the perfect place to promote a positive '''peer culture'''.  For students to be comfortable exploring characters and taking creative risks, there must be an atmosphere of mutual trust and support.  For this reason, drama classes often spend a lot of time at the beginning of the year working on trust and community-building activities.  Very often a drama classroom is the one place in the school a student feels safe, valued and respected.  Having such a space in a school is absolutely essential to students’ well-being and growth.

*I wholeheartedly agree with Laura’s assessment.  Traditional school curriculum addresses a student’s academic needs, and the development of his or her IQ.  Competencies such as the ability to listen, to improvise, to master ones emotions, to empathise with others or to work with a team aren’t factored into the grading of most subjects.  However, these skills are major components of the study of Drama.  

:Drama can teach students how to manage their emotions and read other people’s feelings: skills desperately needed by growing teenagers, and required for success in the post graduate world.  In the Drama classroom, there is also considerable focus on teamwork, relationship building and social awareness. Through working-in-role, Drama can teach empathy and other key values.  Moreover, success in Drama can build a student’s self-esteem.  Non-academic students can excel in this environment, which rewards a different set of skills.  Students can recognize the benefits of taking risks and standing out from the crowd, which may bolster their future efforts to achieve. 

:Among all school courses, Drama studies are unique in that they specifically nurture the development of emotional competencies.  It is important for Drama educators to recognize this key benefit of this line of study, and be able to share this knowledge with students.

:During my practicum, I came to the realization that many students are shunted into Drama studies because they lack direction.  Schools require that students take an Arts course in order to graduate.  Students lacking interest or skill in visual arts and music get pushed into Drama.  Others take Drama because they believe it is a “bird” course, requiring little intellectual effort.  I suspect that many academic over-achievers (or students who are more intellectual than social) avoid taking Drama for similar reasons.  This stigma extends even into the staff room: I recall hearing an English teacher mocking the instructional value of Drama.

:In difference to the aforementioned English teacher, I found Drama a more difficult subject to manage. English has a built-in structure, in regards to both curriculum content and classroom seating arrangement. Focus remains on individual achievement.  The more open, kinetic Drama classroom demands more of a teacher’s creativity, ability to improvise, and personality management skills. In the Drama classroom, relationships are key, be they between students or with a teacher. Although any educator may benefit from a high emotional intelligence, one is required for success as a Drama teacher.

:I have come to recognize that the rewards for teaching and learning Drama may be greater than for any other subject, for it is through the building of relationships that emotional competencies and fond memories are made.  As Drama educators, we must ask ourselves several questions:  ‘How can we dispel the erroneous notion that there is little to be gained from taking Drama?’  ‘How can we help other educators understand the unique benefits of Drama studies?’ ‘And how can we best nurture our students’ emotional growth?’  The answer to all these questions is ‘through open dialogue’.  This makes perfect sense, considering that dialogue is a lynchpin of Drama.

=== &lt;u&gt;Teachers' Casebook: What Would You Do?&lt;/u&gt; (pp.61) ===


Bullying among peer groups is a wide spread epidemic that has plagued students and both baffled and frustrated educators throughout the years.  There seems to be an incredible emotional shift in adolescents with the onset of puberty and the evolution of raging and evolving hormones.  These hormones are further exasperated by peer pressures, societal standards, and media influence.  What causes a child who was previously friend to another, to suddenly begin to exhibit malicious behaviour?  A tough one to access indeed.

As an educator and as a parent of an adolescent female, I have a ZERO tolerance policy when it comes to bullying.  As in the casebook scenario involving ''Stephanie'', I am certain that I would have to assure some punitive repercussions transpired for her actions towards her classmate.  in my parenting style, I encourage my daughter to have her opinions.  I encourage her to share those opinions at home as long as they are constructive and objective.  This behavioural modeling is paramount in helping to assure a respectful communication style from her towards others.  I acknowledge that my daughter does not nee to like everyone she meets, but she has does have a moral and social obligation to &quot;live and let live&quot;, respecting the personal boundaries of others and herself.  

When we consider that the following three influences have a major affect on student development: families, peers, and schools - how do we as educators balance effective communication and the incorporation of these vastly shifting variabes in student's lives?

--[[User:chuckstopher|chuckstopher]] ([[User talk:chuckstopher|talk]]) 17:10, 7 April 2008 (UTC)


I think that one of the most difficult issues for a teacher to handle is the incredible amount of bullying that occurs in school on a regular basis.  I believe that it is the teacher’s responsibility to address this issue whether bullying is occurring inside their own classroom or not.  I agree with Chris that there are so many factors that lead to bullying and as a teacher the idea of trying to stop bullying can be overwhelming because there is not one simple cause that can be fixed.  That being said, the best thing a teacher can do is create a positive learning environment where bullying is forbidden.  

Throughout this course we have discussed how important it is for a teacher to create clear classroom policies and to ensure that the students are aware of these guidelines.  This idea should be used in regards to bullying.  Teachers must make it clear in the beginning that there is no tolerance for bullying in the classroom and that there will be consequences for such behaviour (consequences will vary among teachers, but the students should be aware of these as well).  I think that bullying is a topic that is often ignored by many teachers and to address the issue in the beginning is a positive step toward prevention.  I think that in order to continue bullying prevention in the classroom, teachers must incorporate character education into their classroom everyday.  There are numerous bullying “prevention” programs that the Ontario Ministry of Education has identified that can be offered in schools (these can be found at http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/bullyprevention/registry.html).  However most of these programs are week-long initiatives or assemblies that promote bullying prevention but do not go beyond this.  Classrooms that use cooperative learning strategies, character development, and student participation are more effective than any of these ministry proposed programs because they integrate anti-bullying messages into everyday learning.

=== &lt;u&gt;The Work of Erikson&lt;/u&gt; (pp.62-67 ) ===

&lt;big&gt;'''The Preschool Years: Trust, Autonomy, and Initiative'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Elementary and Middle School Years: Industry versus Inferiority'''&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;big&gt;'''Adolescence: The Search for Identity'''&lt;/big&gt;

As adolescents work hard to establish their ''autonomy'' or independence, they surf a unique balance between child and teen - shifting constantly from one extreme to another depending on the situation and circumstances (i.e. difference between fighting to attend a party, or being &quot;tucked in&quot; at bedtime).  One of the biggest lessons I learned as a new parent occurred when I asked my daughter, &quot;What time will you be home&quot; - to which she replied, &quot;What time do you WANT me home?&quot;  In that moment, I was profoundly reminded of my role as a parental educator and the paramount importance of ''boundaries''.  Children absolutely require boundaries in order to safely develop.  They need to have something against which to push and challenge, as they continue to assert and develop their personal identities.

In the development of identity, we educators have a powerful role in modeling for students as they explore personal skills, their belief system, ideologies, values, and work ethic.  Through Erikson's &quot;framework for understanding the needs of young people in relation to the society in which they grow, learn, and ultimately make their contributions&quot; (Woolfolk et al. p.62), we better understand the potential for ''role confusion'' in youth.  Such youth encounter four Identity Statuses:

&lt;u&gt;Identity Achievement&lt;/u&gt;: a strong sense of commitment to life choices after open consideration of alternatives

&lt;u&gt;Identity Foreclosure&lt;/u&gt;: the acceptance of other life choices without considering options

&lt;u&gt;Identity Diffusion&lt;/u&gt;: confusion about self and wants

&lt;u&gt;Identity Crises (Moratorium)&lt;/u&gt;: suspension of choices due to struggle


As students are figuring out self and &quot;trying on various identities&quot; (Woolfolk et al. p.66), we have the wonderful opportuity to present a solid support structure that provides resources, nurture, patience, and open understanding.  As a parent, this is often a very difficult journey but very noble goal nonetheless. - Christopher Wilson

: Yes yes! I couldn't agree more. I think that there's a danger of labelling kids in a classroom, when we need to realize that the kid that you've labeled the &quot;goth&quot; or the &quot;nerd&quot; or the &quot;gothic nerd&quot; (&quot;Life is a swirling miasma of pain, like that time when when my dwarf-mage lost his +10 mace in the valley of Dk'Lon&quot;) is just trying on a persona, and that we need to respect that, and create a respectful space where students can be allowed to explore social boundaries and connections. 

: As students experience this search for identity, we as educators run into many challenges, as Christopher said above. We need to let students know that we understand their need to try on different personas, and explore social connections, but at the same time make sure they they understand the boundaries and priorities of our classroom (i.e. attendance, assignment completion). 

: This is a tricky task - while the logistics of class size and scheduling make talking to students one-on-one on a regular basis a difficult task, I think that it's still important to try to make time to check in with your students - even a question as simple as &quot;what are you listening to?&quot; (if it's the gothic nerd, probably Gary Numan) can tell you a little bit about a student, and at least you can start to make inroads. I've found that a friendly attitude, coupled with genuine curiosity about the student (if I call it &quot;genuine,&quot; is it still genuine? There's a noodler) goes a long way to making a connection with the student, and even if you don't get the opportunity to develop a strong relationship with the student, you have the beginnings of a personal relationship, so a) the student might be less inclined to test boundaries, and b) if the student pushes boundaries, you won't be treated like a TOTAL narc when you ask the student to talk to you for a bit, so you can see what's causing the change in the student's behaviour. I know this may seem like simple logic, but I think it's something that bears saying.

: Let the children play!  In Joanne Foster and Dona Matthews' book &lt;u&gt;Being Smart about Gifted Children&lt;/u&gt;, they stress the importance of unstructured play, not only for students who have been identified as gifted, but for all students.  As youth begin to mature, we have learned that they start to see the world outside of themselves.  But how do they relate to that world?  Technology has not evolved to the point where social destiny can be predetermined (sorry, I'm reading &lt;u&gt;Brave New World&lt;/u&gt; right now) so young people are still stuck with a trial-and-error approach that predominantly manifests itself through assuming of identities.

: Of course, some identities come readymade depending on a child's interests: the jock, the drama queen, the computer geek, etc.  My question is whether the teenagers who accept those identities from the beginning are achieving or foreclosing.  Without a doubt, there are young people who find their identities early on, become comfortable in them, and develop them.  However, the wondrous monster that is peer pressure and the need for peer acceptance can drive people of any age to conform to something they do not actually believe in.  There are enough social pressures involved with a student's high school experience.  How many of them have chosen to move right into identity diffusion of a sort by just docking in the first safe harbour they come across?  From my own high school experience, I know students keep all kinds of desires and beliefs secret because they do not &quot;fit&quot; how you either are or wish to be perceived.

: I'll finish by seconding the strategy described by Chareth.  As an unabashed music nerd, I love to find out what other people are listening to and why they like it.  Music is something that many teenagers feel passionately about and I have found it a great way to connect with them.  For other teachers it might be movies, television or even (gasp!) books, but connecting through culture is an easy non-intrusive way to start building that connection.  The students become so comfortable talking with you about minor issues that the major issues become less scary to broach.  And by major issues, I mean something as simple as agreeing to follow you with a new concept you are teaching that isn't immediately clear to them, necessitating hard work on their part to grasp it.  As I learned during my English practicum, once you've argued the relative merits of Nine Inch Nails versus Marilyn Manson and which one of them actually brought industrial goth culture to the mainstream, convincing a student that they will be able to get the in-class essay finished correctly and on schedule is easy.

  .&lt;small&gt;Small Text&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''Beyond the School Years'''&lt;/big&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;Understanding Ourselves and Others&lt;/u&gt; (pp.67-76 ) ===

&lt;big&gt;'''Self-Concept and Self-Esteem'''&lt;/big&gt;

Considering the ideas of self-concept and self-esteem one has to ask which one is hard for adolescents and for teachers to help adolescents go through.  Self-concept or our perceptions of ourselves is different from self-esteem which is the value each of us places on our own characteristic, abilities and behaviour.  

I really think that for a teacher the ability to deal and help students to deal with their idea of self-concept is a lot harder to help them deal with self-esteem.  I believe this because the idea of self-concept is an internal idea which is developed within oneself and may not be visible to the world around us.  Therefore when a student has a poor self-concept it might not be noticeable to the world around them.  

On the other hand, the support and resources to help young individuals to develop or help improve their self-esteem are in abundance.  Self-esteem in many ways is control from external element and over time it may create issues for ones self-concept.  Issues such as bullying, grades and pressures from parents and peers can all affect the ideas behind self-esteem. But as a teacher, these issues can control to a certain extent if they are caught.  Even if they are not cause if a teacher notices that a student has a low self-esteem the teacher can intervene and provide emotion and educational support.

The text talks about the example of course selection to explain the impact of choose and self-concept.  What it explains is that when a student has to pick course they tend to pick courses which they know they will do well in over courses they will not do so well.  For the most part this is true, but for some determined students who may have a goal to get into a certain university which requires certain courses that choice is taken away, and they may have to take a course which they are not very good at.  If the student does not do well this may affect they self-esteem and their belief that they can get into a program or university of their chose.  This can be extremely stressful and hindering to one self-motivation.

* Let's not forget the pressure that some students feel from their parents.  During my second practicum, there was a girl in my Grade Nine academic English class who was having a lot of difficulty with the material.  When my AT consulted with the guidance office, she was informed that her parents would not allow her to take any college or applied level classes.  Of course, the situation was very stressful for the student.  

: As educators, we might also be indirectly responsible for similar pressures by simply encouraging students to strive for academic courses and a university education.  The hidden implication with this encouragement is that a student is &quot;settling&quot; with college level courses and a college education.  We need to be sensitive of the reasons students decide to choose their courses, as well as informing them of all of the options that are available to them with course selection.  During practicum, I often sensed that students were not entirely clear about differences between applied, college, and university level courses.  Nor were they all too sure about the appropriate reasons for selecting one of those levels.

--[[User:Maurosavo|Maurosavo]] ([[User talk:Maurosavo|talk]]) 18:47, 16 April 2008 (UTC) 

* Mauro's experience reminded me of a similar experience from my first practicum. A girl in my grade 10 Academic class was struggling to keep up with the material. I am fairly certain that she had a learning disability and really should have been in the Applied or Essential classroom. However her parents refused to allow her to switch to another stream because they were determined that she would go to University, which she could not do without taking Academic classes. This caused the student to become frustrated at her lack of progress, close to failing and still feeling that she must go to University to be successful. She even asked my AT to give her certain marks, so she could get into University. 

I remember being the first class to choose between Academic and Applied classes in 1999, when the difference between the streams was completely unclear, even for the teachers. It surprises me that the difference is still not clear, 9 years later. However, I wonder if it is because we cannot present the courses without implying or attaching a negative stigma to Essential and Applied classes. As teachers we need to refrain from explaining college level courses as &quot;slower&quot; or &quot;easier&quot; than University level courses or we automatically give added value to University level, sending the message that we do not value less academic students.   

However, what interests me most about this chapter is the notion of '''academic self-concept''', and how that relates to students in Arts classes. Woolfolk et al. state that the academic self-concept is the strongest predictor of course selection for high school students. In other words, the better the student feels about their performance in a subject area, the more likely they are to take your class. In elective classes, it is important to make students feel good about their progress in your class, regardless of their marks. If students feel they can succeed in music they will continue to take music, even if they are only getting a 65%. This is especially important for students who do poorly in other subjects.

'''Does anyone have any ideas about how to increase students' self-concept in the Arts?'''

--[[User:Liz P|Liz P]] ([[User talk:Liz P|talk]]) 01:20, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

A successful arts program needs to find ways to empower students.  This is impossible if students do not have a positive self-concept of themselves as artists.  I’ve heard so many people say, “I’m not musical,” “I’m tone deaf,” “I can’t draw” etc.  I think the first step to allowing students to construct positive self-concepts of themselves is to make it clear that it is possible for anyone to do.  Like any discipline, if you work hard, you can succeed (but many people seem to think that the arts are just something you’re born with or you’re not.  Let them know that the most important thing is that they learn to appreciate and love their art.  In my practicum, I did an activity where students listened to a variety of different songs and drew what the songs communicated to them.  We then discussed what music actually means and they each wrote a paragraph describing their personal definitions of music and what music means to them.  I later posted them anonymously around the room, so they would be reminded throughout the term of why they loved music (their definitions were passionate, profound, and moving).  I wanted the students to realize that the arts are something powerful and human, and is about much more than trying to be the best (although trying to be your best is part of it).  Beyond that, I think it’s very important to always be positive and encouraging even when you are offering a student constructive criticism.  I don’t feel that it is the teachers position to judge who is “talented,” but instead, just to give them the tools and knowledge to achieve as much as they can.  You might be surprised in the end by who improves the most.  But for any student to take that risk, they have to know that you’re on their side.

&lt;big&gt;'''School Life and Self-Esteem'''&lt;/big&gt;

How does self esteem affect a student’s behaviour in school?

Educational Psychology suggests that students with higher self esteem are more likely to be successful in school , have a more favourable attitude towards education, be more popular with classmates and adopt more positive behaviour in the classroom.  It may be that high achievement and popularity lead to self-esteem, or vice versa.  (71)

Does life in school affect a student’s self-esteem?

A teacher’s encouragement, feedback and evaluations can greatly influence a student’s self-esteem.  Being placed in a low-ability group may have a negative impact; learning in collaborative and co-operative settings seems to have a positive effect.

William James suggested that self-esteem is determined by how successful we are at accomplishing tasks or reaching goals we value.  If a skill or accomplishment is not important, incompetence in that area does not threaten self esteem.  Students must attribute their successes to their own actions, not to luck or special assistance in order to build self esteem.(71)

Accordingly, for teachers to help students build self esteem, they have to emphasize the importance and value of the tasks they initiate, and nurture students and encourage their continued success.



&lt;big&gt;'''Gender, Ethnicity, and Self-Esteem'''&lt;/big&gt;

Many students underestimate their own competence.  Gender and ethnic stereotypes can play a factor.

A number of psychologists have suggested that there is another basis for self-worth: the collective self.
Our self esteem can be influenced by a sense of worth of the groups to which we belong.  When students are faced with reminders that their ethnic or family group has less status and power, the basis for collective self esteem can erode.(73)  Furthermore, a group ’s values, learning styles, and communication patterns may be inconsistent with the expectations of the school and larger society.  Embracing mainstream culture may seem to require the subordination of ethnic values.  Of course, differences are not deficits, and so schools are encouraged to foster ethnic pride, pride in one’s heritage.

=== &lt;u&gt;Moral Development&lt;/u&gt; (pp.76-86 ) ===

&lt;big&gt;'''Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development'''&lt;/big&gt;

Lawrence Kohlberg theorised a sequence of levels in moral reasoning based on studies he conducted with children and adults in which he presented them with moral dilemmas.  He came up with three levels in moral reasoning (Woolfolk et. al. 77-8):

: 1. Preconventional – judgement is based solely on personal needs
: 2. Conventional – judgement is based on others approval, expectations, or values.  
: 3. Postconventional – judgement is based more on personal ethics derived from abstract concepts of justice, human dignity, and equality.  

Each of these levels is subdived into two stages, resulting in a total of six stages that represent the moral development of an individual.  Kohlberg’s model has been criticised for being too hierarchical and linear.  In reality the stages do not appear to be so separate, with individuals often demonstrating the decision making that reflects more than one stage simultaneously.  Other criticisms have argued that Kohlberg did not distinguish between morality and social conventions.  Furthermore, his theory has been criticised for being Eurocentric, prioritising a Western emphasis on individualism and individual conscience.  In contrast, many family-centred cultures would base their highest levels of moral reasoning on the well-being of the family group and not an individual's conscience (Woolfolk et. al. 79).

'''[[Socialization]]''' – “The ways in which members of a society encourage positive development for the immature individuals of the group” (p.86)

'''Peer Relationships and Peer Cultures'''

In the book it describes how relationships and social contexts early in life can affect the way in which one interacts and functions later on in life.  It describes how students with close friends at younger stages seem to develop into adults with higher self-esteem and seem to more easily maintain intimate relationships (p.87).  Students who may have not had as many friends, or felt rejected throughout school were more likely to drop out/commit crimes (p. 87). Students that are seen as outcast are generally very aggressive, with-drawn or inattentive-hyperactive within the classroom (p.87). However, as the text points out, these labels are also contingent to the classroom atmosphere.  The norm in the mathematics classroom may not be the norm in a physical education setting. Thus someone who may be considered with-drawn in a gym class may be considered the norm in a math class.  I found this point to be very interesting, as it reflects how the classroom setting affects students perceptions of people and outlines what sort of measures a teacher could take to level the differences between student behaviours.  

Differentiated instruction and positive reinforcement in classroom situations with vast difference could be a good way to diminish labels. Allowing for moments of positive reinforcement of different students and their behaviour could lead others in the class to recognize and come to appreciate their classmates’ strengths, rather than focus on the mannerisms as negative/ against the norm. I think it is important as teachers and adults in students’ lives to be able to create an environment conducive to celebrating diversity of strengths rather than a place where differences are highlighted and compared to a standard “norm”.--[[User:Thomas20|Thomas20]] ([[User talk:Thomas20|talk]]) 22:31, 15 April 2008 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;'''Navigating Transitions'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Children and Youth at Risk'''&lt;/big&gt;

There exist an array of risk factors that range from the individual level out to the sociocultural
level:
Individual Factors (e.g.,poor social problem solving skills. )
Family Factors (e.g., low family cohesion)
Peer Factors (e.g., rejection by peers,)
School Factors (e.g., low teacher support)

Factors to consider regarding the idea of an &quot;At Risk&quot; student

-it is important to recognize that risk status is not a
unitary category, but instead should be seen as a series of steps along a continuum, ranging from
low risk to high risk (McWhirter et al. 1998). 

-the defining factor of an at risk student can be internal (mental illness) or external (family) or both

-the risk of a student becomes exponential when the number of factors adding to the risk rise.  Rutter (1980) found that those children experiencing only one risk factor were as likely to
experience the outcomes of those children with no risk factors. For those children with two or more
risk factors, unfavorable outcomes increased four times, and for those children with four risk
factors, the chance of negative outcomes increased ten times.

== &lt;u&gt;'''Diversity'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


=== &lt;u&gt;Language and Labelling&lt;/u&gt; (pp.104-105 ) ===

Although the term '''exceptional student''' can refer to both students of high achievement or learning impairments, many claim that using labels for students is counterproductive since A)they aren't prescriptive in the same sense that medical treatments are; B) they tend to become self-fulfilling prophesies due to their tendency to be viewed as unchangeable stigmas; C) behavioural issues are often improperly attributed to these labels &amp; stigmas, which may or may not be responsible for the problems.

On the other hand, many support the use of labels, claiming that A) they allow other classmates to be more accepting of behaviourally challenged individuals; B) they make possible the categorical use of specialized programs and assistance. In general, Woolfolk admits to the effects of both sides of each argument, and prompts teachers do the same.

'''Person-First''' language is a euphemism used to describe persons with disabilities by reducing the focus on the disability, and placing it more on the person. For example, instead of saying 'Jack is disabled', one would say 'Jack is a student with a disability'. Refer to page 107 for a box with more examples that might be used in a school.

Lastly, it is important to distinguish between the terms ''handicap'' and ''disability''. The prior refers to a disadvantage an individual might face in certain situations, such as when stairs limit the access of a person in a wheel chair. A ''disability'' on the other hand refers to an inability to do something at all, such as walk or see.

*If possible, also define the disability as 'physical' or 'intellectual'.  Many people tend to group those with a disability together and not recognize their differences and uniqueness as individuals.

===&lt;u&gt; Individual Differences in Intelligence &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 105-114) ===
Intelligence is defined as &quot;Ability or abilities to acquire and use knowledge for solving problems and adapting to the world (Woolfolk, 106).&quot; 

There are various categories of identifying intelligences from different school of thoughts. 

'''Fluid intelligence''' by Raymond Cattell

Mental efficiency that is universal (106). 

This is closely related to the physical devleopment, especially the brain. 

'''Crystallized intelligence''' by John Horn 

Ability to apply culturally approved problem-solving methods (106).
 
This is culturally relevant, and closely related to experience.

'''Multiple intelligences''' by Gardner

There are eight separate abilites; 
** logical-mathematical
** linguistic (verbal)
** musical
** spatial
** bodily-kinesthetic (movement)
** interpersonal (understanding others)
** intrapersonal (understanding self)
** naturalist (observing and understanding natural and human-made patterns and systems)

----
'''Thoughts about assessment of the intelligences'''

The words 'individual differences' implies that these intelligences can be evaluated with specific method of testing, and there are numeric values that enables to compare the result of different people. However, how fair and valid are the standardized testing of intelligences? For instance, how can an interpersonal intelligence tested? It would make nonsense to test someone's interpersonal skill by measuring how long they can talk with the other person; checking if they are making proper eye contacts; or checking if he makes the people around him to laugh. 

Gardner's multiple intelligences has limitations in assessment. Gardner identified the eight separate abilites, but never suggested the ways to evaluate them. There are tests designed for each of them; for instances, math contests for logical-mathematical abilities, TOEFL for linguistic abilities, or Royal Conservatory of Music exams for musical abilities. However, do the scores of these tests accurately reflect the actual intelligence? I doubt it. I saw a case where a native English speaker failed TOEFL test when a person who cannot fluently communicate in English passed the test with great score. 

'''Are different kinds of intelligences related?'''

Can someone be good at understanding others (interpersonal intelligence) without proper understanding of self (intrapersonal)? Or does a person with interpersonal intelligence has higher possibility of having higher linguistic (verbal) intelligence than the others? Can crystallized intelligence be completely separated from fluid intelligence? It would be worthwhile to investigate the relationship between the different kinds of intelligences because it implies that there is a possibility to develop specific intelligence by using other types of intelligences; or that there are specific type of intelligence that has to be developed in order to develop the other.

===&lt;u&gt; Ability Differences and Teaching &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 114-116) ===


*'''Ability Grouping in the New Ontario Curriculum'''

:''Between-class Ability Grouping'' is a system of grouping in which students are assigned to classes based on their measured ability or their achievements. (p 114)  This practice, common in secondary and some elementary schools, is also known as ''tracking'' (United States) or ''streaming'' (Canada).

:Most high schools stream their courses according to high-, middle- and low-ability levels in a given subject. (p 114)  This type of streaming is aptly illustrated by the old Ontario Academic Credit (OAC) curriculum, which offered ''advanced, general'' and ''basic'' level courses.

:According to research, this type of segregation tends to benefit high-achieving students while presenting obstacles for lower-achieving students.  Woolfolk asserts that students in lower-ability streams have, historically, received lower-quality instruction. Part of the problem is attributed to a reduced academic focus that perpetuates lower-level objectives. (p 114)  Other factors include frequent classroom management problems and teacher stress leading to decreased enthusiasm.  This cycle sends the wrong message to students, who feel discouraged by low expectations and lack of interest on the part of the teacher.  Furthermore, streaming undermines equity.  Because disadvantaged and minority groups are disproportionately represented in lower-ability streams, these students are not well-served by the education system. (p 115)

:The inclusive alternative is to teach all students in mixed ability groups – by providing support for students who struggle and enrichment for those who learn quickly.  In order to implement this approach, it is necessary to eliminate remedial courses for the sake of student self-esteem and future expectations.  In fact, teachers must raise student expectations for success by providing accessible strategies for working with challenging content.  An important part of the effort to raise expectations is to encourage students from minority groups to enroll in academic level courses. (p 115)

:Under the New Ontario Curriculum, secondary schools use the following (more complex) model for between-class ability grouping:

:''Grades 9-10: Open, Applied, Academic''
:''Grades 11-12: Open, Workplace, College, University/College, University''

:Note that there is no longer a ''basic'' (remedial) level and the fact that ''Open'' courses are deemed appropriate for ''all'' students.  For senior students the options are further diversified, encouraging mixed-ability grouping in ''Open'' and ''University/College'' courses.  

:'''''Does this updated model offer significant/sufficient improvement over previous efforts?  What are the implications for students and teachers?'''''

===&lt;u&gt; Cognitive and Learning Styles &lt;/u&gt;  (pp.116-120)===
'''Cognitive styles''': “Different ways of perceiving and organizing information” (p.117)

Woolfolk advises it is important cognitive styles are differentiated from learning preferences and not confused with one another (p.119). Cognitive styles are not indicators of intelligence levels or special abilities, but are only descriptors of ways in which one perceives, remembers, thinks, etc…In the book an example is given of a person who reacts quickly to a situation versus one who responds at a slower rate after reflective thought (strong markers of impulsive or reflective cognitive styles (p.118)). It goes on to say that both are equally knowledgeable on the topic but just deal with it differently (p.117). 

'''Field dependence vs. Field independence''' (p.118)
Field dependent people observe patterns as a whole and do not separate or break apart elements. Honing in on one aspect of an incident, picking out important details, and reflecting on their strategies in problem solving are often what they have trouble with. According to Woolfolk these people often have success in subjects related to literature and history. They remember information best from social information and work very well in groups. 
Field independent people are often more likely to observe their strategies with their work. They seem to do better at math and science where they are able to use their analytic abilities; as they observe patterns and break apart patterns into components.  

Taking the time to identify attributes such as these could help teachers understand their students’ needs and permit opportunities for better instruction. In the grouping by achievement section (p.117), it recommends students be allotted into groups based on their current performance within the class. It highlights that in such a setting, teachers would be able to walk around and assist students better as each group would require the same/similar sort of instruction to succeed at the task (p.117). I found this to be interesting as it contradicts the popular notion of placing stronger students with weaker students. 
 
'''Learning Preferences''': “Preferred ways of studying and learning such as using pictures instead of text, working with other people versus alone, learning in structured or in unstructured situations, etc…” (p.119)

It is often difficult to get students to understand the importance of unveiling their preferred method of learning.  Many students end up learning in a certain way because there are a lack/no alternatives visible to them. It is important that new ways to learn are presented to students so that they can achieve their optimal performance; the question is how? 

How can you help students understand the importance of recognizing or discovering their learning preferences?

*Many teachers take up some class time to do personality tests.  Although it would take time away from curriculum learnings it is beneficial for the students to help them better understand themselves and their learning styles.  This will, in turn, also benefit the teacher by giving them a better understanding of the students in their classroom.  There are a variety of personality tests out there that an educator can be trained to facilitate.

===&lt;u&gt; Creativity, Giftedness, and Talent &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 120-127) ===
'''Creativity:'''
What is creativity?  How do we recognise it? How do we assess it?  How do we cultivate it?  These questions are assuredly a significant concern to the art educator.  Woolfolk et. al. offer us a definition of creativity that highlights the ability of an individual to produce imaginative &quot;work that is original but still appropriate and useful” in solving important problems (p. 120).  Emphasising that creativity should be recognised as something original (or new) within a social context or field has also been stated by scholars such as Howard Gardner and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. 

: In the realm of creativity and cognition, two areas of study come to the foreground: 
::1. Creative Problem Solving – The process of restructuring problems in new and imaginative ways in order to achieve a creative solution.
::2. Divergent Thinking:  The process of coming up with many different solutions to a problem (i.e. brainstorming).

: Brainstorming: John Baer (quoted in Woolfolk) offers us 4 rules for brainstorming (p. 122):

:: 1. Defer judgement.
:: 2. Avoid ownership of ideas.  Egos can sometimes get in the way of the creative process.
:: 3. Feel free to borrow or modify other ideas.
:: 4. Encourage wild ideas.  Seemingly outrageous ideas can often be modified to suit the needs of a particular situation.

--[[User:Maurosavo|Maurosavo]] ([[User talk:Maurosavo|talk]]) 05:23, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

* Woolfolk’s definition of creativity raises an interesting area to ponder for the arts educator.  What are we trying to accomplish with our students and their creative practice?  

: In music, for instance, what forms of creativity should we be trying to cultivate?  The ministry documents, though they do not make direct references to creativity, would seem to be content on emphasising performance as the primary site if creativity (i.e. the process of creating music).  Many secondary music programs are built around the performance-rehearsal model, where the bulk of time and effort is spent preparing performances of repertoire.  But should that suffice?  Are those performance-focussed students being creative?  

: A hasty response might simply state that merely performing the work of others is not entirely a creative process when compared to activities where the individual has a more active role in the inspiration and composition of a musical work.  Yet, it would be hard to argue that our most celebrated performers were not being creative in their interpretation and performance of musical works even thought they were not the composer of that piece.  Was Glen Gould being creative during his performances works that he did not compose?  It would be unlikely to encounter a many musicians and critics who would argue that his renditions of J.S. Bach’s music were not creative accomplishments.  The question remains, though: How can we foster and assess creativity in performance/repertoire-based activities?   

: In more creativity-based activities (i.e. composition and improvisation), what types of creativity are we to recognise there.  Our definitions of creativity seem contingent upon creating something new within a social context.  It appears as though a re-invention of the wheel would not be regarded as creative by most scholars.  However, would a student who decided to write music with no tonality (despite of never having heard of Schoenberg) be demonstrating creativity in their work?  

: Woolfolk’s definition would seem to argue that this student was not being creative, ant that their work had already been discovered by someone else in the past.  What do we do then?  Do we tell the student that this type of work has already been carried out, perhaps crushing what could have been a meaningful process of inspiration for that student.  Or do we let the student  continue their work, risking that they might eventually become disillusioned with their progress when they inevitably find out that their discovery had been developed (and even rejected) some time ago?

'''Giftedness:'''
There is a common misconception of what giftedness is, or what gifted children are.  To many, gifted children are &quot;bookworms&quot;, or those who are considered to be the geeky nerds of a school's population.  Most school districts consider gifted children to fall in the upper 2%-3% of the IQ spectrum (Weiten, 355); however, this conception is not an accurate depiction of what giftedness entails.  A longitudinal study by, Lewis Terman, in 1921, consisted of approximately 1500 children with an average IQ of 150 (Weiten, 356).  According to Terman's findings, gifted children had more than just above average intelligence they were also, &quot;above average in height, weight, strength, physical health, emotional adjustment, mental health, and social maturity&quot;(Weiten, 356).  Other studies have also found above average qualities in other areas of children's development including, social and emotional development (Weiten, 356).
Interestingly, there is a distinction among giftedness to also consider.  Ellen Winner, distinguishes a difference between moderately gifted children (those with an IQ between 130-150) and those who are profoundly IQ (an IQ above 180; Weiten 356).  She supports the notion that the difference between the two groups lie in temperament.  Winner claims that the latter are more &quot;introverted and socially isolated&quot; and that interpersonal and emotional problems are more likely (Weiten, 356). A further distinction also exists; there are those gifted children whose high-IQ classifies them as the cream of the crop of the school; where as the other group of gifted children are those who are considered &quot;eminent adults who make enduring contributions in their fields&quot; (Weiten, 356).
Another interesting theory from the theorist by the name of Joseph Renzulli, came up with the idea called, '''a three-ring conception of eminent giftedness''' in which high IQ is only one third of the recipe for eminence.  He suggests that a mixture of exceptional ability, creativity and motivation leads some to  vast achievements in their area of interest (Weiten, 356).

''The question that I would like to throw out into the universe is...
How can we foster giftedness in children so that all children can grow up to be eminent adults?
''

:While the sentiment behind this question is clear, it needs to be established that a student identified as gifted is not the same as a student who is high-achieving or unusually self-motivated.  While there are undoubtedly gifted students who possess these characteristics, I disagree with the idea that ‘giftedness’ is something that can or should be fostered.

:With regard to education and curriculum, gifted students (also known as high-ability learners) are identified as individuals who require accommodation that cannot be achieved through the age/grade-appropriate level of curriculum.  High ability learners, like students with learning disabilities, are identified as such because their needs are not being met by the current programming and/or curriculum. For this reason, while giftedness should undoubtedly be supported by both parents and teachers, it is not something that can be ‘fostered’.  

:There are obviously numerous implications for the classroom teacher and there are some important things for educators to keep in mind.  Because gifted students are recognized as students whose needs are not supported by age/grade-appropriate curriculum, the ‘gifted’ label is only relevant in terms of ensuring that the student receives relevant instruction. For some students, this is a necessity earlier on in life but later on the mainstream curriculum will address their needs and for other the students the reverse is true.  Additionally, a student may require special programming in one subject area (eg. science, music) whereas the curriculum may be appropriate for his abilities/needs in other areas of school. For this reason, frequent and thorough assessment of students needs must be a priority.

:High ability learners represent the top 2 percentile of the population and, while all students have the potential and ability to achieve great things, this does not mean all students are, or will be, gifted. Certainly we should encourage, support and adapt our instruction for all students; however, it is important that educators recognize the difference between differentiated instruction and individualized support vs. creating gifted-specific programming and accommodations.

===&lt;u&gt; High-Incidence Disabilities &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 127-140) ===
 
High-Incidence Disabilities are ones teachers will most likely encounter in their classrooms. These include learning disabilities, communication disorders, developmental disabilities and emotional or behavioural disorders. Due to inclusive policies these students will be included in mainstream classes. 

It is important to know that within each general disabilities/disorders, there are many specific branches, which will require different types of modification in order for these students to be equally successful.  

:'''Learning disabilities''' include: oral language (understanding what is being said), reading (comprehension and word recognition), written language (spelling and sentence structure), mathematics (calculations and problem solving).  According to ''LD Online'' 'one in seven children requires special attention in the learning process.&quot;  The following link has lots of information pertaining to learning disabilities from identifying them, to common signs, how to respond and ADHD: http://www.ldonline.org.  It is important to note &quot;No set of teaching techniques will be effective for every learning disabled child.&quot;  (Woolfolk, Winne and Perry, 130)  The special education teachers at each school will design appropriate instruction plans for each individual student and teachers are to implement these strategies along with their support.  

Learning disabilities are most common in our classrooms, with over half of all students receiving special education help being those with a learning disability. Learning disabilities range in severity, but the most common characteristics include: specific difficulties in one or more academic subjects, poor coordination, problems paying attention, hyperactivity and impulsivity; problems organizing and interpreting visual and auditory information; disorders of thinking, memory, speech and hearing; and difficulties making and keeping friends.

:'''Hyperactivity and attention disorders''' include: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - those who have problems with inattention and impulse control along with hyperactivity.  Nylund (2000) has created a new strategy for dealing with ADHD, which &quot;stresses personal agency&quot;.  The idea is to focus on the child's strengths in order to 'conquer' the child's problems - &quot;the focus is on solutions&quot; (Nylund, 2000).  The steps of the SMART approach are:
* '''S'''eparating the problem of ADHD from the child
*'''M'''apping the influence of ADHD on the child and the family
* '''A'''ttending to the exceptions to the ADHD story
*'''R'''eclaiming special abilities of children diagnosed with ADHD
*'''T'''elling and celebrating the new story   (Nylund, 2000, p. xix)


:'''Communication disorders''' include: speech impairments, articulations disorders, stuttering, voicing problems, language disorders.  The best way to be sure to include everyone in conversation regardless of different communication disorders is to teach language in various ways such as sign language and being sure to use jesters when speaking.

:'''Developmental disabilities''' - this term has now replaced 'mental retardation' in Canada (however it is still used in the United States).  The American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) has a classification system that helps identify the type of help needed to support a child to the fullest degree.  This classification scheme ranges as follows:  '''I'''ntermittent, '''L'''imited, '''E'''xtensive, '''P'''ervasive
See the following sites for further information - http://www.aamr.org/  http://aaidd.allenpress.com/aamronline/?request=get-static&amp;name=ajmr-info

An interesting study was done by Lord (1991) where he found that &quot;involvement in the community [is] key to individuals with disabilities feeling empowered and taking charge of their own lives&quot;.  This is a mode of '''transition programming''' where the idea is to help individuals with disabilities prepare for jobs and community lifestyles.

:'''Behavioural and emotional disorders''' include: conduct disorders (aggressive, destructive, disobedient, disruptive), anxiety-withdrawal disorder (withdrawn, anxious, depressed, cry easily).  It is important to note that &quot;...students with learning disabilities, developmental disabilities or ADHD may also have emotional or behavioural problems&quot; (Woolfolk, Winne and Perry, 139) which will be a constant struggle for both themselves, and everyone at school.  It is important to work with the special education teacher at your school in order to design appropriate modes of instruction for such students.

===&lt;u&gt; Low-Incidence Disabilities &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 140-143) ===

Low-incidence disabilities include severe developmental disabilities, autism, sensory impairments that have to do with vision and hearing.  They can also include chronic health concerns and physical disabilities.  Most teachers will only encounter a few students with low-incidence disabilities, but it is their responsibility to be educated about the disability and what strategies can be used in the classroom to meet their needs.  Many students with low-incidence disabilities will have an educational assistant with them in the classroom, and therefore it is important that the teacher and the educational assistant work together to provide the most positive experience for the student. 
 

'''Chronic Health Concerns'''

Students with chronic health concerns will often have special devices to participate in school programs.  If a school can provide the necessary features that these students require then the usual educational program does not need to be greatly altered.  Woolfolk et al. describe two examples of chronic health concerns: Cerebral Palsy – condition involving a range of motor or coordination difficulties due to brain damage, and Epilepsy – disorder marked by seizures and caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the brain.  There are many more chronic health concerns that teachers may come into contact with.  On pp.139 of the text book (Educational Psychology, 3rd Edition), in Table 4.10 there is a list of Special Education Journals where further information on disabilities can be found.


'''Students who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing'''

At the high school level most students who are deaf and hard of hearing will have already been identified.  There are signs that teachers can watch for to determine whether a student is deaf or hard of hearing:
*student turns one ear toward the speaker
*student misunderstands conversation when the speaker’s face cannot be seen
*student does not follow directions, seems distracted or confused at times, does not participate in class discussion
*student frequently asks people to repeat things, mispronouncing new words 
A common perspective says that people who are deaf and hard of hearing are part of a different culture with a different language, values, and social institutions.  The goal for a teacher should be to help their student become bilingual and bicultural, so that they are able to function in both cultures.


'''Students with Low Vision and Blindness'''

Signs a teacher can watch for to determine whether a student has low vision and blindness:
*student holds books very close or far away
*student squints, rubs eyes, complains that their eyes hurt, their eyes may look sore
*student may misread information from the board, be sensitive to light
*student may become annoyed when they have to follow an activity or note from far away 
It is important to watch for signs for low vision.  Many students will struggle with school work because of their vision problem and may not realize they could be receiving help.  For students who are educationally blind, a teacher must work to ensure that the student is aware of the classroom setup, leaving plenty of space around the room, and being consistent with arrangement is the best way to ensure they are comfortable in the classroom.


Technology and special material and equipment have become a great source of help for students with low-incidence disabilities.  It is the teachers’ responsibility to become knowledgeable of the technological resources that are available to assist these students.

This section of the chapter has me wondering how many teachers are actually educated on low-incidence disabilities and the resources that are available.  Do you think that a course in special education should be mandatory for all teachers?  Should it become part of teacher’s college?

===&lt;u&gt; Exceptional Education and Inclusion &lt;/u&gt; (pp. 143-149) ===

'''Introduction:'''

It is important for an educator to be familiar with the diverse needs of each student in the classroom.  This is for the reason that at some point throughout an educator's career, they will encounter exceptional learners in their classrooms and will have to accommodate them accordingly.   


'''Exceptional Education Laws and Policies'''

*Each province differs in terms of the legislation that affects special education across Canada.  To find policies that relation specifically to Ontario, research the '''Education or School Act. ''' 

'''Website:''' http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90e02_e.htm

*'''The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms''' is the only one piece of legislation that has an impact on education across Canada.   Essentially, this piece of legislation protects the rights of all Canadians, in particular, those who are of minority groups and those with disabilities.  

'''Website:''' http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/

*It is important for educators to be accustomed with the terms '''Inclusion''' and '''Integration'''.  As of now, Inclusion is the current policy of all provinces and territories in Canada.  Inclusion is defined as, “the practice of integrating exceptional students into regular education classrooms; the emphasis is on participation rather then placement” (Woolfolk et. al, p. 144).  Integration is defined as &quot;the practice of having exceptional students participate in activities with their non-exceptional peers&quot; (Woolfolk et. al, p. 144).


'''Least Restrictive Placement''' 

*This term refers to how students with exceptional needs should be placed in the most regular, mainstreamed edcational settings as possible.  However, it is essential to ensure that these students receive the proper support appropriate to their special needs.  Thus, students should only be removed from the regular educational environment when the nature or severity of their disability is such that even with the use of supplementary aids and services, education cannot be satisfactorily achieved.


'''Individualized Education Program OR Individual Education Plan (IEP)'''

*It is mandatory for each student with exceptional learning needs to have his/her own education plan so the teacher can meet their distinct needs to ensure their success.  IEP’s can inform and aware the teacher of issues such as the the disability affecting the student, the student’s present level of functioning, the students strengths and weaknesses, a list of specific services needed for the student, and a description of how the student will participate in the program.

This book will describe paper in all its aspects, beginning with the history of paper. The main focus will be on the production of paper, and what kind of paper exist and what their use is. Ecology of paper making and alternatives for paper making will be part of the book as well. 
&lt;/div&gt;

==Importance of paper==
The invention of paper was of high importance for the social development of the human kind. Keeping information, especially for contractual obligations, was vital for the development of trade. Governing a country or an empire became so much easier, when laws and instructions could be written on paper (or any other information carrier) and could be distributed throughout the country or empire.

Without paper the reformation (a religious movement in the 16th century lead by Marten Luther and John Calvin) would not have been possible. One of the most important reasons the reformation could succeed is the fact that the bible was no longer exclusively for the religious clergy, the ordinary people could have access to Gods words. Paper as information carrier lead to education, which helped to develop communities and industry.

There used to be alternatives for paper, but none of them was so cheap and accessible in such huge quantities as paper.

White reinforces the attack on the d5 square and keeps his options open. Black has a variety of answers here, aiming for a King's Indian setup with 2... g6 is an interesting option, 2...e6 is also possible although white can choose to disrupt black's plan of reaching a Nimzo-Indian or QID setup by playing 3.e4 leading to the very sharp and tactical variations known collectively as the Mikenas Carls variation, which black is best advised to avoid if not prepared to face them.

2...e5 is also possible leading to the English four knights and the Bremen system

=Marshall Defence=
A rarely seen opening at the higher levels of chess. Black's knight defends the d5 square, but if white exchanges pawns, it is not too difficult to later gain a tempo by attacking the piece on d5.

== Remove page protection ==

Can someone remove the protection of [[Programming:C plus plus/ctype.h header]], txs... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:11, 5 January 2008 (UTC)
:Done, not sure why it was protected in the first place. --[[User:Az1568|Az1568]]&lt;sup&gt; ([[User talk:Az1568|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 03:27, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

::Txs, I think it was done to enable a merge situation ( [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming#Book_History Book History] )...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:31, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

== [[Special:Userrights]] ==

Bureaucrats now have access to this special page. I do not think sysops can go here. This page is the page that has been used by the stewards: it combines the abilities of [[Special:MakeSysop]] and [[Special:MakeBot]]. I've heard some thigns over the grapevine that seem to indicate that maybe b'crats are going to get more &quot;abilities&quot; through this special page, although that might not be accurate. Current b'crats would probably do well to familiarize themselves with this page. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:30, 1 January 2008 (UTC)
:You are correct, sysops cannot access the page. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 21:36, 1 January 2008 (UTC)

:Simple, yet refined. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:44, 3 January 2008 (UTC)

This can be accessed by sysops in certain cases, I think. For example, if we followed enwiki and allowed sysops to hand out +rollbacker, then sysops could access it, but would only be able to change some of the rights (just like the bcrats can't change all rights through [[Special:Userrights]] - ie you can't give +checkuser). I don't think that we need non-admins with rollback; we don't have enough vandalism to need that.

''But'' I think we could benefit from handing out +patroller so non-sysops can patrol new pages. (There is an option to allow patrolling of any non-patrolled diff, but I don't think it's useful for us, but that's open for discussion. As well, allowing +patroller for autoconfirmed is too low a threshold, I think.) I think the new page patrol could be much better used if we had more people doing it. If you look at [[Special:Log/patrol]], there are only a few names there. I think it'd be useful to spread the work around by giving +patroller to certain users that would like to help with that. I'd think it'd be a fairly low threshold for getting it - essentially a history of new page patrolling without abuse and a willingness to continue new page patrolling should be enough to get the right since +patroller isn't easily abused. Spreading the work around will make the task much less arduous for those who do it, and this allows us to do that without giving +sysop. New page patrol is essentially a perpetual backlog, and I think this will help us use patrolling much more effectively. It's a great software feature, but the burden to use it well it too concentrated currently. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:32, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

:I like this idea for two reasons:
:# it would help to take some strain off our current patrollers (new page and vandalism patrolling, which tend to go hand-in-hand) and 
:# it would create a more graduated system of &quot;advancement&quot; so that active editors can get a taste of administration without having to pre-emptively request adminship (and then get turned down). 
:If we had such features enabled, I would like to make two requests:
:#That admins can hand out +patroller (and possibly +rollback) privileges, and not require bcrats for that (although a trial run that was bcrat-only would be fine if that's what people wanted)
:#That we have the ability to also remove those privileges without requiring steward intervention. If the bar to receive them is so low, we have to account for the risk of &quot;false positives&quot;, or giving the tools to people who can't handle them properly. 
:I would like to see what other people say about it, however. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:04, 10 January 2008 (UTC)
::Both those requirements can (and should) be met. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:43, 10 January 2008 (UTC)
:::Something I would have been very pleased indeed to have when I started here.  There are one or two folk here who I would be very happy to see granted those rights as soon as possible.  +patroller would be good but I would like to see +rollback as well.  Given the variety of .js tools around it will not make a massive difference but with multiple windows and a fairly quick hand a lot of vandalism can be dealt with quite quickly.
:::Are you planning an Rfp/r page or something.  In practice anyone watching RC will know most of the people who maybe should be granted the tools anyway?  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:31, 11 January 2008 (UTC)

::::Anything we can do to make page patrolling easier for those who volunteer to do it sounds like a good idea to me. Might even be better if the RC logs could be changed so admins can see just the rollbacks as well, so we can follow up and block if necessary without the necessity of posting on [[WB:VIP]] (or whatever we're calling that now :-) ), and thus eliminating yet another hoop to jump through. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:46, 11 January 2008 (UTC)

:::::It would be useful if the log shows whether edits/pages were patrolled definitely (Meta's does, Commons does not but &quot;new pages&quot; are shown as patrolled or not).  The other thing is please can we find a nice simple way of dealing with this.  I just looked at en wp - the drama is well up to their usual standards :)
:::::I'm happy to see this 'crat controlled but equally I have no problem with it being an admin controlled issue.  It is a pretty stable (!) bunch here mostly and if it is revocable it is hardly a major issue. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:25, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
::::::I like Johnny's idea of filtering RC to show only rollbacks. I will submit to bugzilla if not already there. The issue will be knowing what is rollback and what isn't. The only way to do that is the edit summary since there's no log entry, but that's not realiable as &amp;summary= can change the rollback default summary, and you can fake it when rollback isn't used. On second thought, I won't bother. It'd have to be scripted, I think.
::::::I agree the process would have to be simple. No enwiki-style drama please. As Herby says, anyone who watches RC already knows who should get +rollbacker. +patroller might be a bit more weighty, but still easy to determine who should get it. A subsection on [[WB:RFA]] should do nicely, I think.
::::::[[Special:Log/patrol]] shows all new page patrols (we don't have diff patrolling, and I don't think we should). Just to reiterate: I think patrolling would be hard to abuse, but there is at least a reliable log entry for every action. Not so with rollback. Nevertheless, if adminship is no big deal, then one or both of these is ''really'' no big deal (a lesson enwiki could do to learn).
::::::As for the disappearance of [[WB:VIP]], I think we still need to make it clearer that we just want people to start a normal section for &quot;please block this doofus&quot; on [[WB:AN]]. I know it's in the intro, but I've seen a few times people going to an admin's talk page. That's fine if they're online or if someone else sees it, but a central location is much more useful &amp; reliable. I may take a look at the intro on that page shortly. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:56, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
:::::::Only en wp could manage to make a good simple idea take up enough energy to raise Atlantis (I see people are now posting there for admin task - I guess the conventional boards have now been abandoned :)).
:::::::Personally I don't see &quot;new pages&quot; patrolling as much of a biggie but I guess rather more knowledge of scope etc would be required.

== [[Template:SharedIP]] ==

I just created some new templates for shared IPs, there's also [[Template:VirginMediaIP]] for Virgin Media as well - hope these are of use.

== Another new toy ==

[[m:MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]] seems a useful idea but given the naming conventions here people with a little more knowledge may want to look at getting this underway [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist|here]].

I'm a tad late with this, but it's been disabled for performance reasons. Apparently it ''will'' make a comeback when it behaves itself.

== Automatic deletion summaries ==

Now that we have the dropdown for deletion reasons (and a good selection, which covers just about anything), I'd like to propose blanking the following MediaWiki: pages to remove the automatic summaries which make the deletion log ugly due to long, unwieldy reasons. These are the things like &quot;Content before blanking was&quot; and &quot;Content was ... and the only contributor was&quot; etc. Those don't really tell you anything useful - it's the other stuff that matters. If you ever need to add something custom, you still can, so you're not restricted to ''only'' the dropdown reasons. The relevant pages are [[MediaWiki:Excontentauthor]], [[MediaWiki:Exblank]], and [[MediaWiki:Excontent]]. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

:I agree, these pages are typically very unhelpful, and trying to include the entire contents of the page in the edit summary causes it to overflow and it's typically just not helpful. We can make them more concise. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:54, 12 January 2008 (UTC)
::&lt;s&gt;Well, seeing as we have [[MediaWiki:Deletereason-dropdown]] and there was no objection, I'm going to blank these pages. If you find that you're deleting something but there isn't a suitable deletion reason in the dropdown, either put a custom reason, or edit the dropdown to add another one if that case will come up again. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:39, 15 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
::There is currently no way to make the messages consist of blank space. I'm going to submit this to bugzilla (although it's clearly trivial) because there should be some method of getting this behaviour. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:39, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

:::: @Mike: Have you tested it with saving as empty page? I think that should work.
:::: But I don't think that's a good idea. For &quot;normal&quot; user it's often helpful, at least for me (in german wb). :) Because so they can controll whether sysops do their job right. If they only write that was e.g. a redirect and the summary is further not filled with ''content was: #REDIRECT ...'' '''I''' am very unsure whether it's right. Of course, there is a risk that the sysop has written it but that's another problem.

:::::None of the developers could make it work earlier, but someone just suggested putting in a comment like &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--this is left blank on purpose--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which I haven't tested yet. Since there's now opposition, I'll leave it be pending further discussion. As for being able to tell that sysops aren't abusing the delete button, it's every admin's reponsibility to leave a half-decent reason. We now have a dropdown combobox for common reasons, but the default reasons still get appended unless you remove them manually. This proposal would remove them by default; if you need to add something extra or if the reason you're deleting isn't adequately covered by an option in the combobox, then you'd have to either add it to the combobox, or add it in the (now blank) deletion reason. Admins shouldn't be deleting stuff with no reason; choosing one from the combobox (and ''not'' having these uninformative reasons appended) helps keep the deletion log clean, and keeps reasons standardized. The only downside is that admins can't just hit delete. That might be a good thing - they have to evaluate why they're deleting. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:02, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

== Temporary Sysopping ==

I've had a request today for [[User:Reedy Boy]] to be promoted to sysop temporarily. He's trying to work out some bugs with [[w:WP:AWB]], a tool that many of our wikibookian administrators use. Apparently, there are some bugs that are specific to wikibooks that simply don't occur on wikipedia. [[User:Reedy Boy]] is already an admin on en.wikipedia, and has promised not to do anything bad with the tools. If there are no objections, I would like to grant this temporarily (probably for a week or less), and then we can have the stewards remove the tools after the necessary debugging is performed. Are there any problems with this? If not, I would like to do it soon so that the testing can commence. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:43, 16 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{support}} - Reedy Boy is not going to delete the main page. In fact, he probably won't use the rights at all; he only needs them to debug proper ''detection'' of the rights in AWB. All the relevant bugs have all been reported by me and can be seen at [[w:Wikipedia talk:AutoWikiBrowser/Bugs]]. The issue with converting to talk pages makes AWB useless as a bot for warning uploaders, which was one of the main tasks I've used [[User:Mike's bot account]] for. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:56, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

== [[User talk:212.219.247.220|This user should probably be blocked]] ==

I would like to report this user as a consistent vandal. Herby has warned him and so have I. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 23:05, 24 January 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol wait.svg|15px]] '''Not yet''' - Only the one latest edit was recent, and they seem to have stopped. Since the IP belongs to what looks like a university dorm, they may make a comeback. If so, we'll consider blocking at that time. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:17, 25 January 2008 (UTC)
::Agree with Mike (&amp; responded on Laleena's page).  Blocking is to prevent further disruption - if they stop (&amp; the disruption hasn't been bad) we don't block.  Equally Laleena &amp; I both warned them about teh same edit.

:::I think you are both right, but what do you mean by a &quot;university dorm&quot; and why on earth would such people vandalize? It seems rather strange. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 12:44, 25 January 2008 (UTC)
::::See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:212.219.247.220 here] for a little more info.  One problem is that now they are blocked for a year on en wp they look for other places to &quot;play&quot;.  Other than open proxies (rather rare now!) schools/educational establishments generally are probably the main source of vandalism (perhaps better described as &quot;immature editing&quot; really).

Keys are named according to these conventions:

* ''x'''''KEY''' — key labelled ''x'' on main keyboard (e.g. '''AKEY''' for key labelled A)
* '''NUM'''''x'' — key labelled ''x'' on numeric keypad (e.g. '''NUM1''' for key labelled 1). You may need to ensure Num Lock is on for these keys to work.
* ''x'''''MB''' — mouse button, ''x'' = '''L'''eft, '''M'''iddle or '''R'''ight.
* '''MW''' — mouse wheel.
* ''modifier'''''+'''''key'' — while holding down ''modifier'' ('''ALT''', '''CTRL''', '''SHIFT'''), press ''key'' (e.g. '''CTRL+XKEY''' means press '''XKEY''' while holding down '''CTRL'''). There may be more than one modifier, all of which are to be held down at once.
* ''key1'' ''key2'' — press ''key1'', let go, then press ''key2'' (e.g. '''GKEY''' '''XKEY''' to press '''GKEY''' followed by '''XKEY'''). Sequence may consist of more than two keys. Each key may have its own modifiers.

The intent of this book is to be a set of solutions for common problems in the SilverStripe CMS ('content management system').

== About SilverStripe ==

SilverStripe is an MVC (model/view/controller) Framework and Content Management System based on PHP5 and MySQL5.

== Building a module ==

=== Loading page specific JavaScript and CSS ===

&lt;pre&gt;
// controller
class Movies_Controller extends Page_Controller
{
	// init
	function init()
	{	
		Requirements::javascript('mysite/javascript/movies.js');

		parent::init();
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) in the CMS ===

Let's say that we need to allow the Administrator to edit the list of coders in the Developers section.

First we need to create the Developers DataObject.

&lt;pre&gt;
class Developers_DataObject extends DataObject
{
        // fields
	static $db = array(
		'Name'		=&gt;'Varchar(150)',
		'Lastname'	=&gt;'Varchar(150)',);

	// edit form in the CMS
	function getCMSFields_forPopup()
	{
		$fields = new FieldSet();
		$fields-&gt;push( new TextField( 'Name', 'Name:' ) );
		$fields-&gt;push( new TextField( 'Lastname', 'Lastname:' ) );
		return $fields;
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the same DataObject, we need to define the fields for the form.

Next, we need to create the Page type for the Developers section.

&lt;pre&gt;
class Developers_Page extends Page {

    // make the relation between the section and the list of coders
    static $has_one = array(
        'MyDeveloper' =&gt; 'Developers_DataObject'
    );


    // manage the relation in the CMS
    function getCMSFields()
    {
        // don't overwrite the main fields
        $fields = parent::getCMSFields();

        $tablefield = new HasOneComplexTableField(
	    $this,
            'MyDeveloper',
            'Developers_DataObject', 
            array(
	        'Name' =&gt; 'Name',
		'Lastname' =&gt; 'Lastname',), 
            'getCMSFields_forPopup');

            // add a new tab in the CMS
            $fields-&gt;addFieldToTab( 'Root.Content.Coders', $tablefield );
					
            return $fields;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Our next step is to create a new page &quot;Developers&quot;. 

Now we need to go to &quot;Behaviour&quot; and change the page type to Developers. 

This new page will have a tab called &quot;Coders&quot;, where we can edit the developers list.

== Relationing a DataObject with a Module ==

In this case we'll make a relation between Movies and Cities. Then we'll allow the administrator to add new cities in a page type 'Movies'.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
/*
 * Local Cities Data Object
 * 
 */
class LocalCitiesDataObject extends DataObject
{
	static $db = array(
		&quot;Name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Varchar(150)&quot;
	);
	
	// relation
	static $has_one = array(
		'LocalCities' =&gt; 'Movies' // 1-n relation
	);
	
	// edit form for the CMS
	function getCMSFields_forPopup()
	{
		$fields = new FieldSet();
		$fields-&gt;push( new TextField( 'Name' ) );
		return $fields;
	}
}

/**
 * Defines the Movies page type
 */
class Movies extends Page
{

	// relation
	static $has_many = array(
		'LocalCities' =&gt; 'LocalCitiesDataObject' // 1-n relation
	);

	// records list in the CMS
	function getCMSFields()
	{
		// don't overwrite the defaults fields for the Page
		$fields = parent::getCMSFields();

		// for handling 1-n relation
		$tablefield = new HasManyComplexTableField(
			$this,
         	'LocalCities', // the name of the relationship
         	'LocalCitiesDataObject', // the related table 
			array(
				&quot;Name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Name&quot;
			),
	         'getCMSFields_forPopup' // the function to build the add/edit form
         );

         $fields-&gt;addFieldToTab( 'Root.Content.Cities', $tablefield );
         
         return $fields;
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Papyrus ==
Paper is derived from the Greek word pápyros, the name for the papyrus plant. This plant grows only on the shore lines of streams in the Middle East, like the river Nile (a river in Africa which flows into the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt). The &quot;paper&quot; from the papyrus plant was first used by the Babylonians and thereafter by the Egyptians (around 3000 B.C.).  Also the Greeks and Romans used papyrus, amongst others for contractual obligations.

The &quot;paper&quot; from the papyrus plant was made from the stem of the plant. The outer rind is first stripped off, and the sticky fibrous inner pith is cut lengthwise into thin strips. The strips are then placed side by side on a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping, and then another layer of strips is laid on top at a right angle. While still moist, the two layers are hammered together, mashing the layers into a single sheet. The moisture or juice from the strips function as adhesive between the layers. The sheet is then dried under pressure. 
&lt;/div&gt;

== Other early information carriers ==
The oldest known information carriers are cave paintings. The paintings tell us about ordinary life in those days. The Sumer wrote with cuneiform script on soft clay tablets around 3200 B.C. This is about the same time when the Egyptians used soapstone. Other organic information carriers, besides papyrus, were leather, parchment, wood and bark. The Romans also used wax for texts which did not need to last for a long time. Especially for buildings the texts were inscripted into the stone of the building. The early Chinese also used materials like shells, bones and ivory. The early Indians uses leaves of palms. Also used as information carrier were jade, iron, gold, silver, tin, bronze, bamboo and silk.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Invention of paper==
Paper made out of plant like fibres was invented by the Chinese [[w:Cai Lun|Cai Lun]], who in 105 AD mixed textile fibres and fibres from the bark of the mulberry in water and produced sheets of paper from that. The invention of paper was one of the reasons of the successes of early China, through easier governing of the country.

Archeological findings have shown that paper made from plantlike fibres, were already used from 140 to 87 BC.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Papermaking knowledge moves out of China==
The art of papermaking was first exported from China to Korea and Japan around 610 AD. Arabic people have learned the papermaking technique in the 8th century from Chinese, as is being told, from Chinese people skilled in papermaking who were captured. The Arabic people spread the knowledge during there military campaigns in the North of Africa and the South of Europe. The first paper manufacturing in Europe started in 1144 in Xativa (near Valencia) in Spain. The first papermaking in countries in Europe, which were not controlled by the Arabians, was in the 13th century in Italy and Spain, although the usage of paper was already known in Europe since about 1100. A paper mill in Fabriano (near Ascona) in Italy existed in 1276 (and still exists nowadays). Around this time sizing paper with animal glue was invented in Italy. The Germans had their first paper mill in 1389, followed by the rest of Europe at the end of the 15th century. In Belgium the first paper production was in Huy (Hoei) in 1405 and in Holland in in Dordrecht in 1586.
&lt;/div&gt;

|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;''Papierproduction before the mechanisation of papermaking''&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==Where was the paper production located==
The ideal location for paper production was determined by two factors:
*The presence of raw materials
*The accessibility to power and energy
The presence of raw materials was, before the invention which made the use of fibres from trees possible, depending on availability of rags. The rags, used clothes, were more available in urban areas. The fibres, which were used for producing paper, were cotton.

The presence of power was necessary for the milling process needed to make fibres fit for papermaking. Wind mills or water mills were used as power sources.

So paper mills in the old days were located at urban areas with access to wind or water power. Nowadays the energy source is not important, so that you can see a trend of concentration of paper industry to the areas where raw materials (old paper and trees) are.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Further mechanisation and development of the paper production==
An important invention was made around 1670 and was called the &quot;Hollander&quot;. This machine improved the milling process of the fibre much, and made it therefore also possible to use other fibres than cotton from rags. Now also (old) ropes and fishing nets could be used. This increased the availability of raw materials much.

In 1744 the bleaching characteristics of chlorine was discovered and at the end of the 18th century this knowledge was used to bleach cotton, the raw material for paper.

The invention of the paper machine at the end of the 19th century increased mechanisation of papermaking further and therefore increased production capacity. Donkin in England and Robert in France developed the first paper machines. Mongolfier and Fourdrinier developed the concept further; a machine with a forming section (wet end), press section and dryer section was developed. The paper machines used nowadays still have a similar build, so that those machines are still often called Foudrinier machines.

In 1806 another important invention was the sizing of the paper. In order to improve the writing characteristics of a paper you need sizing of paper. Until 1806 this was done with animal gelatine. This process was replaced with aluminium sulphate and rosin size.

Around 1845 it became possible to use fibres from wood. The German Friedrich Gottlob developed a process to free the fibres out of wood with a grinding wheel. The development of alternative raw material sources was strengthened by the short supply of rags and at the same time increased demand for paper. Paper made from stone groundwood pulp had more yellowing due to the presence of lignin, so that quality paper was still produced from rags.

At the end of the 19th century a bleaching process was developed in Scandinavia, which made it possible to remove lignin out of stone groundwood. The yellowing of paper decreased much due to this process, so that cotton fibres from rags lost its importance as raw material for paper.

During the 20th century de technology behind the paper machine developed further, so that the production speed and the quality of the produced paper increased. The use of process control and measurement which started in the sixties made even further improvements possible.

Around 1985 a further important development was made in the bleaching technology for fibres. First the bleaching with chlorine was replaced with bleaching with chlorates and chlorine dioxide (Elementary Chlorine Free = ECF) and after that the development of bleaching process without use of chlorine containing agents, like ozone, oxygen and peroxide (Totally Chlorine Free = TCF).
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">OK, so you've created a character who is arrogant, sociable or inquisitive. But how do you get your reader to surmise that she or he is indeed arrogant, sociable or inquisitive? You want your reader to be able to tell.

==Action==

The most common (and most pervasive) outlet for giving readers an impression of your characters is through the character's actions. A cruel character will do cruel things. Anything from the most ground-quaking event to the most quotidian reveals character. There is a rule of thumb, don't say &quot;character X is funny&quot;, make him do funny things and the reader may realize that. It is the principle of showing instead of telling.

For instance, if you write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tina dipped her left pinkie delicately into the finger bowl. Oh, how she loved this dinner!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reader will get the impression that Tina is dainty and proper.

Having your character tell his mother the truth when she asks what he did on a perfectly ordinary school day does not build the impression that he is an honest character, as only a person suffering from problems with confabulation would find any reason to lie about that. However, suppose you had your character turn in missing tickets she found:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Her arm shaking, Rachel took one last look at the concert tickets. &quot;They're all yours&quot;, she said quietly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Oh, thank you once again,&quot; the woman with the blue purse said, falling all over Rachel. &quot;I don't know how I'm ever going to repay you.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I really wanted to see Fourth Ear Deaf in concert.&quot; Rachel looked down. &quot;But these tickets weren't really mine.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Girl&quot;, said the woman, &quot;To see someone with the integrity of you made my day. That will bring me more joy than seeing any concert.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The woman took the tickets from Rachel's hand and put them safely in her purse. She crumpled her hands up, thinking about the upcoming Fourth Ear Deaf concert. Rachel gave one last wistful glare, then turned away.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then you (and your character) have really impressed the reader! 

If you only write parts that advance the plot, you will have to have the characters' personalities be really central to the major events -- they must be ''behind'' these events -- if your characters are to come across in the reading. Including chapters that focus more on the everyday life and personality of the characters -- the &quot;packing peanuts&quot; -- gives you more flexibility, as you get more chances to develop every aspect of a character. Using the example of a cruel character doing cruel things, in the major plot-moving sections you can have your character betray another, or even kill off the protagonist at the end. In the more mundane sections, you can have your character stick dynamite up a cat's rectum right before he meets another character in a dark alley, or push over a disabled student on a school day, or crack a tasteless, heartless joke during a conversation at the hamburger joint.

==Dialogue==

Main chapter: [[Writing Adolescent Fiction/Dialogue|Dialogue]]

In real life, you draw some major conclusions about the people you meet by listening to what they say. So will your reader draw conclusions from reading what your fictional characters say. Suppose you are reading a novel and hear Mindy speaking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Let's go!&quot;, said Mindy. &quot;Take your sticks and beat Buena Vista over the head! Come on! Come on!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Noelle rubbed the end of her lacrosse stick, glanced up and Mindy and looked back down. &quot;Wish me luck.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Luck? We're not going to need luck. We're going to win by our force and strength. What are you waiting for?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You get the idea that Mindy is loud, aggressive, a go-getter and much like a sergeant in the army.

Almost every sentence a character speaks can give you some idea of who the character is. A lot of television shows, in order to save time (after all, they only have 26 minutes), will have a character slam down the telephone without saying good-bye. &quot;Saving time&quot; like this is a bad idea in written fiction. Saying &quot;Good-bye&quot; after completing a phone call is such an ingrained convention observed by the vast majority of people that ''not'' saying good-bye would be a stronger indication of the type of person a character is than actually saying good-bye would.

==Word choice==

The power of dialogue doesn't stop at the sentiments expressed in the character's sentences. The very words themselves can reveal something about his character. Consider the differences between the following characters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I saw Ben pooping under the tree in the backlot&quot;, said Chris.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I saw Ben defecating under the tree in the backlot&quot;, said Trav.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I saw Ben taking a shit under the tree in the backlot&quot;, said Mark.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I saw Ben leaving his memoirs under the tree in the backlot&quot;, said Denzel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I saw Ben shaking his pepper shaker under the tree in the backlot&quot;, said Miguel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I saw Ben going poo-poo under the tree in the backlot&quot;, said Billy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

See [[Writing Adolescent Fiction/Dialogue|Dialogue]] for more on the power of word choice.

==Thoughts==

In addition to the character's words, the things the character thinks but does not say can reveal him or her.

Suppose your character Natalie sees a boy walking by and thinks the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Natalie looked appraisingly at Josh and then stopped there and stared. ''As if!'', she thought. ''Is this guy even aware that a choker necklace is dorky and so not hip? I am so not going to date him.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Natalie has not said a word so far, yet the reader will already be sure that Natalie is not only fashion-conscious, but superficial.

When the writer uses this technique extensively, it is called [[wikipedia:Stream of consciousness|Stream of consciousness]]. Some examples are Ulysses, by Joyce; Hopscotch, by Julio Cortázar.

==Dress==

We get our first impressions of people we see by how they are dressed, and so will your reader.

How neatly a character is dressed can provide instant clues as to his or her personality. If Jerry has the top three buttons on his shirt unbuttoned and his baseball cap on at a totally odd angle, with his jacket fit loosely on his back, the reader will conclude that Jerry is rather slipshod. You plant in the reader, among other things, that Jerry does not pay attention to small details and would likely not get a good grade on the upcoming bio quiz on binomial nomenclature. If Phil's shirt is tucked in, on the other hand, your readers will expect Phil to be meticulously conventional. If your character is kind of flaky or if your character has ADD, perhaps she will come to school one day with her sweater inside-out.

The kind of clothes someone is wearing provide a lot of information about who they are. They can identify what clique your character belongs to: someone with a black trenchcoat, black eye make-up and a pentagram necklace could be identified as a goth. Someone who wears a beret to school would probably be artistic. A rugby shirt, or a baby doll dress, or capris, or a ra-ra skirt, or a cowboy hat, or wallet chains all have their associations, and bring certain personality traits to mind.

How the outfit is put together can also give an impression of a person. Someone who wears green sweatpants with a puce sweatshirt is not the same kind of person as someone who comes in blue chinos, white shirt and beige jacket. Often writers, cartoonists or screenwriters show that someone is the absent-minded professor type by having him wear mismatched socks, but this has become a cliché and you should avoid it.

Having your character change and dress differently on two occasions can also reveal something about him or her:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cole locked the door and started to throw off his black Chromica T-shirt. About to start class in less than a half-hour, be figured he better throw on a red polo shirt. Then he opened his closet where a cashmere sweater was folded neatly. He put it on over his polo shirt and looked into the mirror.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cole seems rather like a plastic metalhead. A character who wore the polo shirt and cashmere sweater all the time, or who wore Chromica T-shirts to school, would be quite a different kind of person.

==Likes and dislikes==

Who doesn't like chocolate ice-cream? Such a statement is used to express how good chocolate ice-cream is, but questions like this can help construct a character's image or personality. If your character likes ice-cream, sure it is helpful to establish that they are rather average. But if a character is a pessimist or more morose or dark character, they may say
&quot;Ice-cream? Blech, no. Too sweet.&quot; People have just learned something about this character. A character who like football, basketball &amp; jogging obviously likes exercise. A character who is fat obviously won't enjoy such things.
One of the things you must remember is that people don't do things that they don't want to do. Even things they don't really want to do, like homework and doing the dishes, they are really choosing the lesser of two evils (they choose to do their chores rather than be punished) so what a character likes gives a little insight into what a character does, or wants to do.
Now, of course, you can run at it like a neanderthal and say:
Suzie likes cooking and puppy dogs.
But both you and the reader will have more fun if you have Suzie cook something and express her delight at doing so, then give the dog the bowl to lick, all the while smiling from ear to ear.
Very important however, is that you really shouldn't mention a 'like' unless you are going to write about it. Your readers will feel short-changed if you mention that Gary likes sky-diving, and then never ever mention sky-diving again.

With dislikes however, don't get confused with fear. When I say I hate spiders, I mean that I am afraid of them. If I mention that a character is afraid of spiders, it may be interpretted as a chekov's gun, and people will expect my character to be confronted by spiders at some point.
Also, if John hates Ashley, then this is also not dislike, this is rivalry. If John is the protagonist, people will expect Ashley to be the antagonist, if not an obstacle.
These can however, both be interpretted in certain ways. Perhaps a fear of spiders is a way of showing that a character is afraid of silly things, and as such is cowardly. Perhaps John hating Ashley shows how John is an aggressive character.
Just be careful that you aren't saying something that you don't mean.
Otherwise, dislikes are very similar to likes. If Peter dislikes reading, it shows that he is probably a more outgoing or active character than Benjamin, the little bookworm who loves reading science fiction stories.

Which brings us to the main and probably most important feature of likes and dislikes. And that is the question &quot;Why?&quot;.
Jeremy likes to eat potato chips, but dislikes dogs. This can say something of a character, perhaps Jeremy is lazy, or doesn't like healthy food. Perhaps he is too irresponsible and hates the idea of looking after an animal. You can learn something here.
However, what if I told you that Jeremy likes potato chips, because when he was younger he and his father used to sit on the couch, eating potato chips, watching action films. This shows that Jeremy likes his father. Liking potato chips is just one facet of this, and there may be many others.
What if Jeremy dislikes dogs, because as a child he was bitten by a dog?
Perhaps he is traumatised, or maybe he has scars. This all adds up to what a character is. Think about what you like and dislike and why.
Knowing such things helps to construct characters

==What other characters say about him or her==

==Describing directly==

Of course, there is always outright telling the reader what your character's personality is like:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fred was masculine, short-spoken and dependable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even when writers do this, their characters' personalities usually shine through anyway through their actions, dialogue, etc. In fact, there is not much use to this ''direct characterization'', as it is called, since if you ''do'' also show a character trait through actions or dialogue, describing the character becomes redundant, and if you ''don't'' show a personality trait anywhere in the story, the trait is probably not worth mentioning.

However, do use direct characterization if your characteristic is so impressionistic that no indirect characterization can perfectly convey it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mandelyn was a light, kelp-free wave briefly visiting upon the shore, with all the simple but mysterious elegance of a Japanese rock garden.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==A final word==

If you have some packing peanuts in your story -- a chapter or part of a chapter that does not move the plot along -- make the best of it and write parts that really show what your characters are like. A dialogue between two different characters, or even two ostensibly similar characters, can bring out the differences in their personality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Epithelial tissues are a well-defined group.  They are the tissues that cover and line surfaces.  
Most glands are also epithelial tissues because they developed from multiple foldings of surface tissues during development.  
Examples of epithelia would be the skin, the lining of the gastrointestinal tract and lining of airways to the lungs and 
blood vessels.  Also, sweat glands, thyroid gland and the liver, which originates as a very large gland.

Epithelial tissues are often on vulnerable surfaces where they will receive damage and wear and tear, like the 
stomach and the skin.  For this reason they need to be able to regenerate well.  They generally do.  Everyone is familiar 
with the healing process after sunburn, or a slight abrasion or thin scratch to the skin.  If the damage is not too extensive, 
the regenerations appears to be perfect.  Coupled with this ability to grow and recover from damage, epithelial tissues are 
also the most vulnerable to cancer.  This is because cancer is basically a disease of uncontrolled growth and is uncommon in 
tissues which have limited capacity for growth.  

Epithelial tissues have a straightforward classification system.  There are just two factors:  

#The number of layers 
of cells.  
#The shape of the cells.  

The classification by layers is the simplest possible:  One layer, or more than one .  One layer 
is called simple, and more than one layer is called stratified.  The classification of shapes is also simple, there are only 
three shapes:  Short, medium and tall.   The short cells are flat and are called squamous.  The medium cells are as tall as 
they are broad, often appear like squares under the microscope, and are termed cuboidal.  The tall cells are taller than they 
are broad and are termed columnar.

So three shapes can be combined with two terms for number of layers to give six possible epithelia:  Simple squamous 
(single layer of flat cells), simple cuboidal (single layer of medium cells), and simple columnar (single layer of tall cells), 
stratified squamous (more than one layer of flat cells), stratified cuboidal and stratified columnar. This simple mathematical
regularity is ruined by the biology and there are actually two more important epithelia:  Transitional and pseudostratified columnar.

{{BookCat}}
These tissues include the skin and the inner surfaces of the body, such as those of the lungs, stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. Because its primary function is to protect the body from injury and infection, epithelium is made up of tightly packed cells with little intercellular substance between them.
About 12 kinds of epithelial tissue occur. One kind is stratified squamous tissue found in the skin and the linings of the esophagus and vagina. It is made up of thin layers of flat, scalelike cells that form rapidly above the blood capillaries and are pushed toward the tissue surface, where they die and are shed. Another is simple columnar epithelium, which lines the digestive system from the stomach to the anus; these cells stand upright and not only control the absorption of nutrients but also secrete mucus through individual goblet cells. Glands are formed by the inward growth of epithelium-for example, the sweat glands of the skin and the gastric glands of the stomach. Outward growth results in hair, nails, and other structures. See Epithelium

It would be a good idea to reorganize the TOC into task-specific sections. With FBtoC as the only form of FutureBASIC now under development, there is no need to separate the Wikibook based on FBtoC being &quot;different&quot; in some way. It is FutureBASIC now. --[[User:Poetcsw|C. S. Wyatt]] ([[User talk:Poetcsw|talk]]) 22:41, 24 January 2009 (UTC)

I'm definitely for setting some standards and those should be part of the documentation. It should be noted that the WikiMedia convention is to not override the Wiki design; there is no easy way to force new styles because the text is meant to be portable -- like the original idea for the Web (content is king). 

I will add a &quot;Document Conventions&quot; page, if there isn't one, and we can update that for some uniform guidelines. --[[User:Poetcsw|C. S. Wyatt]] ([[User talk:Poetcsw|talk]]) 22:24, 24 January 2009 (UTC)

Hi,

I think we need a set of editing rules so that all pages in the book look consistent. For example, I see sometimes keywords written in capitals, some other times in lowercase characters. We must adopt here clear conventions.

I believe also that inline styles are not a good idea. Example :

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;/* '''Not Supported in FBtoC''' */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Although I don't know how CSS files are included in the web pages and how one can acess them to edit them, we will be better off defining CSS rules designed to apply to certain elements. The code above would become something like that:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rem&quot;&gt;/* '''Not Supported in FBtoC''' */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Furthermore, we should follow as closely as possible the conventions stated in the chapter titled &lt;i&gt;&quot;Introduction to the FB language&quot;&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represent placeholders which should be replaced as indicated in the description;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items in &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represent literal text that you should enter exactly as shown;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items in &lt;code&gt;plain non-italic text&lt;/code&gt; represent literal text that you should usually enter exactly as shown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I have the Reference Manual in Word format, for those interested (I guess I must ask Staz Software if I can give it away).

Your thoughts?

As an additional note, someone has to upload the pictures needed for the manual. Who is going to do that job?  And once done, is there a way for anyone to browse them to get their reference?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Erlang Functions==

To see a function in erlang we can create the file: even_prime.erl with the following code.

 -module(even_prime).                           % 1
 -export([is_even_prime/1]).                    % 2
                                                % 3 
 is_even_prime(2) -&gt;                            % 4   clause 1 is simple
     true;                                      % 5
 is_even_prime(N) when is_integer(N) -&gt;         % 6   clause 2 has a guard: is_integer(N)
     false;                                     % 7
 is_even_prime(Any) -&gt;                          % 8   clause 3 is simple
     'I prefer integer inputs'.                 % 9

The function clauses are put in the order that they are checked. First &lt;b&gt; is_even_prime(2) &lt;/b&gt; is checked for a match. If the argument matches then &lt;b&gt; true &lt;/b&gt; is returned. This clause ends in a semicolon because the function is not finished being defined. If &lt;b&gt; is_even_prime(2) &lt;/b&gt; fails to match then &lt;b&gt; is_even_prime(N) &lt;/b&gt; is tried. &lt;b&gt; is_even_prime(N) &lt;/b&gt; is checked for a match. N is a variable that matches any integer. The statement &lt;b&gt; when is_integer &lt;/b&gt; is a [[Erlang_Programming/guards|guard]] that admits only integer types to N. The semicolon says we have more to go. The period at the end tells us that the function is finished being defined. &lt;b&gt; is_even_prime(Any) &lt;/b&gt; matches anything of any type and returns the value &lt;b&gt; 'I prefer integer inputs'. &lt;/b&gt; The function is now finished. This function is a total function and should cover all possible single argument inputs.

outputs:

 &lt;b&gt; 2&gt; c(even_prime). &lt;/b&gt;
 ./even_prime.erl:8: Warning: variable 'Any' is unused
 {ok,even_prime} 

 &lt;b&gt; 3&gt; even_prime:is_even_prime(2). &lt;/b&gt;
 true 

 &lt;b&gt; 4&gt; even_prime:is_even_prime(1). &lt;/b&gt;
 false 

 &lt;b&gt; 5&gt; even_prime:is_even_prime(seven). &lt;/b&gt;
 'I prefer integer inputs'

 ==================================================================
 Syntax/structure of a function: 
 ==================================================================
 semicolon     - ends a clause
 period        - ends a function 
 when          - starts a guard
 arrow         - separates the head from the tail of the function
 function head - input part of function includes the signature and guard
 function tail - output/consequence(s) part of function
 signature     - the function name and argument structure/count
 ==================================================================
 rotate_list( [H|T] ) when is_atom(H) -&gt; T ++ [H].
                                      .
 [----signature-----] [----guard----] .  
                                      .                     
 [-----------function head----------] .  [--function tail--]

==Erlang Guards==

===Guard structures===

Legal guards in Erlang are boolean functions placed after the key word, &quot;when&quot; and before the arrow, &quot;-&gt;&quot;. Guards may appear as part of a function definition, 'receive' 'if', 'case' and 'try/catch' expressions.

We can use a guard in a function definition &lt;br&gt;
Example program: guardian.erl

 -module(guardian).
 -compile(export_all).
    
 the_answer_is(N) when N =:= 42 -&gt; true;
 the_answer_is(N) -&gt; false.
    
 % ============================================= &gt;% 
 %
 % Example output:
 %
 % c(guardian).
 % ok
 %
 % guardian:the_answer_is(42).
 % true
 %
 % guardian:the_answer_is(21).
 % false

and Fun definition

  F = fun
    (N) when N =:= 42 -&gt; true;
    (N) -&gt; false
  end.

receive expression

  receive
    {answer, N} when N =:= 42 -&gt; true;
    {answer, N} -&gt; false
  end.

if expression

  if 
    N =:= 42 -&gt; true;
    true -&gt; false
  end.

case expression

  case L of
    {answer, N} when N =:= 42 -&gt; true;
    _ -&gt; false
  end.

and try/catch

  try find(L) of
     {answer, N} when N =:= 42 -&gt; true;
     _ -&gt; false
  catch
     {notanumber, R} when is_list(R) -&gt; alist;
     {notanumber, R} when is_float(R) -&gt; afloat
     _ -&gt; noidea
  end.

You will notice that in these examples it would be clearer (in real code) to remove the guard and 
modify the pattern matching instead. 

Literate programming note: Anonymous match variables that start with an underscore like &quot;_&quot; are not generally recommended. Rather, it is nice to use some descriptive variable name like &quot;_AnyNode&quot;. On the other hand, for tutorial code like this, a descriptive variable is more distracting than helpful.

  case L of
    {node, N} when N =:= 42 -&gt; true;
    _AnyNode -&gt; false
  end.

===Multiple guards===
It is possible to use multiple guards within the same function definition or expression. When using multiple guards, a semicolon, &quot;;&quot;, signifies a boolean &quot;OR&quot;, while a comma, &quot;,&quot;, signifies boolean &quot;AND&quot;.

 the_answer_is(N) when N == 42, is_integer(N) -&gt; true;
 geq_1_or_leq_2(N) when N &gt;= 1; N =&lt; 2 -&gt; true;

===Guard functions===
  
There are several built-in-functions (BIFs) which may be used in a guard. 
Basically we are limited to checking the type with, is_type(A) and the length of some types with, 
type_size() or length(L) for a list length.

 is_alive/0                     
 is_boolean/1                    
 is_builtin/3                    
 is_constant/1                   
 is_float/1                      
 is_function/2      is_function( Z, Arity)               
 is_function/1                  
 is_integer/1                    
 is_list/1                       
 is_number/1                     
 is_pid/1                        
 is_port/1                      
 is_record/3                    
 is_record/2                     
 is_reference/1                 
 is_tuple/1      
 
 tuple_size/1
 is_binary/1
 is_bitstring/1
 bit_size/1
 byte_size/1        
 length(Z) &gt; N 

 A &gt; B
 A &lt; B
 A == B
 A =&lt; B
 A &gt;= B
 A /= B
 A =:= B     exactly equal
 A =/= B     exactly not equal

Note: all erlang data types have a natural sort order.

 atom &lt; reference &lt; port &lt; pid &lt; tuple &lt; list ...

      <text xml:space="preserve">Clojure is a dynamic programming language for the JVM.

== Introduction ==

People come to Clojure from a variety of backgrounds. The purpose of this book is to help everyone get the most out of the Clojure language. It is not meant as a replacement for the documentation, found at [http://clojure.org the Clojure site]. Please do not copy material from there to here!

Feel free to post your own code, written in the Clojure language, here.
However, please do not post excerpts, patches or other modifications or derivations of the Clojure source itself, as the license of this Wiki is incompatible with the Clojure license.
Instead, post such things to [http://groups.google.com/group/clojure the Clojure discussion group].
&lt;!-- or is there an even better place for such things? --&gt;

== Implementations ==

There are a number of different implementations of the Clojure language:

* [http://clojure.org/ Clojure] (the original Java-based implementation)
* [https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript ClojureScript] (compiles to JavaScript)
* [https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr ClojureCLR] (for Microsoft's .NET framework)
* [https://github.com/halgari/clojure-py clojure-py] (Python-based)
* [https://github.com/takeoutweight/clojure-scheme clojure-scheme] (compiles to Scheme)
* [https://github.com/schani/clojurec ClojureC] (compiles to C)

See also [https://github.com/halgari/clojure-metal Clojure-metal] (thoughts/plans for Clojure on LLVM).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Erlang modules==

Each Erlang Programming source file 
 utility.erl 

is required to be a separate module. Modules are created with the module statement. 

 -module(utility).         % 1
 -export([rotate/1]).      % 2
                           % 3
 rotate([H|T]) -&gt;          % 4
     T ++ [H].             % 5

compile with 
     c(utility).

run with
     utility:rotate([1,2,3]).

and get
     [2,3,1].

&quot;utility&quot; is the module created by the file utility.erl

utility functions like rotate can be imported elsewhere with:
     -import(utility).

so now we do not need to use the &quot;utility:&quot; prefix.
Importing modules is not generally recommended. This is very similar to python and Java imports.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many various kinds of analysis, and in very few of of them Maple may help. One of the &quot;maplable&quot; analyses is the 
'''Asymptotical analysis'''. It is typical, that at calculus of cumbersome expressions, small values of some parameters are especially interesting.
One can evaluate derivatives and then approximate the function with truncated Tailor series. As these operations often appear together, there is special service called '''series'''.

===Examples of series===

 series(sin(x), x, 4)

returns 

 x-1/6*x^3+O(x^4)
 
because the function sin has known derivatives. If the function is not known, the derivatives remain in general form:

 s(0)+(D(s))(0)*x+1/2*((`@@`(D, 2))(s))(0)*x^2+1/6*((`@@`(D, 3))(s))(0)*x^3+O(x^4)

One can guess that the sequence

 `@@`(D, 2))(s))(0)

means second derivative of function whose name is s.

In general, arguments of series can be: expression, variable which is supposed to be small, and the minimal power of this argument dropped out.

If no obvious dependency of the expression on the variable is found, the result is just expression:

 series(a, b)

returns just 

 a

Not all functions can be expressed as Tailor expansion. Nevertheless Maple series tries to do its best, for example, 

 series((1+1/x^2)/(1+2/x+x*log(x)), x, 2)

returns

 1/2/x-1/4+(5/8-1/4*ln(x))*x+O(x^2)

which may have sense in asymptotic analysis. 

It is not difficult to write a function when the series cannot help, for example, 

 series(exp(1/x^2), x, 3)

returns

 Error, (in series/exp) unable to compute series

although it is easy to see, that, at least for the real values of the argument, all the derivatives in zero are just zero. By default, Maple considers all variables as complex; in the complex plane, behavior of the function in the last example is pretty singular and no simple expansion is possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In comparison to the standard description of arrays in other languages, the variety of ways to group several elements into a single object in Maple may look a little bit tricky. 

If one plots (see [[../Graphic functions/]]) several functions at the same graphic, the correct sequence may have, for example the form

plot([sin(x),cos(x)],x=0..9); 

By default, the first function will be plotted with red, second with green, thirds with yellow (almost invisible at the white background) and so on.
The similar if can be obtained with 

plot({sin(x),cos(x)},x=0..9); 

but then the color become dependent on the values of the functions.

Compare, for example, 

[1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1]

to 

{1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1}

In the first case, a list, the sequence remains the form in which it was typed; in the second case, a set, duplicates are removed and the original order is forgotten.

===Sequence===
The sequence of element can be generated with function seq. Example of use:

seq( n^2, n=-2 .. 2 );

generates

 4, 1, 0, 1, 4

Sequences are spliced within the argument list where they occur. This makes seq a rather general tool for writing various kinds of container literals:

 foo(5, seq(n^2, n=-2..2), 5);  # foo(5, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 5);
 [5, seq(n^2, n=-2..2), 5];  # [5, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 5];
 {5, seq(n^2, n=-2..2), 5};  # {0, 1, 4, 5};


The way of evaluation of expressions may be a little bit different from that we could expect in the command line; compare, for example, outputs of
&gt;  seq\sin(x) , n = -2 .. 2/

which gives
1/sin(x)^2, 1/sin(x), 1, sin(x), sin(x)^2

and 
sin^(-2)(x), sin^(-1)(x), sin^0(x), sin^1(x), sin^2(x)

 1/sin(x)^2, arcsin(x), sin(x), sin(x), sin(x)^2

which gives

 (1/sin^2)(x), (1/sin)(x), 1(x), sin(x), (sin^2)(x)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Export data from a plot ==

 &gt; P := plot3d(sin(x*y),x=-2..2,y=-2..2):
 &gt; Q:= &lt; op(indets(P,Array))&gt;;
&lt;pre&gt;
                         [ 25 x 25 Matrix       ]
                    Q := [ Data Type: float[8]  ]
                         [ Storage: rectangular ]
                         [ Order: C_order       ]

&lt;/pre&gt;
You can then export this data to a file and insert in a spreadsheet. 

1. Export to a tab delimited file:

Right-click on the output and choose:

Export As -&gt; Tab Deliminated

save it to a tab-delimited format file with extension .xls. Click on the file (if the extension is associated) or import as tab delimited. Your data will then be in the spreadsheet.

2. The same result by a command:

 &gt; ExportMatrix(&quot;plot.xls&quot;,Q);


3. Only in Standard GUI (Maple 11 or later), export to .xls format:

 &gt; with(ExcelTools);                         
 &gt; Export(Q, &quot;plot.xls&quot;);

      <text xml:space="preserve">Newton's first law states: '''In an inertial reference frame, unless acted on by a net force, an object at rest stays at rest.''' This is often referred to as '''inertia'''.

== First Law (Inertia) ==

Inertia is based on a simple concept: an object in motion tends to remain in motion.  An object at rest tends to remain at rest.  This is counter-intuitive to us, since we know that if we slide an object along the floor, it will slow down.  Similarly, something may decide to fall off a shelf in a way that looks like it decided &quot;all by itself&quot;.  But Newton understood the basis behind this physical reality.  When you slide a book along the floor it slows down, but not because of, as was sometimes thought, some property of matter that makes objects want to slow down.  The book slows down because ''it interacts with the floor''.  Although this may seem a trivial difference from the way most people think about motion, it is really quite significant.

The concept of inertia refers to the tendency of an object to remain in motion, or to remain at rest.  By intuition we can see that the tendency is somehow related to mass.  It is easy to catch and stop a baseball; I don't recommend attempting to catch and stop a freight train.  It's also a lot harder to move a loaded filing cabinet than it is to slide a single book.  In order to measure how hard it was to overcome an object's inertia, Newton discovered another concept:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Newton's second law states: '''In an inertial reference frame, force is equal to mass times acceleration (&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m \vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;)'''. This also defines what '''force''' is quantitatively.

== Second Law (Force) ==

Force can be a confusing term because it is an everyday term, as well as a physics term.  When we use it in everyday language, we use it in a whole number of different contexts, for instance &quot;He forced the door&quot;, &quot;He was forced to take third semester Calculus&quot;, or &quot;This justifies the use of force&quot;.  There are a great many ways in which the word force may be used in casual conversation.

However, in physics, there is only one meaning to force, that which was given to us by Newton's Second Law.  For now we will treat force as having been defined by:

&lt;math&gt; \vec F = m \vec a \ &lt;/math&gt;

where m represents the mass of the object in question and a its acceleration.

When you consider Newton's first law, you have to wonder how an object starts moving.  Something has to happen to an object that is standing still to make it move.  What happens is that an external object applies some sort of force, which can be summed up as a ''push'' or a ''pull''.  We know that, of course.  Ever since we started observing the natural world around us we have been aware of the way in which things are moved around us.  

What is important about this law is that force is now quantified, and can be shared between two objects.  For instance I can design a weight that applies a force of thirty Newtons to the end of a lever.  I can use this to calculate the force I apply to the other end of the lever.  Using force it will become possible to solve complex physical systems for important variables.

It's interesting to note that if Newton's second law is a definition, then it's completely useless unless we know what the force is equal to.  The actual physics comes in, for example, when you know that gravity gives a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance.  Then you have a physical model and not before.  Otherwise all you have is a definition, and you can't define how reality works!  However, strangely enough, the concept of force seems to be a deep physical quantity that actually exists.  Even though the ma side is wrong at speeds near light, the derivative of momentum is still force, but momentum is not mv.  Also, the equations of physics are very elegant when written in terms of force.  Maxwell's equations which govern electricity and magnetism can easily be translated into force, and gravity gives an elegant force.  Many thing produce an elegant force law, so force seems to be a concept that is more than a definition.

''Note:'' Newton studied the importance of the quantity &lt;math&gt; mv &lt;/math&gt;, now termed ''momentum''. He stated the his Second Law as

&lt;math&gt; \vec F = \frac{d \vec p}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

If the mass of the object is constant,

&lt;math&gt; \vec F = m \frac{d \vec v}{dt} = m \vec a &lt;/math&gt;

This form of the Second Law is used to prove the conservation of momentum and has significance in relation to Relativity Theory because this form holds true near the speed of light while F = ma breaks down.

There are quantities hidden Newton's second law which give rise to profound laws of physics.  For example, the momentum is in there as well as energy.  Both energy and momentum are conserved, which means that no matter what interaction takes place, they remain the same for an isolated system.  In fact, both energy and momentum are locally conserved, which means that they not only remain the same, but they cannot teleport; it is possible to look at energy flow and momentum flow into and out of a system.  In fact, in quantum mechanics, the concepts of energy and momentum remain, while the concept of force fades away to nothing -- energy and momentum are the deeper quantities.  It is even possible (and extremely powerful) to reformulate the classical laws of physics in terms of energy and momentum with no reference to force at all!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Newton's third law states: '''For every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force (&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{\mathrm ab} = - \vec{F}_{\mathrm ba}&lt;/math&gt;)'''. This is the basis of &quot;conservation of momentum&quot; to be covered later. 

== Third Law (Equal and Opposite Reactions) ==

Now that we have the concept of force, we can begin exploring how it effects the world around us.  Consider this.  You are most probably sitting in a chair.  How many forces are acting on you at this moment?  Since you are not accelerating in any direction it would be easy to think that there are no forces, but that would be incorrect.  Instead there are a great many forces that are all balanced.  For instance, there is the force of gravity pulling you down.  If you were magically suspended there above the Earth, the force of gravity would pull you swiftly, and ungraciously, to the ground.  But you do not fall to the ground, instead you exert a force on the seat of the chair.

Here is where Newton's Third Law comes into play.  You are exerting a force on the chair equal to your weight (let us assume for a moment that all your weight is resting on the chair).  This is equal to:

&lt;math&gt; \vec F = m \vec g \ &lt;/math&gt;

This is the force that you apply to the seat of your chair.  However, thanks to Newton's Third Law, this is also the force that the chair applies upward on you.  Because of this, the force of gravity pulling you down is countered by the force of the chair pushing you up, and you do not go sprawling all over the floor.

This is a hard concept, because it always applies, even when you might think it does not.  Let us deal with a human attempting to catch a freight train.  When the freight train hits the human, which has more force applied to it?  The answer is, from the title of this section, that the forces are equal.  The force applied to the human by the train is the same as the force applied to the train by the human.  Now, you should note that a few thousand Newtons of force has a much greater effect on a human than it does on a barreling freight train, but the force is the same.  It is the objects that are different, a trick that is often used to fool students on examinations.

Another example is this.  You are standing on a sheet of frictionless ice.  You can thrash around, you can flail your arms, but you cannot move your position (your center of mass to be precise).  It is because if you try to move one way, and you apply a force to yourself, you are are simultaneously pushing yourself forwards and backwards, which results in nothing.  Equivalently, if you put yourself in a basket, and pull on the handles, you can't lift yourself because while your are pulling up with your hands, you are pushing down with your feet.  If you shoot a gun, you feel recoil.  All of these are examples of the third law.

The third law, however, is not really a law because it is not true!  In electrodynamics, it turns out, things ''can'' lift themselves by their bootstraps.  However, the conservation of momentum, which is very similar to the third law, remains true.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cultural Anthropology''' is the study of human cultures, their beliefs, practices, values, ideas, technologies, economies and other domains of social and cognitive organization. This field is based primarily on cultural understanding gained through first hand experience, or participant observation within living populations of humans.

This chapter will introduce you to the field of anthropology, define basic terms and concepts and explain why it is important, and how it can change your perspective of the world around you.

==What is Anthropology?==

'''Anthropology''' is the scientific study of human beings as social organisms interacting with each other in their environment. Anthropology can be defined as the study of human nature, human society, and the human past. It is a scholarly discipline that aims to describe in the broadest possible sense what it means to be human. Anthropologists are interested in comparison. To make substantial and accurate comparisons between cultures, a generalization of humans requires evidence from the wide range of human societies. Anthropologists are in direct contact with the sources of their data, thus field work is a crucial component. The field of Anthropology, although fairly new as an academic field, has been used for centuries. Anthropologists are convinced that explanations of human actions will be superficial unless they acknowledge that human lives are always entangled in complex patterns of work and family, power and meaning.  
Anthropology is holistic[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism#In_anthropology]], comparative, field based, and evolutionary. These regions of Anthropology shape one another and become integrated with one another over time. Historically it was seen as &quot;the study of others,&quot; meaning foreign cultures, but using the term &quot;others&quot; imposed false thoughts of &quot;civilized versus savagery.&quot; These dualistic views have often caused wars or even genocide. Now, anthropologists strive to uncover the mysteries of these foreign cultures and eliminate the prejudice that it first created.

While it is a holistic field, anthropology is typically considered to consist of five sub-disciplines, each focusing on a particular aspect of human existence: 

* '''Archaeology:''' The study and interpretation of ancient humans, their history and culture, through examination of the artifacts and remains they left behind. Such as: The study of the Egyptian culture through examination of their grave sites, the pyramids and the tombs in the [[w:Valley of the Kings|Valley of Kings]]. Through this branch, anthropologists discover much about human history, particularly prehistoric, the long stretch of time before the development of writing.

* '''Cultural Anthropology:'''(also: sociocultural anthropology, social anthropology, or ethnology) studies the different cultures of humans and how those cultures are shaped or shape the world around them. They also focus a lot on the differences between every person. The goal of a cultural anthropologist is to learn about another culture by collecting data about how the world economy and political practices effect the new culture that is being studied. 

* '''Biological Anthropology''' (also: Physical Anthropology):Specific type of Anthropology that studies humanity through the human body as a biological organism, using genetics, evolution, human ancestry, primates, and the ability to adapt. There was a shift in the emphasis on differences (with the older “physical anthropology”) due to the development of the “new” physical anthropology developed by Sherwood Washburn at the University of California, Berkley. This field shifted from racial classification when it was discovered that physical traits that had been used to determine race could not predict other traits such as intelligence and morality. Some biological anthropologists work in the fields of primatology,which is the study of the closest living relatives of the human being, the nonhuman primates. They also work in the field of paleoanthropology which is the study of fossilized bones and teeth of our earliest ancestors.

* '''Linguistic Anthropology:''' examines human languages: how they work, how they are made, how they change, and how they die and are later revived. Linguistic anthropologists try to understand language in relation to the broader cultural, historical, or biological contexts that make it possible. The study of linguistics includes examining [[Cultural_Anthropology/Communication_and_Language#Phonology|phonemes]], [[Cultural_Anthropology/Communication_and_Language#Morphology|morphemes]], [[Cultural_Anthropology/Communication_and_Language#Syntax|syntax]], [[Cultural_Anthropology/Communication_and_Language#Semantics|semantics]], and [[Cultural_Anthropology/Communication_and_Language#Semantics.2C_Pragmatics.2C_and_Ethnopragmatics|pragmatics]]. They look at linguistic features of communication, which includes any verbal contact, as well as non linguistic features, which would include movements, eye contact, the cultural context, and even the recent thoughts of the speaker.

* '''Applied Anthropology''' includes the fields of Applied Medical Anthropology, Urban Anthropology, Anthropological Economics, Contract Archaeology and others. Applied anthropology is simply the practice of applying anthropological theory and or methods from any of the fields of Anthropology to solve human problems. For example, applied anthropology is often used when trying to determine the ancestry of an unearthed native American burial. Biological anthropology can be used to test the DNA of the body and see if the DNA of the burial has any similarities to living populations.

==='''Holism in Anthropology'''===

'''Holism''' is the perspective on the human condition that assumes that mind, body, individuals, society, and the environment interpenetrate, and even define one another. In anthropology holism tries to integrate all that is known about human beings and their activities. From a holistic perspective, attempts to divide reality into mind and matter isolate and pin down certain aspects of a process that, by very nature, resists isolation and dissection.  Holism holds great appeal for those who seek a theory of human nature that is rich enough to do justice to its complex subject matter. An easier understanding of holism is to say that ''the whole is greater than the sum of its parts''.  Individual human organisms are not just ''x'' percent genes and ''y'' percent culture added together. Rather, human beings are what they are because of mutual shaping of genes and culture and experiences living in the world produces something new, something that cannot be reduced to the materials used to construct it. It is important to note that humans who grow and live together are inevitably shaped by shared cultural experiences and develop into a much different person than they would have if developing in isolation. 
[http://as.nyu.edu/object/sally.merry Sally Engle Merry], an anthropologist, got a call from a radio show asking her to talk about a recent incident that happened in Pakistan that resulted in a gang rape of a young woman authorized by a local tribal council. She explained to them that it was an inexcusable act and that the rape was probably connected to local political struggles and class differences. This relates to holism because the gang rape was authorized by higher authorities because it is a cultural norm for socially higher class men to feel more empowered over women. This emphasizes the connection between human actions and their environment and society.

===What is Culture?===

'''Culture''' is the patterns of learned and shared behavior and beliefs of a particular social, ethnic, or age group. It can also be described as the complex whole of collective human beliefs with a structured stage of civilization that can be specific to a nation or time period. Humans in turn use culture to adapt and transform the world they live in.
[[Image:Flag of Ashanti.svg|100px|thumb|right|Ashanti flag, note the [[w:golden stool|golden stool]]]]
This idea of Culture can be seen in the way that we describe the Ashanti, an African tribe located in central Ghana. The Ashanti live with their families as you might assume but the meaning of how and why they live with whom is an important aspect of Ashanti culture. In the Ashanti culture, the family and the mother’s clan are most important. A child is said to inherit the father’s soul or spirit (ntoro) and from the mother, a child receives flesh and blood (mogya). This relates them more closely to the mother’s clan. The Ashanti live in an extended family. The family lives in various homes or huts that are set up around a courtyard. The head of the household is usually the oldest brother that lives there. He is chosen by the elders. He is called either Father or Housefather and everyone in the household obeys him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africaguide.com/culture/tribes/ashanti.htm |title=African People &amp; Culture - Ashanti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropological study of culture can be organized along two persistent and basic themes: '''Diversity''' and '''Change'''. An individual's upbringing, and environment (or culture) is what makes them [[diverse]] from other cultures. It is the differences between all cultures and sub-cultures of the worlds regions. People's need to adapt and transform to physical, biological and cultural forces to survive represents the second theme, '''Change'''. Culture generally changes for one of two reasons: selective transmission or to meet changing needs. This means that when a village or culture is met with new challenges for example a loss of a food source, they must change the way they live. This could mean almost anything to the culture, including possible forced redistribution of, or relocation from ancestral domains due to external and/or internal forces. And an anthropologist would look at that and study their ways to learn from them.


Culture is:&lt;br&gt;
•'''Learned''' through active teaching, and passive [[w:Habitus_(sociology)|habitus]].&lt;br&gt;
•'''Shared''' meaning that it defines a group and meets common needs.&lt;br&gt;
•'''Patterned''' meaning that that there is a recourse of similar ideas. Related cultural beliefs and practices show up repeatedly in different areas of social life. &lt;br&gt;
•'''Adaptive''' which helps individuals meet needs across variable environments. &lt;br&gt;
•'''Symbolic''' which means that there are simple and arbitrary signs that represent something else, something more.&lt;br&gt;


====&quot;'''C'''ulture&quot; vs. &quot;'''c'''ulture&quot;====
At its most basic level, the difference between Culture and culture is in the way they are defined. Culture with a capital C refers to the ability of the human species to absorb and imitate patterned and symbolic ideas that ultimately further their survival. Culture is a trait all humans have, whereas culture with a lower case c refers to a particular learned way of life and set of patterns an individual person has picked up, representing one variation amongst many different cultures. 

[[Image:DurbanSign1989.jpg|thumb|right|200px|&quot;Petty apartheid&quot;: sign on Durban beach in [[w:English language|English]], [[w:Afrikaans|Afrikaans]] and [[w:Zulu|Zulu]] (1989)]]
The concept of Culture vs. culture becomes more complex when it comes to how the two terms are misinterpreted and misused. Originally the overlap of the two concepts had a positive effect, especially during colonial times; it helped spread the idea that vulnerable seemingly “primitive” and “uncivilized” cultures had some intrinsic value and deserved protection from other more dominating cultures. But there are drawbacks to this mentality, as it assumes first that culture is a static thing that it can be preserved, unchanged by the changing people and times it runs into. It also assumes that the people accept at face value and do not wish to change their patterns or ways of life. If people then do change, often they are criticized by member from within and outside their own culture for not valuing ‘authenticity’ and tradition. This relates to the Culture vs. culture in that anthropology’s focus and appreciation of Culture and how it develops differently can be twisted when talking about [[#Cultural_Relativism|Cultural relativism]] or human rights. Appreciation and defense of Culture does not imply blind tolerance to all aspects of all cultures. A pertinent example of this would be Female Genital Cutting and how as an aspect of little c culture, it can be examined and judged a violation of human rights. This does not however, diminish an anthropologist’s appreciation for the ability of the human being to develop Culture.

An example of how defense of culture has been misused is in apartheid South Africa, where the white supremacist government justified the oppression of black Africans, or the [[w:bantu_peoples |bantu peoples]] because their aim was a “higher Bantu culture and not at producing black Europeans”. They argued that “not race but culture was the true base of difference, the sign of destiny. And cultural differences were to be valued”. In such cases, the abuse of the term is clear, in that they were using it as a basis for unequal treatment and access to services such as education.

===Levels of culture===
====Familial culture====
Familial culture is how you express culture as a family through traditions, roles, beliefs, and other areas. Many aspects can influence a family culture such as religion, and the community around you. Religion can strongly influence family culture, which can be demonstrated by the Catholic religion in many Hispanic countries. Most Hispanic cultures practice Catholic beliefs and within a family these beliefs are practiced to different degrees. For example, one family may go to the catholic mass every week while some may only go once a month. This can all depend on the standards and cultural norms for a given community. Every family is different, and every family has its own culture.  

Familial culture is also passed down from generation to generation and this means that it is both shared and learned. It is shared because as a family grows, new generations are introduced to traditional family practices and then it becomes a routine to that new generation. Familial culture is learned by means of [[w:enculturation|enculturation]] which is the process by which a person learns the requirements of the culture that he or she is surrounded by. With enculturation an individual will also learn behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their given culture. The influences of enculturation from the family direct and shape the individual.  
[[Image:Trooping the Colour, Saturday June 16th 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|right||The Royal Family of Great Britain is deeply set in family tradition ]]
The present [[w: Royal family|Royal family]] of Great Britain is a good example of family tradition because each male member of the royal family has served in the armed forces. Prince Andrew joined the Navy in 1979, Prince Edward joined the Royal Marines as a second lieutenant in 1983, Prince Charles the current prince of Wales was appointed in 1969 as the as colonel-in-chief of the Royal Regiment of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh joined the Navy in 1939 and served in World War 2 and as of June 12, 2003 Prince Henry announced that he would be passing on the tradition and joining the Army. This long standing tradition of serving in the armed forces is an important aspect of familial culture because it shows the connection of the generations of the royal family of Great Britain through the years.

====Micro or Subculture====

'''Micro or Subculture'''- distinct groups within a larger group that share some sort of common trait, activity or language that ties them together and or differentiates them from the larger group.  A micro or subculture is also not limited on how small it can be. It could be defined similarly to a clique. An example of this could be Mexican-Americans within the U.S. society.  They share the same language, but they are found in a larger whole. This is similar the subculture of an African American, they are fully accepted in the American culture but are also capable of also maintaining a individual smaller culture too. An example of a micro-culture would be the Japanese hip hop genba (club site) that is becoming more and more popular throughout Japanese cities.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Japanese Hip Hop and the Globalization of Popular Culture&quot; Ian Condry&lt;/ref&gt;  Although rap started in the United States, it has created its own unique appearance and style in the Japanese youth culture today.  The physical appearance of rappers may be the same to those in the States, however the content of the music differs along with the preservation of Japanese traditions.

]]

====Cultural universals====


'''Cultural universals''' ( which has been mentioned by anthropologists like George Murdock, Claude Levi-Strauss, Donald Brown and others) can be defined as being anything common that exists in every human culture on the planet yet varies from different culture to culture, such as values and modes of behavior. Examples of elements that may be considered cultural universals are gender roles, the incest taboo, religious and healing ritual, mythology, marriage, language, art, dance, music, cooking, games, jokes, sports, birth and death because they involve some sort of ritual ceremonies accompanying them, etc.  
Many anthropologist and socialists with an extreme perspective of [[W:cultural relativism|cultural relativism]] deny the existence or reduce the importance of cultural universals believing that these traits were only inherited biologically through the known controversy of “nurture vs. nature”.  They are mainly known as &quot;empty universals&quot; since just mentioning their existence in a culture doesn't make them any more special or unique.  The existence of these universals has been said to date to the Upper Paleolithic with the first evidence of [[W: behavioral modernity|behavioral modernity]]. 

[[Image:Bailando.jpg|thumb|200 px|A woman dancing folklórico in the traditional dress of Jalisco]]

Among the cultural universals listed by Brown are:&lt;br&gt;
• Language and cognition - All cultures employ some type of communication, symbolism is also a universal idea in language.&lt;br&gt;
• Society - Being in a family, having peers, or being a member of any organized group or community is what makes society.&lt;br&gt;
• Myth, Ritual, and aesthetics - Different cultures all have a number of things in common, for example: a belief system, celebration of life and death, and other ceremonial events.&lt;br&gt;
• Technology - There are worldwide variations in clothing, housing, tools and techniques for getting food through different types of technology.&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Feuerreiben.gif|thumb|left|250 px|Residents of Vanuatu making fire. The use of fire for cooking is a human cultural universal]]

Dance is a great example of a cultural universal because it exists in every culture as form of expression, social interaction, or presented in a spiritual or performance setting.  Traditional dances found in Mexico are quite different from those found in the United States. American style dancing includes Flat Foot Dancing, Hoofing, Buck Dancing, Soft Shoe, Clogging, Irish Sean-Nós Dance, and Irish Jig. Because these forms of dance are not commonly found on stage, in the media, or taught in the dance schools, it has received minimal attention and its practice has significantly decreasing compared to its past popularity. Mexico on the other hand had a traditional style of dance called Ballet Folklorico which reflects different regions and folk music genres. These dances are widely known and are constantly being taught in schools and performed during festivities such as Cinco de Mayo.

===Two Views of Culture===
[[File:Harlem - W125st - Madison Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|125th Street in East Harlem]]
In the article, “Workaday World, Crack Economy”, anthropologist [[w:Philippe Bourgois|Philippe Bourgois]] uses participant observation to get involved with the people living in East Harlem. He actually lived there trying to uncover this system, and getting to know the people that he was observing. His approach displays both emic detail, the stories and explanations given by Primo and Cesar, as well as etic analysis attributing workplace discrimination to the FIRE economy. Both points of view are rather crucial (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) {{note|Bourgois}}. 
====Etic====
An etic view of a culture is the perspective of an outsider looking in. For example, if an American anthropologist went to Africa to study a nomadic tribe, his/her resulting case study would be from an etic standpoint if he/she did not integrate themselves into the culture they were observing. Some anthropologies may take this approach to avoid altering the culture that they are studying by direct interaction. The etic perspective is data gathering by ''outsiders'' that yield questions posed by outsiders. One problem that anthropologists may run in to is that people tend to act differently when they are being observed. It is especially hard for an outsider to gain access to certain private rituals, which may be important for understanding a culture. 

The [[w:World_Health_Organization |'''World Health Organization''']] (WHO) is an example of an “etic” view. The WHO created a group that specializes in Health and Human Rights. Although the idea that all cultures should have their rights protected in terms of health seems logical, it can also be dangerous as it is an “etic” view on culture. The WHO posits that “violations or lack of attention to human rights (e.g. harmful traditional practices, slavery, torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, violence against women) can have serious health consequences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Health and Human Rights&quot;, World Health Organization http://www.who.int/hhr/HHRETH_activities.pdf (pdf) Accessed June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although some cultures may see this as a big step in health care, others could see it as an attack on their way of life. 
This problem of right and wrong in terms of crossing cultural lines is a big one. It can be  hard for some cultures to watch other cultures do things that are seen as damaging when to the culture itself it has a purpose and a meaning.

====Emic====
An emic view of culture is ultimately a perspective focus on the intrinsic cultural distinctions that are meaningful to the members of a given society, often considered to be an 'insider’s' perspective. While this perspective stems from the concept of immersion in a specific culture, the emic participant isn't always a member of that culture or society. Studies done from an emic perspective often include more detailed and culturally rich information than studies done from an etic point of view. Because the observer places themselves within the culture of intended study,they are able to go further in-depth on the details of practices and beliefs of a society that may otherwise have been ignored. However, the emic perspective has its downfalls. Studies done from an emic perspective can create bias on the part of the participant,especially if said individual is a member of the culture they are studying, thereby failing to keep in mind how their practices are perceived by others and possibly causing valuable information to be left out. The emic perspective serves the purpose of providing descriptive in-depth reports about how ''insiders'' of a culture understand their rituals.

===Enculturation===
Growing up in any culture, all humans go through the process of enculturation.  This process is the way in which we obtain and transmit culture.
It describes how each individual comes to terms with the already set ideals that their culture has established, and how each person adapts to prohibited behaviors and beliefs, which are 'proscribed', versus encouraged behaviors and beliefs, which are 'prescribed'. 

Parents and other authority figures in young children’s lives are usually the initiators of this process, steering the children toward activities and beliefs that will be socially accepted in their culture.  Through this process these authority figures definitely shape the child’s view on life.  Enculturation results in the interpretation of these ideals established by our culture and the establishment of our own individual behaviors and beliefs.

[[Image:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|500px|right||The !Kung People diligently work on making a fire ]]

For example the [[w:ǃKung_people|!Kung Bushman]] who live in the Kalahari were raised quite differently than someone who grew up in Washington State,or the States in general.  In the United States, we tend to tolerate arrogance more so than the !Kung people.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Discussion Group 10 Week 2- Marisa Mikelsons&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; For example, when we give people gifts and they thank us graciously for it, we acknowledge their acceptance by saying &quot;It was no big deal&quot;, which by accepting their gratitude makes us in a way arrogant because we accept the fact the receiver appreciates the gift. Growing up in another culture, there are different guidelines that people have to follow in order to be socially accepted. In the !Kung Bushman tribe they look down upon people who think highly of themselves and who are arrogant. To avoid these characteristics, each child was raised to put down and mock others when they do things such as hunting and other activities. Their view is that by telling someone who had just hunted a huge ox, that the ox is a “bag of bones” or “thin, sick, and dead,” then they are preventing this person from being arrogant and full of them self.

In contrast, enculturation in the United States teaches people to see this behavior as mean and wrong. Often in the United States culture arrogance is also viewed as a negative quality, but it is not discouraged in the same way. A common way members of the United States culture discourage displays of arrogance is simply by telling the younger generation that it is a bad quality. The !Kung people use enculturation strongly to impress their cultural value of humility; in United States culture, it is emphasized less and it shows in the much wider acceptance of arrogance. In the US, a hunter might have been praised for doing good things such as hunting large game and providing food for everyone else. All of the members of these two cultures went through the process of enculturation but just into different cultures with different established ideals.

====Cultural Transmission====
 [[File:Barack Obama hosts a Seder dinner 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Barack Obama shows multi-cultural respect by hosting a Sedar dinner. Sedar is a Jewish tradition passed down through families for generations.]]
[[Wikipedia: Cultural_Transmission|Cultural Transmission]] is the passing of new knowledge and traditions of culture from one generation to the next, as well as cross-culturally.  Cultural Transmission happens everyday, all the time, without any concept of when or where.  Everything people do and say provides cultural transmission in all aspects of life.  In everyday life,  the most common way cultural norms are transmitted is within each individuals' home life.  Each family has its own, distinct culture under the big picture of each given society and/or nation.  With every family, there are traditions that are kept alive.  The way each family acts, communicates with others and an overall view of life are passed down.  Parents teach their kids everyday how to behave and act by their actions alone.
	
Another big influence on cultural transmission is the media.  The distinct way the media portrays America to other countries and themselves.  One example is the way that hip-hop has formed all over the world, each with its own distinct way of interpretation formed by any such culture.  Each, separate translation of the meaning of hip-hop is an example of cultural transmission, passed from one culture to the next.  In Japanese culture, hip-hop&lt;ref&gt;Condry, Ian, 2001 &quot;Japanese Hip-Hop and the Globalization of Popular Culture.&quot; In Urban Life: Readings in the Anthropology of the City. George Gmelch and Walter Zenner, eds. Prospect Heights, IL: Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, has become quite a popular aspect as more of an underground scene and has made its own concepts of what hip-hop is, but still has similar characteristics of original hip-hop.  Cultural transmission cross culturally happens very easily now with [[Wikipedia: Globalization|Globalization]]. For example, hip-hop is not just music; it’s a lifestyle, an image, and a culture of its own.  Cultural transmission is what keeps cultures alive and thriving.

Dakar, the capitol of Senegal located in Western Africa, has also seen its media become influenced through cultural transmission and Hip-Hop.  As shown in the film &quot;Democracy in Dakar,&quot; Dakar's 2007 elections were heavily influenced by underground Hip-Hop.  The documentary shows how the youth of Dakar have used their musical talents to encourage everyone to vote, in an attempt to void the corruption present within the government. &lt;ref&gt; Democracy in Dakar, Nomadic Wax, 2008 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols and Culture===
 [[File:DemoticScriptsRosettaStoneReplica.jpg|thumb|left|The Rosetta stone has several different languages carved into it]]Symbols are the basis of culture. A [[w:symbol|symbol]] is an object, word, or action that stands for something else with no natural relationship that is culturally defined. Everything one does throughout their life is based and organized through cultural symbolism. Symbolism is when something represents abstract ideas or concepts. Some good examples of symbols/symbolism would be objects, figures, sounds, and colors. For example in the Hawaiian culture, the performance of a Lua is a symbol of their land and heritage which is performed through song and dance &lt;ref&gt;http://courses.wwu.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp?url=/bin/common/course.pl?course_id=_15282_1&amp;frame=top&lt;/ref&gt;  . Also, they could be facial expressions or word interpretations. Symbols mean different things to different people, which is why it is impossible to hypothesize how a specific culture will symbolize something. Some symbols are gained from experience, while others are gained from culture. One of the most common cultural symbols is language. For example, the letters of an alphabet symbolize the sounds of a specific spoken language.

Symbolism leads to the &quot;Layers of Meaning&quot; concept. Culture is the meaning that is shared to provide guiding principles for individual meaning.

Language is the most often used form of symbolism. There are 6,912 known living languages, and the diversity is caused by isolation. Most languages have a different &quot;symbol&quot; for each letter, word, or phrase. The use of symbols is [[W:adaptive|adaptive]], that means that humans can learn to associate new symbols to a concept or new concepts with a symbol. An example, may be drawn from two populations who speak different languages that come into contact with one another and need to communicate. They form a language that has a large degree of flexibility in using either language's symbols (in this case patterns of sound) or a hybrid set of symbols to communicate messages back and forth. This contact language, or [[w:pidgin|pidgin]] gradually gives way to a [[w:creole|creole]] with a more formal set of symbols (words), grammatical rules for their organization, and its own native speakers who transmit the language from generation to generation.

It is important for anthropologists to consider their own cultural background when looking at symbolism in a different culture. This is because many symbols, though similar in appearance, can mean drastically different things. These symbols can best be understood or interpreted though the eyes of the culture that they pertain to, otherwise they may loose their unique significance. One example of a misinterpreted cultural symbol is the “whirl log” symbol commonly used in Southwestern Native American blanket weaving. This symbol is almost identical to the Nazi Swastika, and therefore brings a negative response from many Americans. Although the Native American symbol has nothing to do with Nazi or Germanic symbolism, this design is rarely used on blankets today because of the symbolic misinterpretation.  &lt;ref&gt; Barton Wright Cruz Bay Publishing, Inc. http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa040.shtml &lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnocentrism===
[[Image:Colonization_of_New_England.jpg‎|right|thumb|&quot;Colonization of New England&quot; - Early settlers cut and saw trees and use the lumber to construct a building, possibly a warehouse for their supplies. This is the first scene painted entirely by Costaggini.]]

[[W:Ethnocentrism|Ethnocentrism]] is the term anthropologists use to describe the opinion that one's own way of life is natural or correct. Some would simply call it cultural ignorance.  Ethnocentrism means that one may see his/her own culture as the correct way of living.  For those who have not experienced other cultures in depth can be said to be ethnocentric if they feel that their lives are the most natural way of living.  Some cultures may be similar or overlap in ideas or concepts, however, some people are in a sense, shocked to experience differences they may encounter with individuals culturally different than themselves.  In extreme cases, a group of individuals may see another cultures way of life and consider it wrong, because of this, the group may try to convert the other group to their own ways of living. Fearful war and [[w: genocide|genocide]] could be the devastating result if a group is unwilling to change their ways of living. 

An example of ethnocentrism in culture is the Asian cultures across all the countries of Asia.  Throughout [[w:Asia|Asia]], the way of eating is to use [[w: chopsticks|chopsticks]] with every meal.  These people may find it unnecessary to find that people in other societies, such as the American society, eat using forks, spoons, knives, etc.  Since these countries use chopsticks to eat every meal, they find it foolish for other cultures to not use utensils similar to chopsticks; however, they do accept the fact that they use different utensils for eating.  This example is not something extreme that could lead to [[w: genocide|genocide]] or war, but it is a large enough gap between these cultures for people to see their way of eating as the natural or best way to typically eat their food.

Another example of ethnocentrism is colonialism. [[w:colonialism|Colonialism]] can be defined as cultural domination with enforced social change.Colonialism refers to the social system in which political conquests by one society of another leads to &quot;cultural domination with enforced social change&quot;. A good example to look at when examining colonialism is the British invasion of India. The British had little understanding of the culture in India which created a lot of problems an unrest during their rule.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Emily A., and Robert H. Lavenda. Cultural Anthropology : A Perspective on the Human Condition. New York: Oxford UP, Incorporated, 2009.pg.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Monumento ghandi seccion.jpg‎|left|thumb|&quot;Statue of Gandhi&quot; - Gandhi was one of the main characters in the colonization of India, he fought for peace and understanding during this time of unrest.]]


Ethnocentrism may not, in some circumstances, be avoidable. We all often have instinctual reactions toward another person or culture's practices or beliefs. But these reactions do not have to result in horrible events such as genocide or war. In order to avoid such awful things like those we must all try to be more culturally relative. Ethnocentrism is one solution to tension between one cultural self and another cultural self. It helps reduce the other way of life to a version of one's own.

===Cultural Relativism===
The Cross-Cultural Relationship is the idea that people from different cultures can have relationships that acknowledge, respect and begin to understand each others diverse lives. People with different backgrounds can help each other see possibilities that they never thought were there because of limitations, or cultural proscriptions, posed by their own traditions. Traditional practices in certain cultures can restrict opportunity because they are &quot;wrong&quot; according to one specific culture. Becoming aware of these new possibilities will ultimately change the people that are exposed to the new ideas. This cross-cultural relationship provides hope that new opportunities will be discovered but at the same time it is threatening. The threat is that once the relationship occurs, one can no longer claim that any single culture is the absolute truth.

[[Wikipedia:Cultural_relativism|Cultural relativism]] is the ability to understand a culture on its own terms and not to make judgments using the standards of ones own culture. The goal of this is promote understanding of cultural practices that are not typically part of one's own culture. Using the perspective of cultural relativism leads to the view that no one culture is superior than another culture when compared to systems of morality, law, politics, etc. &lt;ref&gt;Philosophy Home, 2009. http://www.cultural-relativism.com/&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept that cultural norms and values derive their meaning within a specific social context. This is also based on the idea that there is no absolute standard of good or evil, therefore every decision and judgment of what is right and wrong is individually decided in each society. The concept of cultural relativism also means that any opinion on ethics is subject to the perspective of each person within their particular culture. Overall, there is no right or wrong ethical system. In a holistic understanding of the term cultural relativism, it tries to promote the understanding of cultural practices that are unfamiliar to other cultures such as eating insects, genocides or genital cutting.

There are two different categories of '''cultural relativism''':
'''Absolute''': Everything that happens within a culture must and should not be questioned by outsiders. 
The extreme example of absolute cultural relativism would be the Nazi party’s point of view justifying the Holocaust.

'''Critical''': Creates questions about cultural practices in terms of who is accepting them and why. Critical cultural relativism also recognizes power relationships. 

Absolute cultural relativism is displayed in many cultures, especially Africa, that practice female genital cutting. This procedure refers to the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or any other trauma to the female reproductive/genital organs. By allowing this procedure to happen, females are considered women and then are able to be married. FGC is practiced mainly because of culture, religion and tradition. Outside cultures such as the United States look down upon FGC, but are unable to stop this practice from happening because it is protected by its culture.

Cultural relativism can be seen with the Chinese culture and their process of [[Wikipedia:feet_binding|feet binding]]. Foot binding was to stop the growth of the foot and make them smaller. The process often began between four and seven years old. A ten foot bandage would be wrapped around the foot forcing the toes to go under the foot. It caused the big toe to be closer to the heel causing the foot to bow.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;In China, small feet were seen as beautiful and a symbol of status. The women wanted their feet to be “three-inch golden lotuses”三寸金蓮&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; It was also the only way to marry into money. Because men only wanted women with small feet, even after this practice was banned in 1912, women still continued to do it. To Western cultures the idea of feet binding might seems torturous, but for the Chinese culture it is symbol of beauty that has been ingrained the culture for hundreds of years. The idea of beauty differs from culture to culture.

==Cultural Anthropology Today==
What do Cultural Anthropologists do? [[Image:Community_Circle_at_OUR_Ecovillage.jpg|thumb|right| This image shows participants in Diana Leafe Christian's 'Heart of a Healthy Community' seminar circle during an afternoon session at an O.U.R. Ecovillage]]
===Ethnography===
The word [[w:Ethnography |Ethnography]] comes from these two Greek words:&quot;Ethnos&quot;, meaning people &amp; &quot;Graphein&quot;, meaning writing. Wolcott (1999) defines ethnography is a description of “the customary social behaviors of an identifiable group of people”.
Ethnography is often referred to as &quot;culture writing,&quot; and it refers to a type of documentation often employed by Anthropologists in their field work. This genre of writing uses detailed  first-hand written descriptions of a culture based on first-hand research in the field.

Ethnographies often reflect the anthropological desire for '''holism''', the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of the individual parts. In the case of ethnography, holism refers to the fact that a culture can be best understood through the understanding of as many aspects of the cultural context as possible.

Cultural anthropologists who write ethnographies are often called &lt;i&gt;ethnographers&lt;/i&gt;. Ethnographers who write about what they have learned from the people that they have been working with often use a research method known as participant-observation.  [[w:Participant Observation|Participant Observation]] is a technique of field research used in anthropology by which an anthropologist studies the life of a group by sharing in its activities.

Ethnographic information can take many different forms. Articles, journals, statistical data, and documentaries are just a few of the many forms that ethnographic information can be conveyed. A very common form is a book written by the person participating in the research or observation. 
A great example of a book would be &quot;Waiting For An Ordinary Day&quot; by Farnaz Fassihi because as a journalist traveling to Iraq during the Iraq war, she participates in Iraqi daily life and documents her description of it, because of her methods and style of writing although Fassihi may not consider herself an anthropologist, her book ''Waiting for an Ordinary Day'' is ethnographic. Eventually, she turns all of her journalistic notes into a book which describes certain events that help her define the Iraqi culture. She uses the participant-observation method, and also uses the concept of holism to explain the whole of Iraqi culture, rather than just small aspects of it.  

Anthropologists, scientists, philosophers, historians and most social scientists have been reexamining assumptions about what science is and how it works. They have challenged the traditional distinction between hard sciences (such as physics, chemistry, and biology) and soft sciences (psychology, sociology, and anthropology). They think they have more in common than previously believed. Anthropologists aid in the effort to study and reconsider what science is all about through gathering information about diverse cultural views on the process of explanation gained during participant-observation-based fieldwork.

===Ethnology===
Ethnology is the comparative study of two or more cultures. Ethnology utilizes the data taken from ethnographic research and applies it to a single cross cultural topic. The ethnographic approach can be used to identify and attempt to explain cross cultural variation in cultural elements such as marriage, religion, subsistence practices, political organization, and parenting, just to name a few. Ethnology often compares and contrasts various cultures. Anthropologists who focus on one culture are often called ethnographers while those who focus on several cultures are often called ethnologists.
The term ethnology is credited to Adam Franz Kollár who used and defined it in his Historiae ivrisqve pvblici Regni Vngariae amoenitates published in Vienna in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Zmago Šmitek and Božidar Jezernik, &quot;The anthropological tradition in Slovenia.&quot; In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. ''Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deconstructing Race and Racism===

Race was created long ago as a tool to separate humans from different areas on the globe in order to justify enslaving and belittling certain peoples of the world. Since its creation there has been a slow but steady attempt to deconstruct it. Of course there have been many speed bumps along the way.

Deconstructing the social concept of [[w:race (classification of human beings)|race]] has been a major interest of Cultural Anthropology at least since Franz Boas's work on race and immigration in the early 1900's. The concept of race is important in many different areas of the discipline including cross-cultural studies, the way we look at ourselves vs. people we feel are different from us and many other areas. Race is not biological but it's supposed to be a way to classify biological differences by grouping people according to different characteristics that they have &lt;ref&gt; American Anthropological Association Statement on &quot;Race&quot;(May 17, 1998) http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm &lt;/ref&gt;. However it's important to remember that race is not based on genetic features. There is no biological part of race. It is strictly a concept created by humans to try to better understand differences between us. The history of the relationship between anthropology and the concept of race is long and interesting [http://www.racesci.org/home.html (see Race in Science web resources for more information).]

===Technology===
[[w:technology |'''Technology''']] is an important aspect of Cultural Anthropology. Anthropologists have studied the examples of material life established in different human civilizations. Some examples of these universal differences are in shelter, attire, tools and methods for acquiring food and producing material goods. Some anthropologists focus their main concern on studying technology in diverse societies or the progression of technology. Individuals concerned with material life also illustrate the primary environment for which technologies have been revolutionized. In Anthropology, technology is often studied in relationship to the natural environment that it was developed in. 
 
Different cultures use technology in different ways.  Western technology that is used in non-Western cultures are being used in new and creative ways. Although some of the new uses for the technology are unexpected, it makes sense in the context of the different cultures. An example would be the ipod in the African country of [[w:Benin|Benin]] in which predominantly students of higher education, who speak French as well as their native language and go to a Private University. The Ipods are shipped from England, France, and the United States. The country of Benin is sometimes referred to as &quot;little America&quot; because the country has a good economic system and isn't involved in wars, ethnic cleansings, or starvation like other countries. Students here try to imitate students from European and American schools. This trend is not concurrent throughout Africa, due to political differences.
[[File:Personal Computer 774.JPG|right|200px]]
Some anthropologists analyze the ways in which technologies and settings shape each other, and others analyze the way non-Western civilizations have reacted in regards to political and economic strife of colonialism and capitalist industrialized technology. With globalization, all people increasingly consume material goods and technologies manufactured beyond their own culture. Anthropologists have proven that non-Western inhabitants do not mindlessly imitate Western customs for the use of technology; instead they utilize Western technologies in creative ways, which are often unforeseen and can be adaptive or maladaptive. A [[Cultural_Anthropology/Ritual_and_Religion#Cargo_Cult|cargo cult]] could be considered an example of the creative use of new technology. 

An example of differences in culture can also be found within the same culture.  For example, the differences between generations in the American culture.  For the adult generation it is much harder to do the simple tasks that young adults do daily with technology.  This is because they were not raised with the technology constantly surrounding them like this generation has been.  Today teenagers rarely go a day without using either their cell phone, laptop, ipod, or a television.

By:  Lori Spicer




INTRODUCTION



For the first time in at least 40 years poor children constitute 54% of students in public schools throughout the South.  “While that makes the South the nation’s first geographic region to reach that milestone, researchers said the West is not fare behind.  If current population trends continue, the report adds, students from low-income households will constitute more than half of K-12 enrollment in public schools nationally within 10 years” (Viadero, 14).  Each year increasing number of children are entering schools with special needs, such as poverty, that schools are not prepared to meet.  Socioeconomic status is the most powerful influence on a student’s educational ability.  Where a student is born and grows up has a great effect on what they are able to accomplish.  “A good education is often the only means of breaking the cycle of poverty for poor children.  These children need an education that is founded in high standards and high expectations for all” (Pellino, 3).  In order to be a successful teacher to these under privileged students one must know themselves, know the environment in which they teach, and maintain high expectations (Gehrke, 1).  

[[Image:Lori-1.jpg]]


SELF AWARENESS



To be an effective teacher to students of all socioeconomic classes one must have a great desire to meet the learning needs of all students in an individual and personal manner.  An effective teacher requires uniform treatment, conduct and outcome from all students.  A teacher must know themselves in terms of their levels of frustration and their coping capabilities (Gehrke, 2).  Teachers need to rely on their own assumptions and belief systems, especially in cases where there social experiences and backgrounds greatly differ from those of the students they teach.  When a teacher can understand the perspectives and situations of their students the teacher is able to establish a connection that facilitates engagement.  



KNOWING YOUR ENVIRONMENT



Our nation’s classrooms are becoming more diverse than ever before due to the rise in the number of children in poverty.  Poor children are disadvantaged from the start.  They most likely had inadequate or no pre-natal care.  They probably have insufficient health insurance.  More importantly poor children do not have the same life experiences as other children.  They miss out on things that help in the development of skills and academic achievement, i.e. the use of home computers, visits to zoos and museums, attendance at pre-school, interaction with the educated, and being read to by a parent (Pellino, 5-6).  

The government and agencies have been considering what steps they can take to help this problem.  “Some take the view that schools could do much more to reduce, if not eliminate, the effects of poverty.  This has led to some very dubious strategies, such as various kinds of takeovers or reconstitution of so-called failing schools, as if the problem were simply one of working a little harder.  Others argue that socioeconomic status is too powerful and that schools alone will not be able to mitigate its impact” (Levin, 2).  



MAINTAINING HIGH EXPECTATIONS



Poor children often attend schools where teachers are less qualified and instruction is less challenging, when they actually need the best that can be offered.  Steps need to be taken to reduce retention in grade and increase early intervention to diagnose reading problems.  “The solution lies in placing all of our youth in the best position to be successful” (Desroches, 2).  As teachers of poor children, planning and preparation is absolutely critical to be successful.  In a classroom of diverse students, content needs to be related in varying ways to meet all of their needs.  Constructivism is a great concept in that it allows student differences and use of their own prior knowledge to make connections and learn.  This allows the students the opportunity to become active learners by questioning, hypothesizing and drawing conclusions based on their individual experiences.  If there is only a limited foundation for children to draw upon, we need to help them develop a base of experiences and knowledge from which they have a place to start (Pellino, 2).  Teachers of under privileged children often feel sorry for their students because of the environment in which they live.  Subsequently, the demands for these poor children are lowered and the student achievement lags causing self improvement and school reform to be impossible.  We as teachers need to place an emphasis on sparking the desire to learn (motivation) by not only encouraging students to see the demands and rewards of schooling but also by restoring the child’s self image.  “We need to make them feel that they are lovable, important and acceptable human beings by making them feel secure and good about themselves and by building trusting respectful relationships with them” (Pellino, 3).  Most of these students want and desire to learn but do not always have the skills needed.  However, teachers that are patient and take the time necessary to offer extra help and encouragement can often make the difference.  

Involving the parents of low socioeconomic children is a great advantage but also a great challenge.  Children experience the world through their parents.  The parent child relationship is the primary context for early development, due to poverty factors there is usually a negative effect on the development of the child.  Children rely on their parents for support, emotional stimulation, and to mediate their environment.  If a parent does not due this, due to poverty related stress, the child’s development could be delayed or negatively effected.  Strengthening and supporting parents and families is very important.  Teachers can educate parents on time efficient, simple ways to help their children at home.  Teachers can provide activities and literature that can educate the child and strengthen the parent the child relationship in a positive way.  “Many of these parents need to learn strategies that can help them cope and help their children get a chance at breaking the cycle of poverty” (Pellino, 7).  



CONCLUSION



Poverty is an epidemic that is greatly effecting the South but slowly sweeping our nation.  Schools are not prepared to meet the requirements it takes to educate these children.  The only way for a child to break out of poverty is through education, successful teachers are needed to meet this goal.  To be a successful teacher one must have three characteristics:  self awareness, awareness of environment and the maintainance of high expectations.

Most people know that fibres from wood are needed to produce paper. But a paper only existing of fibres would not be able to be formed into a sheet. At least the presence of water in the paper sheet is necessary. Without water the individual fibres would not bind to each other and the sheet would disintegrate.

As will be discussed later, water is acting as a binding agent between the fibres by forming molecular bridges with hydrogen bonds. A hydrogen bond is a special type of dipole-dipole force that exists between an electronegative atom (the oxygen of the water molecule) and a hydrogen atom from another water molecule. This bond bridges the gap between electronegative atoms on the surface of one fibre to the other fibre.

Wood pulp is quite expensive and therefore it would be good to fill the sheet with a less expensive material. Some papers, especially the ones used for offset print, are filled with inexpensive anorganic fillers. The fillers also reduce thickness and increase smoothness of the paper.

During the forming process of the paper sheet on the paper machine the fibres need to be formed to the sheet. In order to prevent the fibres from flowing away with the removed water a special chemical, a retention aid, is used to bind the fibres to each other in the formed sheet. This chemical also increase dewatering speed and increases rentention of the filler in the forming sheet.

Most paper have a colour, even white papers are coloured. Wood pulp is naturally somewhat yellow, this can be compensated by introducing blue and violet dyes into the wood pulp. In order to increase whiteness further fluorescent whitening agents are mixed in the pulp.

The fibres, untreated, would absorb a lot of water or solvents during for instance writing or printing processes on paper. To prevent this the papermakers mix sizing agents into the pulp. Also the surface of the formed paper is treated, mostly with a coating of starch (unmodified or modified) or with a coating with fillers and binders.

A lot of papers disintegrate when put in water. For some papers this is not a problem. For hygienic papers that would be a disaster. Certain papers are therefore treated with wet strength agents, for instance so that a paper handkerchief does not break just after you sneeze your nose into it (imagine what could happen in the toilet).

==Application of the 2-1 architecture==
This architecture is used in practice for:
*'''line regenerators''', and for 
*'''slave clocks in''' long distance (='''Telecom''') '''networks'''.


The implementation with &lt;u&gt;linear phase comparator&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;linear VCO&lt;/u&gt; is the typical case, as it best fits those target applications.


This is the architecture that produces the sharpest high frequency rejection (40 dB/dec), that is important when:
* long distance links (=large distortions) affect the line signal with ISI and noise;
* regenerators are connected in series to cover a very long distance span. 

The use of a linear comparator (in contrast to a possible bang-bang alternative) generates very little noise.

As applications inside long distance equipment are less cost sensitive, the use of a linear comparator and of a linear VCOs with low noise and good linearity is possible.
:&lt;small&gt;Linearity of the characteristics all PLL elements allows matching tight, demanding specifications that are typical of the Telecom world.&lt;/small&gt;

The cascading of of several CDRs in a long distance connection becomes possible because of the low noise generation, good input noise rejection and predictable characteristics.

::'''The use of linear circuit blocks in these applications makes the linear model of the 2-1 architecture really and directly useful!'''


The ITU-T Recommendations generally indicate as a reference model the model that corresponds to the 2-1 architecture. 
::&lt;small&gt;For instance:&lt;/small&gt; 
::“a SEC will generally mimic the behavior of a 2-nd order ''(type 1)'' linear analogue phase locked loop. This allows the use of the terms (equivalent) 3 dB bandwidth and (equivalent) damping factor, as they are used in analog PLL theory, irrespective of the fact that in the implementation of a SEC, digital and/or non-linear techniques may be used.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;ITU-T G.813 (03/2003) Timing characteristics of SDH equipment slave clocks (SEC),  Appendix II: Considerations on bandwidth requirements, noise accumulation and payload wander accumulation, II.1 Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;''( SEC: a SDH equipment slave clock)''&lt;/small&gt;



In fact, when requirements are the following, like in a telecom networks:
* continuous transmission mode
* receiver cost may increase if an increase of the regeneration span offers a larger saving.

They translates into:
* filtering incoming phase noise is important
* the cost of circuitry with low noise generation is affordable
* fast acquisition is not important
then the preferred CDR implementation includes a phase comparator that behaves linearly, a low pass filter and a low noise oscillator whose frequency varies proportionally to the control signal. The PLL behaves very much as a 2-1 linear loop.

When more CDRs are chained so that their jitter transfer functions combine, then gain peaking must be minimum or absent: &amp;zeta; &gt;&gt; 0.7.



==== Loop parameters====
As seen in the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1|previous page]], the loop model is defined either by its performance parameters '''&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''&amp;zeta;'''  ,   or by its design parameters '''G''' and '''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''',
::&lt;small&gt;where τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the time constant of the loop filter and 1/ τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; its cut off frequency ;   G is the open loop DC gain = G&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; * G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; * G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;

As the application is reasonably well described by the model, the loop parameters offer a good enough description for most purposes.


The two sets of parameters are related:

  |+ style=&quot;color:black;&quot; |2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order PLL of type 1: relations between performance and design parameters
|-
  ! &amp;nbsp;Setting &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;zeta;&amp;nbsp;
  ! &amp;nbsp;Setting G and &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;
|-
  | align=&quot;center&quot; | G = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; / 2&amp;zeta;
  | align=&quot;center&quot; | &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = G/&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
  | align=&quot;center&quot; | &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / 2&amp;zeta;&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;
  | align=&quot;center&quot; |&amp;zeta;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 / 4&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;G
|}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;


&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; may vary within a +/- 30% range, but G may vary in a much wider range because it is linked also to the transition density.



'''&lt;u&gt;If&lt;/u&gt; the filtering caracteristics ( &lt;u&gt;τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; ) &lt;u&gt;are kept fixed&lt;/u&gt;, and just the open &lt;u&gt;loop gain is varied&lt;/u&gt;:'''
: ω&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = G / τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and '''ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =1 / ( 4 G τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)'''&lt;br /&gt;
: the 2-1 gets less damped with more gain, i.e. more damped with less gain.
:This behaviour of  ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;  with respect to the loop gain G explains why 2-1  is not used with bang-bang phase detectors nor VCOs that have a highly variable gain.
*The interesting characteristics of the 2-1 (rejection of the signal jitter, that make it preferred for regenerator applications) depends on a good control of the damping ratio, ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; . ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, in turn, depends on the loop gain G and decreases when G increases (risk of jitter peaking!): &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =1 / ( 4 G &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;).
&lt;small&gt;''It is important to keep in mind that the value of τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; may vary in certain interval (e.g. +/- 30% because of manufacturing variability, ageing, power supply and temperature), but that G varies in a wider range because, in addition to the same factors that affect τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; in particular is affected by the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#Uneven density of transitions in the reference signal|transition density]] of the incoming signal.''&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;Depending on the applications, D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; maybe considered as practically constant and equal to 50% (8B10B, 64/66 with scrambling, ...), or variable in a somewhat wider range around 50%. 

In this second case, the loop gain G variability is correspondingly larger.&lt;/small&gt;



&lt;small&gt;What is important is that this 2-1 loop has the lowest &amp;zeta; when G is maximum, and therefore the design constraint is to use the maximum value of G to match the minimum value allowed for &amp;zeta;.  When transition density decreases and G decreases, then &amp;zeta; increases and an overdamping of the characteristic must be accepted (the two poles of the characteristic of jitter transfer may become real and separate, degrading to some extent the valuable characteristics of this 2-1 loop.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;small&gt;''(It may also be pointed out that the 2 - 1 loop becomes unstable if the natural frequency &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; {that normally is about 1/2 &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; or lower} gets close to &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. As  &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; grows if the loop gain grows, it is not possible to use a bang-bang detector because its gain varies very much with the phase difference it measures).''&lt;/small&gt;



==== edit section====

====  ζ close to 1 (0.7 to 1.3) at minimum D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;====


The value of ζ shall be set by design close to 1 when D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is at its minimum expected value.

'''In other words ζ during real operation (taking into account all factors, including manufacturing variations of each different unit) may be found anywhere in the range 0.7 to 3 or 4.'''

:* If  ζ was &lt; 0.707, the jitter at frequencies around ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; would be amplified during the transit through the PLL [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1#Jitter transfer function|''&lt;small&gt;as seen when studying the jitter transfer function of this loop&lt;/small&gt;'']], and more so for smaller values of ζ. 

::Amplification of jitter may - if the input jitter at those frequencies is large enough to start with - accumulate when more identical regenerators are interconnected in a chain along the signal path (a not infrequent case in geographical networks) and eventually deteriorate the jitter tolerance beyond the acceptable boundary.

:* When ζ &gt;&gt; 1, the loop behaves more and more like a first order loop. The sharp cutoff at about  &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; , typical of a good 2nd order loop, smooths out, and the jitter at frequencies around ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; is less effectively rejected.


Similar indications are derived from the study of the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1#Error signal|&lt;u&gt;error signal&lt;/u&gt;]] in this 2-1 loop.

:Large values of ζ ( &gt;&gt; 1) involve an appreciable error even at frequencies much lower than &lt;math&gt;\omega_{n2}&lt;/math&gt;; 
:small values of ζ ( &lt; 1.0) correspond to large overshoots of the phase error just above &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;.


Values of ζ between 0.7 and 1.3 are therefore an inevitable design choice. Other considerations that can be drawn from the study of the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1#Jitter tolerance|&lt;u&gt;jitter tolerance function&lt;/u&gt;]] confirm the choice of this range of ζ values for the regenerator CDR design.




====   ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; and ω&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;====

The cut-off frequency of the loop filter block ''&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' =1/&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; fixes the bandwidth of the closed loop, apart from the minor adjustments of &amp;zeta; as it varies within its allowed range).

The natural frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; (which can also be seen as the jitter cutoff frequency of the CDR) is defined by the loop gain and by  ω&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; :
&lt;center&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = G&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and can also be expressed as a function of just ζ and ω&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; :
&lt;center&gt;'''ω&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; /2ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/center&gt;
This simple formula tells that ''(in a &lt;u&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order  PLL of type 1&lt;/u&gt; where  ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; must remain close to 1)'' the natural frequency  ω&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; remains close to &lt;u&gt;half&lt;/u&gt; the cutoff frequency of the loop filter!


[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1#The steady state error due to fp – ffr difference and the steady state error of the sampling time|'''VCO good centering and narrow jitter bandwidth''']]


In the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 1, loop, the VCO frequency mismatch  f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; becomes a sampling time error E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;  according to:
&lt;center&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;)/G &lt;/center&gt;  
&lt;small&gt;''(G= G&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;*G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;*G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;)''&lt;/small&gt;
For fixed open loop dc gain G and filter time constant τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, the jitter cut-off frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; is:
&lt;center&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; = G * 2&amp;zeta; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; =  ((ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;) * 2ζ ) / ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
It is easy to see that, for a 1st order type 1 loop:  E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; =  ((ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;)  / ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The same equation, rearranged, tells that the frequency mismatch and the maximum E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; define how tight the the loop jitter bandwidth can be: 
&lt;center&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; / 2ζ   =   (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;) / ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;   =   ((ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;)/ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)  /  (ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;/ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;(ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; / ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; )    =    ((ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;) /ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)  /  (E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; /2ζ ))&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
It is easy to see that, for a 1st order type 1 loop:  (ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;/ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ) = ((ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;) /ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) / E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; )
&lt;/div&gt;

For instance, if E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is conservatively set as low as = 0.1 rad, then ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; can be :
ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; ≃ 20 * (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;) .

As seen already about [[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Acquisition, tracking and jitter performances#Requirements and characteristics|CDRs and parts per million of frequency mismatch]], the free running frequency of a slave CDR may differ no more than 50 ppm from the frequency of its remote master (very low cost quartz crystal), or 10000 ppm (monolythic RC oscillator after EWS trimming), or even differ less than 1 ppm, still without big cost concerns (quartz for GPS receivers inside mobile phones). Less than 0.1 ppm is typical of professional equipment.

The four mentioned cases would set a respective minimum for the design choice of ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; at:
0.001 ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; , 0.2 ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; , 2 e-5 ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; , 2 ppm ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; .

For a 2-1 loop when high transmission speed is involved, a jitter-out/jitter-in bandwidth of about 1/1000 of the bit rate  is specified by most standards [http://www.tek.com/document/primer/clock-recovery-primer-part-2| Clock Recovery Primer, Part 2 by Guy Foster, par.10: Survey of Clock Recovery Used in Selected Standards]. Therefore the typical limit for ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; to respect is .....

====   ω&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; and ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; ====

In a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR based on a first order PLL|1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order loop]], the quantity ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = G tells how fast the loop reacts. The higher ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, the faster the loop response.

For the 2nd order loop it is difficult to relate ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; to how fast the loop reacts to a change. In the 2 - 1 loop, for ζ ≈ 1, and setting -for sake of comparison- the gain G equal for the two loops:
&lt;center&gt; &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; G&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;ω&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 2 ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In other words a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 PLL (ζ ≈ 1) wold seem twice as “fast” as a 1st order PLL of the same gain!

But it can also be seen that, setting, for sake of comparison, ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, then [[Clock and Data Recovery/Miscellanea#Unit step responses from the (jitter) transfer functions|the 2nd order type 1 loop is not practically slower than the 1st order loop]]!

:“Slow or fast” in the sentences above means both:
::- slow or fast to acquire the lock condition
::- slow or fast to drift to its free running frequency when the input signal disappears.

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;The following figure contrasts the Unit Step Responses of the 3 important PLL models:&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Why do kids in poverty score lower on standardized tests?'''
By: Ashley Ellis

'''Introduction'''

Over the years, poverty has been a major social problem for the United States that has affected millions of American citizens. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2006, 36.5 million people lived in poverty and 12.8 million children under the age of 18 lived in poverty as well (Poverty 2006 Highlights). In 2005, 12.6 million U.S. families were not able to obtain enough food to feed their family members due to lack of money (Barton &amp; Coley, 2007). The conditions and issues experienced by those in poverty cause an immense amount of stress and uncertainty, which makes it extremely hard to get through each day. Children in poverty stricken families struggle to receive a proper education and to perform well in school. Educators and the U.S. government are faced with the issue of solving the achievement gap between children who live in poverty and children who live in the middle and upper class. To conquer and fix the achievement gap, educators and government officials must first understand and evaluate why students from low-income families have lower achievement levels than students from middle and high-income families.

'''Effects of Poverty on Student Performance'''

Students living in poverty deal with numerous obstacles such as poor quality schools, violence, and limited access to health care and insurance, all of which affect school performance and cause achievement gaps. Low quality home life is one of the biggest obstacles affecting children in poverty as “much of what later shows up as achievement gaps begins before children even enter school” (Achievement Gaps, 2008, p. 5). The report The Family: America’s Smallest School found that “by the time they’re four years old, children in families where at least one parent is a professional hear 35 million more words than children of parents on welfare,” (Achievement Gaps, 2008, p. 5). This finding represents a huge disadvantage for children in welfare families, because their vocabulary will be extremely limited. It also puts them behind for kindergarten and possibly makes it harder to comprehend what they are taught in kindergarten. Another obstacle faced by students in low-income families is a constant need to move to find affordable housing and obtainable jobs [[Image:Wiki Article.jpg|50px]]. As a result of moving, students have to change schools constantly, which is a problem because “research has shown that changing schools frequently can have a negative impact on student achievement” (Barton &amp; Coley, 2007, p. 14). 

In addition to low quality home life and constant moving, children living in poverty are much “more likely than children from middle-class backgrounds to report increased levels of anxiety and depression.” These factors make it almost unbearable for these children to focus in class and on school assignments, thus leading to poor academic achievement (Amatea &amp; West-Olatunji, 2007, para. 3). The increased levels of anxiety and depression experienced by students in poverty can result from the violence they witness in their neighborhoods and especially in the schools they attend, since they are “more likely to report the presence of gangs in the school than [are] those from higher income households” (Barton, 2003, p. 18). Little or no access to health care and insurance is another major problem for children attending high-poverty schools, because they have increased absences from ongoing illnesses that they cannot afford to treat. Therefore, they miss out on the educational content being taught and fall behind (Barton &amp; Coley, 2007).  The schools children in poverty attend usually have “inadequate facilities, fewer textbooks and supplies, less administrative support, and larger class sizes,” which makes it hard for teachers to provide a quality education to these children so they can have high academic achievement (Amatea &amp; West-Olatunji, 2007, para. 5). 

All of these obstacles lead to “greater incidence of school failure [and] lower standardized test scores” amongst children who live in poverty (Amatea &amp; West-Olatunji, 2007, par. 5).

'''Opposing Arguments &amp; Research'''

Even though there is overwhelming evidence that students in poverty perform lower academically, evidence does exist that proves otherwise. A report published by the Center on Education Policy found that “low-income students at public urban high schools generally perform as well on achievement tests as students who attend private high schools” (Urban Students, p. 5). This finding contradicts the argument that students in poverty score lower on standardized tests than students in middle and upper classes. Another report, Are Private High Schools Better Than Public High Schools?, also contradicts this argument by stating private school students “didn’t do any better on math, reading, science and history tests” than those students attending public schools (Urban Students, p. 5). Specific ethnic groups, such as African-American and Filipino-American, often get placed into the category of low-income students because they perform lower academically than students in middle and upper classes, but this is not always the case. For example, the Filipino-American students in the Lodi Unified School District are proving they do not fit into the academic achievement gap by “continu[ing] to outscore every other student population year after year,” which their standardized tests scores prove as they “beat out the Lodi Unified's total average by a whopping 73 points” (Dyer, 2008, p. 1). 

Of course there will always be contradicting evidence and research to the argument that students who live in poverty display lower academic achievement, however; educators and government officials still need to find solutions to the achievement gap that research has proven does exist in United States’ schools. 

'''Possible Methods &amp; Solutions'''

School counselors, teaching students to use technology efficiently, increased parent involvement in school, and providing early childhood education are examples of possible solutions to improving low-income students’ academic performance. Many school counselors “have received training in multicultural counseling” and therefore understand the different factors of poverty that negatively influence low-income children’s academic achievement (Amatea &amp; West-Olatunji, 2007, para. 7). School counselors who have received multicultural training can help school staff better understand the effects of poverty on low-income students, allowing teachers to “design[] more effective learning experiences” for students and more effectively reach their parents(Amatea &amp; West-Olatunji, 2007, para. 7). 

Technology has become essential to daily life and to most job professions. The U.S. Department of Education has jumped on board with technology by setting up the National Educational Technology Standards for schools to develop technological performances students should be able to complete by a certain grade (Thomas, 2007). Teachers frequently give students assignments where some form of technology is necessary to complete the task, but often students in high poverty schools are not knowledgeable on how to use computers or other forms of technology, which puts them at a severe disadvantage (Thomas, 2007). However, if high poverty schools effectively teach technology to students, then they will be prepared to “either enter the work force or [] complete higher-level degrees,” and begin to break the cycle of poverty because more and more low-income students will be prepared to obtain better jobs (Thomas, 2007, para. 16). 

Increasing the amount of parent involvement in children’s schooling can also help improve student performance, since research has proven “that when parents and schools work together to support student learning, children do better in school”  (Barton &amp; Coley, 2007, p. 32). Parents can become more involved by ensuring their students attend school regularly, having conferences with their children’s teachers, and ensure their students complete all assignments and projects (Barton &amp; Coley, 2007). 

Programs encouraging early childhood education such as Head Start have been in the headline of newspapers and have been major topics for U.S. legislators. This is partly because of the belief that the “school readiness gap begins before children enter school and places children at risk of failure in school” (An NEA, 2008, p. 1). State officials are being encouraged to adopt these preschool programs, because “research continues to confirm the benefits of quality early childhood programs” will prevent achievement gaps between low-income students and high-income students (An NEA, 2008, p. 1). Research supporting preschool programs has shown “children in quality preschool programs are less likely to repeat grades,” since they are better prepared to start school and are being equipped with the skills necessary to succeed in future levels of schooling (An NEA, 2008, p. 1).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==='''Timing in serial data transmission'''&lt;br /&gt;===
To transmit digital information over a certain distance, it often necessary to serialise it (you save in number of wires/connections but must deal with correspondingly higher bit rates).

The digital information is often encoded for error detection and correction.

The bit stream is transmitted with its clock information.

The resulting signal, during its journey, is affected by noise and by the transfer function of the transmission medium, and undesired corruption of the information content may follow.

At the receiving end, the signal is restored (it is equalised and the noise filtered out) as much as possible.

Then the timing information is extracted, and the bit stream regenerated.


The electronic circuits that accomplish these functions inside the data receiver are called '''the Clock and Data Recovery block''' (= '''the CDR''').

The timing information, i.e. the clock, is essentially carried by the level transitions of the received signal.

The action of recuperating the clock signal from the received signal is inevitably affected by some deterioration: the square wave extracted is not exactly synchronous with the transmit clock.

Data and clock, during their travel together, have been affected by the noise and by the inter-symbol interference and have acquired:
*some inevitable delay, due to the physical transit time, and to the extraction process,
*some timing inaccuracy  ''(= &lt;u&gt;phase modulation, called [[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Definition of (phase) jitter|jitter]]&lt;/u&gt;)''
*some errored bits with a (very) low probability, or –in other words-  a bit error rate of very low value (e.g. &lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;)


The jitter can be kept to a minimum with sophisticated clock extraction circuits, but not eliminated. 

On the other hand, in the network topology there are always points where signals that had been originated by the same clock and have cumulated different jitters along different transmission paths, must be put together again. 

To absorb the jitter differences an elastic buffer (i.e. a buffer memory) is used.

:''Note: a serialised transmission, with clock and data encoded together, becomes necessary when the bit rate and the wavelength at    the bit rate frequency become comparable (when different paths travelled by parallel streams can be different by 25% or more of a       wavelength).
:''For example:  at 1 Gbps the wavelength to refer to is:
:::'' c/(1 GHz)  =  3 * 10^8 m/s / 10^9  sec-1   =  30 cm.
:''Considering that on PCB the speed is 40% lower than in vacuum, the reference distance is 60% of 30 cm, or about 20 cm. As a result, serial encoded transmission @ 1 Gbps becomes preferred when distance differences amongst parallel paths are 5 cm or more.
:''The delay difference amongst different parallel paths causes bits, that have been sent at the same instant on different paths, to be received in different clock cycles of the clock at the receiving end. To put them back in sync, it is necessary to insert redundant bits inside each path, so that a frame sync can be detected. Then buffer memories on each path will be used to put back in sync all the bits of the parallel paths. Interfaces with this structure have been proposed, and are in use in some systems.
:''In most practical applications though, the approach of serialising several parallel streams of bits (typically 8), with the multiplication of the clock frequency, has been found to be preferable to the alternative approach of adding the sync structure on each bit stream at the transmit end and to recover that, with use of buffer memories, at the receive end.''

==='''CDRs and PLLs'''&lt;br /&gt;===
This book deals with CDR (Clock and Data Recovery) circuits, but the just the PLLs (Phase Locked Loops) that they incorporate are the circuit blocks that are analyzed and studied.
[[Image:Set_diagram_of_CDRs_and_PLLs.png|center|350px|]]
These PLLs are the important part of a CDR (= used for the Clock Recovery, = the CR part of the CDR).

The DR (Data Recovery) part of the CDR is not studied in any depth, and only the PLLs that are fit for the Clock Recovery function are studied here.


PLLs used for other applications&lt;ref&gt;Choquet and Jacquemod: Tutorial: Fundamentals about PLL, 2008, http://www.same-conference.org/same_2008/images/documents/SLIDE/TECHNICAL/Tutorial_1_TI_Polytech.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, like for instance position detection of mobile objects or identifications of non-modulated signals, are not considered.

In recent years, owing to the explosive growth of mobile phones, a lot of development has been made on PLLs inside frequency synthesizers (they are not CDRs). It may be said that nowadays a very large part of the PLLs implementations are in frequency synthesizers.

What is special in PLLs for CDRs is a direct consequence of the &quot;blending&quot; of information bits with their clock into a unique serial stream of pulses. 
Often a NRZ transmission of the information bits does the job perfectly. 
For other transmission channels a different &quot;encoding&quot; of bits and clock may optimise better the overall performances and increase the reach before a regeneration is needed.

In all cases the &quot;blended&quot; serial stream, owing to the essential &quot;impredictability&quot; of the information bits, does not have a spectrum with neat lines at fixed frequencies but is spread out with large lobes; its level transitions do not occur at each of the possible instants but randomly on just part of them. The concept of [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#Uneven density of transitions in the reference signal|&quot;transition density&quot;]] is used in this book to simplify the mathematics. Moreover, these transitions, when they occur, jitter with respect to their ideal positions because of channel distortion and noise.

On the contrary, the signal that a frequency synthesiser locks into, is a regular periodic waveform, witha spectrum close to a strong line with noise sidebands. Its level transitions consequently occur with a 100% density.

===What this book is all about===
This book intends to provide a good theoretical base for the understanding, the study, the analysis and the design
of PLL systems meant for CDR applications.
&lt;br /&gt;
Two perspectives should be distinguished inside it, for an easier grasp:
# Some CDRs that are essentially linear (as far as CDRs can be linear) are studied. Their mathematical models are analysed in detail keeping in mind the real applications where they are used match exactly the model. They are:
##1. Loops of '''1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;''' order and of type '''1''', for applications of &quot;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Within the same clock domain|phase aligners]]&quot; and of &quot;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Master and slaves (slaves: regenerators or end points)|end points]]&quot;.
##2. Loops of '''2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;''' order and of type '''1''', for applications of &quot;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Master and slaves (slaves: regenerators or end points)|regenerators]]&quot;
# some CDRs with an additional very hard non-linearity are studied. The widespread (and often inevitable) use of [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator# Deliberately non-linear phase comparator|essentially non-linear phase comparators (bang-bang)]] leads to the use of more tolerant -even if less performing- architectures. ''(The gain of the bang-bang phase detector is not fixed, but varies with the phase difference at its inputs)''. Such &quot;robust&quot; architectures are:
##1. Loops of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order and of type 1 (exactly as in 1.1.), for applications of &quot;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Within the same clock domain|phase aligners]]&quot; and of &quot;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Master and slaves (slaves: regenerators or end points)|end points]]&quot;.
##2. Loops of '''2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;''' order and of type '''2''' (non-preferred if a linear phase comparator is used), for applications of &quot;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Master and slaves (slaves: regenerators or end points)|regenerators]]&quot; and of &quot;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Master and slaves (slaves: regenerators or end points)|end points]]&quot;. This last architecture (2.2.) is also analyzed in detail using (no other way) a model based on a &quot;linear&quot; phase comparator, but having as an objective  the comprehension of its behavior when incorporating a bang-bang phase detector.


For all the listed cases (1.1., 1.2. and 2.2.):
# the model (functions of the complex variable s or of jω) is provided, so that the operation in &quot;small signal&quot; conditions is studied (jitter transfer, jitter tolerance, noise)
##of each PLL block and
##of the overall system
#a simulator program is provided. It accepts as inputs the loop parameters and the input signal characteristics and provies as output a representation of the &quot;large signal&quot; behavior in those conditions, i.e. of the loop acquisition waveform.

== Hello! Information? ==

Hello BORGATO, how are you? I like your book very much, it's a topic that's of personal interest to me. I've done a majority of work on the [[Control Systems]] and [[Signals and Systems]] books, so that should give you an idea of my background.

I heard that you moved this book here from Wikipedia, correct? I would like to get a little bit of information about this from you, if possible. Why did you move the material to Wikibooks? Was the material deleted on Wikipedia? Also, are there any things that we can do to help you and your project? I have a Wikibooks news blog that I write, and I like to include stories about how Wikibooks and Wikipedia interact. I would like to write a little clip about you and your book, if you don't mind. Thanks! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:00, 15 April 2008 (UTC)

Hi, Whiteknight! I sent you a reply via email. Got it? By, [[User:BORGATO Pierandrea|BORGATO Pierandrea]] ([[User talk:BORGATO Pierandrea|talk]]) 21:47, 23 April 2008 (UTC).

:Yes I did, and I'm sorry I didn't reply sooner. Your Curriculum Vitae is very impressive! With your experience in baseband transmissions, you might be able to lend a hand or an eye to the young [[Communication Networks]] book, or the [[Communication Systems]] book. Of course, I'm sure you're busy enough with your own projects! I agree with you that Phase aligners, PLLs and DLLs are terribly misunderstood in engineering. I can see it every day in class on the blank stares of my fellow students. A good book on this subject is therefore very important. I look forward to reading more of your book, and helping in any way that I can. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:10, 24 April 2008 (UTC)

Thanks for your upload of [[:File:Multilevel eye diagrams.png]]. Please note that GFDL license is not very well designed for images. Could you also clarify who the author/copyright-holder is? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:02, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

: Dear Swift, I made a new drawing on purpose, to avoid copyright problems. The scope pictures previously used came from: Principles of data Communication, a book printed in 1968. So I think a copyright still applies, doesnt'it? 
And what license should be quoted for images made like this one? Thanks, Pierandrea. [[User:BORGATO Pierandrea|BORGATO Pierandrea]] ([[User talk:BORGATO Pierandrea|talk]])

:: Yes, the book is probably still under copyright. As for the update, if it is your own creation, you can pick whatever license you like. See [[Wikibooks:Media]] for the policy on licenses here.
:: The GFDL is ill-suited for images as the full license has to be attached to copies and derivative works. Releaseing the image into the public domain is simplest, but doesn't require people to attribute the work to you. See [[Wikibooks:Media]] for more.
:: Images that are under a free license and can be of use to others outside Wikibooks should be uploaded to [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]. Doing so makes the transparently available on any Wikimedia project (Wikipedia, Wikitionary, Wik...).
:: Let me know if this is still unclear (in particular the pages I linked to) or there is anything else you'd like help with. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:33, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Hope you wouldn't mind participating on the &quot;vote&quot; to restore the [[Wikibooks:Administrators#Becoming_a_CheckUser|CheckUser (CU) function]] (mostly used to fight vandalism) to the Wikibooks project, a &lt;u&gt;minimum of 25 expressions of support is required&lt;/u&gt; to grant the flag to administrator Thenub314 (this will also enable admin Adrignola to get the function active again, since there is a minimum requirement of 2 active Wikibookians with the flag). In case you do agree to participate, your vote needs to be added to [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions#Thenub314.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0email.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0contribs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0logs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0rights.29_.28CheckUser.29|administrator Thenub314 request for permission]].

== Clock and Data Recovery ==

I noticed you created a new page for [[Clock and Data Recovery]] ([[Clock and Data Recovery/Noise is shaped by the PLL structure|Noise is shaped by the PLL structure]]), but placed it in the Wikibooks namespace instead of within the book. I had moved it to correct this mistake, and now there is two copies, the other still within the Wikibooks namespace at [[Wikibooks:Clock and data recovery/Noise is shaped by the PLL structure‎‎]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:29, 3 October 2011 (UTC)

: I have deleted the copy in the Wikibooks namespace. I have also deleted &quot;Clock and data recovery/The CDR' VCO&quot; which you had previously asked on the discussion page be deleted. Yet another copy of &quot;Noise is shaped by the PLL structure&quot; was created at [[Clock and data recovery/Noise interacts with the PLL]] roughly two days ago. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:39, 3 October 2011 (UTC)

== [[Special:UnusedFiles]] ==

Hi,
I'm a [[:w:WP:Wikignome|wikignome]] editor and cleaning up many pages. I was realizing that many images listed at [[Special:UnusedFiles]] were uploaded by you. After a short research, I believe that most(if not all) were replaced by a better/newer version. Is that so? Can 'we' delete these images? &lt;small style=&quot;font: 12px Courier New;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Mabdul|mabdul]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 10:46, 14 June 2012 (UTC)

:Ciao Mabdul, and thank you for your concern about these images. Yes, I believe that all of them are leftovers from my writing the book &quot;Clock and data recovery&quot;, because of my insufficient knowledge of the Wikibooks world.

:Please go ahead and delete them (I do not know how to delete them) as long as they are not any longer used by pages of that book.

:If you will also find the time to improve the pages of that book by whatever means, please do and I will thank you for that as well (BORGATO Pierandrea 13:02, 14 June 2012 (UTC)).</text>

      <comment>/* Phase aligners */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===[[w:Data_buffer|Data Buffers]] in association with CDRs===
The CDR function is primarily a layer 1 function, in the sense of the [[wikipedia:OSI_model| OSI Reference Model]].


A [[wikipedia:Data_buffer#Telecommunication buffer| Telecommunication buffer]] is a [[w:Data_buffer|Data Buffer]] specialized for the Telecom application. 

In the scope of CDR applications, the Telecom buffer further specializes to simply add a convenient delay to a serial data stream.

Such buffer, in principle, consists of a R/W memory with circularly sequential addresses, and of two counters.
[[Image:Buffer_memory.png|frame|center|width=700px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Example of a Telecom buffer that adds a delay.&lt;br&gt;(Up to about 32 bits of memory size, the memory structure can be as simple as a shift register. If larger, it is implemented as a memory bank)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
The write counter times the writing into the memory of an incoming serial flow of information, and the read counter sets, in turn, the timing of the reading operation.

===Elastic buffers===

In general a buffer memory may be used to absorb delays, or just delay variations (wander and/or jitter), generated by transmission over physical media, or by software elaboration, or other types of delays.

If the buffer is meant to absorb delay variations due to the transit along a transmission path (that is: designed to absorb wander and/or jitter),

then its size in bytes (or in bits) is smaller,

the control of the phase relation between the write and the read clocks is more accurate, 

and its name specializes into “&lt;u&gt;elastic buffer&lt;/u&gt;”.


An adder compares the content of the two counters, computing the difference between the two. 

Its output gives an indication of the relative phase of the two clock signals, very similar to the output of a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator|phase comparator]] of a PLL:

:at the start-up of the system, the write counter is set to 0, and the reading counter is set to half the memory depth. 

:If the initial value of the read counter is set to less than half the memory depth, then less than the entire memory may be used and the transit delay through the elastic buffer may be less.

===Phase aligners===
A special case of elastic buffer is the &quot;phase aligner&quot;
::'' The phase aligner is an elastic buffer used inside a single clock domain. The CDR that recovers the write clock is typically implemented as a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR based on a first order PLL|1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order PLL]].''
:A more formal definition, without mention of the operation within a single clock domain, can be:&lt;br&gt;
::'' '''The phase aligner is a buffer memory that shifts the phase of the received signal so that it matches the phase of a reference clock'''.''

:: in some application the phase aligner may be be defined as incorporating the CRD that recovers the write clock (wider definition), or not (stricter sense definition), as will be seen in the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains# Within the same clock domain|next page]]. 
:: In some specialized cases it may be defined as accomplishing a CDR function itself in cascade to the CDR that recovers the write clock [[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Cascades of Buffers and CDRs, delays and tolerance#de-jitterizer|(de-jitterizer)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''How can constructivism be used in a Classroom?'''

By: Sarah Twiford

Ms. Smith teaches her first grade class about the construction of a sentence. Each week the class is given new words to put on the word tree. To create a larger word tree, the students create new sentences on their own using their new weekly words. Then together as a class the students and Ms. Smith will discuss the new sentences and decide which ones should be used for the word tree. Ms. Smith uses constructive theory teaching to create a positive English lesson in the classroom. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;

Constructivism does not claim to have made earth-shaking inventions in the area of education; it merely claims to provide a solid conceptual basis for some of the things that, until now, inspired teachers had to do without theoretical foundation.
E. Von Glasersfeld (1995) 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


----


&lt;big&gt;'''Where did constructivism come from?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Bruner introduced the theory of instruction in 1966. Piaget researched childhood development and education in 1967. Piaget believed that childhood development was connected with cognitive learning. (Constructivism, 2008, paragraph 1)Bruner had four main aspects to his theory of learning. One, predisposition towards learning, Two, the ways in which a body of knowledge can be structured so that it can be most readily gasped by the learner, Three, the most effective sequences in which to present material, and Four, the nature and pacing of rewards and punishments.(Constructivism Theory J.Bruner, 1996, paragraph 3) These two philosophers, along with ideas and theories from others, like Vygotsky and Dewey, became the learning theory, constructivism.


----


&lt;big&gt;'''What is Constructivism?'''&lt;/big&gt;

The constructivist learning theory states that students use cognitive processes to construct knowledge or understanding of the material to be learned. The student is the key to learning. Constructivism is the way a student is able to build on knowledge to understand and develop new concepts. Bruner’s three main principles of constructivism are: readiness- instruction must be concerned with the experiences and contexts that make the student willing and able to learn. Spiral organization- instruction must be structured so that in can be easily grasped by the student and going beyond the information given- instruction should be designed to facilitate extrapolation and or fill in the gaps. (Constructivism, 2003, paragraph 8)
Constructivism is the concept that by reflecting on our own experiences, we construct our own rules and modules of how to do something. From there we try to construct a new way to develop on old idea and module it to our liking. As a student, one most understand the whole concept first. Then the student will be able to construct new meaning. The teacher needs to understand the conception of the student, so the teacher is able to guide the student along. (Constructivism learning intervention, 2008, paragraphs 3-5) 


----


&lt;big&gt;'''How to use Constructivism as a Teaching Theory.'''&lt;/big&gt;

Constructive teaching is based on the recent research about the human brain and what is known about how learning occurs. The two main types of constructivism are social constructivism and cognitive constructivism. Social constructivism emphasizes on how meanings and understandings grow out of social encounters. Cognitive constructivism is about how the individual learner understands things, in terms of developmental stages and learning styles. This is greatly explained through Piaget. He has a developmental stage called accommodation. This is when a person has knowledge in their head and the person comes across new knowledge. That person will reconstruct the ideas within their head to accommodate the new ideas. 
In a classroom, the curriculum should not be standardized. It should be related to the students prior knowledge of a subject and emphasize on hands on problem solving. The teacher should focus mainly on making connections between facts and encouragement with new understandings from the students. Teaching strategist should be structured toward encouraging students to analyze, interpret, and predict information. (Constructivism, Instructors as facilitators, 2008, paragraphs 1-2) David Jonassen, a theorist, identified three major roles for a facilitator to support students in constructivist learning environments; modeling, scaffolding and coaching. (Constructivist teaching methods, 2008, paragraph 8) A great technique should be open-ended questions and extensive dialogue with the student. As for assessments, the student should assess themselves. The teacher should not create structured tests for the student. The student needs to judge themselves.

&lt;big&gt;'''How to use Constructivism as a Learner.'''&lt;/big&gt;

Constructive learning should be based on the concepts of question or issue, case study, long term project or problem (multiple cases and projects integrated at curriculum level). This idea of constructive learning is stated by theorist, David Jonassen. (Constructivist teaching methods, 2008, paragraph 10) Students learn content theory through solving problems. Social constructivism is more widely recognized and accepted by both the teacher and the learner. A learner will use social constructivism to emphasize a discussion on creating and developing their own ideas of a concept.
Learners with difficult skills and learning disabilities should collaborate in tasks and discussions in order to arrive at a shared understanding of the specific concept. (Constructivist teaching methods, 2008, paragraph 11) The student will assess themselves through oral discussion. The teacher should present the focus question and the students should accommodate the idea and develop on it. Another great constructive technique is hands on activities. Students seem to correspond better and grasp a concept quicker through hands on activities.

&lt;big&gt;'''Arguments and Misunderstandings behind Constructivism.'''&lt;/big&gt;

In contrast to behaviorism, constructivism focuses on process of learning rather than on learning behavior. (Becoming A Teacher, 2004, Chapter 3 page 90) Some observers of teaching theories confuse the concepts. Behaviorism is a theory of learning as nothing more than the acquisition of new behavior.(Behavorism, 1998-2001, paragraph 1) Experiments done to develop the theory include conditioning, both classic conditioning and behavioral conditioning. This theory relies on the observable behavior not the observation of the learning within the behavior. (Becoming A Teacher, 2004, Chapter 3 page 90) 
Other fields of study have had their authors voice their opinion on the central claims of constructivism. Groups of cognitive scientist have questioned the central concept, saying they are either misleading or contradicting known findings. Zhu and Simon (1987) state that because the emphasis is not based on acquiring and practicing basic skills, students in constructive classrooms tend to lag behind those in traditional classrooms in these areas. (Constructivist teaching methods, 2008, paragraph 11)
What about the strong willed students who take over discussions? Does that mean students are being left out? Is there a way for the students to equally address concepts and have amble information to add? As a future teacher I hate to see a student get lost in the shuffle. Is there a way to have a more standard style of teaching with constructivism as a basis? Here are some concept questions I have thought of.

&lt;big&gt;'''Summary'''&lt;/big&gt;

Constructivism is a learning theory that has been introduced by some of the greatest psychological theorists of the world; Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, and Bruner. Together they have created a theory that has the student as the main focus of learning, not only as the leaner but as the teacher to ones’ self and peers. Constructivism is a theory of perception and analysis. Students are to assess themselves and accommodate the knowledge around them. Teachers are there for the student as a guiding  tool. The teacher is to give an initial idea and have the students explore their thoughts. A holistic approach to learning is great way to explain and understand constructivism.

The Volcanoes/Special Topics page will cover phenomena like supervolcanoes.

== Supervolcanoes ==
Supervolcanoes, compared to eruptions like [[w:Tambora]], are simply giants. A supervolcano is ''ten times'' the size of a VEI 7 eruption, like Tambora, and their destruction could happen again. About 74,000 years ago, Mt. Toba erupted in Sumatra, Indonesia, with an apocalyptic eruption that reduced the human race to around 5-10,000 survivors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello! I had to comment on your page because it seems we have an identical view on teaching. If you look on my user page you'll see that I feel the exact same way about how getting through to one student would make my entire career well worth it. I think that's what has drawn me to teaching and also what will keep me in the proffession after the many years and headaches I'm sure to endure. One more thing, I have always wanted to go to a drive-in movie theater! Definatley jealous about that. And I ''do'' have verizon and, I ''could'' use a new phone...seriously! P.S what's your name, it's not on your page? [[User:Jbowe017|Jbowe017]] ([[User talk:Jbowe017|talk]]) 17:42, 30 January 2009 (UTC)


I think its great that you feel that way about teaching. A friend of mine is currently teaching, and she says the exact thing for father does. I cannot wait to inspire and encourage at least one student in my class. [[User:Bwhit050|Bwhit050]] ([[User talk:Bwhit050|talk]]) 16:10, 4 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

History and Rewards of Teaching

	“Teaching is a process in which a person helps other people to learn,#” .  Teaching educates individuals by increasing their knowledge, thus opening doors of opportunities for independence. Education allows a person to live a more productive life with greater job security. It also trains an individual to be more responsible and it offers rewards of personal gratification.  Education developed from scholars like Aristotle, Socrates, and other philosophers in ancient Greece. The creation of knowledge began in ancient Athens and other Greek cities. Education also flourished in China. The Orient made important contributions to art and science. The first scholars began in Europe around churches and monasteries. The Renaissance Era opened paths to the education of mind and spirit. 
	Most teaching occurs at home as parents teach their children informal values such as habits and manners. The most effective teaching takes place formally in schools by professional teachers. The first teacher based schools began in Western Europe in the 1800’s and before then teachers received no training at all. Today, most teachers are educated in an accredited program. “Public school teachers must have at least a bachelor’s degree, complete an approved teacher’s education program and be licensed.#” 
Obtaining a Bachelors Degree 
	“The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education currently accredits teachers across the United States,#”. A student must first obtain a bachelor degree in liberal arts. General colleges and universities offer teacher training programs. Students must apply to a teacher program by their sophomore year. In their junior and senior years, elementary school teachers must complete a wide variety of subjects they plan on teaching such as mathematics, art, litature, physical science, social science and music. They also must complete professional educational classes like teaching methods, the philosophy of education and the psychology of learning. 
	 Most states use their own state exams and the National Teacher Examination (NTE) Core Battery Test for certification. Also, every state has its own passing scores. The state of Virginia uses the NTE core battery exam and area specialty exams. “Passing scores on the three battery test are as follows: communication skills-649, professional knowledge-639, general knowledge-639, # “.
	
License to Teach
	Public school teachers must be licensed in the state of Virginia. The State Board of Education usually grants the license or it can be through a licensure advisory board. 	Teachers must be licensed to teach preschool through twelve grade. “Requirements for regular license to teach  kindergarten through grade twelve vary by state, #” . “The Virginia licensure regulations stipulate three routes for an individual to become licensed in Virginia: 1.) Approved Program, 2.) Reciprocity, 3.) Alternative Licensure ,#”.  
	In a program the state of Virginia requires the student to be enrolled in a teacher educational program. In reciprocity, an individual can acquire accreditation from another state if they have completed similar educational requirements through a state-approved program or the individual can hold a out of state license. The alternative licensure is another route made through a private school or through an recommendation of another teacher. Then, the teacher can obtain a three year nonrenewable provisional license from the state if they possess a baccalaureate degree from an accredited university and satisfies one or more teaching endorsements areas.
	The fifty state system is now responsible for licensing teachers in 3,000 local licensing authorities. New York and Chicago allow their large school district to license teachers. In recent years, some states have tightened certification by requiring five years of preparation. Other states like Virginia have make it easier for teachers to enter the profession. They have opened doors to students with other college major who had no teacher education.
	
Conclusion
	Teaching contributes to our society and to our future in very special ways. It is a challenging profession. The work is demanding but satisfying. It has unlimited opportunities for life long learning and intellectual growth. 	The Board of Education predicts a significant increase in elementary and secondary school teachers over the next twenty years because of our rapid population growth and from the retirement of a large number of teachers in the next few years. College admission requirements for teacher training program vary in different states. First, an interested individual needs a good high school academic record to meet basic requirements for the college they are applying for. Next, they must apply for a teacher’s training program at the institution of their choice. Then, they must apply for their license. 
	The best teachers are the only ones qualified to teach our children. Teachers professional knowledge is unique.  Engineers, lawyers or nurses acquire specialist knowledge that is directly related to their field of practice. Teachers first acquire knowledge of their chosen subject. Then, they apply their knowledge to teach a planned curriculum. They are also responsible for the entire school program of their grade. Teachers also teach all subjects. They supervise lunch periods and meet with parents. They are essential to the growth and development of our young children. Teachers communicate with their students as they share what they know. Their greatest accomplishments are encouraging the youngest mind to explore, learn and develop into a responsible adult.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The question that had crossed everyone’s mind as a teacher is whether or not positive discipline works better? There are many discipline problems in the classroom, but the most frequently disruptions in the classroom are,  acts of disruption such as talking and fidgeting, acts of defiance such as disrespectful behavior and disobedience, and acts of inattention such as being off task, not doing one's work, or out of their seat( Geiger,2000, par. 3). Should these students be punished with the zero tolerance or by the positive discipline method? In this article we will go over positive discipline, zero tolerance discipline, and which way is really the best way.

==Positive discipline==

This new orientation called positive discipline; aims at establishing a nurturing learning environment by using positive approaches for intervention (McGinnis, Frederick, &amp; Edwards, 1995, par. 7) Misbehaving children are discouraged children who have mistaken ideas on how to accomplish their primary goal, which is to belong. Their mistaken ideas will eventually lead them to misbehavior. We cannot be effective unless we address the mistaken beliefs rather than just the misbehavior. An example of positive discipline is instead of saying, “don’t kick the desk,” you could say, “keep your feet on the floor.” Some good ways to handle misbehavior with positive discipline is to ignore. Effective ignoring involves not talking to or looking at the child or using any body language that indicates attention. Redirecting is another good way to help the child find an alternative activity that is relative to the work. Cooling off is another way to help with sudden outbursts or anger, and sending a child somewhere quiet to cool off is a good way for children to calm down and get their thoughts together. The last way to handle misbehavior with positive discipline is with allowing consequences do they have choices and learn from the consequences of their choices. According to Jane Nelson who wrote a book called Positive Discipline Guide she said that, “Punishment may &quot;work&quot; if all you are interested in is stopping misbehavior for &quot;the moment.&quot; Sometimes we must beware of what works when the long-range results are negative—resentment, rebellion, revenge, or retreat” (Nelson, 2001, par 13).She also talked about  that teaching children that make mistakes are wonderful opportunities to learn and that you can do this by using the three ‘R’s, which are to recognize your mistake, reconcile: Be willing to say &quot;I'm sorry, I didn't like the way I handled that,” and resolve: focus on solutions rather than blame (Nelson, 2001, par.14). The overall goal of positive discipline is to give them skills for making decisions, gradually gaining self control, and being responsible for their own behavior.

==Zero Tolerance==

“Zero tolerance means that a school will automatically and severely punish a student for a variety of infractions (Tebo, 2000).” By 1993 zero tolerance policies were being adopted by school boards across the country, often broadened to include not only drugs and weapons but also tobacco-related offenses and school disruption (Russ Skiba and Reece Peterson par. 7).  It has been almost a decade since school districts first began to adopt zero tolerance policies, and it has been four years since the policy was institutionalized nationally in the Gun-Free Schools Act. It was first started to keep violence out of schools, but now it has been adopted as a solution for any kind of problem a teacher may be having with a child. How exactly has it been working out for schools? After four years of implementation, the NCES found that schools that using zero tolerance policies are still less safe than those without such policies (Russ Skiba and Reece Peterson par. 17). “School administrators and school boards claim that their hands are tied by federal or state law and they also claim that continuation of the application of zero tolerance is necessary to send a message to disruptive students”( Russ Skiba and Reece Peterson par. 17)



==Which is better?==

So overall, which way of discipline is actually better? Well the zero tolerance approach has led to increases in the use of school suspension and expulsion; unfortunately, there is no evidence that suspension and expulsion are effective in changing student behavior or improving school safety. “Despite a widespread perception that suspension and expulsion are reserved for serious incidents, those consequences are often used indiscriminately; in 1997-98, only about 4% of the suspensions and expulsions in Indiana were in response to serious disruptions (Indiana University). Also, exclusionary approaches tend to be used inconsistently: one researcher concluded that students wishing to reduce their rates of suspension would do better changing schools than improving their behavior or attitudes (Indiana University, 2000, par. 5). Finally, while there is little data on the short-term effectiveness of suspension, in the long term, it is associated with higher rates of school dropout. Other strategies found ineffective included threats, warnings, and taking no action which had respectively 27, 14, and 20 percent success rate (Tulley &amp; Chiu, 1995). Corporal punishment, public humiliation, and reprimand were the least desired interventions (Ringer et al., 1993). Based on student-teachers' narratives, the most effective strategy to resolve discipline problems was found to be positive reinforcement. Praise, approval and/or reward, and planned ignoring were reported to have a 92 percent success rate when used to solve disruption problems (Ringer, Doerr, Hollenshead, &amp; Wills, 1993; Tulley &amp; Chiu, 1995, par.11). 

==Conclusion==

After researching for the positive discipline and the zero tolerance discipline, I have learned a lot about both sides of these two disciplines. Although zero tolerance is a quick solution to a problem at that time, but it is not a lasting effect on the student. With the positive discipline, you are working with the child and understanding their problems more and you are also getting to know who they are. When I think of zero tolerance, I begin to think of children that bring guns to school or threaten someone’s life, or something that is endangering someone’s life. I don’t think of zero tolerance as someone being suspended for being tardy a few times or just acting up in class. There is a place and time for zero tolerance to be in effect but for most schools around the country, they are not having problems related to that. Positive discipline has seemed to work in the past years for students, and statistically positive discipline works a whole lot better than zero tolerance, and positive discipline is definitely a strategy that I will be using with my students in the future

== binary search ==
Dear Jrtayloriv,

While I agree that &quot;Readability more important than kewlness&quot;,
I was recently stunned -- STUNNED! -- to discover that
pretty much all the binary search implementations I've ever seen -- including my own --
have a subtle bug that none of my test routines ever checked.
I dropped a pointer on the [[Algorithm Implementation/Search/Binary search]]
to a detailed description of that subtle bug.

Is there any way to tweak [[Algorithm Implementation/Search/Binary search]]
to that it is *both* highly readable *and* also correct?

'''College Preparation vs. Vocational Education'''
By: Cassaundra Lewis

----
'''Introduction'''

:Every year thousands of students graduate from high school and go on to college. Every year hundreds are not as successful. What can be done to assure that more high school students go on to college? What can we do to prepare students for college? The United States has been debating these questions not only on state levels, but national as well. In this article I will discuss some of the benefits, hindrances, advances, and content of vocational education and college preparation courses.

----
'''What are college prep and vocational education?'''

:First we should define college preparation and vocational education. College preparation is a course or series of courses that help students adjust to many college-level requirements. Vocational education is a course or series of courses that give students work related experience to express the nature of careers and help them learn skills that will assist towards careers in the future. William Tierney writes, “Important objectives of most programs are the smoothing of the transition from school to college, improvement of study habits, increase of general academic readiness, and expansion of academic options” (Increasing Access to College, 2002, pg 3.

----
'''Who is targeted?'''

:One of the main targets of college preparation courses are low-income students and minorities, who make up a very small percentage of students attending both two and four year colleges directly after high school. Vocational education targets those who are even less likely to attend college immediately after high school. Both college prep and vocational education attempt to enlighten students about career choices and assist them with the transition from high school into the real world.

----
'''What progress is being made?'''

:According to Anne Lewis, of the Education Digest, “more students are taking upper-level math and science classes and more are enrolled in Advanced Placement classes” (College Prep, 2004, paragraph 1). She goes on to state, “the likelihood of ninth-graders completing high school and enrolling in college by age 19 (…, having graduated from high school within four years and directly entered a higher education institution) has declined”(paragraph 2). The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education grades each state, on a scale of A to F, on ability to effectively prepare students for college. Seven states received an “A,” Connecticut, Colorado, Massachusetts (who scored the highest), Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Utah. Louisiana and New Mexico were the only states to receive a “F.”

----
'''What all is included in the curriculum for college preparation and vocational education?'''

:What factors help in considering whether or not a program should be added or subtracted? Unfortunately, there is no fool proof way of being able to tell what is going to help and what isn’t. There are many things to take into consideration when choosing what programs to keep and eliminate. As far as college preparation is concerned, a lot of the learning occurs in advanced classes. Many different approaches are used, such as computer-based assessment and writing assessment. With vocational education, you must determine: What will the student want to study? What does the community need as far as work experience? What will motivate the students toward life after high school?

----
'''My Experience with college prep and vocational education.'''

:While I was in high school, I was fortunate enough to experience both college preparation and vocational education. In my opinion, college preparation did very little to help me familiarize myself with what college would actually be like. During my time as a vocational education student, I had hands on job training and was able to get my license as a cosmetologist when I graduated from high school. Vocational education did more for me on an overall level than college preparation. I do understand that not everyone was as fortunate as I and may not have had the same type of support that I received. One contributing factor, that is very often overlooked, is the influence of home life on attending college directly after high school.

----
'''Conclusion'''

:In my opinion, America will constantly have research to do to determine what all should be included in college prep and vocational education curriculum as the nations needs change. Economy is one of the leading factors in what should and shouldn't be included as part of the curriculum.

:I agree. In the Spanish Wikipedia there is lot of discussion because ''anticuchos'' is a word meaning different things in Peru and in Chile. I'll suppress the references to Chilean cuisine. [[User:Esmito|Esmito]] ([[User talk:Esmito|talk]]) 14:20, 29 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{bicycles}}
Tire inflation is by far the most frequent task that the bicycle owner encounters.   Fortunately, inflating tires is simple to learn.

==Overview==
Bicycle tires, for the most part, have an inner tube, and a protective rubber casing.   Tire inner tubes are inflated with air using a pump.   This is done via a one-way valve in the tube, that prevents the air from spilling out again.

Even when tires do not have punctures, manufacturing limitations cause small amounts of air to leak from them over a number of days. The resulting deflated tires make for heavier work pedalling.   In addition, low tire pressures increase the number of punctures.   See  [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Wheels_and_Tires/Fixing_a_flat| Repairing Punctures]] for details of such repairs.

==Preliminaries==
*Although tires exist that do not use an inner tube, these comments apply to tires with tubes.
*The manufacturer's recommended tire pressure is found written on the side of the tire.   For adult-sized bikes it is usually a figure between 50 and 100 psi, (pounds per square inch), though figures vary greatly.
*If you have no restrictions in choosing a pump, try to find one with a pressure gauge on it.   It will help to get the tire pressures right each time.
*If there is no pressure gauge on the pump then consider a separate gauge, sold as an accessory.
*If no gauge is available at all then there is no alternative but experience of how hard the tires should feel.
*Do not use garage air lines to inflate bike tires.   It is too easy to damage the tubes.   
       
==Valves, Connectors and Pumps==
===Valves===
Tubes have one of two main valve types:
* Schrader valves. These are similar to the kind found on motorcar tires.
* Presta valves. These are thinner than Schraders and have a small locknut on the end of the valve body, and a nut on the rim.
Shrader valve types have springs inside them, so they do not need locknuts to seal them.   After removing the dust cap, the pump can be applied directly or a pump-adaptor screwed into position.   

Presta valves need the locknut on the end of the stem unscrewed as far as it will go before securing the pump or adaptor to the valve stem.  Once the tube has been inflated, the locknut should be screwed closed again.  The locknut only needs to be finger-tightened so that it is snug when opening or closing.  Do not overtighten it.

It is unusual for valves to become blocked, except perhaps in the use of innertube sealants.   If valves are blocked then pumping becomes difficult.   Schrader valve cores can be removed for cleaning,  but in general Presta valves cannot.   (Bontrager and Schwalbe Presta valves are exceptions and ''do'' have removable cores).   Before attaching a pump it is a good idea to press the end of the valve so that escaping air can unblock any debris.

===Connectors===
*Both valve types have threads on their stems for connections, and hand pumps often need flexible adaptors to connect between the pump and the thread on the valve.   These connections, although used on the cheaper pumps, are useful in that they avoid stress on the valve stems during pumping.   Pumps of this kind can be used for both types of valve simply by changing the adaptor.
*The Schrader and Presta flexible adaptors have different threads; the Schrader is wide and the Presta is thin, so it is important to get the right adaptor for the valves on the tires.
*Other pumps do not use flexibles but are attached directly to the tops of the valves.   Some of these have connection heads that can be interchanged in the same pump, but some others are made only for one kind of valve.
*Some bicycle shops sell brass adaptors that allow any Schrader pump to convert to use with flexible adaptors of either kind, thus extending the use of the pump. 
*Track pumps, the kind that stand on the ground, use long flexible tubes and a choice of heads for direct attachment.
  
By far the most common connector is the threaded flexible tube that is screwed onto the valve and into the pump.  Press-on plastic connectors also have a lever to switch the air-flow on and off. The fittings for press-on connectors differ for the two valve types also, though some pumps have fittings for both.   The press-on fitting is faster to use so is found on most track pumps.

{{technote|Some pumps with press-on fittings have serrated screws on each head.   To get a proper, snug fitting with these, the screwed end can first be adjusted.  However, when the valve stem is loose owing to a very flat tire, it is best to support the valve stem while attaching the head; this reduces the stress on the stem.   For direct attachment pumps without a flexible connection, it is also a good idea to support the pump in use so that the stem remains in its usual position. 

These pumps often require that an air switch be positioned correctly before pumping.  In any case, when it feels that you are pumping against an unreasonable pressure, it usually means that the head of the pump is not properly seated on the valve or the switch is closed; stop pumping, check and re-seat the head.

If the tires have ''slime'' or other sealants in them, they can sometimes block the valve stems.   If pumping seems blocked in this situation, then bleed air from the tube until there is a good flow, before adding air. 

Instructions supplied on the packaging of such pumps tend to assume too much knowledge on the part of the user, and would benefit from a good deal of expansion. }}

Pumps that use a flexible connection tube are said to place lower stresses on the valve stems than those that press onto the valve stem directly.   (See the technical note box above).   The Presta valve has a locknut to hold it onto the wheel rim and that is also said to reduce valve stress.   This rim locknut should be finger-tight, and never over tightened.


[[image:Bike_pump.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A track pump with a gauge:   ''The slimmest tubes make for the easiest work.'']]

===Choosing a Pump===
Use the points below for guidance in choosing pumps.   For more information on pumps see  [[w:Bicycle_pump|Bicycle Pumps]].
:*The pump must be suitable for inflating to the pressures intended.   Some pumps cannot attain higher pressures.
:*The valve fitting must be the right kind for your tubes; Schrader or Presta; having both is best in case you can't find the right innertube. 
:*Consider how much effort is needed to use the pump.   Some lightweight riders might have trouble pumping to 100psi, even with a track pump.  Narrow-tubed pumps need less effort than wide-tubed pumps but take slightly longer to complete the task.
:*Some pumps are small enough to take on the bike, and can often be clipped to the frame.  In fact, some pumps are made to be the hidden part of the seat post. 
:*Inflation of tires is easiest with a fairly bulky track pump.  It is an upright pump that stands on the ground with a handle on top.   Some have a pressure gauge and have fittings for both valve types.  Since most tire inflation is done at home, the size of the pump is not a disadvantage.
:*Always ask the advice of the bike store, since they know what works best.   Also, browse on the internet for comments on your intended purchase.         
:*Ask at the store whether or not spares exist for the pump.

===Gas Inflators===
On the road it is often convenient to use a carbon dioxide gas canister to inflate tires.   These disposables are only about three inches in length, and contain some sixteen grams of gas at sufficient pressure to inflate most tires.   This assumes that any punctures are patched in the usual way. 

The accessory consists of a tool to hold the gas cylinder in place and a control valve to adjust the rate of inflation.   The tool with its cylinder is hand-sized so is small enough to carry on the bike or in a back-pack.

Another method uses a puncture repair fluid combined with air pressure and manufacturers claim that it makes internal repairs to punctures and inflates the tire at the same time.   The repair fluid  is retained for the life of the tire.  Such treatments are supplied in a container comparable in size to a deodorant aerosol.

Separate containers of internal repair fluid, (''Slime''), ''without'' gas inflation are also available, and these are usually poured into the tube after removing the valve core.   A connection tube as a pourer and a valve stem remover for Schrader valves is supplied with the bottle.   All Schrader valve cores  can be removed, but only Bontrager and Schwalbe tubes have removable Presta valve cores.   In any case Slime products are not supplied with removal tools for Presta valves, and because the Presta valve stems are thinner, the filling tubes would not fit.   Presta valve users, and for that matter Shrader users, are best to purchase inner tubes that are pre-filled with sealant by the manufacturer;   they are not much more expensive than the plain tubes.

==Inflating the Tire==
 [[image:Bicycle_pump_Luftpumpe.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A basic handpump:   ''This is the most common pump; cheap, easy to use, but takes some time for high pressures.'' ]]'''If the tire is completely flat:''' ''for example, when a puncture has been repaired''
*Add just enough air to the inner tube to give the tire some structure.
*Work around the tire with your fingers, pressing in the sides to make sure that the edges are properly seated.
*Then, inflate the tire in accordance with the usual methods given below.

'''Inflating with the Presta valve:'''
:*First rotate the bike's wheel to a convenient valve position. 
:*Remove the valve's plastic dust cap and place it somewhere safe.
:*Unscrew the small nut on the valve stem all the way to the end.
:*Depress the valve end briefly to air blast any debris from the valve   
:*Attach the pump to the valve.
:*Inflate with the pump to the required pressure.   If the pump feels pressure-blocked, rather than forcing it, check again for the proper fitting of the head, (see the technical note above), and try again. This will usually correct the problem.
:*Remove the pump from the tire and retighten the small nut on the valve stem.   If much pressure is lost in removing the pump then consider a slight overpressure during the pumping process.
:*Replace the valve's plastic dust cap, and make sure that the nut at the tire's rim is only finger-tight.  

'''Inflating with the Schrader valve:'''
:*First rotate the bike's wheel to a convenient valve position. 
:*Remove the valve's plastic dust cap and place it somewhere safe.
:*Depress the pin in the end of the valve briefly to air blast any debris from the valve.   
:*Attach the pump to the valve.
:*Inflate with the pump to the required pressure.   If the pump feels pressure-blocked, rather than forcing it, check again for the proper fitting of the head, (see the technical note above), and try again.   This will usually correct the problem.
:*Remove the pump from the tire.   If much pressure is lost in removing the pump then consider a slight overpressure during the pumping process.
:*Replace the valve's plastic dust cap.

==Brakes==
There are many different types of brakes for bicycles. Most bicycle brake systems have three basic parts: a mechanism for the rider to apply the brakes, such as brake levers or pedals; cables or the bicycle chain to enact the braking of the bicycle; and the brake itself, a pad or the reversal of momentum, which actually stops the bicycle with pressure.

Brake cables often come loose, pads often become slick in the rain or worn down, and these problems should be addressed immediately for safe riding.

When asked [in 1787] by a certain Mrs. Powell of Philadelphia what kind of government had been bestowed on the country as a result of the [Constitutional] Convention’s four-month effort, Benjamin Franklin was reported to have said: “A republic, madam, if you can keep it” (Morrow, 1999, pp. 1-2)
Franklin’s response to Mrs. Powell demonstrates the necessity for citizens to engage in the functioning of their democratic government if it is to prosper. Society struggles with how to impart its knowledge to the next generation in a manner that integrates social learning, civic learning, and moral learning into academic learning. These necessities led Jefferson to pursue the development of a system of public education: “Preach, my dear Sir, a crusade against ignorance; establish and improve the law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen know that the people alone can protect us against these evils” (as cited in Ravitch &amp; Thernstrom, 1992, p. xi). Dewey (1916, 1938) was resolute in defining the overarching goal of education to be no less than fostering and maintaining a democracy.  Applying a strict definition of civic education, political scholars would define citizenship as voting (Walker, 2000). Scholars would note that youth’s knowledge of the particulars of government are on the decline (Niemi &amp; Junn, 1998) as the focus for a clear definition of civic education center on the knowledge required of the citizenry to participate in a democracy as evidenced through the explicit act of voting.  Flanagan and Faison (2001) utilize an action definition pertaining to civic participation, the civitas, where individuals freely associate in self-selected groups to meet their needs and promote and define their beliefs. When asked to describe a “good citizen” students responded that “the task of being a good citizen carries no additional meaning or special responsibilities beyond simply being a ‘good person’” (p. 6). The basic civic duty to vote was mentioned by only 12 percent of the respondents as a component of citizenship (People for the American Way, 1989, pp. 12-15).  The State of Michigan mandates the teaching of civics as detailed in the Michigan Curriculum Framework. The State of Michigan’s Department of Education (MDE) defines its purpose for the social studies in the realm of civic education as follows: “The purpose of social studies is to develop social understanding and civic efficacy; the readiness and willingness to assume citizenship responsibilities and to make informed and reasoned decisions for the public good as citizens of a democratic society” (MDE, 2006, 8).  Ultimately, to assume the responsibilities of a citizen would mean that one is actively involved in the governance of their own being; the self. Aristotle’s Politics (c 340 BC) reflects on the notion that the ideals of a democracy are sufficiently achieved when all persons share in government to the best of their abilities: “If liberty and equality, as is thought by some, are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be attained when all persons alike share in the government to the utmost.” The rights and responsibilities of citizen from our beginnings to modern times have deep roots and shared meaning when set side by side; the ancient philosopher with the current goals of the state.  In summary, there is little confusion on the need for the public schools to teach the civic skills and knowledge necessary for an informed citizenry to complete measurable acts of citizenship such as voting, service, and volunteerism. The determination of how to best instill those skills and knowledge to best allow for their articulation as demonstrated in increased civic participation remains to be seen. 

==Essential Components of a Civic Education==
An effective democracy requires a citizenry with a civic education. The public schools were founded in part to create an informed citizenry through a curriculum that formally promotes common knowledge, skills and dispositions allowing for authentic engagement in the business of a democracy. The civic knowledge and participation necessary for a democracy are not inherently passed down from generation to generation – “they require that each generation of students learn civic facts, explore democratic ideals and connect such concepts to the responsibility of citizenship” (NACE, 2006, 1). There is widespread agreement in the United States of America that “good citizenship” contributes to a better democracy which, in turn, contributes to a stable society of opportunity and justice (Isaac, 1992). Practicing civics, becoming a skilled citizen, using one’s skills to overcome apathy, ignorance, greed or abuses of power in society at all levels requires knowledge of civic history, understanding of civic rights and strategies and sharing in a growing civic culture of regular participation. The next three subsections define what is meant by civic knowledge, civic skills, and civic dispositions as they pertained to this study. 

===Civic knowledge===
The irony of defining a body of finite knowledge in a democratic system is that it cannot be done without limiting the deliberative discourse necessary for a democracy to exist. Both the National Standards and the Civics Framework for the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) have developed five essential questions to promote the discussion towards a shared understanding of what citizens ought to know: 

*What are civic life, politics, and government?
*What are the foundations of the American political system?
*How does the government established by the Constitution embody the purposes, values, and principles of American democracy?
*What is the relationship of the United States to other nations and to world affairs?
*What are the roles of citizens in American democracy?

The civic knowledge defined by the five questions requires the citizenry to put into context those systems, historical documents, cultural pieces, values, law, international government and non-governmental organizations, and individual rights and responsibilities. To gain an understanding of this civic knowledge would require the social studies educator to address these questions in an authentic manner in the civics classroom as supported by NCSS (1992, 2001) and their definition of what a civic educator is as well as through their definition of an effective citizen.

===Civic skills===
A civic base of knowledge in a democracy would hold no value if citizens were unable to critically think about and act upon that knowledge (NCSS, 2001). In a democracy, citizens are decision-makers and are expected to continually develop and improve their abilities to evaluate, take and defend a position (Branson, 1998), to articulate the meaning of the tangible and intangible symbols of a democracy, to explain how a function of government should operate and the consequences of that operation, as well as to be able to interact, monitor and influence the political process of a democracy (Branson, 1998).  Critical thinking in the social studies has been seen as a necessary goal to effective civic education. According to Ennis (1985), &quot;Critical thinking is reflective and reasonable thinking that is focused on deciding what to believe or do&quot; (p. 45).  Limited definitions focus on evaluation or appraisal; critical thinking is formulation and use of criteria to make warranted judgments about knowledge claims, normative statements, methods of inquiry, policy decisions, alternative positions on public issues, or any other object of concern. Critical thinking, defined narrowly, is an essential element of general cognitive processes, such as problem solving or decision making, but is not synonymous with them.  Critical thinking, whether conceived broadly or narrowly, implies curiosity, skepticism, reflection, and rationality. Critical thinkers have a propensity to raise and explore questions about beliefs, claims, evidence, definitions, conclusions, and actions. (Patrick, 1986, pp. 2-3)  Despite the identified importance of critical thinking in civic education along with increased research and discourse on the topic it has not been found to be taught satisfactorily in most social studies classrooms. This has been noted by the governing body for social studies education, NCSS, as they continue to reinforce the need for the connection between critical thinking and civic efficacy: Powerful social studies teaching begins with a clear understanding of the subject’s unique purposes and goals. NCSS’s statement “Essentials of the Social Studies” identifies citizenship education as the primary purpose of K-12 social studies. Noting that concern for the common good and citizen participation in public life are essential to the health of our democratic system, it states that effective social studies programs prepare young people to identify, understand, and work to solve the problems facing our diverse nation in an increasingly interdependent world. (NCSS, 1999) Goodlad's nationwide study of schooling demonstrated little evidence of the critical thinking supported by NCSS and concluded that &quot;preoccupation with the lower intellectual processes pervades social studies and science as well&quot; (1984, p. 236).

===Civic dispositions===
The “habits of the heart” (de Toqueville as cited in Mayer, 1969), or civic dispositions, are those pieces of private and public character that weave a democracy together allowing for it to be celebrated and critiqued in the public square. The purpose and necessity of these civic dispositions are perhaps articulated best by Judge Learned Hand (1944): “Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it. While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it (1).” To have civic knowledge and skill without the capacity to implement and assess them makes them valueless.  The National Standards for Civics and Government have identified those dispositions “that contribute to the political efficacy of the individual, the healthy functioning of the political system, a sense of dignity and worth, and the common good” (Branson, 1998, p. 8): 

*Becoming an independent member of society
*Assuming the personal, political, and economic responsibilities of a citizen
*Respecting individual worth and human dignity
*Participating in civic affairs in a thoughtful and effective manner
*Promoting the healthy functioning of constitutional democracy

All of these dispositions require the citizenry to accept responsibility for one’s self and their actions, to listen and read for information, to lead, to accept majority decisions while recognizing minority opinions, to act and to invoke change through legal means. 

Key to the implementation of civic knowledge, skills, and dispositions is how the curriculum in public schools is supported to foster these civic attributes. The following section in this chapter discusses the literature as it pertains to the formal and informal delivery of civic instruction.

==How Civic Education Takes Place==
Civics education occurs in theory at both a formal and informal level. The more formal instruction reflects those curricular pieces utilized as the means by which to teach civics while the informal instruction is demonstrated through the manner in which those curricular pieces are taught in the classroom setting.

===Formal Instruction===
The formal instruction in a civics curriculum is one of emphasis on the documents and systems of American democracy (Barr, Barth &amp; Shermis, 1977; Jenness, 1990; National Commission in Education, 1983; Task Force of the National Council for the Social Studies, 1994; Saxe, 1998). The study of these documents and systems should be used to gain an understanding of the rights and responsibilities of the citizenry in the realm of personal rights and responsibilities, political rights and responsibilities, and economic rights and responsibilities as supported by the standards and benchmarks of states across America. The formal instruction of these rights should be used to generate a personal understanding that none of these rights are absolute and they all come attached with certain reasonable limits (Scheurman &amp; Newman, 1998; Sunal, Sunal, &amp; Haas, 1996). The rights discussed and emphasized must be accompanied with clear instruction on the personal and civic responsibilities attached to these rights.  Since 1955, an expanding environments approach (Superka, Hawke, &amp; Morrisett, 1980) for teaching the social studies has been the most frequently used format for civic education. This approach uses a focus on the self and family in the kindergarten years and moves the student into a wider range of cultures through grade seven and then moves into a U.S. history focus in Grade 8. Social studies educators during the 1970’s supported and promoted a curriculum based on essential concepts from history and the social sciences (Taba, Durkin, Fraenkel, &amp; McNaughton, 1971) believing social problems would provide a solid foundation for a solid social studies curriculum (Engle &amp; Ochoa, 1988). In spite of these efforts, evidence has shown students in eighth grade and seventh grade currently studying essentially the same topics their counterparts have since 1916 (Morrissett, 1981; Superka, Hawke, &amp; Morrissett, 1980). 

===Informal Instruction===
The informal instruction that occurs in civics education is exemplified in the manner in which an educator manages teaching and learning. It is also exemplified in how they foster positive relationships in the schools. Holding students accountable in an equitable manner models the rights and responsibilities of the formal curriculum in civics and students who have a positive relationship with adults in this venue are more motivated to learn and more apt to lead (Apple, 1979, 1982, 1988; Banks, 1991; Bissex, 1980; Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Bruner, 1959; Freire, 1970, 1973, 1978, 1990; Giroux, 1988; Goodlad, 1984; Kohn, 2004; Marshall, 2004; McGregor, 1960;  Meier, 1990; Piaget, 1979; Sapon-Shevin &amp; Schniedwind, 1991; Schniedewind &amp; Davidson, 1987; Shor, 1992; Silberman, 1970; Smith, 1983; Wertsch, 1985). The National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health (Resnick, et al., 1997) found that “connectedness with school” is a determining and critical factor in the lives of young people and that “School engagement is a critical and protective factor against a variety of risky behaviors, influenced in good measure by perceived caring from teachers and high expectations for student performance” (p. 827).  Students will most likely duplicate the adult behaviors they observe in the school setting. It is for this reason that the informal processes we utilize in the school setting should most reflect those civic virtues and formal pieces of the curriculum we are teaching and assessing. The learning of civics should be one supported by a true sense of purpose supported through a modeled social experience (Dewey, 1938; Freire1970, 1973, 1978, 1990; Marshall, 2004). In a civics classroom the opportunity for the civic educator, in their role of expert citizen due to their assumed experience in authentic civic engagement as well as their role as civic expert due to the nature of their position, working in collaboration with the civic student, who by their very nature are novices in matters of civic engagement, are afforded the opportunity to create a shared culture and understanding of what civic efficacy is through the informal social experience of the classroom setting (Schein, 1992).

==Culture of Civic Education==
Galston (1991) acknowledges the constant reemphasis special interest groups have placed upon the necessity to revamp civic education citing that our survival as Americans in a viable democracy depends upon our transmission of liberty and equality to each new generation of Americans. Although this urgency has existed and continues to exist as acknowledged by several social educators true inquiry into social issues pertaining to developing civic efficacy are not commonplace in classrooms. Saye and Brush (2006) have identified research highlighting obstacles to inquiry-based teaching that are related to teachers and learners (Newmann, 1991; Parker, Mueller, &amp; Wendling, 1989) as well as to the culture of schools and society at large (Onosko, 1991).  Identified barriers limiting a culture of authentic inquiry in the social studies classroom exist. Class size, preparation time, isolation from supportive peers, and accountability for high-stakes testing are powerful disincentives to complex instruction (Konopak, Wilson, &amp; Readence, 1994; Grant et. al, 2002; Onosko, 1991; Saye, 1998; Schlechty, 1993).  Sternberg (1985) notes the difference in the problems students are asked to solve in school and those they are asked to solve in real life. The authenticities of the problems students are asked to solve at school do not necessarily follow the same ill-structured patterns real life problems follow. In addition to these barriers, studies suggest that teachers’ understanding of the concepts and methodology of the social studies discipline affects their willingness to engage students in authentic critical thinking in this subject area (Bain, 1995; Windeburg &amp; Wilson, 1991). Adding to the complexity of the teaching in this area are suggestions by Shaver (1996) that authentic critical thinking in the social studies centered on real-world issues requires a teacher who is able to cope with the uncertainty such instruction brings.  Scant research exists on the effectiveness of teachers who are able to utilize more of an inquiry approach to the teaching of social issues. Rossi and Pace (1995, 1998) caution that even those teachers who have the capacity to employ an inquiry approach to their teaching face the obstacle of deciding what is desirable to pursue as it conflicts with supporting meaningful student inquiry processes in the classroom.  Another identified barrier to authentic civics instruction may come from the field of social studies itself as advocates for history, a social studies discipline, have been prone to attack other social studies disciplines “which they believe have supplanted history as the core of the social studies curriculum” (Brophy &amp; Alleman, 2007, p. 7). History advocates argue that curriculum and instruction centered on history and supported by all the other components of the social studies allows for a greater and more thorough coverage of any individual topic.  History-centered reform proposals have not been received warmly by social studies leaders and professional organizations. Part of the conflict involves disciplinary turf protection: The social sciences do not want to cede curricular airtime to history. In addition, social scientists argue that their disciplines offer important insights about how the social world functions that all citizens ought to understand and be able to bring to bear in their civic decision making. Some of them also disparage the value of history as a basis for citizen education, arguing that knowledge about the past has limited application to the complexities of the contemporary world. (Engle &amp; Ochoa as cited in Evans, 2004, p. 124)  Reform ideas to the social studies curriculum are not new. During the 1960’s and 1970’s proponents of a history and literature perspective to social studies thought it wise to abandon social studies as a subject designed to pursue civic efficacy goals. “Instead, they would offer separate courses in the academic disciplines, simplified as needed but designed to pursue the goals of history and the social sciences rather than the goals of citizenship education” (Brophy &amp; Alleman, 2007, p. 12). These programs were called the “new social studies” but never really caught on because of their narrow focus on specific subjects and their lack of acknowledgement for the importance of citizenship education. The 1980’s witnessed a variation of this approach with Egan (1988) and Ravitch (1987) leading the call for a curriculum heavy on history and literature, particularly the myth and folklore of the American experience. Lack of value on the reality of social studies as it would be substituted with myth and folklore pushed this type of curriculum to the area of language arts instruction where it was thought to be better suited.  Hirsch (1987) proposed a cultural literacy common to all Americans as the basis for reform in social studies education. The late 1980’s saw Hirsch’s list of 5,000 items “of knowledge that he believed should be acquired in elementary school as a way to equip students with a common base of prior knowledge to inform their social and civic decision making” (Brophy &amp; Alleman, 2007, p. 11) emerge on the scene. Hirsch’s list of 5,000 unorganized facts was deemed by social educators to be too specific and too broad discounting the development of connected knowledge around meaningful themes and ideas. Hirsch’s list did give way to the CORE curriculum which attempted to integrate science, social studies, and the arts but even this modification on the Hirsch list was seen as too focused on the distant past ignoring the value of personal experience with students as a viable tool for engaging with the curriculum.  Perhaps the greatest cultural piece influencing civic education has been the lack of political support at the national and state levels to create a unified message in regards to civic education. While 31 states currently test civics topics, only 29 states require high school students to take a course in government or civics (NACE, 2006). Additionally, 23 of the 50 states present their civic standards as explicit standards within their social studies standards and three states have separate civic standards. Another 18 states weave civics into their social studies standards (Policy Research Project on Civic Education Policies and Practices, 1999). The American Federation of Teachers [AFT] has reported on the difficulty related to setting clear and specific objectives in the area of civic education and recommends that a more unified approach, as has been done in math and science, would move teaching and learning in the social studies out of the lower thinking categories it is currently resigned to (1999). Civic educators see the concern extending to the No Child Left Behind Act [NCLB] as it does not emphasize testing of civics as it does for math and reading thus pulling the focus away from potential reform in civics education.  Since the late 1960s, civic education at the secondary level has declined substantially. High school students now enroll typically in only one year of government and civics classes instead of three. NCLB does not emphasize civics proficiency, which further erodes the value of civics education at the high school level. To rectify this situation, national assessments in civics should be administered more frequently, and state officials should incorporate civics into their standards. (American Youth Policy Forum, 2006, ¶ 1).  Many states fear the policies of NCLB marginalize civic education even further as other core subject areas are supported through legislation and testing. These fears reinforce the need for a connection between content and authentic opportunities for the application of that content in the lives’ of students. 

==Need to Improve Civic Education==
When Americans were asked which qualities or aptitudes schools consider “essential” or “very important,” 86 percent replied “being a good citizen” (U.S. Department of Education, 1997). In the same U.S. Department of Education survey (1997) only 59 percent or respondents stated they believed schools had a major impact on the development of “being a good citizen” (¶ 4).  There is ample research to show the American citizenry’s interest in government is disappointing (Delli, Michael &amp; Keeter, 1996; Erskine, 1963; Hyman &amp; Sheatsley, 1947) as  fewer and fewer Americans are showing up to vote (Abramson &amp; Aldrich, 1982; Miller, 1992; Teixeira, 1987, 1992). The 1960 presidential election had a participation rate of 63 percent. The voting rate declined to about 50 percent in the 1996 presidential election with the 2000 presidential election showing a participation rate of 51 percent of eligible voters.  While Americans between ages 18 and 30 make up the largest bloc of eligible voters in the country (at about 25 percent), abysmally low (and increasingly declining) numbers in this age group actually vote. According to a recently published Carnegie Corporation of New York report, youth voter turnout has dropped by at least 13 percent since 1972 and the occurrence of such social and political flashpoints such as Watergate; this equates to less than a 13 percent voter turnout among eligible young voters. Among the youngest voters, those between the ages of 18 and 24, the voting rate has dropped by a third over the same three decades. (Fields, 2003, p. 1)  Putnam (2000) believes voter apathy as evidenced through statistics reflecting the downward trend is indicative of a more cynical view of civic participation: During the last third of the twentieth century formal membership in organizations in general has edged downward by perhaps 10-20 percent. More important, active involvement in clubs and other voluntary associations has collapsed at an astonishing rate, more than halving most indexes of participation within barely a few decades most Americans no longer spend much time in community organizations, we’ve stopped doing committee work, stopped serving as officers and stopped going to meetings. (p. 63)  The 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) survey found that only 6 percent of eighth-grade students could explain how countries benefit from a written constitution and only 30 percent of high school seniors understood the use of judicial review by the United States Supreme Court to protect minority rights (Hoff, 1999).  The 1997 American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 1997 report (Sax &amp; Astin et. al, 1997) shows college freshman at a record low 26.7 percent when asked if it was essential for them to stay “up to date with political affairs.” This was a 2.7 percent drop from the previous year and a 31.1 percent drop from the 1966 reported high. The same National Norms report (1997) documented another all-time low 13.7 percent of freshmen reporting they frequently discuss politics. The all-time high for this category was in 1968 with 29.9 percent of college freshmen reporting they frequently discuss politics. Similarly, the ultimate act of citizen participation as defined by the political scientists (Walker, 2000), the act of voting, is also at an all-time low according to the 1997 National Norms report. Student election turnout plummeted from 76.9 percent in 1968 to 21.3 percent in 1997.  The 1990 NAEP Report Card in Civics (as cited in Branson, 1998) results revealed that students have only a superficial knowledge of civics and lack depth of understanding. For example, only 38 percent of 8th graders knew that Congress makes laws; and nearly half of high school seniors did not recognize typical examples of the federal system of checks and balances. Although half of the high school seniors tested displayed a detailed knowledge of major government structures and their functions, only six percent demonstrated a more developed understanding of a wide range of political institutions and processes. (p. 16)  “National, state, and local standards all indicate that the task in social studies classrooms is to support learning that really does increase a student’s competence and confidence in using important social studies knowledge and skills to have a better life and to contribute more as a citizen” (Sunal &amp; Haas, 2002, p. 4). As evidenced by data in the previous section, increases in standardized test results and survey results have not been evident supporting the need for more overt connections between teaching of civic knowledge and skills to authentic assessments measuring student efficacy in civics. 

==Current Instructional Models for Teaching Civic Education==
The challenges of deciding what content and purpose should be taught in civic education are exacerbated by the various approaches to teaching civic education and the defined goal of each approach. Civic educators have traditionally utilized one of the following approaches to teach civics: citizenship transmission, social science/history, reflective inquiry, personal development, or informed social criticism/reform (Barr, Barth, &amp; Shermis, 1977). A brief review of the traditional approaches to civic education follows.

===Citizenship Transmission===
Citizenship transmission insists schools instill the “American creed” in children with the defined purpose of binding the nation together (Shaver, 1985). This creed would include those core democratic values centered on due process, freedom of choice, respect for others, multiculturalism, free access to information, and respect and value for rational thought (Shaver as cited in Chapin &amp; Messick, 2002). According to Shaver (1985) the student must accept the basic values in the creed as fundamental beliefs. The assumption with the citizenship transmission model is that it is the teacher’s job to assure students arrive at the correct answer for any civic concept. The student is strictly the receiver of any piece of civic information. The fear of opponents to the citizenship transmission approach within the context of developing a citizenry that is adept at critiquing the world around them to authentically engage in the democratic process is that students are being trained to accept a solution to a problem rather than exploring the solution to the problem on their own or with guidance. Citizenship transmission stresses the knowing of civic values as most important. Therefore the understanding of the civic values is not a priority thus limiting discourse and leading to a form of indoctrination (Chapin &amp; Messick, 2002). 

===Social Science/History===
The social/science history model is one predicated on a knowledge-centered approach (Chapin &amp; Messick, 2002). The intent of this model is to inform students of the major social studies concepts in each of the social studies disciplines. Applied to civics education, the social science/history model would have students reviewing primary and secondary source documents and comparing the documents to formulate a hypothesis. The purpose is to show students how our assumptions lead us to jump to conclusions. The model often utilizes an interdisciplinary approach where students might study a topic such as the Civil Rights Movement where each student is required to provide hard data on a given topic and to write deeply about the facts and opinions related to the topic. This would require students to engage in those areas of the social studies necessary to successfully demonstrate their understanding such as, in this case, sociology and history. More specifically, students would use primary and secondary source documents to study specific pieces of legislation connected to the Civil Rights Movement. The model comes under much criticism due to the ill-defined parameters of the hypothesis formulation, and the primary and secondary source documents are often too difficult for the students to read and comprehend. 

===Reflective Inquiry===
Reflective inquiry, also labeled public issues-centered approach or real-world problems approach, emphasizes the importance of motivating students to think critically (Chapin &amp; Messick, 2002). Typically students would be responsible for identifying an issue to explore, to find evidence for or research the issue, to analyze the evidence or research and to interpret or act upon their discoveries. The fault of this model lies in the lack of a clear and concise definition of reflective inquiry. 

===Informed Social Criticism/Reform===
Informed social criticism/reform is used to guide students to change an existing institution in our world through an understanding of the necessary knowledge and skills. Students are challenged to use the ideas of justice, democracy and human rights as the means by which to critique social institutions (Chapin &amp; Messick, 2002).  The informed social criticism/reform model requires teachers and students alike to be willing to discuss the potentially highly controversial issues associated with the social institutions under critique. In addition, students involved in this type of model need to believe or trust that their actions will be accepted by governmental actors and lead to change.

==Democratic Schools==
There is much talk these days about the importance of teaching democratic values in our public schools. It appears that newspaper columnists, teachers' unions, public organizations and other civic minded people have suddenly come to realize that our youth is growing up ignorant of, and uncommitted to, the great principles upon which our nation is based.

Although there may be full agreement that the problem exists, it seems that the proposed cure – more classes on democracy – is no better than the disease. It can be asked why is it that people persist in thinking that the solution to real-life problems is talking about them, or if anyone really believe that subjecting children to yet another course will achieve really meaningful goals. Schools can't even get kids to read or write or do arithmetic properly, despite endless hours of classroom effort. And the question is if we are going to make them into the defenders of freedom by adjusting the curriculum once more. 

The simple fact is that children are not committed to democratic principles, or political freedom, or the bill of rights, or behaving as responsible people because they themselves do not experience any of these lofty matters in their everyday lives, and in particular in their schools. Children do not have rights in school, they do not participate in meaningful decision-making at school (even where the decisions directly affect their own lives) nor do they have the freedom of self determination in school. In fact, the schools are models of autocracy - sometimes benevolent, sometimes cruel, but always in direct conflict with the principles on which our country is based. 

The way to ensure that people of any age will be deeply committed to the American Way is to make them full participants in it: making schools democratic, giving children freedom of choice and the basic rights of citizenship in schools, and they will have no problem understanding what this country is about (Greenberg, 1992). 

==Summary==
Certainly any one of the aforementioned instructional social studies models or any combination of those models would be sufficient to successfully instill the knowledge, skills, and dispositions for an adequate civic education. Throughout the review of the instructional models used to teach civics, little has been explored as to how to transfer the strengths or intentions of these models into adulthood and civic action through authentic classroom practice. Nor have we seen how these models are used differently or why their use is altered as students move through the public school system. What is clear is the importance of teacher expertise in increasing civic engagement and results and that placing non-experts, or out-of-field teachers, assume the responsibility for increasing student achievement in the area of civics will only exasperate the problem (Ingersoll, 1998). The consequences of not realizing expert guidance and leadership in civic education will have a direct negative impact on our democratic process and the effectiveness of that process.  To limit civic education to a prescribed model does not allow students or teachers to authentically engage in the identified characteristics of an effective citizen (NCSS Task Force, 2001). The instructional model developed in this research does not assume every student will obtain the characteristics of an effective citizen, but that most students must if we are to continue with an active and engaged citizenry necessary for an effective democracy. What the model did assume is the need for “…attending more carefully to the moral requirements of liberal public life and by doing what is possible and proper to reinforce them” (Galston, 1991). Public schools, as an agent of the government, are poised to allow students to each identify, explore, and articulate these moral requirements. To do this free of prescribed means and outcomes while at the same time working within those civic virtues (characteristics) would allow for students to rehearse what it means to be a citizen.  …we need a group differentiated citizenship and a heterogeneous public. In a heterogeneous public, differences are publicly recognized and acknowledged as irreducible, by which I mean that a person from one perspective or history can never completely understand and adopt the point of view of those with other group-based perspectives and histories” (Young, 1989).  Young (1989) goes on to argue for a classroom where students are given defined spaces to reflect upon and to have discourse on issues of importance; a classroom where the virtues of civics can be explored, understood, and questioned. Galston’s work (1991) identified those liberal virtues in their broadest sense: Some of the virtues needed to sustain the liberal state are requisites of every political community. From time to time, each community must call upon its members to risk their lives in its defense. Courage – the willingness to fight and even die on behalf of one’s country – is thus very widely honored, even though there may be occasions on which the refusal to fight is fully justified.
In addition, every community creates a complex structure of law and regulations in the expectation that they will be legitimate, hence binding, without recourse to direct threats or sanctions. The net social value of law is equal to the social benefits it engenders minus the social costs of enforcing it. As the individual propensity to obey the law diminishes, so does a society’s ability to pursue collective goals through the law. Law-abidingness is therefore a core social virtue…  Finally, every society is constituted by certain core principles and sustained by its members’ active belief in them. Conversely, every society is weakened by the diminution of its members’ belief in legitimacy. Loyalty – the developed capacity to understand, to accept, and to act on the core principles of one’s society – is thus a fundamental virtue. (p. 221)  While the need for a civic education to sustain an effective democracy has been agreed upon by many groups, the participation in that democracy “does not occur instinctively nor does it develop organically. Educators have a role to play – helping students in thinking carefully…” (Kahne &amp; Middaugh, 2006, p. 607). &lt;br&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;__TOC__&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;[[image:Free Wheel.jpg|400px|thumb|right|A typical nine-speed rear wheel.   The large bulge at one end of the hub identifies it as a freehub.   This, and the size of the cluster means that the cogs are supplied as a cassette.]] [[image:Cassetteandfreehub.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A cassette cog-set and its splined (grooved) freehub.   The splines allow alignment of the cogs and prevent their rotation in use.  The ratchet is in the wheel's hub.]] [[image:Freewheelandhub.jpg|300px|thumb|left|A freewheel cog-set and its threaded hub.   The freewheel itself contains both ratchet and cogs.   Individual cogs are threaded onto the freewheel itself and the entire freewheel assembly is threaded onto the hub.]] 
&lt;h2&gt;General&lt;/h2&gt;
'''The ''freewheel'' is the ratchet device on the ''rear wheel'' that makes it possible to roll without pedaling, for example, when free-wheeling down a hill'''.  It operates whenever the wheels are going faster than the drive-force, in this case the pedals and chain.   The term is also used to describe a bicycle component that combines both a ratchet and a cog-set in one single screw-on assembly, and this is the most commonly used meaning.   The alternative way of installing a cog-set is to use a cassette, a stack of cogs that slides onto a splined hub.   Whether a ''freewheel'' or a ''cassette'' is used on the rear hub of the bike, there is always a ratchet; in the case of a ''freewheel assembly'' the ratchet is unscrewed with the cogs, whereas a ''cassette'' is merely a stack of cogs, and the ratchet is ''within'' the ''freehub'' of the wheel.   Cog pitch (here is means inter- cog center-to-center spacing) is the main consideration for shifting and apart from the restricted choice of freewheels, it is unimportant to the derailleur whether a freewheel or a cassette is installed, provided that the spacing between the cogs is right.

'''Bikes ''without'' gear-changing exist''', so-called ''fixed-gear'' bikes or ''fixies''.   They have one chain-ring and one rear cog.   Although such bikes are not technically prevented from having a ratchet device, they usually have none, so that the rider's legs will be forced to rotate whenever the bike is moving.   Some new riders of such bikes can find the experience disturbing.           

'''The threaded hub of the freewheel installation is clearly different from the splined freehub of the cassette installation and the cog-set of one type cannot be installed onto the other'''.   When an upgrade from freewheels to cassettes is to be made, it is most convenient to do so by changing the rear wheel for one with a freehub and cassette already installed.   Examples of a freehub and of a threaded hub can be seen clearly in the adjacent photographs. 

'''Both freewheels and cassettes exist in a variety of cog combinations, and because chains are all half-inch spaced, cogs can be defined entirely by their numbers of teeth'''.   For example, an 11T cog has eleven teeth, and a cog-set with a range of 11T-30T might have say, seven cogs, the smallest having eleven teeth and the largest thirty.   Because cog-sets have been in use for a long time, the most useful sets have been identified by code letters, for example, the above set is designated ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'am'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.   

'''For those who need more than seven rear cogs, a bike with a cassette becomes the choice'''.   This is because bikes are rarely made with freewheels of more than seven cogs.   Larger numbers of gears can be obtained even with a seven speed freewheel or cassette by simply having more front chainrings.   For example, the combination of three front chainrings and seven rear sprockets provides 21 gear combinations (3 X 7), and enjoys the wider working tolerances of seven speed shifting at the rear. 

'''This page explains how to remove and fit cassettes and freewheels''' and provides links for further information on that subject.   An introduction to the principles of indexed shifting is given, and notes on the complexity of gear-shifting standards is provided with the help of tables.

==Cog-set Standards.==
===Complexity===
The hub of a rear wheel has an extension on it, and this is threaded or splined to fit either a freewheel or a cassette respectively.   Extensions differ in length, according to the number of cogs to be installed, but to maintain reasonable chain alignment and reduce the stresses on the hub, there is a limit to the extension that can be considered.   So, when a number of cogs greater than say, seven, is crammed into a set, the teeth and spacers need to be made thinner.   In this way the space or pitch between the cogs can be reduced.   (See the table in the drop box below for a summary on cog-pitch.)   A narrower chain is also needed for a narrower cog-pitch.

Although  cassette cogs and most freewheel cogs can be replaced individually, doing so favors cassettes.   Freewheel cogs need two chain-whips to remove them from the cluster after the freewheel itself if free of its hub, one to unscrew the cog and another to prevent the freewheel from rotating; anyway, individual replacement cogs for freewheels are now hard to find.   Freewheels rarely exist beyond 7-speeds, while cassettes exist in up to 11-speeds.   Cassette cogs are easier to remove, are abundant in supply, and offer the greatest scope for modification.  

Cog pitch (here means inter-cog spacing), cog thickness, and spacer thickness differ greatly for the various bike types, (see [http://sheldonbrown.com/cribsheet-spacing.shtml '''Sheldon Brown's Cribsheet on Spacing'''] for detailed lists), not only for ''different'' sizes of cog-sets, but between different manufacturers for the ''same'' size of cog-set. As a result, the derailleurs and shifters used differ greatly as well.   When the different shift ratios of derailleurs ,  cable-pull-lengths of shifters, and the pitch (inter-cog spacing) of cog-sets  are considered together, it becomes clear that arbitrarily selected drive components will hardly ever work well together.

Examples of the various manufacturers' cog-pitches and the expected results of mixing drive gear can be found in the drop-box below. For the full description upon which these notes were based, see [http://www.ctc.org.uk/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=3946 '''CTC on Rear Shifting'''].   In the way of relief, some notes on the more common ground are are given in the next section.

The above tables give the means to predict whether or not rear-gear shifting will work with various combinations of shifters, derailleurs, and cogs.   Because of the size limitations and difficulty in modifying freewheels, '''these tables refer in the main to CASSETTES'''.   The emphasis here is on ''closeness of pitch'', and other practical factors might still need to be considered.

The pitch of common cog-sets is given in one table and the derailleur shift data is given in another.   The shift data is divided into four main categories:
;GREEN Colors:'''''These show the resultant derailleur shift in millimeters when the shifter, derailleur, and cogs of one manufacturer are used together.   This is the ideal situation.'''''   For example, the Shimano 10-speed shifter with a cable pull of 2.3mm is applied to a Shimano derailleur with an actuation ratio of 1.7, resulting in a shift (2.3mm x 1.7) of 3.91mm.   Allowing for the precision of the available data this fits the Shimano 10-speed cog-set pitch of 3.95mm well, and the shifting is considered to be ideal.    
;YELLOW Colors:'''''These give the resultant derailleur shift in millimeters when other than the ideal combination is used, and are characterized by having an intact set of cogs, but unused positions on the shifter when the modification is complete.'''''(But see Campagnolo 'old and new').      The pitch that is produced works well enough with the alternative cog-set.   For example, the Campagnolo 10-speed shifter with a cable pull of 2.8mm is applied to a Shimano derailleur with an actuation ratio of 1.7, resulting in a shift (2.8mm x 1.7) of 4.76mm.   Allowing for the precision of the available data this fits the Shimano 8-speed cog-set pitch of 4.80mm well.   That is to say, the Campagnolo 10-speed shifter could be used with the Shimano derailleur provided that there was an 8-speed Shimano cog-set installed.   The other two positions on the shifter would remain unused, excluded by adjusting the limit stops of the derailleur. 
;RED Colors:'''''These give the resultant derailleur shift in millimeters when other than the ideal combination is used, and  although the shifter range will be correct, they need some cogs to be left off the cassette assembly.'''''   The pitch that is produced works well enough with the specified cog-set.   For example, the Campagnolo 8-speed shifter with a cable pull of 3.5mm is applied to a SRAM (1.0) derailleur with an actuation ratio of 1.1, resulting in a shift (3.5mm x 1.1) of 3.85mm.   Allowing for the precision of the available data this fits the Shimano S10 cog-set pitch of 3.95mm well.   That is to say, the cog-set can be assembled using eight of the Shimano 10-speed cogs and seven of its spacers.            
;OTHER Shift Data:''''' Data other than those with green, yellow, or red coloring would not index correctly.'''''   That said, there are some other Shimano combinations that can be applied to a Shimano 7-speed freehub.   The set can be extended to eight cogs if S9 cogs form the cassette, and a 9-speed shifter and chain are used.  Similar results can be obtained for nine cogs on a 7-speed freehub if S10 is used for the assembly, and a 10-speed shifter and chain are used.   In each of these two cases the unused positions on the shifters are blocked by the adjustment of the derailleurs' limit stops.

{{technote|heading=General Rule|'''To avoid most compatibility problems, stick to one manufacturer's components for the cog-set, derailleur, shifter, and chain'''.   Even then, since some manufacturers make items for more than one shift ratio, it is wise to make sure that the derailleur and shifter combine to produce the cog-pitch that is intended.   The tables in the above drop-box explain the indexing principles, and the calculation of derailleur capacity based on the cog-set is given elsewhere on this page.}}

[[image:TeethCloseUp.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A close-up of cogs clearly showing their ramps]]

===Consistencies===
Although complexity is the rule as opposed to the exception, there are some consistencies in manufactured goods.   Examples include manufacturers who produce components that suit the drive-trains of others, a tendency to standardize spline patterns for cassettes on the most popular brand name, and the standardized pitch (inter-cog spacing) for 7-speed cog-sets.   

'''Some SRAM shifters, for example, GripShift types marked as MRX, are suitable for Shimano systems''', since these shifters suit the so-called ''2 : 1'' family of Shimano derailleurs; in fact their shift ratios are not exactly ''2'' but ''1.7''.   (Shift ratio is the reciprocal of actuation ratio which is itself ''the ratio of input change to output change'', so here, one length of cable pull causes a transverse movement that exceeds it by 1.7 times).    Other shifters by the same SRAM manufacturer, are suited to the ''1:1'' family of derailleurs; (with exact 1.1 shift ratios), and so these do not match the Shimano derailleurs.   The subject of compatibility in drive-train gear has received much attention over the years and despite the complexities involved, it has been found that some ''mixed systems'' can work well enough provided that there is careful selection.   (See the examples in the drop-box of the above section). 

'''Cassette spline patterns for Shimano freehubs fit a number of other makes of cassette''', and within its own products is the same for virtually every type of cassette.   With minor exceptions, the SRAM manufacturer has used the same sprocket pitch (inter-sprocket spacing) and spline pattern as Shimano, so that their products are used interchangably, (with the possible exception of cog ramping functions).      The tool used to remove Shimano cassette locking-rings  will unlock them for all of their modern cassettes, and in addition, the cassette locking-rings of SRAM, SunRace, SunTour, Chris King and various others.    A similar situation exists for freewheel removals, with the Shimano freewheel tool unlocking all of its own and Sachs, Aris, and Sun Race freewheels besides.   As far as is known, the Campagnolo cassette removal tool is intended only for its own  locking rings, though some report that a Shimano tool is a (risky?) 'near fit'.   The Shimano standards for spline-fittings come closest to an informal industry standard.   

'''Seven-speed sprocket pitch is ''almost always 5mm'' ''', so shifter/derailleur combinations that are designed for seven-speed use can be made to work on all seven-speed sprocket sets, (subject to any frame fitting constraints).   Consideration of the mixed shifts and pitches given elsewhere on this page will emphasize how unusual this fortunate situation is.   The main consideration is that the shifter's cable-pull suits the derailleur's shift ratio so that between them they make the necessary 5mm gear shifts.   How the necessary shift is accomplished is of no concern.  For example, a Shimano 7-speed shifter pulls the cable by 2.9 mm while the derailleur has a shift ratio of 1.7.   The resulting product, (2.9 mm x 1.7 = 4.93 mm), is about 5mm so the combination works well.   Another shifter and derailleur combination, say SRAM,  also produces the necessary 5mm derailleur shift using 4.5 mm of cable pull and a derailleur shift ratio of 1.1.   (4.5mm x 1.1 = 4.95mm = approx 5mm).   There is little cross-manufacturer consistency for the pitch of the larger sprocket-sets, so the mixing of components for these larger cog-sets needs more care.   See [http://www.ctc.org.uk/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=3946 '''CTC on Rear Shifting'''] for more on mixing components of the drive system.

'''Freewheel threads on modern bikes are the same.'''   Regardless of where in the world the bike is made, the standard (ISO) for freewheel mounting threads is  1.375 inches in diameter and 24 threads per inch.  This means that any modern freewheel is likely to fit a standard threaded hub.   This is not necessarily the case for older bikes, and the details for these can be found at [http://www.sheldonbrown.com/freewheels.html Sheldon Brown's '''Freewheels'''].   There are a number of other ISO standards in use for bikes; see [http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_i-k.html#iso '''Sheldon Brown's ISO Standards for Bikes'''].

'''The tools needed to remove and replace ''cassettes'' differ according to the manufacturer'''.   The most commonly used tools include a locking ring remover (see the image), shaped for the lock ring in use, and a chain-whip (see the image), a tool that engages with the cogs to prevent turning while the locking ring is being unscrewed. (A chain-whip is needed only for cassette removal).  Because the locking ring remover is merely a tool-end, an extension arm or a long adjustable spanner is needed to provide the necessary torque.   An external page that describes the different removal tools of various manufacturers is provided at [http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/cassette-and-freewheel-removal Park Tool's ''Cassette and Freewheel Removal''], along with other practical advice.

'''The tools needed for the removal of freewheels have similar appearance to those for cassettes''', though the removal tools might not always be interchangeable.    The effort in removing a freewheel is likely to be greater than that for a cassette's locking ring owing to the freewheel's self-tightening during normal cycling.  

'''The removal of cassettes and freewheels that have been in use require considerable force''', and under force the tool might tend to slip, possibly damaging the tool or its receptacle.   For this reason some mechanics modify the simple procedures below by fastening the tool in position with the reassembled quick-release wheel skewer.   When this is done the skewer springs are ommitted and the skewer cap is tightened against the removal tool to take up the slack.    The tool must not exceed one turn with the skewer still in place, and must be removed before completing the removal of the cassette or freewhweel. 

====Tools required:====
*Cassette locking ring or freewheel removal tool for the product in use.
*Adjustable wrench, about one foot long, or specific tools with similar leverage.
*A chain whip, for cassette removal only.
*Torque wrench, in a range that includes 30 ft.lbs:   Mainly for cassette locking ring replacement, (optional).
*Bench with a secure vice, (optional).

{{technote|1=Few riders are lucky enough to own expensive torque wrenches for their bikes, so it might be as well to get the assistance of the bike shop for work that requires their use.   That said, many are known to approximate the necessary torques by judging the force applied to a wrench lever of known length.   That is to say, torque is just the product of force and length.   For example, a 30 ft.lb torque is applied when a thirty pound force is applied at right angles to the end of a one foot wrench.   The accuracy of this method is as good as the user's ingenuity at judging or measuring the applied force.&lt;br&gt;
Formulas for converting to other torque designations:&lt;br&gt;
in.lb = ft.lb x 12&lt;br&gt;
in.lb = Nm x 8.851&lt;br&gt;
in.lb = kgf.cm / 1.15
}}

====Cassette Removal====
'''Howsoever the effort is eventually applied or from what angle, these directions are made assuming that the cogs of the wheel are facing you.'''
*Remove the rear wheel from the bike.
*Unscrew and remove the skewer assembly from the wheel.   
*Fit the correct locking ring removal tool against the locking ring.  Some removal tools have their own guide rods that feed through the middle of the hub.
*Apply a chain whip to the cogs to pull them ''clockwise'', to prevent them from turning anti-clockwise during removal.
*While holding the cogs firmly with the chain whip, turn the removal tool with the wrench or lever-arm ''anti-clockwise'' to release it.   Slackening requires considerable force, so a longer lever arm or pipe extension might help.   It is usual to hear a clicking  noise as the ring is initially released.   ''Note that the torque wrench should never be used for heavy work of this kind''. 
*The cluster of cogs can then be removed.   Note the alignment and sequence of the parts for reassembly before splitting up the cog-set. Consider stringing them together, since the spacer thicknesses might differ within the cluster.   The smallest cogs will be noted to have built-in spacers, and perhaps shims.    

For those who have a bench fitted with a suitable vice, fit the tool into the cassette in the usual way and if possible use the skewer and its cap (no springs) to set it in position.  Having done so, and with the wheel flat and  the cog-set on the underside, grip the flats of the removal tool in the vice.   Hold the cogs in the chain-whip and with it, turn the cogs anti- clockwise, (looking down on top of the wheel), to release the ring.  ''Do not turn the wheel to make this release, but use only the chain-whip, letting the wheel turn with the cogs''.   

Further details on the subject of cassette removal can be found at [http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/cassette-and-freewheel-removal '''Park Tool's ''Cassette and Freewheel Removal'''''].   A video that clearly shows the unlocking of a typical cassette is availble at [http://www.parktool.com/product/cassette-lockring-tool-fr-5 '''FR-5 Lock-ring video'''].

====Cassette Replacement====
The ''replacement'' of a cassette does not require the use of a chain whip, and the process is otherwise just a reverse of the removal.   The procedure is as follows:

'''Howsoever the effort is eventually applied or from what angle, these directions are made assuming that the cogs of the wheel are facing you.'''
*Clean the cassette and oil-wipe the cogs of the cluster.   Grease the threads of the locking-ring and its receptacle. 
*Fit the cassette cogs onto the freehub splines with the correct orientation.  While manufacturers attempt to ensure that only one working alignment can exist, there will no doubt be exceptions. In addition, take care that the cassette spacers are in the correct sequence, since they are not always identical.
*Screw on the locking ring loosely into position. 
*Turn the tool on the locking ring clockwise with a wrench, (no chain whip needed), to establish the manufacturer's recommended torque.   In the absence of data, aim for about  of 360in.lbs,  (40N.m),  (30ft.lbs).

====Freewheel Removal====
'''Howsoever the effort is eventually applied or from what angle, these directions are made assuming that the cogs of the wheel are facing you.'''
*Remove the rear wheel from the bike.
*Unscrew and remove the skewer assembly from the wheel.    
*Fit the correct removal tool into the recess in the hub.  Some removal tools have their own guide rods that feed through the middle of the hub.
*Turn the removal tool with the wrench or lever-arm ''anti-clockwise'' to slacken the freewheel.   Slackening requires considerable force, so a longer lever arm or pipe extension might help.   Consider the use of a bench and vice if it is available.   ''Note that the torque wrench should never be used  for heavy work of this kind''. 
*The freewheel cluster can then be removed as a complete unit.
If a bench-vice is to be used, then first set the removal tool in the wheel and if possible use the skewer and its cap (no springs) to set it in position.   Place the wheel, cogs down with the flats of the tool in the vice.   Turn the wheel ''anti-clockwise'', (looking down on top of the wheel), to unscrew the freewheel.   An inflated tire gives the best grip.

====Freewheel Replacement====
'''Howsoever the effort is eventually applied or from what angle, these directions are made assuming that the cogs of the wheel are facing you.'''
*Unscrew the skewer assembly from the wheel.   
*Clean the freewheel, oil-wipe the cogs, and grease both its threads and the threads on the hub.
*Fit the freewheel onto the hub threads until it is hand tight.  Tighten the freewheel further using the wrench and tool in a clock-wise direction, to obtain the torque recommended by the manufacturer.  In the absence of data, aim for about  of 240 in.lbs,  (27 N.m),  (20 ft.lbs).  The freewheel will tighten in use in any case;  the above figure is given to avoid uncertainty at the point of delivery.   

There is little advantage in making use of a vice for the freewheel fitting, but for those who intend to do so, they can find a method at [http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/cassette-and-freewheel-removal Park Tool's ''Cassette and Freewheel Removal''].

==Gearing Calculations==
This section  provides the rudimentary calculations associated with bicycle gearing. 

===Distance Shifted===
In all ''indexed'' shifting, (as opposed to ''friction'' shifting), there is a fundamental relation to describe the transverse distance that a derailleur cage shifts across the cog-set or chainrings.   The transverse distance shifted is equal to the product of the shifter's cable pull and the derailleur's shift ratio.   In practice, the distance shifted must equal the center to center spacing of the cogs, (or chainrings).   Most modern ''rear-shifting'' is indexed, and some ''front-shifting'' is indexed (for example, Shimano).  See [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Gear-changing_Dimensions|'''Gear Changing Dimensions''']] for a selection of such data.
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;Transverse Distance of Derailleur Cage = Shifter Cable Pull   x   Derailleur Shift Ratio

For example:   For a seven-speed rear cogset, a Shimano rear derailleur, and a SRAM MRX twist 7-speed shifter; we have;
Transverse Distance of Derailleur Cage = 1.7 ratio  x   2.9mm cable pull    =    4.93mm    Approximately 5mm
This suits all seven speed center to center spacings since they are all set at 5mm centers.
 &lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

===Derailleur Capacity===
When a rear-derailleur is planned or when an existing chain ring or cogset is changed, the required total capacity of the derailleur needs to be checked.   The total capacity refers to the ability of the derailleur to take up slack across the entire range of gear combinations.
Since the gear combinations are affected by the range of both the chain rings and the rear cogset, these are both represented in the calculation.   The required capacity of the rear derailleur becomes:

&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;Minimum Required Capacity = (Largest cog - Smallest cog) + (Largest chainring - Smallest chainring)

For example:   For a cogset 11T - 30T with only one chainring of 38T; we have;
Minimum Required Capacity = (30T - 11T) + (38T - 38T) = 19T    The 'total capacity' spec for the derailleur must be at least 19T.

Another example:  For a cogset 11T - 28T and chain rings 20, 30, and 42; we have;
Minimum Required Capacity = (28T - 11T) + (42T - 20T) = 39T    The 'total capacity' spec for the derailleur must be at least 39T. &lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
Other consideraions within a derailleur's specification sheet include front chain ring tooth difference and smallest and largest rear cog sizes.   This latter requirement ensures that as the derailleur traverses the cogs on its in-built gradient, the clearance of the cage, as set by the 'b-height' adjustment, is reasonably consistent. Attention should also be paid to the number of gears for which the derailleur is intended, and whether or not the  shifter is compatible with its shift ratio.

===Gear-Inches and Ground Covered===
Gear inch calculations are used by those who plan the design of cycle gearing, and are useful when a new bike is being considered.   They allow a tabular layout where the gears associated with adjacent chain rings can be studied for their overlap and convenience, and allow a purchaser to predict whether or not an intended ride will have a similar ''sweet spot'', or ''feel'', like their existing bike.   Multiplying the gear-inch figure by the constant ''pi'' (approximately 3) gives the distance covered by one complete turn of the pedals.   Calculations are made for each gear combination of front chain ring and rear sprocket.   The formula for any one combination is just:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;Gear Inches = Outside Inch-Diameter of driven Bicycle Wheel   X  (Size front chain ring / Size rear sprocket)    

For example:   For an 11T rear sprocket and a 38T chain ring, with a 26 inch rear wheel diameter, we have:
Gear Inches   =   26   X   (38T / 11T)   =  89.8 

and the distance covered in one turn of pedals is:
Distance (inches)   =   ''gear-inches  X  pi''   =   89.8   x   3.142   =   282.2 inches   =   23.5 feet for one turn of the pedals. &lt;/pre&gt;

It is usual to make a table of the gear inches and then possibly another table showing the change in gear inches between adjacent gears.   This permits an understanding of the relative effort required in the use of adjacent gears.   An on-line calculator that saves some work can be found at [http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gears/ '''''Gears'' by Sheldon Brown''''']. A typical gear-inch table is shown below, and although it is not entirely obvious in this example, for convenient arrangements, the top figure of each column is most usually found in the middle of the next column to its right. 

&lt;table  style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solix gray; border-collapse:collapse;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=5px align=left width=50% &gt;

''&lt;u&gt;Summary:&lt;/u&gt;''
	This website gives a basic overview of carbohydrates and the role they play in the human body.  It also covers metabolism of carbohydrates.  Glucose oxidation can be seen in Glycolysis as well as the pentose-phosphate pathway while the regeneration of glucose is seen in gluconeogenesis.  This website shows, step by step, the reactions of these pathways and the energy yield from each step.  The second link for this website goes to a page covering glycogen metabolism, showing the net reactions for the synthesis and degradation of glycogen.  Both links have sections on major control mechanisms for glucose and glycogen metabolism.

''&lt;u&gt;Terms:&lt;/u&gt;''
Glucosidases – enzymes involved in breaking down complex carbohydrates such as starch and glycogen

ascorbic acid – a sugar acid with antioxidant properties.  Scurvy is the disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C.

glucostat – removing glucose when offered in excess via glycogen synthesis and glycolysis and providing glucose when needed by gluconeogenesis

concomitant – accompanying in a passive way

hepatic lipase – lipolytic enzyme, synthesized by hepatocytes and found localized at the surface of liver sinusoid capillaries

phosphoglucomutase – an enzyme that transfers a phosphoryl group on a glucose monomer from the 1' to the 6' position in the forward direction or the 6' to the 1' position in the reverse

UTP – (Uridine triphosphate) - a pyrimidine nucleotide, consisting of the organic base uracil

Relation:
	This website clearly explains what is meant by carbohydrate metabolism.  It shows the relationship between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and the three enzymes that are different between the two pathways.  It also shows major control methods for the metabolism of carbohydrates, specifically glucose and glycogen in this case.  This site is a great resource to use for a more in depth coverage of glucose and glycogen metabolism.


'''[http://www.hmdb.ca/ The Human Metabolome Database]'''

&lt;u&gt;''Summary:''&lt;/u&gt;
	The Human Metabolome Database is a database that contains information about small metabolites.  This information includes chemical composition, taxonomy, location in the body, normal levels of the metabolite, genomic sequence, pathways it is involved in, and other molecules it interacts with.  This site has links to KEGG, PubChem, MetaCyc, ChEBI, PDB, Siss-Prot, and GenBank (see terms below).  This website is particularly easy to use and has enormous amounts of information on each molecule.  Just go to the main page and type in the name of the molecule you are looking for.

&lt;u&gt;''Terms:''&lt;/u&gt;

Relation:
	This website provides easy access to information on small molecules, such as carbohydrates, that would be useful in the study of metabolomics.  You are able to determine what the normal levels of a metabolite is in the body and the pathways involved that could increase or decrease those levels.  This would be helpful in screening for particular metabolic diseases.


'''[http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/biochem/15/ University of Akron: Carbohydrate Metabolism]'''

&lt;u&gt;''Summary:''&lt;/u&gt;
	This is a very basic website outlying the principles of carbohydrate metabolism.  It touches on the metabolite glucose including its synthesis and degradation pathways.  It also touches upon other carbohydrates such as starch, glycogen, and maltose.  This site describes what these metabolites are used for in the body and how they are a part of several different pathways.  Biosynthesis and regulation of carbohydrate metabolites are also a part of this website.

&lt;u&gt;''Terms:''&lt;/u&gt;
Fructose – is a simple reducing sugar (monosaccharide) found in many foods

'''[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=18183306 A Model for Carbohydrate Metabolism in the Diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum Deduced from Comparative Whole Genome Analysis ]'''

&lt;u&gt;''Summary:''&lt;/u&gt;
	Diatoms are responsible for 20% of the earth’s carbon fixation.  However, this mechanism is not well understood.  This paper attempt to clarify this process by proposing a model for carbon fixation by diatoms.  Little is also known about the synthesis and storage of Chrysolaminaran, the main carbohydrate in diatoms.  This carbohydrate is secreted and is a major component of biofilms.  In this paper, a model for the carbon concentrating mechanism, photorespiration, the oxidative and reductive pentose phosphate pathways and a model of the glycolytic reactions were generated.  The model for the glycolytic reaction is shown below.

[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2173943&amp;blobname=pone.0001426.g004.jpg Link to glycolytic reaction proposed by this paper]

&lt;u&gt;''Terms:''&lt;/u&gt;
Diatoms – major group of eukaryotic algae, and are one of the most common types of phytoplankton, most are unicellular

Rubisco – Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenases - catalyzes the incorporation of CO2

Chrysolaminaran – the principle storage carbohydrate in diatoms

Chimeras – two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells

Endosymbiont – any organism that lives within the body or cells of another organism

Plastids – organelles that only exist in plant cells and photosynthetic protists, responsible for photosynthesis

in silico analysis – analysis  performed using computers in conjunction with informatics capabilities

chlorenchyma cells – parenchyma cells that contain chlorophyll

periplasmic space – space seen between the plasma membrane and the outer membrane

Relation:
	Much is known about carbohydrate metabolism and the many different carbohydrate metabolites in the human body.  However, it is surprising that little is known about how diatoms fix carbon dioxide since it is so important to our survival.  This paper takes the first step in proposing a mechanism by which this takes place.  Someday, we may find this very diagram in our textbooks.


'''[http://jbiol.com/content/6/4/10 Dynamic rerouting of the carbohydrate flux is key to counteracting oxidative stress]'''

&lt;u&gt;''Summary:''&lt;/u&gt;
In order to access this article, you must first complete a free registration with the journal of biology.  This study is one of the first to develop a mathematical model that describes the observed experimental changes in metabolic flux.  In response to reactive oxygen species, yeast will shift from glycolysis to the pentose-phosphate pathway as an immediate and protective response to ROS.  This shift is made in order to maintain redox balance in the cell.

&lt;u&gt;''Terms:''&lt;/u&gt;
Deleterious – harmful, injurious

Triose-phosphate isomerase – TPI - catalyzes the reversible interconversion of the triose phosphate isomers dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

metabolic flux – the rate of flow of metabolites

Reactive oxygen species – ROS - oxygen ions, free radicals, and peroxides, both inorganic and organic

Perturbations – disturbance of motion, course, arrangement, or state of equilibrium

de novo – afresh, anew, beginning again

diamide – Any compound containing two amido groups united with one or more acid or negative radicals

Relation:
	It is well known that the human body will alter which pathway it uses (glycolysis or gluconeogenesis) depending on the carbohydrate status of the blood.  This study has now shown that yeast will change from using glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway in response to reactive oxygen species.  It is interesting to see how many different organisms have the ability to switch between pathways in order to counteract detrimental affects or to save energy.


'''[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/M708798200v1 Destabilization of ATP-sensitive potassium channel activity by novel KCNJ11 mutations identified in congenital hyperinsulinism]'''

&lt;u&gt;''Summary:''&lt;/u&gt;
	This paper demonstrates the importance of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in controlling the amount of insulin secreted by pancreatic cells.  It is shown that having a mutation in the genes encoding for this potassium channel can depolarize the membrane leading to an increase in the basal level of insulin secretion.  This can lead to the disease, hyperinsulinism.  

&lt;u&gt;''Terms:''&lt;/u&gt;
Hyperinsulinism – refers to an above normal level of insulin in the blood of a person or animal

Sulfonylurea – A class of oral hypoglycemic agents (pills and capsules taken to lower the level of blood glucose) by people with type 2 diabetes

Phosphoinositides – serve as direct local modulators or recruiters of the protein machineries that control membrane trafficking

Hypoglycemia – is the medical term for a pathologic state produced by a lower than normal level of glucose in the blood

Somatostatin – growth hormone inhibiting hormone

octreotide.- potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin

Chemiluminescence – the emission of light (luminescence) with limited emission of heat as the result of a chemical reaction

Exogenous – caused by factors from outside the organism or system

Relation:
	Throughout the study of metabolism, we learn that a pH and charge gradient is necessary to have across a membrane.  In this case, the charge gradient is essential for proper signaling in the cell.  With a lower depolarization, insulin is secreted at a higher basal level, leading to the disease of hyperinsulinism.


http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1694820.com

&lt;u&gt;''Summary:''&lt;/u&gt; 
The main point of this peer review article is to discuss the glycolysis process, which results in the formation of ATP as the main fuel in the anaerobic eukaryote, Monocercomonoides. Both ATP and Glucose are metabolites that relate directly to glycolysis and would be included in the organism's metabalome.  Since anaerobic eukaryotes lack a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle, they can only extract few molecule of ATP per molecule of glucose.  This is opposite of human cells, which makes this article important as it discusses alternate versions of enzymes in glycolysis.  In anaerobic eukaryotes, enzymes such as pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase and pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase were examined through horizontal gene transfers from the bacteria in question to other eukaryotes.  Horizontal gene transfers are processes in which an organism transfers genetic material to another cell that is not its offspring.  Analysis of the glycolytic pathway of Monocercomonoides resulted in identification of both single-gene trees and conserved HGT events that provide evidence for the monophyly of protists known as Ecavata. Shared horizontal gene transfer events between oxymonads and both Giardia and Trichomonas further supported this relationship. This relationship becomes an important resource as it focuses on using glucose metabolites of Monocercomonoides to determine its lineage.


&lt;u&gt;''Terms:''&lt;/u&gt;
Horizontal Gene Transfer- process in which an organism transfers genetic material to another cell that is not its offspring

Monophyly- a group of organisms that includes an ancestral species and all of its descendants.

Oxymonad- a group of flagellated protozoa found exclusively in the intestines of termites and other wood-eating insects.

Diplomonads- a group of flagellates, most of which are parasitic.  Also classified as Protists.

Walking primers-is a sequencing method for sequencing large DNA fragments (between 1,3 and 7 kilobases) that works by dividing long sequences into several consecutive short ones. 

Phylogenetic analysis- Analysis of the evolutionary connections between traits (for example, sequences)

Taxa- Any organism or group of organisms of the same taxonomic rank; for example, members of an order, family, genus, or species.


Relation:
This resource is very closely related to our current coursework.  As one would recall we had to memorize the complete glycolysis pathway, which is exactly what this article covered.  It focused on the enzymes involved in the pathway, which are some that I have memorized.  It also reviewed the process through an anaerobic prospective, which sheds light on how glycolysis can be altered but still produce ATP.  This is very interesting as we mainly focused on just the one type of glycolysis.


'''[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1748240 Flux control and excess capacity in the enzymes of glycolysis and their relationship to flight metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster]'''

''Summary:''
The focus of this research article is to study the degree of flux control of several enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway on flight performance of the fruit fly. The author’s were able to research this by “knocking out” the enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglucomutase, triosephosphate isomerase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and glycogen phosphorylase and studying the effect each knockout had on wing beat frequency of Drosophila. Wing-beat frequency is an accurate measure of flux control because it is closely correlated with oxygen consumption and directly reflects the rate of the hydrolysis of ATP.

&lt;u&gt;''Terms:''&lt;/u&gt;
Dipteran - A member of the insect order Diptera (the two-winged, or &quot;true,&quot; flies), characterized by the use of only one pair of wings for flight and the reduction of the second pair of wings to knobs used for balance.
P-element - a transposon that is present in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and is used widely for mutagenesis and the creation of genetically modified flies used for genetic research.
Hemolymph – insect “blood”
Polymorphism - The occurrence of different forms, stages, or types in individual organisms or in organisms of the same species, independent of sexual variations.
Dysgenic - Relating to or causing the deterioration of hereditary qualities in offspring.
Introgression - Infiltration of the genes of one species into the gene pool of another through repeated backcrossing of an interspecific hybrid with one of its parents.

Relevance:
The research carried out in this article involves the glycolytic pathway, which we have covered in class. The authors researched the control of several of the enzymes involved in glycolysis on the regulation of flight in Drosophila. The authors tested the enzymes’ regulatory effectiveness by reducing each enzyme’s activity and calculating their flux controls on flight performance.

&lt;u&gt;''Summary:''&lt;/u&gt;
This paper focused on measuring the rate at which metabolites flow through the pathway (i.e. the flux) of the rat hepatic glucose metabolic network in both forward and reverse directions.

&lt;u&gt;''Terms:''&lt;/u&gt;
Ion exchange chromatography – A process that allows the separation of ions and polar molecules based on the charge properties of the molecules.
Electron impact ionization – Method of mass spectrometry ionisation. The sample of interest is vaporized into the mass spectrometer ion source, where it is impacted by the a beam of electrons with sufficient energy to ionise the molecule.
Isotopomer – (isotopic isomer) Isomer having the same number of each isotopic atom but differing in their positions.
Outflux –  Movement of metabolites out of the pathway.
Influx – Movement of metabolites into the pathway.
Anaplerosis - An intermediate enzyme reaction that replaces the concentration of vital reacting compound that has been depleted in an organism.

Relevance:
The paper involves two major concepts that have been discussed in class.  First, it uses a measurement of flux as a means to analyze the metabolic control of a pathway.  Secondly, it mentions that, rather than existing in isolation, many pathways are in fact linked and integrated into each other through the sharing of substrates, activators, inhibitors etc, so that changes in one have an effect on the others.

&lt;u&gt;''Summary:''&lt;/u&gt; 
This research explores the differences in metabolic regulation between 2 strains of yeast, S.cerevisiae
and P.stipitis, when grown in media containing different concentrations of glucose. The central carbon
metabolism of P.stipitis is largely unidentified, while that of S.cerevisiae is well documented.
Metabolic-flux ratio analysis was used to identify active pathways in the central carbon metabolism of
P.stipitis. Differences in flux ratios were indicative of differences in activity in pathways between the
strains of yeast.

&lt;u&gt;''Terms:''&lt;/u&gt;
METAFoR (Metabolic-flux ratio) Analysis – a method to determine the rate at which a metabolite is
produced
NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy – a technique used to identify molecules
Chemostat Cultures – cultures grown in a static chemical environment
anaplerosis – process of restoring depleted sources of metabolic intermediates
respiro-fermentative metabolism – simultaneous execution of fermentation and respiration

Relevance:
This research can be directly tied to the content of this course. It focuses on 3 metabolic pathways:
glycolysis, pentose phosphate, and the citric acid cycle. The analysis of these pathways and subsequent
comparison between 2 organisms is an investigation of metabolic regulation.

=== Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of Zymomonas Mobilis during aerobic and anaerobic fermentations ===

[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/34 Yang S, Tschaplinski TJ, Engle NL, Carroll SL, Martin SL, Davison BH, Palumbo AV, Rodriguez M  and Brown SD. ''BMC Genomics'' (2009) '''10''':34]

'''Reviewer: Shannon B'''

'''Main Focus:'''
The main focus of the article was to understand how the aerobic and anerobic Z.mobilis fermentations mixture with ZM4s would affect their growth with and without oxygen. 

'''Summary:'''
Zhomana mobilis (ZM4) produces very closely to the theoretical yields of ethanol with high productivity that is specific. The recombinant strains are able to ferment both C-5 and C-6 sugars. ZM4 is achieved best under anaerobic conditions but is an aerotolerant organism. This particular DNA molecule is not well understood under the genetic and physiological responses to stresses.   
For Zhomana mobilis (ZM4), a type of bacteria, transcriptomic and metabolomic aerobic and anaerobic fermentations were demonstrated by microarray analysis. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were also demonstrated to the experiment. When oxygen was not present, ZM4 absorbed glucose more rapidly, higher growth rate, and the major end product was ethanol.  There were other end products that produced a great amount such as acetate, lactate, and acetoin. There was only 1.7% of ethanol shown aerobically as there was anaerobically. Certain gene expressions were not examined during the early exponential growth phase between aerobic and anaerobic conditions via microarray analysis. As fermentations continued there were greater differences in extracellular metabolite profiles. Under anaerobic conditions ZM4 contained lower levels of amino acids such as alanine, valine and lysine relating to aerobic conditions. In the stationary phase, the microarray analysis showed that 166 genes were differently expressed by more than a two-fold. ZM4 ferments glucose, fructose, and sucrose producing ethanol and carbon dioxide via the Enterner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. A key enzyme was encoded by transcripts of the ED pathway genes. During the ZM4 fermentations the high oxygen concentration negatively influenced the fermentation performance and the maximum specific growth rates were not very different between the aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Although, oxygen did affect the physiology of the cells which lead to the buildup of metabolic byproducts which after awhile led to high differences in transcriptomic profiles in stationary phase.

'''Relevance Statement:'''
There are quite a lot of techniques used in this article which will be useful in the study of metabolism and different metabolites. For example, gas chromatography (GC), High-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. As our course concentrates on different metabolic pathways these techniques are pretty helpful on understanding the metabolic measurements and results of these metabolic pathways. This article concentrates more on the aerobic and anaerobic fermentation. This gives us a better idea of where this metabolic pathway is applied in different organisms like the Zymomonas mobilis. Different bacteria have been studied such as Escherichia coli, Zymomonas mobilis, and Klebsiella oxytoca. Gram positive bacteria have also been studied such as Bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium glutamicum.</text>

====Summary====
;:The quantitative and comprehensive analysis of the structural lipid metabolome was applied to gain an understanding of the effect that the Type 2 diabetes drug rosiglitazone has on the liver metabolism. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are potent therapeutic agents that have proven successful in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in rodent models and in humans. TZDs include troglitazone, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ or PPARγ is supposed to have a high sensitivity to TZDs and after activation, is supposed to improve insulin sensitivity. 
;:However, TZD usage is accompanied by increased adipogenesis and lipid accumulation in tissues. There is question if the benefits to circulating lipid concentration can be disassociated from metabolic side effects including hepatic lipid accumulation. For the mice that were used, some had diabesity genes that led to early onset obesity leading to a progressively more sever hyperinsulinemia. TZD treatment was done one the liver metabolism and rosiglitazone was more potent antidiabetic TZD than troglitazone in early studies. 
;:It was revealed that actions of rosiglitazone and putatively PPARγ had key targets on lipid metabolism. Two groups of mice, one control and one experimental were used in the experiment. The mice were a cross of Nonobese Nondiabetic Zealand Obese (NZO/HILt) and Nonobese Nondiabetic (NON/LT) strains. They were feed for 4 weeks and then euthanized at which point blood, heart tissue, liver tissue and inguinal adipose were collected, weighed and frozen for analysis. 
;:Gene expression data was obtained by measuring the fluorescence intensity for each PCR reaction using the system software and was analyzed in EXCEL®. Lipids from plasma and tissues were extracted and prepared thin-layer chromatography to analysis. Also fatty acid methyl esters were collected and ran by capillary gas chromatography using a gas chromatograph. Quantitative data was visualized suing the Lipomic Surveyor™ software system which made a heat-map graph of the difference between control and treated mice. The heat map displayed the increase in each metabolite in rosiglitazone-treated mice relative to control mice by the intensity of the brightness. 
;:After 4 weeks of rosiglitazone treatment, diabetic hyperglycemia was completely reversed. That reversal also was accompanied by decline in plasma concentrations of insulin, leptin, triacylglyerides and cholesterol. The rosiglitazone treated mice had gained more body weight that the control mice, especially in the inguinal fat, heart and liver areas. Liver lipid metabolism results included a substantial accumulation of triacylglyerides and the inhibition of normal liver-plasma lipid exchange. Heart lipid metabolism results included the increased biosynthesis of n-7 fatty acids and increased concentration of triacylglyerides and free fatty acids of plasma. The hearts of the rosiglitazone treated mice were significantly enriched with cardiolipin however concentrations of plasmalogens were lower. This was consistent with a decrease peroxisome synthesis of lipids within hearts of treated mice.  Adipose lipid metabolism results included a decrease in triacylglyerides content but an increase in fatty acids. The treated mice had an n-7 and n-3 fatty acid accumulation while have a depletion of n-9 fatty acids. The plasmalogen lipids in inguinal fat phospholipids were depleted by the treatment. 
;:Overall the rosiglitazone treatment is often accompanied by weight gain. Increased synthesis of fatty acids occurred as well as an upregualtion of expression of genes associated with adipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis was found. Palmitoleic acid was an excellent indicator of the increased synthesis of fatty acids in both the live and adipose tissue. Rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist has an inhibitory effect on lipid biosynthesis in the peroxisome. It induced hyperlipidemia by disruption the mobilization of liver lipids into plasma and induced de novo fatty acid synthesis. Diminished the biosynthesis of lipids synthesized within the peroxisome and had substantial effect on the heart cardiolipin and free fatty acid metabolism. Lastly, it exerted tissue specific effects on lipid metabolism. 
;:It is hypothesized that the mice used in the experiment might have had underlying defects that rendered them sensitive to steatosis inducing effect to TZDs. Over all it should be noted that mice metabolism is very distinctly different than human lipid metabolism and directly application needs to be tested.

====Relevance to a Traditional Metabolism Course====
;:The topic of metabolome wide effects is a topic that could be easily related to a metabolism course. The paper mentions some pathways that are affected and could be further studied to see the complete involvement of the Type 2 diabetes drug rosiglitazone. One pathway is the electron transport chain. It is known that cardiolipin composition and content is important to the efficiency of electron transport. An increase in cardiolipin increased electron transport efficiency as well as decreased electron leakage. Also, there were two major lipid structures studied that are produce with in the peroxisome and these fatty acids as well as plasmalogen lipids are involved with the dihydroxyacetone phosphate biosynthetic pathway. Lastly, the study looked at the conversation of polyunsaturated rich phospholipids to triacylglyerides via a phospholipase C pathway.</text>

==The New World of Metabolomics==

{{main|Metabolomics/Introduction to Metabolomics/History | History}}
{{main|Metabolomics/Introduction to Metabolomics/Relationship to Traditional Metabolism | Relationship to Traditional Metabolism}}

In the world of biology and biochemistry there are many tiers of function. There is the genome, which is the underlying blueprint for the workings of our cells. From the genome arises the proteome; the factories, building blocks and workhorses of the cell and the organism. But neither of these is enough to truly understand the workings of biological systems. 

Cells and organisms have far more in them than just proteins and DNA. Metabolites are the organic chemical compounds that either start off the reactions within biology or act as intermediates, changing or being incorporated into each reaction along a metabolic pathway. The grand total of these compounds and their interactions throughout a cell or a species is the Metabolome. Traditionally metabolism was our way of understanding the Metabolome. It was measured in small-scale pathways through a reductionist approach. The idea was that the sum of the parts could be used to truly understand the whole. But the Metabolome can’t effectively be found through the sum of the parts, especially in the context of systems biology and metabolic engineering.

Newer tiers like Phenomics (the study of the set of phenotypes expressed by a cell) and new disciplines like Nutrigenomics (the study of relationship between nutrition and genetic function) depend heavily on comprehending the Metabolome in a large-scale fashion.

Metabolomics is the solution to this problem. A comprehensive, systems biology conscious approach to understanding the Metabolome in its full scope. Metabolomics seeks to avoid reductionism and apply high throughput analysis methods on metabolic levels in the cell. It will revolutionize fields like metabolic engineering and increase our knowledge of biological function phenomenally.

====Main Focus====
;:The main focus of “What is metabolic all about?” by Ute Roessner and Jairus Bowne, is to describe various techniques (pathway mapping, metabolite fingerprinting, comparative overlays and etc.) which develop metabolomics to better understand the organization and roles of organisms in the environment. There were four species used in a study to determine the metabolite profiles. These species were; moss Physcomitrella patens, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the crop plants Hordeum vulgare L. and Triticum aestivum L. These comparisons were done with techniques such as cluster analysis, DiMS, and target analysis.

====Summary====
Metabolomics in the last twenty years has made gigantic progress in sequencing a number of different organisms and has made large investments in developing analytical approaches for the study of different cell products. These ‘omics approaches such as transcriptomics, metabolomics and etc. are essential in the study of organisms responding to their environments. Metabolomics helps understand the physiological state of an organism. Metabolites act as the language of metabolomics. Only a few technologies have been employed such as mass spectrometry with chromatographic techniques like NMR to analyze these metabolites. Due to the complexity of a metabolome, it is difficult to employ a single technique for analysis. Therefore a number of approaches have to be established for extraction of the information and interpreting it in a biological context.  Detection, quantification and identification can be accomplished through cluster analysis, pathway mapping and etc.

One application used in the study of metabolomics is target analysis, which helps in determination and quantification of a few known metabolites. Another application is metabolite profiling which analyzes large set of compounds using important tools like GC-MS. Metabolomics helps quantify as many metabolites as possible and metabolic fingerprinting helps differentiate between these samples. 

Most of the research in metabolomics is based on the construction of phylogenetic trees. Primary metabolites are used to determine nutritional and growth status. Secondary metabolites function as markers for taxonomy and phylogenetics. Direct infusion ectecrospray mass spectrometry was a very helpful tool in determining different fungal species. When compared to the phenotypic tree, more than 80% of the species could be classified based on their mass profile. To determine mechanisms for adaptation and tolerance of plants to abiotic stresses revealed that a number of responses are plant specific or are common between stresses and/or plants. 

A study to compare levels of metabolites in four different species using metabolomic techniques demonstrated that the metabolite profiles of the species were very different. Classifications such as these demonstrate metabolomics as an important tool for the identification and classification or organisms. Studies in metabolomics would be pretty helpful for the basic principle of life and its evolution. The drawbacks of metabolomics could be that it only measures a small portion of all elements in a biological system. In the future, study of metabolomics such as the response of various organisms to different environments at the genetic, transcript, protein and metabolite levels would strengthen are knowledge of the biology framework in different life systems. It would also help us understand the function, organization and roles of organisms in nature.

====Relevance to a Traditional Metabolism Course====
The course about metabolism, teaches students about the chemical reactions occurring in an organism such as citric acid cycle, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. From reading this article, it was found that metabolomics is a study of the chemical footprints left behind by the cellular processes organisms carry out in everyday life. Metabolomics in the article is described by various techniques used to statistically analyze these footprints. The footprints in the article are believed to be called metabolites. These metabolites are studied in subspecies of a class using techniques such as metabolic fingerprinting, DiMS and hierarchical cluster analysis. Most of these techniques are new analytical approaches, allowing biochemists broaden there research goals in metabolism.

====Summary====
Biology can be viewed as information processing on four interconnected levels.  Each of these levels of information has an associated field of study.  The flow of information starts at DNA, to RNA, to proteins, and finally metabolites.  These are studied as the fields of Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, and Metabolomics.  Metabolic Pathways are interconnected sets of chemical reactions.  These pathways are complex, and difficult to study.  However, many benefits can be gleaned from the study of metabolomics, and metabolites.  Many metabolites are very highly conserved molecules.  This means that the study of one organism can often yield results applicable to a wide range of organisms.  Metabolomes can show influences of both genetics and environmental impacts.  This allows metabolic diagnostics to have great power, as regardless of the source of a disease, it can be detected.  Metabolites can be analyzed and measured through many techniqes.  The main techniques include Mass Spectometry, NMR analysis, and chromatography.  There are four levels on which metabolomes can be viewed.  From most to least specific, these are Metabolite Target Analysis - measuring specific amounts of a single metabolite, Metabolic Profiling - viewing the abundance of related groups of compounds, metabolomics - the study of all metabolites in a cell, and Metabolic Fingerprinting - simple classification of metabolomes into important categories.  There are many contributing factors to the difficulty in studying metabolomes.  Rather than processing static information, of specific bits, such as genetics - which are made up of 4 base pairs, or proteins - made up of 20 Amino Acids.  In contract, metabolism involves the interactions, over time, of thousands and thousands of different molecules.  The products measured for metabolomes can vary in concentration from as low as nanomolar, to micromolar concentrations.  Data from metabolomic analysis requires further analysis in order to interpret.  The two main forms of these analysis is Principal Component Analysis.  Despite these drawbacks, the benefits available from this analysis make it a productive field of study.

====Relevance to a Traditional Metabolism Course====
This article is a power point presentation, which provides an overview of Metabolomics.  It serves nicely as a broad introduction to the techniques available for Metabolomics, as well as the purpose behind these techniques, their strengths, and weaknesses.  There is a brief overview as to the role of metabolites, and their position in metabolic pathways - this is mostly presented as a review, however, and is most helpful to one already familiar with the concepts.  This article is appropriate for giving an overview, or for a broad review, and does not go in depth in any given topic.

== '''Metabolites''' ==

Metabolites are organic compounds that are starting materials/intermediates in metabolism pathways. Metabolites are small simple structures absorbed in a diet.  They include vitamins and essential amino acids. They can be used to construct more complex molecules, or they can be broken down into simpler ones. 
Intermediary metabolites may be synthesized from other metabolites and often release chemical energy. For example, glucose, can be synthesized via gluconeogenesis (an anabolic reaction) to form starch or glycogen, and can be broken down during glycolysis (catabolic reaction) to obtain chemical energy. End products of metabolism are excreted from the organism. Urea, for example, is an end product of protein degradation in man. Carbon dioxide is usually thought of as an end product of carbohydrate, protein, and fat degradation in aerobic organisms, although technically, carbon dioxide, as carbonic acid, can also participate in the biosynthesis of some substances, particularly in plants. 
Catabolism and Anabolism Catabolism:  degradative metabolism involving the release of energy and resulting in the breakdown of complex materials (as proteins or lipids) within the organism. Anabolism: the constructive part of metabolism concerned especially with macromolecular synthesis.

===Metabolites and their pathways===

====KEGG Pathways====

[http://www.genome.jp/ GenomeNet] is a resource database developed by the Kyoto University Bioinformatics Center dedicated to provide computational devices to aid the study on the genome are various areas in biomedical sciences. The database provide tons of diversified maps of various metabolic pathways in humans and in plants. In addition, topics such as disease and drugs research are also mentioned and discussed in details with visual aids. Gene sequencing and analysis are also hugely emphasized at GenomeNet that provides many bioinformatic tools to in studying the genome sequence motif, phylogenetic research, and everything else you want to know about genes. One of the huge contribution from GenomeNet is providing '''KEGG''' maps and pathways that served as visual aids for studying of Matabolomics.
	

[http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes] or KEGG, is a database of biological systems which consists of genes, proteins, chemical building blocks, molecular pathways, hierarchies and relationships between various biological objects. KEGG links genomes to biological systems and maps pathways together to see the interactive cycle and the metabolites involved. You can also search through the KEGG website by entering a specific organism. 


Primary Metabolites: 
Below are links that show the different pathways of all Primary metabolites. 
Primary metabolites encompass reactions involving compounds which are formed as part of the normal anabolic and catabolic processes. These processes take in the cells of the organism.

New Vocabulary: 
1.	Orthologs, or orthologous genes, are genes in different species that are similar to each other because they originated from a common ancestor.
2.	Ohnologous genes are paralogous genes that have originated by a process of whole-genome duplication.
3.	Paralogs: a gene in an organism that is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, making the two copies paralogous.
4.	Xenologs: Homologs resulting from horizontal gene transfer between two. Xenologs can have different functions, if the new environment is vastly different for the horizontally moving gene. In general, though, xenologs typically have similar function in both organism
5.	Gametology: term which denotes the relationship between homologous genes on nonrecombining, opposite sex chromosomes. Gametologs result from the origination of genetic sex determination and barriers to recombination between sex chromosomes

Relevance: This website database relates to our course work and text book by compiling all of the metabolism pathways. It defines metabolites, characterizes them in their role they play in any pathway and gives us a clear view on the relationship it has with organism as a whole. This database can be used for research to further develop our understanding in the world of Metabolomics which will in turn help us understand and maybe even cure different illnesses. 


====MetaCyc====


[http://metacyc.org/ MetaCyc] is a database for over 900 primary and secondary metabolic pathways from various organisms; it also contains associated compounds, enzymes, and genes. Similary to KEGG, MetaCryc database aid the studying of Metabolomics by providing visual aid of many metabolic pathways. 

The exciting aspect of [http://biocyc.org/META/class-tree?object=Pathways MetaCyc pathways] is the detail explanation of the pathways. You can view all metabolites and their subclasses. (It also allows you to see all metabolites in relationship to each other and their hierarchy.)  
New vocabulary:
1.	Prostaglandin is any member of a group of lipid compounds that are derived enzymatically from fatty acids and have important functions in the animal body. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They are mediators and have a variety of strong physiological effects; although they are technically hormones, they are rarely classified as such.
2.	Cyclooxygenases: Prostaglandins are produced following the sequential oxidation of AA, DGLA or EPA by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) and terminal prostaglandin synthesis. 
3.	Pseudo compound: is not necessarily a physical compound. For example light, or a mis match of DNA base pairs, could be considered pseudo compounds.

====The Human Metabolome Database====



[http://www.hmdb.ca/ Human Metabolome Database] is the most complete collection of human metabolite and human metabolism data in the world. It contains records for more than 2180 metabolites. It contains every metabolite and where you can find them (biofluids, tissue etc) it gives the molecular structure, weight and IUPC.  The HMDB also contains a collection of experimental metabolite concentration data compiled from hundreds of mass spectra and Nuclear Magnetic resonance metabolomic analyses performed on urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples. The HMDB contains compound description, names and synonyms, structural information, physico-chemical data, reference NMR and MS spectra, biofluid concentrations, disease associations, pathway information, enzyme data, gene sequence data, SNP and mutation data as well as extensive links to images, references and other public databases. Another aspect of the HMDB is Biofluid search which allows you to look at normal and abnormal concentrations of different metabolites for 7 different biofluids.  

[http://universe-review.ca/F11-monocell.htm Universe-review.ca] is a link that gives a brief summary on different essential metabolites. It goes through the structure of the molecule and their role in various metabolic pathways. 
[http://universe-review.ca/F11-monocell.htm Biosynth Chemistry &amp; Biology] is another site with specific information on Lipids.
New Vocabulary:
1.	CAS registry numbers are unique numerical identifiers for chemical compounds, polymers, biological sequences, mixtures and alloys. They are also referred to as CAS numbers, CAS RNs or CAS #s
2.	Biofluid: encompasses any fluid found in the body, HMDB includes: Amniotic Fluid, Bile, Blood, Breast Milk, CSF, Feces, Lymph, Menses, Mucus, Saliva, Sebum, Semen, Sweat, Synovial Fluid, Urine, Vitreous Humour and Vomit. 
3.	Sebum: oily substances are secreted by Sebaceous glands called sebum and the debris of dead fat-producing cells. 
4.	Simplified molecular input line entry specification or SMILES:  is a specification for unambiguously describing the structure of chemical molecules using short ASCII strings. SMILES strings can be imported by most molecule editors for conversion back into two-dimensional drawings or three-dimensional models of the molecules.
5.	American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), character encoding based on the English alphabet. ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that work with text
Relevance: While the past two data base are more specific for metabolite pathways, HMDB focuses on the metabolite composition and chemistry/ chemical interaction. This is relevant because HMDB really breaks down each metabolite to the molecular level. HMDB also allows for purchasing of these compounds.

Summary:
The main point of this peer review article is to discuss the glycolysis process, which results in the formation of ATP as the main fuel in the anaerobic eukaryote, Monocercomonoides. Both ATP and Glucose are metabolites that relate directly to glycolysis and would be included in the organism's metabalome.  Since anaerobic eukaryotes lack a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle, they can only extract few molecule of ATP per molecule of glucose.  This is opposite of human cells, which makes this article important as it discusses alternate versions of enzymes in glycolysis.  In anaerobic eukaryotes, enzymes such as pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase and pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase were examined through horizontal gene transfers from the bacteria in question to other eukaryotes.  Horizontal gene transfers are processes in which an organism transfers genetic material to another cell that is not its offspring.  Analysis of the glycolytic pathway of Monocercomonoides resulted in identification of both single-gene trees and conserved HGT events that provide evidence for the monophyly of protists known as Ecavata. Shared horizontal gene transfer events between oxymonads and both Giardia and Trichomonas further supported this relationship. This relationship becomes an important resource as it focuses on using glucose metabolites of Monocercomonoides to determine its lineage.

Horizontal Gene Transfer- process in which an organism transfers genetic material to another cell that is not its offspring
Monophyly- a group of organisms that includes an ancestral species and all of its descendants.

Phylogenetic analyses- Analysis of the evolutionary connections between traits (for example, sequences)
Taxa- Any organism or group of organisms of the same taxonomic rank; for example, members of an order, family, genus, or species.

Relevance:
How does this information relate to the information that you have studied in this course to date?
This resource is very closely related to our current coursework.  As one would recall we had to memorize the complete glycolysis pathway, which is exactly what this article covered.  It focused on the enzymes involved in the pathway, which are some that I have memorized.  It also reviewed the process through an anaerobic prospective, which sheds light on how glycolysis can be altered but still produce ATP.  This is very interesting as we mainly focused on just the one type of glycolysis.

Summary:
ISAS’s main focus is to create analytical methods that will be able to answer questions about a metabolites specificity, selectivity, and dynamic range. They want to be able to identify a metabolom in a single step (ex: from a sample of air breathed out by a person being able to identify dangerous metabolites that would signal cancer was present in the lungs). Another goal of ISAS is to detect differences at the single cell level that come from mutations and the varying environments that each cell is in.

Cytostatic- inhibiting or suppressing cellular growth and multiplication (http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/cytostatic)

Relevance:
A lot of the techniques that ISAS uses so far are similar to subjects we have studied in the course. ISAS uses nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry to evaluate intracellular and extracellular metabolites in human bowel tissues in an attempt to identify metabolites created by cancer cells. In Chapter 4 we learned that NMR can show the dynamic part of a components structure (folding, conformational alterations, and interactions with different molecules). Through the use of this method people could diagnosed with colorectal cancer earlier and through a less invasive method than before. Since cancer cells have mutated genes and create different metabolites than the colorectal cells normally would, a method being able to identify these products would be very helpful. In chapter 3 we learned about Mass Spec methods including MALDI MS, ESI MS, and MS/MS. ISAS uses ion mobility mass spectrometry in a lot of their projects including mold identification, analysis of breath to check for diabetes and lung cancer. Ion Mass Spec (IMS) detects low amounts of chemicals by using a homogenous electric field to see differences in migration of the gas phase ions.  Where proteomics and genomics can show general drug treatments for problems, the Single Cell Laboratory research could be used to create specific drugs for each individual person’s unique cells and how their metabolome might be different.

==Analytical Methods Introduction==

Metabolomics is a field where the discovery of specific cellular metabolites is essential to the field. Without the tools and methods to discover the metabolites, metabolite profiles and cellular processes unique to organisms cannot be discovered. Methods for discovering metabolomes range from technical chemical methods such as NMR to statistical analysis.

==The Sumner Group==


The [http://www.noble.org/plantbio/ms/metabolomics.html Sumner Group] is involved in the research of plant metabolomics. This is challenging because of 3 primary limitations. Profiling the metabolome is
difficult because of its chemical diversity. Genomic and proteomic variance are limited by the basic
components (nucleotides and amino acids), whereas metabolomes lack any sort of consistency.
Another problem is dynamic range, which deals with measurement tolerance and sensitivity. The third
problem is analytical and biological variance, which deals with deviations in measurement and in
composition. The Sumner group is developing a way to get around these problems by dividing metabolites into
different groups for analysis. The analytical techniques they develop are used to research disease in
plants, and also to develop computational model organisms of plants.

'''Terms'''

transcriptome – the set of all transcripts produced by either a single cell or an entire organism
principal component analysis – a statistical technique used to separate data into classes
hierarchical clustering – a method to determine relationships or similarity between data sets.
GC/MS (gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ) - a way to profile large numbers of
metabolites by separation (GS) and then measurement (MS)
HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) – a technique to separate both volatile and nonvolatile elements. Coupled to MS, it is another way to profile a large number of metabolites.

'''Relevance'''

The research of this group looks at metabolic regulation and its relationship to diseases in plants. This
course looks at metabolic regulation, and problems within a pathway that can lead to disease. The area
that is more relevant is the group's efforts at creating a model organism. The comprehensive
understanding of an organism's metabolic regulation, depending on environmental conditions, relates to
the regulatory mechanisms covered in class thus far.

==Three Dimensional Cellular Microarray for High-Throughput Toxicology Assays==
[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/105/1/59 Three-dimensional cellular microarray for high-throughput toxicology assays]

The main purpose of this paper was to develop a miniaturized 3D cell-culture array (DataChip) that would screen drug candidates for toxicity of a particular drug at the early stages of drug development.  This is important due to amount of research put into drug development in today's world.  The DataChip will hopefully select for drugs that cause adverse effects, remove them from development and help bring more drugs into the development process.  This DataChip will be able to rapidly identify metabolic activation or deactivation of xenobiotics before they ever enter a human being.  Xenobiotics are metabolized in the liver and in most cases, the liver is adversely affected by drugs.  The DataChip’s aim is to significantly reduce the number of cases of liver failure due to xenobiotic metabolism, which is the leading cause of liver failure.

'''Terms:'''

Xenobiotics – chemical which is found in an organism but which is not normally produced or expected to be present in it

Microarray – biological assay

Alginate - viscous gum that is abundant in the cell walls of brown algae

P450 isoforms – (CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) enzymes that are a part of the  mixed-function oxidase system

IC50 values - or the half maximal inhibitory concentration

Hep3B cells – Human hepatoma cells

Fluorogenic - a process in which fluorescence is generated

Ketoconazole - synthetic antifungal drug used to prevent and treat skin and fungal infections

'''Relevance:'''
In class, we were discussing different metabolic pathways in the human body and the different products they produce.  We were also learning how all these processes are linked to one another.  This paper talks about new ways to detect harmful side effects caused by the metabolism of a substance.  Xenobiotics are broken down in the liver.  Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis both take place in the liver as well.  If the liver if damaged by xenobiotic metabolism, then glycolysis and gluconeogenesis would also be disrupted.  This paper describes other metabolic process that occurs in the body and the possible side effects of the metabolites.

Metabolomics involves the detection and quantification of as many sample components as reasonably possible in order to identify compounds that can be used to characterize the samples under study. In electrospray ionization, ions are produced for analysis my mass spectrometry (MS). When applying this technique to metabolomics, it is important that metabolome sample constituents  are efficiently separated prior to ion production, so that ionization suppression is minimized. This will ensure an extensive dynamic range of the measurement, as well as coverage of the metabolome. Measurement sensitivity may be increased by optimizing the MS inlet and interface.

Advancements in front end liquid chromatography (LC) separations, electrospray ionization and ion transmission efficiency have increased the sensitivity of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based measurements. An extended and more reproducible coverage of the metabolome has resulted in the detection of larger numbers of features characterized by accurately measured masses and retention times. Ionization efficiency has been improved with small i.d. columns that provide lower flow rates. This has led to greater sensitivity and better quantification. However, longer columns that provide high separation peak capacities produce lengthy analysis times that are not amenable in the analysis of large numbers of samples, which are required for statistically significant metabolomics studies. Alternative and complementary approaches, such as ionization electrospray-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) or liquid chromatography-ionization microspray-mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS) are in development. These methods would provide higher throughput, which would allow for a moderately high coverage analysis of several hundred samples over the duration of a few days.

In an effort to simplify and streamline compound identification from metabolomics data generated by liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, software has been developed for constructing Personalized Metabolite Databases with content from over 15,000 compounds pulled from the public METLIN database. Extra functionalities have been added that permit the addition of user-defined retention times as an orthogonal searchable parameter; and allow interfacing to separate software, a Molecular Formula Generator (MFG), that facilitates reliable interpretation of any database matches from the accurate mass spectral data. In an effort to assess the utility of this identification strategy, retention times have been added to a subset of masses in this database that represent a mixture of 78 synthetic urine standards. The mixture was analyzed and screened against this METLIN urine database, which resulted in 46 accurate mass and retention time matches. Human urine samples had been analyzed under the same analytical conditions and were screened against this database. Another 374 had an accurate mass match to the database, where 163 of those masses had the highest MFG score. What’s more, MFG calculated a formula for an additional 849 ions that had no database matches. These results indicate that the METLIN Personal Metabolite database and MFG software offer an exemplary strategy for confirming the formula of database matches. If no database match is found, possible formulas are suggested.

Since a mass determination cannot assign elemental composition with absolute certainty, it has been suggested to complement database assignment of high mass accuracy data with other techniques such as isotope ratios and RT. It has been demonstrated that the METLIN Personal Metabolite Database software can be used to assign the correct elemental compositions for a set of urine metabolite standards. Including RT as a separate, orthogonal variable will allow for rapid, positive identification of the temporally resolved masses. Combining MFG capacity with mass and RT database matching is expected to increase the confidence with which both known and unknown compounds are assigned a correct elemental composition.

Fourier Transform Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS) offers unparalleled mass resolution, mass accuracy, and superb detection sensitivity. With these features, FTICR-MS is capable of becoming a powerful technique for high-throughput metabolomics analysis. This study examines properties of ultrahigh-field 12-Tesla (12T) in order to identify and quantify human plasma metabolites, and for the untargeted metabolic fingerprinting of inbred-strain mouse serum by direct infusion (DI). Rational elemental compositions (incorporated unlimited C, H, N and O, and a maximum of two S, three P, two Na, and one K per formula) of approximately 250 out of 570 metabolite features were detected in a 3-min infusion analysis of aqueous extract of human plasma, and were able to identify more than 100 metabolites. Isotopically-labeled internal standards were used to obtain high-quality calibration curves for the absolute quantitation of choline with sub-pmol sensitivity. This required 500 times less sample than previous LC/MS analyses. Optimal serum dilution conditions allowed for chemical compounds that were spiked into mouse serum as metabolite mimics to produce a linear response that spanned over a 600-fold concentration range. DI/FTICR-MS analysis was conducted on serum from 26 mice from 2 inbred strains, with and without acute trichloroethylene (TCE) treatment. This method had also been extended to the metabolomic fingerprinting of serum samples from 49 mice from 5 inbred strains that were involved in an acute alcohol toxicity study, with positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI). It was demonstrated that more upwards of 400 metabolites could be profiled within 24 hrs, when applying DI/FTICR-MS to these samples.

Ultrahigh-field FTICR-MS has proven to be a potentially invaluable tool for qualitative metabolomics. The superior mass resolution facilitates the detection of hundreds of metabolites in complex samples in the DI mode. The mass accuracy frequently allows the identification of low-mass metabolites that are based solely on mass. This is accomplished by generating elemental compositions and then searching available metabolome databases.

Ultrahigh-field FTICR-MS can also be used to rapidly generate differential metabolite profiles in samples taken from large studies. However, DI/FTICR-MS is not comprehensive and therefore will not likely eliminate the need for chromatographic separations to achieve thorough metabolome coverage and to differentiate metabolite isomers. Software is currently being developed to enhance the potential of FTICR-MS for high-throughput metabolomics. This software would facilitate analyses by automatic detection of differentially-abundant metabolites, followed by their automated identification via elemental composition determination and metabolome database searching.

=Computational Modeling of Metabolic Control=

Metabolomics is a systems biology look at the interactions of metabolic pathways within an organism.  
Computational tools are useful and necessary to model these complex interactions and predict outcomes of perturbations of the system.
A computational model of mitochondria and electrophysiological metabolism has been established, and applied to data collected from analyses conducted on cardiac mitochondria and phosphate metabolites in striated muscle, in vivo. The model is based on kinetic and thermodynamic details of reaction mechanisms of biochemical species. Building such an elaborate and kinetically encompassing model necessitated a vast collection of quantitative data from respiring mitochondria under specific closely monitored conditions. These details were then catalogued along with their results. Further validation of the model resulted from in vitro data measurements from cardiac muscle and in vivo measurements from skeletal muscle. The model was capable of predicting the roles of NAD and ADP in tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenase regulation, and determined that NAD was a more significant regulator. The model was also capable predicting the effects of cytosolic pH fluctuation. Specifically, the model determined that decreases in the pH resulted in mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, which in turn decreased the rate of ATP synthesis.

Current research suggests that a vast quantity of independent data collected from experiments on in vivo and ex vivo systems would provide a comprehensive model of mitochondria metabolism. Established predictions based upon this model indicated the mitochondrial redox state as a primary regulator of tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. This model also reinforces results from similarly conducted research supporting the determination of inorganic phosphate strongly affecting the mitochondria redox state. Specifically, it was determined that inorganic phosphate influences the tricarboxylic acid cycle as a substrate and a cofactor. The current model also determined that mitochondrial ATP synthesis is directly dependent upon ADP and inorganic phosphate activation of oxidative phosphorylation, as well as NAD and inorganic phosphate activation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

A future prospect for this model is expected to involve analyzing calcium regulation of mitochondrial energetics. This will require including the established roles of Ca2+ in regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and  -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase within the model.

==E-Cell2 Simulation System==
 
Available for download at http://www.e-cell.org


&lt;big&gt;'''Main Focus:'''&lt;/big&gt;

The E-Cell2 simulation system is a publicly available simulation system for 
modeling, simulation and analysis of complex, heterogeneous and multi-scale systems 
like the cell.  Within this package, a computational tool for mitochondrial systems 
biology has been included.  The model was developed by integrating enzyme kinetics 
studies previously published in the literature.  Instead of looking at pathways 
individually, the model integrates the respiratory chain, the TCA cycle, fatty acid
B-oxidation, and metabolite transport systems to allow an observation of the dynamic
behavior of the mitochondria as a whole. The model should allow investigators to 
evaluate the influence of metabolite treatments on the organelle as a whole.  
This model is flexible and allows the incorporation of other models created by
independent researchers.  E-Cell is implemented in C++ computer language.

&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms:'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Lineweaver-Burk plots: Also known as a double reciprocal plot, this is a graphical representation of the Lineweaver-Burk equation of enzyme kinetics.  This method was developed before nonlinear regression was available to fit curve data into straight lines.  The plot is used to provide a graphical analysis of the Michaelis-Menten equation and describe values for Vmax and KM.   

;Michaelis-Menten equation: This equation describes the relationship between the rate of substrate conversion by an enzyme to the concentration of the substrate.  The equation is given below, where Km is the Michaelis constant, V is the rate of conversion, Vmax is the maximum rate of conversion, and [S] is the substrate concentration.

;Fourth-order Runge-Kutta method: This is a method of numerically (approximately) integrating ordinary differential equations. It uses a trial step at the midpoint of an interval to cancel our lower-order error terms.  The method is reasonably simple and robust, making it a good candidate for numerical solutions of differential equations. The method was developed by the German mathematicians C. Rung and M.W.Kutta.

;TCA Cycle:  Abbreviation for the tricarboxylic acid cycle.  This is also commonly referred to as the citric acid cycle or  the Krebs cycle (for its discovered Hans Krebs).

;Quantitative Modeling:  As opposed to experimental modeling which shows the general interactions of systems, quantitative modeling describes the precise concentrations of metabolite flux in and out of systems.  Quantitative modeling has been made possible through mathematical analysis of biochemical models and has become essential to understand the cell at a systems level.

;Bifurcation:  In general, bifurcation is the splitting of a main body into two parts.  In a dynamic system bifurcation is a period of doubling, quadrupling etc.

The mitochondrial model includes processes we have studied in depth, including fatty acid B-oxidation (chapter 17) and the respiratory chain (chapter 20).  It also includes inner-membrane transport system. We have looked at several transport systems, for example the citrate shuttle for acetate out of the mitochondria (chapter21).  Another cycle included in the model, the TCA cycle or Citric Acid Cycle  (chapter 16) was a large focus of our studies.

&lt;big&gt;'''Main Focus:'''&lt;/big&gt;

The site has a good introduction to the utility of computational models for quantitatively analyzing traditional isotopic tracer methods and isotopic kinetic data.  Experimental methods using stable isotope and radioisotope tracers to monitor kinetics of intermediates in metabolic pathways can be interpreted using computer routines to give insight into the fluxes and compartmentation of the pools of these metabolites. The site provides a breakdown of an example of a basic iterative computer model used to simulate labeling behavior of non-steady state intermediates. The important distinction is that iterative model can be applied to non-steady-state situations or to a situation with multiple pools of intermediates with different turnover rates, basic kinetic equations cannot.	


&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms:'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Steady-state: Pools of intermediates and rates of reactions remain constant with time. 	

;Non-steady state: Pools of intermediates expand and deplete with time.

;Pulse-chase labeling kinetics: In this commonly used protocol, a cell sample is exposed to a radio-labeled compound for a brief period of time, referred to as a ‘pulse’.  The quantity of labeling can be shown to be a function of the length of exposure time.  After exposure, the sample is washed with a buffer solution.  This removes the isotope.  Next, there is a ‘chase’ step where the sample is incubated with a non-labeled form of the compound.  These experiments are useful for following intra-cellular location of proteins or the transformation of a metabolite into others over a period of time/ through a biological pathway. 

;Effluxes:  Refers to the movement of metabolites out of a cell or compartment.

;Hill Coefficient:  This is a measure of cooperativity in a binding process. It was originally worked out for the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. A hill coefficient of 1 indicates independent binding, a hill coefficient greater than 1 indicates a positive cooperative binding of one ligand facilitates binding of subsequent ligands at other sites on the multimeric receptor complex.

;GS/GOGAT Cycle:  Responsible for glutamate synthesis.  Within this process ammonia is assimilated and recycled. The GS stands for glutamine synthase and GOGAT stands for an NADPH-dependent glutamine:2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase (or glutamate synthase).


&lt;big&gt;'''Connection to Biochemistry Metabolism Course:'''&lt;/big&gt;
	
Within this site pools of metabolic intermediates and multiple compartments are considered.  We have explored the impact of compartmentalization as a form of regulation. For example in the regulation of hexokinase IV (glucokinase) when fructose 6-phosphate concentration in the liver is high, a nuclear binding protein draws hexokinase IV into the nucleus.  This prevents it from acting in glycolysis.   We have also looked at the significance of pools of activated intermediates (such as Acetly-CoA and succcinly-CoA) and reduced intermediates (such as NADH and NADPH) and the role their transport and availability plays in metabolic reactions.

JWS Online is a systems biology tool for simulation of kinetic models from a curated model database. It provides access to a collection of published kinetics models divided into the categories of metabolism, gene expression, translation, cell cycle, enzymology, single transduction, and unknown.   The models can be queried by this category and/or by the organism being modeled. Organisms available range from Homo Sapien to Dictyostelium. The models have been compiled from various authors (another query option), and are available for download or can be run within the website. Manuscript details (author, source, description, etc.) are also provided.  Java applets are required to run the models. Within the models users can change enzyme parameters, run time simulations or do steady state analysis.


&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms:'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Curated Database:  A curated database refers to a database that has been created and is maintained with a significant amount of ‘manual’ labor.  Its creators typically monitor and update the content of the sight as appropriate.  

;Enzymology:  The branch of chemistry concerned with the properties and actions of enzymes.

;The Silicon Cell Project:  Research initiative that JWS Online is a part of.  The long term goal of this project is “the computation of Life at the cellular level on the basis of the complete genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and cell-physiomic information that will become available in the forthcoming years”.  Those involved predicted the initiative would take a decade to complete, and it began in 2000. (No word available as to how close they feel they are to completion). 

;Armoracia rausticana: Misspelled within the site (actual spelling Armoracia rusticana), this is the scientific name for the plant horseradish.

;Entamoeba histolytica:  This is a type of anaerobic parasitic protozoan.  It infects primarily humans and other primates, leading  to amoebic dysentery or amoebic liver abscess. 

;Leishmania infantum:  This parasite is an intracellular pathogen of  the immune system.   It targets macrophages and dendritic cells, causing the disease Leishmaniasis which affects millions of people worldwide. A more severe and life-threatening form of the illness is caused by a different species, L. donovani.

;Lactococcus lactic:  This is a mesophilic fermentative bacterium which produces lactic acid from sugar (hexose) fermentation. Strains of this bacterium are used in the production of fermented milk products.


&lt;big&gt;'''Connection to Biochemistry Metabolism Course:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Within this database many different models of metabolic pathways are available.  For example, glycolysis pathways from many different authors are offered for E. coli, H. sapiens, L. lactis, S. cerevisiae, sugar cane, and more.  By clicking ‘run’ we can see the pathway, for example for glycolysis in S. cervisiae.  For our studies it is interesting to then compare that to the glycolysis pathway in humans.  The ability to perturb any cofactor, intermediate, or enzyme in the system and see its affect on the entire system reinforces the connections we have been studying all year.  For example, increasing ATP will decrease formation of Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

&lt;big&gt;'''Main Focus:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Being able to model cellular processes on a systems wide level is a labor intensive process.  This article introduces a new tool, the Genome-based Modeling (GEM) System, which makes this task accessible.  It is a tool that simulates cell-wide metabolic pathways using genomic sequence data and other biological information from public repositories.  The genomic sequence data (annotated or unannotated) is used to create a rough metabolic network from publicly available databases and allows for more specific information to be added retrospectively.  The system works by matching coding regions of the genome sequence with reaction stoichiometry for qualitative modeling.  Next, a cell-wide simulation is created using these reactions quantitatively modeled through kinetic equations.  The computer-based model produced allows researchers to simulate and study complex dynamic biological systems, analyzing system-level behavior and testing experimental hypotheses. Most previous models are developed manually and/or focus on small pathways when dealing with dynamic modeling.
An Escherichia coli metabolism model developed by the GEM system achieved 100% coverage of the KEGG database model, 92.38% when compared with the EcoCyc database, and 95.06% when compared with the iJR904 genome-scale model.

;Systems Biology:  The study of the integrated and interacting network of genes, proteins, and biochemical reactions in an organism as a whole.

;Bottom-up Approach:  In this context, refers to beginning the process of molecular modeling with a great amount of expert knowledge and experimental data.  This information is combined to create a coherent model.  

;Top-Down Approach:  Beginning with a complete model and using it to produce specific information. This is the approach taken by GEM by using genomic data to create a basic metabolic network, adding more specific information later.  

;Bottleneck:  This is a process or event which creates a large backup in a system.  Manual modeling of cellular networks has been referred to as a bottleneck in systems biology because it is a slow process that causes a backup in the large amount of information which goes into it.  

;Systems Biology Markup Language (SMBL):  A standard format for systems biology information which is computer-readable.  This format is required for input data in to many different simulation software packages.  The automated output of GEM can be concerted to SBML.

We have discussed how homeostasis within living cells is maintained in a “steady state dynamic”.  This refers to the idea that while the gross composition of the cell stays the same over time, the concentrations of materials in the cell are constantly changing in response to changes in the environment and the needs of the organism.  The GEM systems tool is a way of modeling the dynamic interactions within the cell which correspond to these changes.  This is powerful because, while understanding metabolic pathways is helpful, being able to simulate them and experimentally model their actions under set conditions is extremely useful in research.  

In class and the text we have also been exposed to the KEGG pathway database.  This database models an integrated system of pathways, including the relationships of these pathways to genomic data, chemical building blocks of substances, and networks of interactions and relationships.  GEM uses KEGG as a standard reference.  By stating that their tool achieves 100% coverage when compared with KEGG, they are stating that their tool was able to identify all of the relationships that the KEGG database dose.  Since KEGG is a well accepted resource for this type of information, this comparison signifies that their tools produces significant results.

==Computational Model of In Vivo Human Energy Metabolism During Semistarvation and Refeeding== 

By: Kevin D. Hall
Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 291: E23-E37, 2006. First published January 31, 2006; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00523.2005

Available at http://ajpendo.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/291/1/E23


&lt;big&gt;'''Main Focus:'''&lt;/big&gt;

This paper describes a mathematical model that relates dietary marco-nutrient intake to computed whole body expenditure, de novo lipogeneis, gluconeogenesis, and turnover and oxidation of carbohydrate, fat, and protein.  Using the classic Minnesota human starvation experiment and published in vivo human data the model simulates measured body weight and fat mass changes during semi-starvation and refeeding.  In conjunction with this, unmeasured metabolic fluxes underlying these body composition changes were predicted.  The study also looks at body composition in terms of fat and lean tissue in relation to the in vivo metabolic fluxes that regulate this composition.


&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms:'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Minnesota Human Starvation Experiment:  Performed at the University of Minnesota from November 1944 to December 1945, this experiment is renowned for its comprehensive set of careful measurements taken over an extended duration of precisely controlled feeding.  The goal of the experiment was to investigate the physiological and physiological effects of severe and prolonged dietary restriction and the effectiveness of dietary rehabilitation strategies.   

;Lipolysis: The breakdown of lipids stored in the cell, or the hydrolysis of triacylglycereides to free fatty acids from fats.

;Proteolysis: The breakdown of proteins in the cell. 

;PI: Protein intake rate in kcal/day

;ProtOx: Rate of protein oxidation in kcal/day

;FI: Fat intake rate in kcal/day

;FatOx:  Rate of fat oxidation in kcal/day

;BCM: Body Cell Mass  (in grams)

;CI: Carbohydrate intake rate in kcal/day

;CarbOx:  Rate of carbohydrate oxidation in kcal/day

;RMR: Resting metabolic rate in kcal/day

;ProtOx: Rate of protein oxidation in kcal/day

;Basal metabolic rate (BMR):  The amount of energy normally required by an individual at rest in a neutrally temperature environment. 


&lt;big&gt;'''Connection to Biochemistry Metabolism Course:'''&lt;/big&gt;

As we have studied, the model showed connections between the daily content of body protein, glycogen, and fat and the daily average rates of proteolysis, glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis, respectively.  Based on what we have learned, in the starved state with a lack of these inputs (protein, glycogen, fat) we would expect a increase in proteolysis, a decrease in gluconeogenesis and an increase in glylcolysis, and an increase in lipolysis.  This is exactly what the model showed in the semi-starved state.  In the fed state, or refeeding state of the model, we see the opposite of these conditions.

&lt;big&gt;'''Main Focus:'''&lt;/big&gt;

The goal of this project was to create mathematical models of common mechanisms that occur in metabolic pathways and other biological processes. The authors have developed kMech, a language extension of Cellerator, that models a suite of enzyme mechanisms.  These enzyme mechanisms can be used within mathematical modeling of enzyme-related pathways.  The reaction mechanisms are based on mass action kinetics and each generates a set of elementary reactions that are then translated into ordinary differential equations and association-dissociation reactions that can be solved by Mathematica. The simulations modeled by kMech procude graphic  outputs.  The program can be executed by Mathematica software installed in a Microssoft Windows, MacOS or Linux operating system.   The advantage of kMech over traditional enzyme modeling approaches is that its reaction mechanisms incorporate multiple substrates, products, and regulatory mechanisms.  It is a user-friendly tool which allows biologists to model biochemical pathway without knowledge of the underlying mathematics.

;Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML): A standard format for systems biology information that is computer-readable.  This format is required for input data in to many different simulation software packages.

;Steady-state Velocity Equations:  Equations for enzyme modeling that set the derivatives of the concentrations of each reactant in the model to zero over time. This simplifies a set of non-linear differential equations to linear algebraic equations.

The design of kMech allows it to model many single and multiple substrate enzyme mechanisms such as those we have studied in class, including feedback inhibition by allosteric, competitive and non-competitive mechanisms.  These regulation mechanisms have been a focus of our course.  One example of a model we have studied that falls into the category of allosteric inhibition is fructose 1,6-bisphosphatases inhibition by fructose 2,6-bisphossphate and AMP.

=Overview=

The vast amount of metabolomic information harvested using high-throughput techniques has necessitated an effective means of storage to organize, disseminate, and facilitate analysis and annotation.  This need has driven the development of databases as a repository of metabolomic data being produced.  Data housed in these databases covers the wide-spectrum of research being done in the metabolomic world from NMR spectra to metabolic pathway substrates and products.  

Metabolomic database serve a primary purpose or organizing information on the large catalog of metabolites that are encountered in metabolism pathways. There are many different databases that exist on the World Wide Web and house a wide variety of information covering a large variety of organisms.

==Example Databases==
===Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank===

The [http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/ Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank] (BMRB) focuses on quantitative data generated by spectroscopic investigations of biological macromolecules. It has links to search engines such as PubChem, that connect to recent articles and new data. It also links to projects and other databases that are all related to Metabolomics and Metabonomics. This database focuses on the NMR research aspect of metabolites discovery and what roles they play in metabolism. BMRB offers a large list of different known compounds and the information associated to it.

'''Terms''': 
* Metabonomics (verses Metabolomics): The words 'Metabolomics' and 'Metabonomics' are often used interchangeably, though a consensus is beginning to develop as to the specific meaning of each. The goals of Metabolomics are to catalog and quantify the myriad small molecules found in biological fluids under different conditions. Metabonomics is the study of how the metabolic profile of a complex biological system changes in response to stresses like disease, toxic exposure, or dietary change
* Metabolites: low molecular weight molecules.
* Diamagnetism: A weak repulsion from a magnetic field. It is a form of magnetism that is only exhibited by a substance in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. It results from changes in the orbital motion of electrons. Applying a magnetic field creates a magnetic force on a moving electron in the form of F = Qv × B. This force changes the centripetal force on the electron, causing it to either speed up or slow down in its orbital motion. This changed electron speed modifies the magnetic moment of the orbital in a direction opposing the external field
* Calmodulin: An example of calcium binding regulatory proteins in intracellular signaling pathways. It is highly conserved and abundant in all eukaryotic cells. As a signaling protein, Calmodulin's function is to bind calcium ions and then bind a target protein, affecting its activity. It affects processes ranging from neurotransmitter release to membrane protein organization
* Heuristic:  A method to help solve a problem, commonly informal. It is particularly used for a method that often rapidly leads to a solution that is usually reasonably close to the best possible answer.

'''Relevance''':
This information relates to what we have studied in class because we have been studying metabolism and the metabolites involved. This resource is simply a collection of all the accountable knowledge that exists. The field of metabolomics is growing and with the help of NMR spectroscopy more compounds and metabolites will be discovered along with their functionality. The information studied in class forms the foundation for this knowledge

===Metabolomics: Resources, Reagents, and Kits for Metabolomic Analysis===

===Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database===

The [http://mmcd.nmrfam.wisc.edu/ Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database] contains metabolites determined through NMR and MS.  It contains information with the main focus on Arabidopsis thaliana, but also refers to many different species. The database also contains information on the presence of metabolites under several different physiological conditions, their structures in 2D and 3D, and links to related resource sources and other databases.

'''Terms''':
* Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR):  technique using nuclear magnetic resonance to determine structural information about a molecule.
* Mass spectroscopy (MS): technique that uses the mass-to-charge ratio of ions to determine the composition of a sample.
* Arabidopsis thaliana: the thale cress, a species of plant with a small genome and rapid life cycle that is a model organism in the lab.
* chemoinformatics: the use of computer and informational techniques, applied to a range of problems in the field of chemistry
* Chemical shift: relevant to NMR, chemical shift describes the dependence of nuclear magnetic energy levels on the electronic environment of a molecule.

'''Relevance''': How does this information relate to the information that has been studied in this course to date?
Using this website, it is possible to enter a molecule of interest into the search engine and obtain links that will lead to a list of pathways in which that molecule participates.  Doing this for glucose, two pathways with which were covered in class: starch degradation (aka glycolysis) and glycogen degradation were displayed.

===MetaCyc===

The main focus of the [http://metacyc.org/ MetaCyc Database] is to collect and display information on experimentally studied pathways from a variety of organisms.  Pathways are divided into five categories: biosynthesis, degradation/utilization/assimilation, detoxification, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, and Super-Pathways.  Clicking on any of these will open, in outline format, more specific categories. This eventually leads to individual Metabolomes that are described graphically. There is also descriptions with details about their history and connected pathways.  The database can also be browsed by compounds and reactions, though these sections tend to be less detailed.

MetaCyc allows anyone to submit newly identified pathways, but they unsurprisingly demand detailed, experimentally proven data which is closely examined before any additions are curated.

'''Terms''':
* Superatom: A cluster of atoms that has the same behavior as elemental atoms.
* Prostaglandins: A group of lipid compounds found in a wide variety of tissues that are synthesized from essential fatty acids.  Cells have several receptors for prostaglandins that lead to actions ranging from smooth muscle constriction to increasing spinal neurons' sensitivity to pain.

'''Relevance''': MetaCyc is closely related to the material that we have been learning about in class because it is a comprehensive database that covers many of the same pathways, such as glycolysis I (http://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=GLYCOLYSIS)

===The Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry: Metabolomics Science Webpage===

The main focus of the [http://masspec.scripps.edu/metabo_science/metadbase.php Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry] is to provide a user-friendly websites for scientist in the field of Metabolomics. They provide general information on analytical tools, timelines of Metabolomics history, Metabolomic events held around the world, databases of metabolic systems, as well as bioinformatics software.

'''Terms''':
* Pathophysiology: the physiology of abnormal or diseased organisms or their parts; the functional changes associated with a disease or syndrome.
* Lipidomics: deals with Lipids studying not only their structures, but also functions and modifications occurring during physiological and pathological conditions.
* Exdogenous: of or noting the metabolic assimilation of proteins or other metabolites, the elimination of nitrogenous catabolites being in direct proportion to the amount of metabolites taken in.

* Paraccetamol: The generic name for a common nonprescription medication useful in the treatment of mild pain or fever.
* GC-MS: gas chromatography mass spectrometry
* CE-MS: capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry
* FT-IR: Fourier transform infrared spectrometry

'''Relevance''': This Website relates to the information that we have been studying in class because it is it full of information about pathways and numerous databases. One such database is the KEGG Pathway Database, which contains all the pathways that are involved in metabolism. It shows such pathways as Glycolysis, Gluconeogenesis, Citrate cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, glactose metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, and hundreds more. Click here to check out they glycolysis pathway -&gt; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/map/map00010.html This website does a good job of showing how all the pathways are interconnected into one another.

* Mw +- margin:  A search parameter of KNApSAcK that allows a user to search for 			metabolites within a gram range of a set number.  For example, searching for MW: 100 			with a margin of 2 would return all metabolites with a molecular weight between 98 and 		102 grams.
* Phylum: The fourth taxonomic rank for classifying organisms, between kingdom and 			class.  Cyanobacteria is one phylum.  The database allows searches based on any 			specifying any taxonomic rank, although the higher ones take significant time to load.
* m/z: The mass-to-charge ratio, a physical quantity that is used in the detailed 				examination of charged particles.  It is a key aspect of mass spectrometry studies and the 		database focuses heavily on this data.
		
'''Relevance''': KNApsAcK connects to our coursework because it allows for 	comparison of 	metabolites important to different organisms.  One example search that was	attempted was to see 	the metabolites shared by cyanobacteria and plants for photosynthesis.

===BRENDA===




	
The [http://www.brenda-enzymes.info/ BRENDA] developers boast that it is the main internet repository of 	functional enzyme data of the scientific community.  An extremely robust system, it allows for 	searching of more than 4000 enzymes and provides comprehensive information on each of 	them, including indispensable reaction diagrams. 

'''Terms''':
* ECTree: A term for the outline organization BRENDA uses to characterize related 			enzymes.  An example image of an ECTree for Oxidoreductases from the user manual:
* TaxTree: TaxTree is the interactive display used by BRENDA to search for organisms 			by taxonomy.  Once an organism or taxonomy designation is chosen, all of the enzymes 			in the database linked to it are displayed.
* Substructure Search: The substructure search function allows a user to actually draw 			part of the enzyme structure in skeletal formula.  All enzymes containing the component 		drawn are returned.
* EC Explorer: A search function that allows the user to access enzyme information by a 		several criteria including common name, reaction, and even history.  
* Systematic Name: A style of naming enzymes controlled by the Enzyme condition.  			The enzyme is categorized by four numbers classifying its main class, subclass, sub-subclass and serial number which are all separated by periods.

Relevance: Information on this database is reinforces what was covered in class. Material covered in class also is the foundation for the material on this database

===Reactome===

The [http://www.reactome.org/ Reactome] is a collaboration between Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, The European Bioinformatics Institute, and the Gene Oncology Consortium to provide a curated database that catalogs core pathways and reactions in human biology.  The Reactome obtains information from researchers with expertise in their fields and is cross-validated by an Reactome editorial team which references other databases such as the NCBI, Ensembl, and UniProt.  Alongside the human pathways and reactions the Reactome also contains inferred data from 22 non-human species including mouse, rat, chicken, puffer fish, worm, fly, yeast, two plants and E.coli.

Current versions of the Reactome allow for searching by keyword but also allow a more visual approach by allowing researchers to view a map of much of the data being housed in the database and allowing reactions to be selected and zoomed in on from the top level.

'''Terms'''
* Skypainter tool: A tool provided by the Reactome which allows a list of proteins or gene identifiers to be uploaded to color one of the reaction or pathway maps generated by the database.
* Morbid map: A diagram showing chromosome location of genes that are known to be associated with disease.
* Reactome Author Tool: Desktop application written in Java that is utilized to enter new data into the Reactome.  Use a graphical interface to allow for ease in expanding or adding reactions and pathways.
* BioPAX: an attempt at a common exchange format for biological pathway data.
* SBML: Systems Biology Markup Language; a computer-readable format representing biochemical reaction networks.
* PSI-MI: Proteomics Standards Initiative - Molecular Interactions; A standardized format which described molecular interactions.

'''Relevance''': Much of the data housed in the Reactome database covers many of the pathways and reactions we have covered in the course such as the intermediary metabolism and regulator pathways.  Like many of the other metabolomics database it can be thought of almost like a textbook containing thousands of entries on metabolism and its associated events.

===KEGG Pathway DB===
The [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html KEGG Pathway Database] is a large part of a collection of smaller databases which comprise the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The Pathway database is known for its extensive collection of metabolic pathways and its handling of their interconnections, as well as other non metabolic cellular interactions. The database does an excellent job of integrating genomic, chemical and systemic functional information into an easily readable format.

Instead of new terms, enjoy this list of subsections of the database.
*1.1 Carbohydrate Metabolism 
*1.2 Energy Metabolism 
*1.3 Lipid Metabolism
*1.4 Nucleotide Metabolism 
*1.5 Amino Acid Metabolism 
*1.6 Metabolism of Other Amino Acids 
*1.7 Glycan Biosynthesis and Metabolism 
*1.8 Biosynthesis of Polyketides and Nonribosomal Peptides 
*1.9 Metabolism of Cofactors and Vitamins 
*1.10 Biosynthesis of Secondary Metabolites 
*1.11 Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism

===BMRB, MMCD and the Sesame laboratory module===


Databases have been recently developed as metabolomics resources. Some of the databases that have been designed as metabolomics resources are intended to assist in MS and NMR analyses of relevant research. Among these particular databases are the BioMagResBank (BMRB), Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD) and a module for the Sesame laboratory information management system. 

The BMRB comprises of experimental spectral data for over 270 pure compounds. Each molecule entry includes five or six one- and two-dimensional NMR data sets, as well as compound source information, solution conditions, data collection protocol and the NMR pulse sequences. Database entries can be accessed by name, monoisotopic mass and chemical shift. Currently in development is an open access feature to this database that will allow users to contribute their own data, and substantiate the BMRB. 

The MMCD consists of information on over 10,000 metabolites that primarily consists of data collected from Arabidopsis metabolites. Users may make queries comprising of MS and/or NMR spectra. 

The Sesame laboratory module collects all metabolomics based experimental protocols, background information, and data for a particular study.

===[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1751555 CellCircuits: a database of protein network models]===

General Overview: This article provides a rationale for the development of CellCircuits, an open-	access database that focuses on molecular network models.  The database covers models that 	have been derived computationally and posted in published journal articles.  The article explains 	that the ultimate goal of the project is to bridge the gap between molecular databases, even 	those with unconfirmed data, and strictly regulated pathway databases.  The body of the article 	explores not only the rationale of CellCircuits, but the computational process that went 	into 	developing it and some example results of molecular networks models.

'''Terms''':
* GO Annotation: GO refers to the Gene Ontology project, which is a system of universal 	descriptions of genes across a broad variety of databases.  The developers of CellCircuits have 	used GO to score genes in comparisons across databases.

* Data Processing Pipeline: A pipeline is a construct used to carry data through threads, scripts, 	and processes through a chain of software elements.  CellCircuits uses pipelines to draw text 	information from input models for processing.
* MySQL: MySQL is a database management system that allows users to easily set up multi-	platform systems of data control and is very popular for internet applications, Wikipedia being 	one example.  CellCircuits is built with MySQL.
* Scoring models: Scoring models is a concept that refers to a system for comparison of two 	sets of data.  In  CellCircuits, scoring models are used in conjunction with the GO database to 	compare sets of genes from input models.
*Perl: Perl is a popular procedural programming language heavily derived from C.  The 	primary graphical interface of CellCircuits is written in Perl.

'''Relevance''': This article relates to our coursework because it shows some of the dizzying 	heights of complexity involved in trying to collate the growing body of metabolomics data into 	a usable form for the general science community.

===[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1920535 ProMEX: a mass spectral reference database for proteins and protein phosphorylation sites]===

General Overview – This article explains the development and use of the ProMEX mass spectral 	library database.  The goal of the expanding database is to allow users to compare an unknown 	sample to a body of confirmed mass spectra for known proteins.  The article explores some of 	the theory and algorithms that go into making that possible.

'''Terms''' 
* Metadata: A common database term that refers to the overlying information on an object rather 	than discrete points.  The ProMEX developers use it to refer to the consensus of experimental 	results and mass spectrometric parameters.
* AGI Codes: A uniform system of nomenclature to classify genes that was developed in 1999.  	AGI codes reference the organism, chromosome number, gene, and gene ID.  The 	announcement of the original decision to create the system for Arabidopsis genes can be found 	at: http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/about/agicodes.html
* LC-MS: Liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry is an uncreatively named data gathering 	process that combines the two techniques to allow for highly sensitive detection of specific 	chemicals.  The ProMEX developers use LC-MS to distinguish even closely related samples.
* CLR: Common Language Runtime is a virtual machine developed by Microsoft.  It provides 	an execution environment for software programs on a variety of platforms.  The ProMEX's 	algorithms  for comparing spectra run within the CLR.
Threshold: In comparing the mass spectra of an unknown, user provided sample against those 	in the database, the threshold value is point at which mass spectra hits are ignored because they 	are not considered matching.

'''Relevance''' – ProMEX is a relevant resource to our coursework because it shows 	how quickly the field of metabolomics is advancing.  Using the search algorithms described in 	this article, users can now identify unknown proteins from experimental data in a quick and 	highly automated process.

===[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1686944 Correcting ligands, metabolites, and pathways]===

General Overview – The authors of this article explain that the goal of their database, Biometa, 	is to provide an example of the need to correct inaccurate pathways and chemical structures.  	After originally developing this database, they came up with tools to validate the data it 	contained by stereochemistry and stoichiometric outcomes only to find that they had a high 	error rate.  The article explains the creation of the database and validation tools and the steps 	they took to make corrections.

'''Terms''' 
* Xenobiotics: Chemicals that can be experimentally or clinically detected in an 	organism that 	is not capable of normally producing them, either at all or at the 	concentration 	that they 	appear.  The authors of the article use xenobiotics as an example 	of the staggering intricacy of 	metabolomics.
* Reactants and Products: Although these are not new terms, their use in BioMeta is 	significant because the authors deliberately eschewed use of “substrate,” feeling that it was 	inappropriate for their purposes on the grounds that it can refer to either reactant or product of 	an enzyme and they are only interested in catalyzed reactions. 
* “Fuzzy” Synonyms: To deal with a lack of uniform nomenclature, BioMeta contains 	synonym tables that recognize many common names for compounds or pathways.  If an initial 	search can't locate a synonym, it is referred to a table of fuzzy synonyms that strips out non-	alphanumeric characters and capitalizes all letters for a looser, but still automated, comparison.
* ElemCount: ElemCount is one field used by the BioMeta Compounds data table that covers 	the raw quantity of each element in a compound.  Searches can be made with it specifying a 	minimum or maximum number
* Molfiles: Molfiles are minute structure descriptions of small compounds that can be quickly 	analyzed and validated by the developers' chemical structure software.
* Canonicalization: The concept of recognizing several synonymous data references as a single 	reference.  The validation tools used by the developers make heavy use of canonicalization at 	most steps to reduce repetitive comparisons and false error reports.

'''Relevance''' – This article is relevant to our coursework because it explains the logical 	eventuality that with the incredibly vast amount of metabolomics data and speed at which it is 	growing, errors are inevitable.  The authors offer some insight into how this problem can be 	corrected and the necessity of doing so.

===[http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/35/suppl_1/D521.pdf  HMDB: The Human Metabolome Database ]===
The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) was established in 2004 with the explicit aim to catalog the whole metabolome in humans just as the Human Genome project unraveled the mysteries behind our genetic code.  This paper covers the information contained in the database, which includes compound description, synonyms, physo-chemical structure, disease association, pathways information, and NMR Spectra and MS spectra among other things; each entry in the database contains 90 entries filled with relevant information.  The paper also serves as a design documentation for the database, detailing how it was built with care to allow for efficient searching as well as explaining the quality control and curation of the database. 

The HMDB is built upon a MySQL database that serves as the backend to to the graphical web-page interface.  Raw text found in the database is translated to HTML via special Perl scripts that also generate links and graphics.  The MySQL database is part of a generalized metabolomic LIMS system called MetaboLIMS that utilizes Java to handle input and queries.  

The robustness of the database allows researchers to search from many different angles including by chemical structure, BLAST, single and multiple sequences, MS and NMR spectra, and boolean text searches via GLIMPSE.  

'''Terms'''
* Biomarker: A biochemcal feature that can be used to detect or measure a disease or the effects of a treatment.
* Medical Informatics: A field of information science that primarily deals with the analysis and distribution of medical data through the use of computers.  This data can be applied to different areas of health care and medicine.
* GLIMPSE: Global Implicit Search; an indexing and query scheme for searching file systems.
* SimCell: A metabolic simulation software package which models complex metabolic pathways at the cellular level with real-time movies of the enzymatic process.   These movies can also be graphed by the package.
* Nutrigenomics: The study of how foods interact with genes as to increase the risk factor of chronic disease.

'''Relevance''': The information housed in the HMDB can be traced through all of the coursework that has been covered so far. Many of the metabolites housed in the HMDB were directly discussed in both the textbook and the lectures covered in class.  Of course this is a surface connection between the information the text and this paper as the HMDB and other metabolic databases really encompass the majority of the metabolism world as they serve as as a repository under which all past and future research data can be stored.

===[http://www.genome.jp/kegg/docs/stj.pdf Toward Pathway Engineering: A New Database of Genetic and Molecular Pathways]===
The KEGG database was created with the sole purpose of providing a diagram of molecular and genetic interactions to aid in the understanding of biological systems.  Its creation was fueled in part by the completion of the Human Genome Project as a way to take this massive amount of information and place it in the proper locations in a system. KEGG is connected to DNA and Protein databases by integration with the tool DBGET, which acts to search across databases.  

'''Terms'''
* DBGET: An integrated database retrieval tool to search across databases.
* GenomeNet: A network that establishes a informatics framework for genome research and related areas.
* Φx174: Small virus genome consisting of 11 genes; one of the first viruses sequenced.
* Superfamilies: A classification scheme to group proteins.
* Boehringer wall chart: A classic biological pathway chart.

'''Relevance''': The KEGG database is just another entry in the long line of databases which sum up much of the metabolic pathway information we have learned in class.

The '''Aramaic alphabet''' is an abjad alphabet designed for writing the Aramaic language. As with other abjads, the letters all represent consonants; a few matres lectionis are consonants that also represent long vowels.

The earliest inscriptions in the Aramaic language use the Phoenician alphabet. In time, the alphabet developed into the form shown below. The use of Aramaic as a lingua franca throughout the Middle East from the 8th century BCE led to the gradual adoption of the Aramaic alphabet for writing Hebrew. Formerly, Hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of Phoenician (the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet).

The Hebrew and Nabataean alphabets are little changed in style from the Aramaic alphabet. The development of cursive versions of Aramaic led to the creation of the Syriac, Palmyrenean and Mandaic alphabets. These scripts formed the basis of the Arabic, Sogdian, Orkhon and Mongolian alphabets. Controversially, it is claimed that the Aramaic alphabet may be the forebear of the Indic alphabets.

Today, Biblical Aramaic, Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects and the Aramaic language of the Talmud are written in the Hebrew alphabet. Syriac and Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects are written in the Syriac alphabet. Mandaic is written in the Mandaic alphabet.

== Imperial Aramaic alphabet ==
Redrawn from ''A Grammar of Biblical Aramaic'', Franz Rosenthal; forms are as used in Egypt, 5th century BCE. Names are as in Biblical Aramaic.

The cellular concept of space-divided networks was first developed in AT&amp;T in the 1940's and 1950's. AMPS, an analog frequency division multiplexing network was first implemented in Chicago in 1983, and was completely saturated with users the next year. The FCC, in response to overwhelming user demand, increased the available cellular bandwidth from 40Mhz to 50Mhz.

The second generation (see below) started in the early 1990's with the advent of the Digital European Cordless Telephone (DECT) system, and the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM). Data networks were also developed such as HiperLAN and the IEEE 802.11 working group, which produced the 802.11 legacy standard in 1997. The 802.11a and 802.11b revisions were standardized in October 1999.

The third generation started with the CDMA2000 standard in Korea, and UMTS in Europe and FOMA in Japan. The IEEE 802.16 WiMAX specification was approved in December 2001.

== Wireless Generations ==
It is often instructive to break the history of wireless networking up into several specific generations.

=== First Generation (1G) ===
The 1G wireless generation comprised of mainly analog signals for carrying voice and music. These were one directional broadcast systems such as Television broadcast, AM/FM radio, and similar communications.

=== Second Generation (2G) ===
2G introduced concepts such as TDMA and CDMA for allowing bi-directional communications among nodes in large networks. 2G is when some of the first cellular phones were made available, although communications were restricted to very low bit-rates.

The second generation is frequently divided into sub-sets as well. &quot;2.5G&quot; represented a significant increase in throughput capacity as digital communications techniques became more refined. &quot;2.75G&quot; is another common pseudo-generation that saw an additional increase in speed and capacity among digital wireless networks.

=== Third Generation (3G) ===
3G is the current generation, and represents the combination of voice traffic with data traffic, and the advent of high-bandwidth mobile devices such as PDAs and smartphones. Spectrum Band Freq. varies depending on the mobile technology standard adopted in the system. Current HSDPA deployments support down-link speeds of 1.8, 3.6, 7.2 and 14.0 megabit/s and the HSPA family with up-link speeds up to 5.76 Mbit/s.

=== Fourth Generation (4G) ===
The 4G generation, which is a theoretical future generation, will see the ubiquity of broadband data connections and universal Internet access. These networks, many of which are being designed around the WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) specification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

Over large distances, signal quality is shown to degrade even without the presence of large quantities of AWGN. This degradation is known as '''fading''', and channels that exhibit these properties are known as '''fading channels'''.

== What Causes Fading ==
Fading can be caused by natural weather disturbances, such as rainfall, snow, fog, hail and extremely cold air over a warm earth.  Fading can also be created by man made disturbances, such as irrigation, or from multiple transmission paths, irregular earth surfaces, and varying terrains.

== Fading Channel Models ==

=== Rician Fading ===
=== Rayleigh Fading ===
=== nagami fading ===

== Scales of Fading ==

=== Large-Scale Fading ===
is called frequency selective fading??

=== Small-Scale Fading ===

== Small-Scale Fading Types ==

=== Frequency-Selective Fading ===

=== Flat Fading ===
In flat fading, the coherence bandwidth of the channel is larger than the bandwidth of the signal. Therefore, all frequency components of the signal will experience the same magnitude of fading.

=== Fast Fading ===</text>

Different types of fibres can be used for producing paper. The most well-known is the wood fibre. In the beginning of papermaking mostly fibres from cotton and silk were used. A notorious fibre that at one time was used for producing a specific papergrade was asbestos. Until the late sixties of the 20th century this cancer causing fibre was used to produce asbestos paper. This lead to elevated cancer death rates specially within the group of papermakers, who produced this type of paper.

Different types of plants can and are used for producing paper, like bamboo from China. Phragmites can also be used as raw material for paper, still in the nineties of the 20th century producing paper from phragmites was investigated in Holland.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Wood pulp==
Pulp from wood is the most important raw material for paper. Another, less correct name, which is used for pulp is cellulose.

Wood pulp as raw material is formed after the following treatments:
* Collection of wood as raw material, usually harvesting from production forests, wood from thinning and wood rests from sawmills.
* Sawing, debarking and woodchipping. Bark exist only of small amounts of useful fibres and therefore is used mostly for producing energy and steam. Woodchipping is the conversion of  timber to woodchips.
* Wood defibring 
* Bleaching
* Drying and formation of pulp bales.
This last part of the process is only necessary when the production of paper is not integrated with the production of wood pulp. The last step is necessary when the paper mill is located on a different location than the raw material source.

Hardwood and softwood can both be used to for paper. Usually wood pulp from eucalypt trees is treated as a separate group although it is in fact hardwood, because it has special dimensions (relatively short, but thick), which gives it unique properties.

In some countries paper industry exist without the existence of pulp mills in this country, like Holland. All wood pulp for the production of fine paper is imported.

Typical hardwood used in the paper industry comes from:
*aspen/populus
*birch
*beech
*eucalypt
Typical softwood:
*spruce
*pine
*fir
*larch

Fibres from tropical hardwood trees are not as suitable for production of paper. This is contrary to what people think.

=== Defibring of wood pulp ===
''For this chapter some knowledge about chemistry is required''

Er are two main types for defibring: mechanical or chemical. There exist however also a intermediate. Mechanically defibred pulp is called &quot;wood containing&quot;, whereas chemically defibred pulp is called &quot;woodfree&quot;. Wood containing is misleading, because it only says if lignin is present in substantial amounts. &lt;br /&gt;
Wood consists besides of fibres also of ligin. Lignin functions as binder between the individual fibres in the tree and needs to be removed or treated so it can be turned into pulp.

Pulp, as is, is usually only used for chemically defibred fibres, but the mechanical defibring is also mentioned here.

==== Mechanical pulping process====
The first method we consider is stone groundwood.&lt;br&gt;

The stem of a tree is pushed onto a turning ground stone. This process leads to a lot of heat formation, which is why the wood needs cooling. The high temperature attenuates the ligning (which is the binding component between the fibres), which is why the individual fibre is freed. Part of the fibres is not only freed but is also shortened.

|}
The second defibring method is pressure groundwood.&lt;br&gt;
Almost the same as stone groundwood, the only difference is the elevated pressure under which the process takes place. Due to the higher pressure the temperature can be higher as well, which causes a more thorough weakening of the lignin structure.

The third defibring method is thermo groundwood.&lt;br&gt;
This process is performed with atmosferic pressure. The temperature is elevated and kept at a high temperature. Warm wood is used in stead of cold wood.

The fourth defibring method is RMP, ''refiner mechanical pulp''.&lt;br&gt;
First wood is chipped and then lead into a refiner. A refiner consists of plates on which knives are mounted. The plates turn with high speed and is pressured against a stationary plate, so that the fibre during contact with plates or knives is pulled out of the wood.
Hier wordt gebruik gemaakt van gechipt hout. Het hout wordt in een refiner geleid. Een refiner bestaat uit een of meer platen met messen erop. De platen draaien en drukken hierbij tegen een stilstaande plaat, waarbij de vezel bij contact met de platen en messen uit het hout wordt getrokken.

The fifth defibring method is CRMP, ''chemical refiner mechanical pulp''.&lt;br&gt;
Actually this is a method which is between mechanical and chemical defibring. Before the chips are feed into the refiner they are treated with sufite of bisulfite. This causes the fibre to be stronger compared to other mechanical methods. The efficiency of the process is alas lower so that a lower proportion of the wood is turned into pulp.

The sixth defibring method is TMP, ''thermo mechanical pulp''.&lt;br&gt;
The chips are preheated before it is feed into the refiner.

Thee seventh defibring method is is CTMP, ''chemo thermo mechanical pulp''.&lt;br&gt;
The chips get besides pretreatment with heat also a pretreatment with chemicals like sulfite. This pulp is regarded as the best wood containing mechanical pulp.

This last methode is also called &quot;semi-chemical&quot; and is the transistion from mechanical to chemical pulp.


&lt;/div&gt;

== Overview ==

'''''Geminio''''' is a spell used to duplicate things.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The verbal component of this spell is based on the word Gemini, which is the English form of the zodiac symbol for &quot;the twins&quot;. It is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to duplicate the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] in the Ministry of Magic, so that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] will not be aware that it has been taken from her.

== Analysis ==

Note that this spell is similar, but not identical, to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gemino|Gemino]] curse.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#This spell duplicates objects, so why is this spell not used much in the books? For example, in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', Harry, Ron, Hermione, Percy, Ginny, Fred and George all need a complete set of Lockhart books for Hogwarts. Seven sets of books were bought, but Mrs. Weasley presumably could have bought one set, and cast this spell to make seven complete sets for the price of one.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

=== Re: why did Molly not use it? ===

The question has been asked, why don't wizards use Geminio to twin objects that they need more of? Of course, this is never answered directly in the book, but there is implication that either the copy just isn't good enough, or there is some form of magical rights management, akin to Muggle DRM or copy protection.

Taking the latter case first: We have already seen that some spells can be countered; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Alohomora|Alohomora]] can be blocked, as we see in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] has locked her door in a manner that makes it impervious to that spell, and we see in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that some objects, notably the Sword of Gryffindor, are unaffected by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Accio]]. It is to be expected that someone like Gilderoy Lockhart, concerned as he is with his own fame and profits, would have protected his books with a spell to prevent copying. Bookstores like Flourish and Blott's, of course, would be all in favour of such a spell, as they could not stay in business if their wares were copied indefinitely.

There is also the inferred &quot;not good enough&quot; issue. When Hermione uses the Geminio charm to create a duplicate of the locket, she says that she believes the copy will be good enough to fool Umbridge. This quite strongly suggests that even a witch as technically competent as Hermione cannot use the spell to create an identical copy. It is also mentioned that the copies produced by the similar [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gemino|Gemino curse]] are worthless. So if, as suggested, Mrs. Weasley were to use Geminio to replicate textbooks, the new textbooks might be as unusable as the end results of the failing Weasley spell-checking quill near the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] – the text might be present but scrambled, or the books might be solid blocks that only appear to be books, for instance.

'''Duplex Networks''', or networks where data travels in both directions between two nodes, pose the problem of needing two channels to communication between two nodes, instead of just one for a broadcast networks.

== Overview ==

'''''Flagrate''''' is used to mark things, such as doors, with a flaming mark of some sort.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

As they enter the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and his companions find themselves in an antechamber with a number of identical doors, that seem to spin around every time a door is closed. As a result, it is impossible to tell which doors have already been tried. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] uses this spell to mark each door they try, until they find the correct one.

== Analysis ==

Despite the similarity in names, this spell seems to be not particularly similar to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flagrante|Flagrante]] curse.

Presumably this is the spell that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] used when visiting the Dursleys at the Hut on the Rock.

;Volley:usually deflecting the ball at the net.

;Serve:usually an overhand hit used to get the ball in play.

;Forehand:a hit with the inside of the hitting hand facing the court, almost always a one-handed shot.

;Backhand:a hit the back of the hitting hand facing the court.  Can be a one or two-handed shot.  The two-handed backhand, though difficult for some, if mastered, offers good power, direction, and spin.  The one-handed backhand offers power, speed, and flexibility.

;Racquet:the stringed bat used to hit the tennis ball.

;Backspin:when the ball is literally spinning backwards while traveling forwards.  Produces a low bounce and/or less forward motion after the bounce.

;Topspin:when the ball is spinning forward while traveling forward.  Usually produces a high bounce.

;Slice:hitting the ball with left or right side spin, produces a low or sideways bounce.

;Rally:hitting the ball back and forth.

2. You get two attempts to get the ball in play when serving.  If the ball goes directly out or hits the net and lands out, the first serve is lost and you have a second serve attempt.  If the 2nd serve does not land in play, the receiver gets the point.  If either the 1st or 2nd serve hits the net but goes over and lands in the correct service box, it is a &quot;let&quot; and the serve is taken over again.

3. When rallying, in order to get a &quot;point,&quot; the ball can either bounce at least twice in the court, once in the court and once anywhere else (including stationary objects not on the court), or the hitter can may hit the ball directly out or into the net and lose the point.

4. No double hitting; one player cannot hit the ball more than once or two doubles partners cannot each hit the ball.

==Scoring System==

All scores are announced with the server's score first.  Thus, a 0-40 score means the server has 0 points, the receiver has 40 and could win on the next point.  Under normal circumstances, the point after 40 wins the game, unless both players have 40 (&quot;deuce&quot;), in which case advantage scoring starts

0&lt;br&gt;
15&lt;br&gt;
30&lt;br&gt;
40 - &quot;Deuce&quot; if both players have 40&lt;br&gt;
Ad - Short for &quot;advantage.&quot;  If the server scores a point from deuce, the score is Ad-In or Advantage-In.  If the receiver scores the point, the score is Ad-Out.  The first player who scores from their advantage wins the point.  If the opposite player scores, the score goes back to deuce.  Some people play with no-ad scoring where the next point after deuce wins.

== Rollbacker status ==

After reading the policies I am still not sure what Rollbacker status quite is. Could you explain? Thanks, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 22:50, 24 January 2008 (UTC)
:Rollback will allow you to revert the top edit of some user ''and all consecutive edits prior to that by the same user''. As such, it's suited ''only'' to reverting clear vandalism. This can be done in other ways (Twinkle, or simply undoing the edits manually) but this method is faster for the user. Can you suggest how [[Help:Editing#Rollback|Wikibooks:Rollback]] could be improved to be more informative? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:11, 24 January 2008 (UTC)
::It has a ton of just ''words'', but it's too complex. Over at WP they have the &quot;policy in a nutshell&quot; feature which would make WB policies easier to understand, I think. While I'm at it, though, could you look over the entry for a VEI 9 that I put in over at [[Volcanoes]]? I found it in a book, ask questions if you need to. I'm beginning to satisfy myself with the state of [[Volcanoes]] but not totally :). Cheers, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 00:25, 25 January 2008 (UTC)
:::Well some of it isn't relevant to how the tool actually works - just the paragraph on rollback. In essence, all you need to know is that you can only use it for vandalism, and it will undo from the top revision all consecutive edits of a single user. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:41, 26 January 2008 (UTC)
:::I fixed up [[Help:Editing#Rollback|Wikibooks:Rollback]] and [[Wikibooks:Dealing with vandalism]]. They should be much more helpful now. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:21, 27 January 2008 (UTC)
::::It is clearer, yes, but there is still a lot of jargon in it. For example &quot;contribs page&quot; – I know immediately what you mean, but the term should be defined: &quot;For each user there is a contributions page, accessible by...&quot; Also, the admin-only section about bot marking should have an &quot;admin-only&quot; header of some sort to cut down the confusion. One other thing is that you say &quot;in this case you should probably use the delete template&quot; without adequately defining what the case is. The Rollback tool is pretty simple, so it doesn't require a huge write-up, and though I've used it only twice, I have a decent idea what it does. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:38, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

==Thanks==

For fixing the NC on the Movie making manual.  When I had the list down to 3 last year some time, that was one one the ones I dreaded looking at.  While we're talking about Naming Convention I wanted to ask your opinion on the programming books.  Techinally I don't think all of these break the Naming Convention.  However I think that they shouldn't have a colon in their title, becuase we use this for namespaces such as wikijunior...  I was wondering about proposing a change to the naming convention which says that colons are disallowed in titles.  What do you think? --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 10:23, 26 January 2008 (UTC)
:Yeah, the programming books are on my list. I talked about them a while back (look in my archives) and we decided that instead of being Programming:Language/Chapter they should be Language Programming/Chapter. This is mostly because there is no single book &quot;Programming&quot; with sections on all these different languages - they're entirely separate books. You're right though, I don't think they technically violate it. I don't think we need a new policy proposal to deal with colons in the title; we can just change the title. As well, there may be books with titles like (making one up at random) &quot;Terrorism: A scourge upon the Earth&quot; where the colon is legal as it denotes that the 2nd part is a subtitle, not a chapter. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:38, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

== yes... ==

i saw it. But the definition + the toc is actually a lot more than a lot of Wikiversity pages unfortunately. So in that sense, it might not be bad on Wikiversity and then geared more towards Wikiversity's mission. --[[User:Remi|Remi]] ([[User talk:Remi|talk]]) 17:22, 27 January 2008 (UTC)
:Fair enough. Let us know if/when you have it transwikied please. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:57, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Advanced Interactive Media Class ==

I already sent the email, so I don't think you need to send another one quite yet. Either way, I don't think we need to delete this book, and we likely should undelete the Future Media Class book as well (so we can reformat it properly).

This just goes to show that the differences between WB and WV can be vanishingly small, and sometimes the only difference is the way in which the material is titled. 

I'm too busy to go into a mad day-long editing frenzy on this book (I wish I could, because my wiki muscle needs the exercise), but I will try to help out a little bit here and there when I can spare the time. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:08, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
:heh. Too late; me too. I think a rename is in order for both books. I've already started a VFU for [[Future Media Class]], as both were intended to be textbooks. It's just that the students went of the rails a bit, and the teacher wasn't watching. This is unfortunate; perhaps we should do more to encourage class projects to a) let us know they're out there, b) plan things out better and c) ask for help from the community. /me thinks about such things for a while. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:14, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

== help with copyright ==

Hi Mike,

I am a new user although the class I am now teaching has been writing Wikibooks for some time (ECI 301 at Old Dominion University). I followed the information provideed on the website for getting permission to use the image I posted. It doesn't list what type of license they are operating under, but I did email the author to try and find out. 

Here's the info from the website:http://www.phdcomics.com/about.htm

Maybe you'd be able to advise me.

Can I use one of your comics in my thesis/defense/website or graduate student newsletter?
We'll be happy to grant you permission, but you MUST e-mail us at questions(at)phdcomics.com to let us know how and which strips you are using (by sending this email, you obtain official permission to use the images). In all cases, the strips must have the following text printed next to them:

&quot;Piled Higher and Deeper&quot; by Jorge Cham

:Unfortunately licensing like &quot;used with permission&quot; is not permitted here. If you can get the image re-licensed under a free license, then you can use it here. Your other option is to claim fair use (see [[WB:MEDIA]] for how to do this), though this is strongly discouraged. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:26, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
::I have posted a sample Wiki article for my students to use as a sample and from which they can borrow code for the articles they will write over the next three weeks. In my sample article, I have included this image which I am &quot;using with permission&quot;. I have already stated in my sample article that I will remove it once the students have finished their final articles and it will not become part of the official text book. This seems to me like a decent rationale for fair use - using it temporarily for the education of students. Can I claim fair use and keep the image until my students have finished creating their articles? [[User:Jenniferjkidd|Jenniferjkidd]] ([[User talk:Jenniferjkidd|talk]]) 03:27, 30 January 2008 (UTC)
:::That is absolutely ''not'' a valid rationale for fair use, but I can't delete the image on those grounds for seven days after upload, which means you'll probably get away with it. If this module is an example for your students to follow, I can only envision the headache when they all start uploading images which aren't allowed on Wikibooks. Please replace the image with a freely-licensed one. [[commons:|Commons]] is a huge repository of freely-licensed images, and [http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/ flikr] allows you to search for images licensed under CreativeCommons licenses (no-derivatives and non-commercial are not permitted!); there is no shortage of freely-licensed images to use.

::::Thanks for working with me on this issue. Help me to understand why this would not be a rationale for fair use. I have been presenting information on my class related to copyright and fair use i.e. I am trying to do the right thing.

:::::Fair use elsewhere might be permitted, but Wikibooks has rules which restrict fair use for this website. Our requirements are similar to that of [[w:|Wikipedia]], and are enumerated at [[WB:MEDIA]]. I think this image falls short on points 1 (&quot;Free license or public domain alternatives aren't available&quot;) and 5 (&quot;Deleting a non-free media file would render a book unusable&quot;). There are plenty of other single-panel comics that you could use, and that page could survive without ''any'' image there. If you want something very similar, I suggest you search flikr; Commons is unlikely to have a suitable replacement. Alternatively, you can ask the community at Commons to create a replacement. There's no reason that some artist couldn't create a comic to replace the one you've chosen. Since that page is an example, just about any image would serve the same purpose there, and again, no image whatsoever wouldn't render the example unusable. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:44, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
::::::I see you've visited the page where my illegal picture is shown. I have two sections of a course contributing to this Wikibook. I showed one group my sample page on Friday and the other will see it tomorrow. So far, my mistake is serving as an example of what not to do and in that case may be more powerful that a correct example. So, the fact that this happened has turned into a good teachable moment for my students. I will let the image get deleted as scheduled and this will provide yet another good example of the repercussions of choosing an image which is not public domain or free license. 

::::::Can you explain your other point? I should tell students to use Wiki markup instead of html? I tried searching for Wiki codes and had much less success. Html codes seem to work fine.

Wikimarkup is generally easier to learn, and more flexible than html; that's why we use it. Much html will work as expected, but there are some things which won't.

== About uploading image (Megauniversity-Turkey) ==

Dear,

Thanks a lot for recoverying our site at that time. I really enjyoed my first experience to create a book with peers.

I wanna ask one question, as my format of licence notification of an image was wrong, you deleted. I uploaded again and revised the format of this notification. I wonder whether this version fill the requiement or not.
The resource(white version)is provided as free licence and free for editingou , thus I created the image with editing this one..... 

I am afraid but if you think my format in this time is also not good, would you let me know??

Thank you for your initial help.               From Yoko (g096016-wikiID)

== Trademarks as usernames ==
I saw your post at [[User:Hyundai|Hyundai]] [[User_talk:Hyundai|talkpage]] and even if I understand the rational and reasons for it I noticed that you didn't include any reference to a policy about the issue, is there one? (The question is that failing to be clear and have a common ground for making such request could become problematic. I personally don't see a problem in a use choosing to actively promote or even demote a trademark, logging as I_hate_MS or Hyundai_fan or a myriad of possible &quot;well behaviored&quot; alias, even extending this into the political activism field without being crass or abusive of others, corporations, or other types of non personal entities shouldn't receive the same protection status, and will not react emotionally to any statement).

The best a quick search revealed on the subject was [[Wikibooks:No offensive usernames]] (rejected) and [[Wikipedia:Username policy]] (that is not enforcible here). I agree that using exact trademarks should be abolished but do not agree with that the promotional side you mentioned on the post should be a problem...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:19, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
:Well, as I said, it is my personal opinion, not policy (though I strongly believe it should be). You're correct, there's no policy or guideline I'm aware of, save common decency. As for corporations not getting hurt feelings, I'm actually ''delighted'' to hear someone other than myself make the claim that corporations are not people. That said, their trademarks should still be respected. However, my main concern with that username (and the one I blocked erroneously, as you can see a few sections up) is from a conflict of interest standpoint. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:46, 5 February 2008 (UTC)

::The &quot;request&quot; to the user is a bit heavy handed. You aren't clear that it only reflects your personal view point and that you are open to be challenged on the issue. Remember that you start referring to a block and then mention that he otherwise will lose his edits attributions.  It was that stance that made me question the bases for a request on those terms.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:08, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
:::&quot;I was about to&quot; implies that I considered and rejected that option. &quot;You're more than welcome to continue contributing&quot; and &quot;Please ask...&quot; are not particularly heavy-handed, I don't think. Considering that this user is editing modules concerning products manufactured by Hyundai, I think there's ample reason to be concerned about the username. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:18, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
::::I understood the text but again state that it is not clear if the use is obliged to comply to it. the &quot;You're more than welcome to continue contributing&quot; isn't clear if after the change or even if he doesn't change the alias for instance.
::::I only calling your attention that it can have other interpretations and that your concerns beyond a use of a trademark in itself aren't understood and probably shared. I haven't read his edits and have only patrolled some pages about bicycles (I don't even know if Hyundai builds those) but in any case I see the name/content relation non problematic (beyond what I already stated and you agreed) as for the content any conflict of interests that could rise would fall inside the NPOV rule of the contributions. Would you consider a conflict of interest if you stated contributing to a book about lifeguards ? or is your preoccupation not on the alias he uses but on neutrality of the content ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:37, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
:::::No, because &quot;Lifeguard&quot; doesn't imply partisanship. If my username was &quot;Lifesaving Society&quot; or &quot;JEA&quot; or &quot;Red Cross&quot; or somesuch, then yes, there'd be a problem. NPOV is a separate issue. If I had the username &quot;Lifesaving Society&quot; and I were writing about lifeguarding, then there would be a conflict of interest (or at least the appearance of one) independently of whether my contributions were neutral, verifiable, etc. Similarly, I could write without a neutral POV on lifeguarding with any other name which doesn't imply partisanship (such as &quot;Mike.lifeguard&quot;). So yes, the NPOV issue arises, but it's separate from any COI issue with respect to a username (though the username issue may indicate a NPOV problem, and usually does).
:::::I hesitate to call it a &quot;preoccupation&quot; but my concern is both. Usernames often reveal a conflict of interest. In the case you see above, I was way off-base, and there was no COI whatsoever. In this case, there probably isn't either (so I didn't block). Nevertheless, even the ''appearance'' of a COI should be scrupulously avoided. If these concerns aren't shared, that's fine, but IMO a Bad Thing.
:::::I'm off to bed; feel free to amend my message to [[User:Hyundai]] if you like. Since you're the second person to take issue with my thinking here in as many days, I won't be pressing the issue, and consider it closed. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:55, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
::::::Ok I'll post below you and state that he is free to keep the name but should at least consider an alias change or clarify his position in is user page and will attempt to make a point about NPOV.
::::::We are all busy and sometimes time doesn't lend it self to be used in details and we can be misunderstood, I still have problems with the distinctions you make on invested interests but I don't see how there could be any harm to Wikibooks without violating the NPOV rule.  
::::::I could debate the issue more with you. Will add just this: Users here tend to be anonymous, even making assumptions about a username can be dangerous and appearances are often deceiving, by policy we should expect all to have the best intentions, it is far more probable that one with bad intentions would use guile and subterfuge for such functions.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:51, 5 February 2008 (UTC)

== Subject Page Updating ==

Shouldn't this page [[Subject:Languages]] update automatically? Currently it contains a lot of Arabic module pages for no apparent reason. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 12:57, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
:Yes, the lists are dynamic, however caching may cause out-of-date information to be displayed. Try purging the server cache by appending ?action=purge to the URL for the page like this: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Subject:Languages?action=purge As well many books are categorized &quot;improperly&quot; so that all modules appear. The solution is to re-categorize the modules, ensuring that only the top page has the category corresponding to the Subject: page. This often involves bot work. If you leave a list of books which appear on Subject: pages incorrectly, I can have a go later in the week. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:53, 5 February 2008 (UTC)

== And another one ==

After seeing your conversation with Panic above, I thought I'd look through some of your other contribs. From what I could tell without actually undeleting, the contribs of [[User:Freemoneybuy]] were not necessarily bad faith either. Bad use of naming convention? Yes. Contemptuous subject? Well, I would say so, but who am I to judge! Looks like you blocked him and mass deleted his contribs because you disapproved of the subject he was writing about. 

I'm not fond of that way of making money, but (a) it's not illegal, and (b) it might be interesting to know how people do that (since I am often perplexed by keyword-laden spams and websites). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:59, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
:You might want to look at the content of those pages, as there's nothing particularly objectionable there. However, they were all dumps of wikihow content, which is GFDL-incompatible. Furthermore, freemoneybuy is one of those stupid sites which is a regularly associated with spam and is basically running a fraud scheme.

== Tremblantchat copyright problems.  ==

Hi Mike.  I thought I might let you know about something regarding your Tremblant page.  Recently a website called www.tremblantchat.com was added to the links.  There is a problem with this website and their teenage owners.  

I own/run www.tremblant-insider.com  The main owners of tremblantchat were banned from my website after they maliciously attacked a members sexuality.  It was bad.  They signed up under names like &quot;russsuckscock&quot; JBtakesitintheass&quot; etc.  So I had to ban them for life.  It got really really bad.  

So because of this they came up with tremblantchat.com to basically trash my site.  They have stolen pictures and videos of mine, and trademarks.  Not a good group of kids to be listed on your site.  I thought you should know this.

Dear Mike,

I am doing the porting, page by page  (it was me who wrote those pages in the first place!!)

I am not able to use Transwiki, therefore I am in the middle of the porting. It is time consuming, but it offers me the opportunity of revising the material, completing it and adding a few pages that were still missing in the Wikipedia version.

Please leave me the necessary time, and remove the Transwiki stuff for clock recovery in the meantime (I do not know how to do that!!!)

==Character names==

Collecting character names has been my passion for several years. Sometimes I'll go through baby name popularity lists for a country (such as Canada, France, Sweden or Japan) and add all the names to that ehtnicity's list. I'll often scour through lists of people in a certain country or ethnic group (such as an Italian donor list, a list of students at a Lithuanian university, a list of Sierra Leonean terrorism victims or the membership list of an Iranian club) and figure out the most common names, adding them all to my lists. For surnames the U.S. census' list is helpful -- I just have to do research to figure out which name fits into which ethnic group. Baby name books are also a source. Ciao!

Hi Mike,
I am unsure if I'm doing this correctly, so please forgive my ignorance.  You asked for the information regarding [[:Image:ChefFredSalad.jpg]]. I found the photo on the Wiki Commons page and from there, in a gov't site.

== Two books we're adapting to fit community guidelines more appropriately. ==

Mike,  

As time allows, I'm editing in Future Media and Advanced Interactive Media Books to better comply to wikibook guidelines.  Thanks for changing the names for both books right away.

I'm using this link: http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&amp;contribs=user&amp;target   to search my student's edits for each of these books.  Is there a way I can enter a student's user ID and see every edit a particular student has made in ONE wikibook?  I'm going module by module so far and it's tedious.  Part of their class grade is based on wiki edits so I don't want to miss anything once they've logged in.

Any suggestions?

PS
Will your feedback show up only in your &quot;talk&quot; pages or on mine as well?  I want to learn how to use this wiki communication feature, but don't want to miss your feedback.

Don Eland   doneland@oru.edu &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:AiClassEland|AiClassEland]] ([[User talk:AiClassEland|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/AiClassEland|contribs]]) 21:06, February 10, 2008.&lt;/small&gt;
:You can click the ''watch'' tab on the top of this page to add it to your watchlist. Then, in the top right corner there is a ''[[Special:Watchlist|my watchlist]]'' link, which will show you edits to pages on your watchlist; you can use this feature to see when I make edits to this page, such as this reply.
:There is no way of getting that information from the software as-is, but there is at least one workaround. Again in the top right, there is a ''[[Special:Preferences|my preferences]]'' link. There, you can click the ''Gadgets'' tab, check off ''Logs filter'' and hit save at the bottom. On certain pages (including [[Special:Contributions]]) you'll get a ''filter'' tab at the top of the page. You can then filter or highlight the results on the page. So if you enter the title of a module, and filter, you'll see only their edits to that module. Unfortunately, this may not work with all browsers (it is tested to work in [[w:Firefox|Firefox]]).
:Another method is to use one of several tools hosted on the [[m:Toolserver|toolserver]]. [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php Contributors] can approximate the effect you want, using the ''group by contributor'' option. Specify ''en'' for language and ''wikibooks.org'' for the project along with the module name. Note that this tool uses an out-of-date copy of the wiki, which is currently about 1.5 weeks behind the current state of Wikibooks.
:Hope one of those will work for you. If not, come on back &amp; we'll try to figure something out.
:Last thing: Please sign messages on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); the software will automatically turn that into a signature and timestamp so it's easy to see who said what and when. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:27, 10 February 2008 (UTC)
:Sorry, the toolserver tool doesn't do what you want - it will just list how many edits a certain user has done to a particular page. I don't think there is another tool which does what you want. But perhaps we should find someone to make one for this purpose... &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:28, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

== Formating options for print version ==
Where to find the list of formating options for a print version? Simple question: how to set a page breack?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{earthquakes header}}

According to [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/earthquake Wiktionary], an earthquake (synonym &quot;quake&quot;) is &quot;a shaking of the Earth, caused by volcanic activity or movement around geologic faults&quot; or &quot;a natural disaster.&quot; This, indeed, comprehensively covers all written about earthquakes. However, you should learn something about this phenomenon's geography.
Most earthquakes occur along tectonic plate boundaries, although one of the worst earthquakes of all time was in Missouri, in 1811. It was felt even in Washington, D.C.</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Removed the broken &quot;regex&quot; solution ==

The shortest proper regex solution for this problem looks something like [http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html].  Anything shorter than this is not matching &quot;an email address&quot;.  I removed the broken solution until someone figures out what should actually go in here, because in fact, regex solutions in javascript are almost always the wrong solution for this. --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] ([[User talk:RandalSchwartz|talk]]) 00:33, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
:And I had to remove a second broken solution.  Please. People.  Read, and use your head. --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] ([[User talk:RandalSchwartz|talk]]) 02:53, 25 February 2008 (UTC)
:I spent a long time researching this subject, and am now comfortable with the results, feel free to use the regex I produced in the end, and use the article as citation... &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm2k.com/posts/what-is-a-valid-email-address What is a valid email address]&lt;/ref&gt; --[[Special:Contributions/82.152.138.226|82.152.138.226]] ([[User talk:82.152.138.226|talk]]) 12:23, 6 June 2008 (UTC)
::A regular expression of about 600 characters in length is all that's needed to validate an email address according to the RFC 5322 specification. It's certainly not impossible, despite what the article claims.

== WTF?  ==

&quot;This means that the best way to detect whether an email address is valid is to simply send it an email.&quot;
That section is completely useless and dump. I am voting for removing it.</text>

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Gemino''''' is a protective curse; cast on an object, it makes that object multiply repeatedly when it is touched.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}
The verbal component of this spell is based on the word Gemini, which is the English form of the zodiac symbol for &quot;the twins&quot;.

According to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], it is apparently fairly common for valuable items in the vaults at Gringotts to be protected with the Gemino and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flagrante|Flagrante]] curses. The former causes the touched item to produce multiple copies of itself, thus confusing the burglar into taking the valueless copies.

== Analysis ==
Note the similarity to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Geminio|Geminio]] charm, which produces a single replica of the object it is cast upon.

== Overview ==

The '''''Flagrante''''' curse causes an object to become unbearably hot when touched.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

According to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], it is apparently fairly common for valuable items in the vaults at Gringotts to be protected with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gemino|Gemino]] and Flagrante curses. The latter causes the touched item to become unbearably hot, so that the burglar cannot hold onto his ill-gotten gains.

Despite the similarity in names, this spell has very little in common with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flagrate|Flagrate]] spell.

This Cultural Anthropology textbook is a very new one (As of Feb 4, 2008), and I would like to encourage any and all people knowledgeable of Cultural Anthropology to modify this textbook in any way they see fit, or add comments on this page.

Before getting started please review the following 

[[Help:Editing]] for details on how to edit and format additions

and [[Wikibooks:Guidelines_for_class_projects]] for basic information about logging in etc.


Feel free to create new topics and headings or collapse/move sections as you think best. Those that are there but have no details filled in are just someones ideas. If you have better ideas change it.


Note on Images and wikipedia links

Large images are useful in Anth texts because they allow the reader to appreciate the detail that people go to to create meaning, the detail contributes to the readers understanding of the values and choices of a culture as well as hilighting potentially unfamiliar details, textures, what activities are occurring in the background etc. Larger images are preferred, specifically for the purpose of making the text more comparable to commercially available texts, many high quality images are available in wikimedia commons. 

Links to wikipedia. For the most part in wikibooks the preference is to make the content stand alone with fewer links to wikipedia. However in the case of an introductory textbook the links to wikipedia function as a glossary for the introductory text so as students encounter a new term they can, with a single click, find the definition and encyclopedic content to explain the concept. This is a valuable learning tool that should remain in the text.

== Welcomes and help ==

Congratulations on a fast growing book. I wouldn't be surprised to see it amongst our [[WB:FB|featured books]] before long.

I've been adding [[Template:Bigwelcome|welcome messages]] to some of the contributors of this wikibook. This provides a number of useful links to help users learn more about the Wikibooks project. I haven't been very methodical; I've just added it when I've seen valuable contributions (and I've only noticed contributions to a small part of this book).

I'm currently trying to improve the Wikibooks documentation and would be particularly interested to hear any comments on whether you find the [[Help:Contents|help pages]] and this template useful, or if something is missing or could be done better.

If you think the welcome message is of value, you can actually add it too! Just place &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Template:bigwelcome|bigwelcome]]}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; on the recipient's [[Help:Talk page|talk page]]. Other versions are available in the [[:Category:Welcome templates]].

Happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:43, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

==References and Content==


Write information in your own words based on your understanding of concepts.

Do not cite 'about.com' or other low quality web info as your source in the wikibook. Also please avoid quoting the textbook.

As a simple alternative try these
1)
search for your topic at http://www.anthrosource.net (you have access to abstracts and many full texts, without even using the library).
2)
in Google scholar http://scholar.google.com/ - combine your topic term with anthropology and see what articles come up.
3)
use information in wikipedia, although the quality is only as good as you make it.
4) 

An excellent link to definitions of terms as well as full online ethnographies is available at 
http://www.anthrobase.com/ 

In all cases write it in your own words to avoid plagiarism.

It is easiest to copy the markup for images already used in wikipedia articles, they are formatted for size, location and often have captions and citations (although if there are links in the caption they may need to be removed or redirected to wikipedia) OR if you cant find the image you want look and browse from here
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Photographs

Also remember the focus is quality not quantity, write as much as you think others will want to read.

The kids are supposed to make the car.
You show $8k worth of tools there!!!!! (unsigned by 72.224.35.94 from Herndon  VA)

:Not by a long shot. Hub tool = $10; Wheel shaver = $35; axle press = $16; Body too; $12, Wheel polish = $10; Micromesh sandpaper = $10; Rotary tool (already had it) = $100; bench vise (had it) = $20, metal polish (had it for years) $3. So that's about $220 and $120 of that is general tools. I spent twice that for helmets and pads last fall. My sons helped straighten and polish the axles but I did the wheel shaving since that involves a razor blade. I also helped another dad and his son (who had been disappointed in previous years) with their car. My son took first and the scout I helped took second (beating my other son). All cars ran fast and no scout (including tiger) had a disappointing &quot;lemon&quot;.  Priceless. --[[User:Kkmurray|Kkmurray]] ([[User talk:Kkmurray|talk]]) 23:29, 7 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Goats kid after a 150 day gestation, usually at night. Immediately before kidding, the udders become quite hard, and the doe will &quot;nest&quot; in part of the barn, shunning the company of the other goats and often chasing them off.

During labor, the doe makes a distinct grunting noise.

First-time dams sometimes resist nursing. If the doe refuses to let the kids nurse, try holding her and talking to calm her down. If she hasn't allowed the kids to nurse for over an hour, tie her or put her in the milkstand and put the kids under the teats while holding the back legs down. Once she starts nursing, most does will adjust quickly.

If temperatures are below freezing in the barn, be sure to dry the kids' ears, since they are the most vulnerable to freezing. In very cold weather, provide a hot water bottle, wrapped in a towel, in a sheltered spot for them to sleep. If the barn is drafty, put the water bottle in a large cardboard box: preferably large enough to accommodate the dam as well.

To check if the kids are nursing, put a finger in its mouth. If the mouth is warm or hot, the kid has nursed. If the mouth is cold, it may be necessary to milk an ounce or two from the doe and bottle feed the kid either in the house or while holding it inside your jacket to bring its body temperature up. Give any leftover milk to the dam.

Keep the dam and kids in a separate pen. The dam will let you know when she is ready for the company of the other goats. As a rule, keep the dam and kids out of the herd for at least 2 days.

Be prepared with fresh straw to renew the pack after kidding.

As soon as the kids can stand, dip the umbilical cord in iodine solution or calendula infusion to sterilize and speed drying.

If the kid(s) favor one teat, milk out the other teat to keep them even, in order to avoid mastitis. This milk will have a high colostrum content, so freeze it for use the following year if a doe is having trouble producing early milk. Label these by days from birth, and use them in that order the following year if necessary. Dispose of after 1 year.

Goats can be weaned after 10 weeks.

&lt;big&gt;'''Proton Therapy in Head &amp; Neck Cancers'''&lt;/big&gt;


==General==
*'''Tsukuba; 2004''' (1983-2000) PMID 14762662 -- &quot;Proton therapy for head and neck malignancies at Tsukuba.&quot; (Tokuuye K, Strahlenther Onkol. 2004 Feb;180(2):96-101.)
**Retrospective. 33 patients with H&amp;N malignancies, no surgery. Oral papilomatosis 12%, T1-2N0 21%, 67% locally advanced. Treated with protons +/- photons (depending on beam availability). Median dose 76 Gy, median proton dose 2.8 Gy/fraction.
**Outcome: 5-year LC 74%, 5-year OS 44%
**Toxicity: Grade 3+ acute 3%, late 18%
**Conclusion: High local control, with few toxicities compared with conventional RT. However, late toxicity if prior significant RT


==Specific Sites==
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Nasopharynx/Advanced_Stage#Proton_Therapy|Nasopharynx]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Sinonasal/Overview#Proton_Therapy|Sinonasal tumors]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Salivary_gland#Adenoid_Cystic_Carcinoma|Adenoid cystic]] 
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Oropharynx#Proton_Therapy|Oropharynx]]


==Treatment Planning==
*'''Paul Scherrer Institute''' 
**'''2006''' PMID 16916557 -- &quot;Intensity modulated photon and proton therapy for the treatment of head and neck tumors.&quot; (Steneker M, Radiother Oncol. 2006 Aug;80(2):263-7. Epub 2006 Aug 17.)
***Treatment planning. 5 patients, comparison of IMPT (3, 5, 9 fields and 2 spot sizes) and IMRT (5, 9 fields)
***Outcome: Critical organs best spared using 3-field IMPT. Little advantage to more fields, but advantage to smaller spot size. 
***Conclusion: IMPT better ability to spare organs at risk than IMRT for the same dose homogeneity
**'''2001''' PMID 11730999 -- &quot;A treatment planning comparison of 3D conformal therapy, intensity modulated photon therapy and proton therapy for treatment of advanced head and neck tumours.&quot; (Cozzi L, Radiother Oncol. 2001 Dec;61(3):287-97.)
***Treatment planning. 5 patients, comparison of conventional photon/electron plan, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton therapy. PTV 54 Gy.
***Outcome: PTV coverage for all techniques but conventional photon/electron plan; protons improved dose homogeneity. For spinal cord and parotid, proton best sparing; IMRT plans superior to 3D-CRT and conventional plans, but inferior to proton plans.
***Conclusion: IMRT and protons have potential to reduce toxicity over conventional RT


==Review==
*'''MAASTRO; 2010''' PMID 20817407 -- &quot;Systematic review and meta-analysis of radiotherapy in various head and neck cancers: Comparing photons, carbon-ions and protons.&quot; (Ramaekers BL, Cancer Treat Rev. 2010 Sep 1. [Epub ahead of print])
**Systematic review. 86 observational studies (74 photon, 5 carbon, 7 proton), 8 comparative in-silico studies
**Outcome: 5-year OS higher after carbon ion for mucusal melanoma compared to photons (44% vs 25%, SS). 5-year LC higher for carbon compared with IMRT for paranasal/sinonasal tumors (88% vs 66%, SS). No other significant comparisons
**Conclusion: Overall quality and quantity of data regarding carbon and proton therapy is poor

*'''Harvard; 2008''' PMID 18493920 -- &quot;Proton radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.&quot; (Chan AW, J Surg Oncol. 2008 Jun 15;97(8):697-700.)

*'''Review; 2006''' PMID 16804876 -- &quot;Particle beam radiotherapy for head and neck tumors: radiobiological basis and clinical experience.&quot; (Jereczek-Fossa, Head Neck. 2006 Aug;28(8):750-60.)

==Charged Particles==
*'''Chiba''' 
**'''2008''' PMID 18769999 -- &quot;Comparative study of dose distribution between carbon ion radiotherapy and photon radiotherapy for head and neck tumor.&quot; (Amirul Islam, Radiat Med. 2008 Aug;26(7):415-21. Epub 2008 Sep 4.)
***Treatment planning. 7 patients originally treated with carbon ion (sinonasal tumors). Carbon ion (CIRT) vs. 3D-CRT vs. IMRT.
***Outcome: Mean conformity index 3D-CRT 1.46, IMRT 1.43, CIRT 1.22. Photon plans greater volumes of normal tissue at 10-95% isodose
***Conclusion: Carbon ion has potential to improve target dose conformity, inhomogeneity and OAR sparing
**'''2004''' (1994-1997) PMID 15380567 -- &quot;Dose escalation study of carbon ion radiotherapy for locally advanced head-and-neck cancer.&quot; (Mizoe JE, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Oct 1;60(2):358-64.)
***Phase I/II. 36 patients, locally advanced H&amp;N. Group A: 18 fractions (48.6/18 GyE to 70.2/18 GyE). Group B: 16 fractions (52.8/16 to 64/16). Endpoint erythema and mucositis. Median F/U 7.5 years
***Outcome: MTD 70.2/18 (1/2 patients Grade 3 acute toxicity) and 64/16 (2/3 patients Grade 3 acute toxicity). 5-year LC 75%, better with non-squamous tumors including adenoid cystic and melanoma
***Conclusoin: Carbon ion will deliver high local control without unacceptable toxicity

*'''Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory''' 
**'''1994''' (1977-1992) PMID 8040010 -- &quot;Experience in charged particle irradiation of tumors of the skull base: 1977-1992.&quot; (Castro JR, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Jul 1;29(4):647-55.)
***Retrospective. 233 patients treated with charged particles. Tumors arising/extending to skull base. Arising: Chordoma 24%, chondrosarcoma 12%, meningioma 12%, other 9%; Extending: salivary glands 20%, nasopharynx 14%, paranasal sinuses 10%. Mean dose 65 GyE. Median F/U 4.2 years
***Outcome: 5-year LC meningioma 85%, chondrosarcoma 78%, chordoma 63%
***Conclusion: Charged particle therapy effective in controlling skull base lesions
**'''1988''' PMID 3350726 -- &quot;Charged particle radiotherapy of selected tumors in the head and neck.&quot; (Castro JR, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1988 Apr;14(4):711-20.)
***Retrospective. 98 patients, H&amp;N. Mean F/U 3 years
***Outcome: 2-year LC non-squamous 60%, squamous 35%</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Toppy can name recording files using characters that are not allowed on a Windows PC.  Any one of these is likely to cause problems:
&lt;pre&gt;\ / : * ? &quot; &lt; &gt; |&lt;/pre&gt;
Simplistic tools like Altair may fail to retrieve such files, but often this failure won't occur until the whole contents of the file have been transferred, making it a particularly annoying problem.  If you get one of the following types of error then check the filename for the above characters:
 
* A 0 byte file following an apparently successful transfer.
* &quot;Cannot copy the selected file. Already used in the other process or unknown error occurred&quot; (in a standard Windows error box).

The solution is to either use a better tool (like TopSet or an FTP setup), or rename the file on the Toppy before transferring it:

# Select the recording in native Archive
# Press the Blue button to select &quot;Options&quot;
# Select &quot;Rename&quot;
# Press Up to select the filename part
# Press Right repeatedly until the first &quot;bad&quot; character is highlighted
# Press Red to delete that character
# Repeat from 5 if necessary.

0 Byte files have also been reported associated with faulty USB cables and paticularly active USB extenders [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=43877#43877 here]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== CIRCLE ==

=== statement ===
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔ Console
	
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;
CIRCLE [ FILL ] &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;radius&lt;/i&gt; [ { TO  | PLOT} &lt;i&gt;startAngle&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;angleSize&lt;/i&gt;]
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Draws a circle, an arc or a wedge in the current foreground color, pen pattern and pen size. If a circle or wedge is drawn using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FILL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword, the circle or wedge will be filled with the current pen pattern. When used in combination with the &lt;code&gt;RATIO&lt;/code&gt; statement, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CIRCLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be used to draw ellipses and elliptical arcs and wedges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the current &lt;code&gt;RATIO&lt;/code&gt; is set to 0,0 (the default), then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CIRCLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; behaves as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;radius&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters are specified, then a complete circle is drawn, with its center at point (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and having a radius of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;radius&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; pixels.

If the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword is specified, then a wedge (two radii plus an arc) is drawn. The first radius is drawn in the orientation specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startAngle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is measured in units of &amp;quot;brads&amp;quot; (see below). Angles are measured counterclockwise starting from the &amp;quot;3-o'clock&amp;quot; position, which corresponds to zero brads. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;angleSize&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies the angular width of the wedge (also in brads); the wedge always extends counterclockwise from the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startAngle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; position. Note that the width of the &amp;quot;wedge&amp;quot; may be greater than a half-circle, in which case the &amp;quot;wedge&amp;quot; looks more like a Pac-Man.

If the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword is specified, then an arc is drawn without any radii. The position and size of the arc are the same as when the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword is specified. If both the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FILL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword are specified, then the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CIRCLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; command does nothing.

&amp;quot;Brads&amp;quot; are an angular unit in which a full circle corresponds to 256 brads. A brad is therefore slightly larger than a degree (to be exact, it's 360/256 of a degree). A half circle therefore equals 128 brads, and a right angle equals 64 brads.

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
CD Example: CIRCLE.BAS
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CIRCLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; always switches to the Graphics Window before drawing. You can't use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CIRCLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to draw a circles and arcs in the Text Window, or on the printer; use the Toolbox procedures &lt;code&gt;FRAMEOVAL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FRAMEARC&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PAINTOVAL&lt;/code&gt; instead. Alternatively, you can activate the graphics window and select Print from the File menu.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Note ===
If you use values outside the range 0..255 for &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startAngle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;angleSize&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then values modulo 256 will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

=== See Also=== 
&lt;code&gt;RATIO; FILL; FRAMEOVAL&gt; &lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;FRAMEARC &lt;/code&gt;Toolbox procedures&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==List Comprehensions==

===Intro to Comprehensions===
A list comprehension is a mathematical way to construct a list. To do list comprehension we have to use a new operator &quot;&lt;-&quot;, &quot;taken from&quot;. 

 L = [ X*X || X &lt;- [1,2,3,4] ].

English translation is: build a list, L with elements that have the value X*X, such that X is taken from the list [1,2,3,4].  It gives the output:

 [1,4,9,16]

Notice that this is similar to 

 lists:map(fun(X) -&gt; X*X end, [1,2,3,4])

In fact, list comprehension provides a shorthand notation for most of the functions in the lists module.

===Simple Comprehensions===

You can use them to solve equations.

  L = [ {X,Y} || X &lt;- [1,2,3,4], Y &lt;- [1,2,3,4], X*X == Y]. 

output:

 [ {1,1}, {2,4} ]

====Lists version====

Can you figure out the lists functions used in the above comprehension ?

How about

  F = fun(X, Y) -&gt;
   lists:filter(fun({X0, Y0}) -&gt; X0 * X0 == Y0 end,
      lists:reverse(
         lists:foldl(fun(E, Acc) -&gt; 
              lists:zip(lists:duplicate(length(Y), E), Y) ++ Acc
            end, [], X))) end.
  F([1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4]).

That is 5 functions in one succinct line. For the remainder of the examples
take some time and find the corresponding lists functions that do the same 
thing.

====Permutations====

Here we flip two coins:
 [ [X]++[Y] || X&lt;-&quot;HT&quot;, Y&lt;-&quot;HT&quot;].                                         

Note: strings are lists in erlang.
all combinations are:
output:
 [&quot;HH&quot;,&quot;HT&quot;,&quot;TH&quot;,&quot;TT&quot;]

===Intermediate list comprehensions===

An important use of List Comprehensions is to help translate Prolog-like statements into Erlang.  [Why is this &quot;important&quot;?] 

1- Erlang is a functional language designed for message passing (MIMD) parallel processing. Prolog is designed for logic programming. Sometimes a problem is most easily defined as a logical set of constraints on some set of data. If one thinks logically or thinks in constraints, or thinks in prolog, this style of list comprehensions can be a helpful way to do your tasks in erlang. There exist many useful solutions in prolog that can be moved to erlang via list comprehensions.
 
2- Constraint programming and logic programming are considered a higher level way to program than functions, and hence, are a good way to save you time and increase terseness. 

Warning: constraint and logic based programs can be harder to debug because strict step by step actions are hidden and delegated to the list comprehension engine. Order of constraints in erlang list comprehensions can affect the output. Order dependence of constraints can be a non-intuitive distraction.

Note: in general, using huge numbers of atoms is not a good idea as they are never garbage collected.

 -module(think).              %
 -compile(export_all).        %
                              %
 male(adam) -&gt; true;          %
 male(seth) -&gt; true;
 male(cain) -&gt; true;
 male(abel) -&gt; true;
 male(noah) -&gt; true;
 male(_X) -&gt; false.
                              %
 female(eve) -&gt; true;
 female(_X) -&gt; false.
                              %
 parent(adam,cain) -&gt; true;
 parent(adam,abel) -&gt; true;
 parent(eve,cain) -&gt; true;
 parent(eve,abel) -&gt; true;
 parent(noah,shem) -&gt; true;
 parent(_X,_Y) -&gt; false.
                                                 %
 people() -&gt;
        [ adam, shem, cain, abel, eve, noah ].
                                                 %
 father_of() -&gt;
        [ {X,Y} || X &lt;- people(), Y &lt;- people(), parent(X,Y), male(X) ].
 mother_of() -&gt;
        [ {X,Y} || X &lt;- people(), Y &lt;- people(), parent(X,Y), female(X) ].

compile with c(think). and generate output with: 
 17&gt; think:father_of() ++ think:mother_of().
 [{adam,cain},{adam,abel},{noah,shem},{eve,cain},{eve,abel}]

===Advanced List Comprehensions===

Example with quicksort in 7 lines.

 -module(sort).
 -compile(export_all).
                                 % classic way to show off erlang terseness.
 qsort([]) -&gt;
    [];
 qsort([H | T]) -&gt; 
    qsort([ X || X &lt;- T, X &lt; H ]) ++ [H] ++ qsort([ X || X &lt;- T, X &gt;= H ]).

 % sample output:
 %
 % sort:qsort([1,5,3,7,6,8,9,4]).
 %   [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]


(Btw: This isn't actually &quot;quicksort,&quot; as you'd want to use it, because it uses more memory than necessary, and doesn't get the VM page/cache benefits of an in-place quicksort. But it's neat nevertheless!)

===Exercises===

1) Write a program using list comprehension that finds the integer solutions {X,Y} for a circle of radius 5.

===Solutions===

1) 
 -module( solve_circle).
 -export( [start/0] ).
                                                   %
 numbers() -&gt; lists:seq(-5,5).
                                                   %
 start() -&gt; [ {X,Y} ||
                    X &lt;- numbers(),
                    Y &lt;- numbers(),
                    X*X + Y*Y == 25 ].
                                                    %
 % ================================================ %
 % sample output
 % 11&gt; solve_circle:start().
 % [{-5,0}, {-4,-3}, {-4,3}, {-3,-4}, 
 %  {-3,4}, {0,-5}, {0,5}, {3,-4},
 %  {3,4}, {4,-3}, {4,3}, {5,0}]

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''standard lens''' is a general-purpose lens, which captures the middle of the focal length range. These can be a [[w:normal lens|normal lens]] (standard prime), or a standard zoom, often the [[w:kit lens|kit lens]].

Some common recommendations follow.

* [http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Canon-Lenses/Canon-General-Purpose-Lens.aspx General Purpose Canon Lenses (from The-Digital-Picture)]

==APS-C==
Canon's small sensor cameras mostly use a 1.6x [[w:Crop factor|crop factor]] (except for the 1D series, which is 1.3), so a normal lens would be 50mm/1.6 = 31.25mm, and focal lengths for standard zooms are correspondingly shorter than on full frame standard zooms.

===Standard Zoom===
'''Kit lenses'''
* [[w:Canon EF-S 18-55mm lens|Canon EF-S 18-55mm]]: kit on Rebel series, considered very soft
:FF FOV equivalent of 29-88mm, EF-S analog of [[w:Canon EF 28-90mm lens|Canon EF 28-90mm]]
* [[w:Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens|Canon EF-S 17-85mm IS USM]]: kit on 30D, 40D
:FF FOV equivalent of 27-136mm, EF-S analog of [[w:Canon EF 28-135mm lens|Canon EF 28-135mm]]
:([http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-S-17-85mm-f-4-5.6-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx The-Digital-Picture review]) ([http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/reviews/ef-s_17-85_review.html Bob Atkins review])
'''Non-kit lenses'''
* [[w:Canon EF-S 17-55mm lens|Canon EF-S 17-55mm]] ($1,300) excellent standard lens
:FF FOV equivalent of 27-88mm
:Notable features: high-quality glass (similar to L series, though lower build quality), and at f/2.8, quite fast for a zoom.
:([http://photo.net/equipment/canon/efs_17-55/ Philip Greenspun Review at photo.net]) ([http://www.fredmiranda.com/reviews/showproduct.php?product=303 Fred Miranda Review]) ([http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-S-17-55mm-f-2.8-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx The-Digital-Picture.com Review]) ([http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06022113canonefs1755f28g.asp dpreview.com Review])

===Standard Prime===
A normal lens on a 1.6x crop factor camera would be about 31mm. Canon doesn't make a prime lens at this point, but does make some EF wide-angle lenses that can work. Others instead suggest the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 as the best prime normal lens for Canon APS-C cameras.
* [[w:Canon EF 28mm lens|Canon EF 28mm]]: f/2.8, f/1.8
* [[w:Canon EF 35mm lens|Canon EF 35mm]]: f/2 ($200); f/1.4 L USM ($1,100)
* Sigma 30mm f/1.4 for Canon ($400)
:Recommended by [http://photo.net/equipment/canon/ Philip Greenspun at photo.net].

==Full Frame==
===Standard Zoom===
* [[w:Canon EF 28-135mm lens|Canon EF 28-135mm]]

**50/1.8 II is high quality and ''excellent'' value ($75),
**50/1.4 is more expensive ($300) but widely praised,
**and 50/1.2 is very expensive ($1,300) but very fast.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Standard Lenses==
As a standard lens, most commonly people use the zoom lens that is included with the DSLR body (called the '''[[w:kit lens|kit lens]]'''). Indeed, many people use no other lenses, and thus reap relatively little benefit from a DSLR. Others decry this practice&lt;ref&gt;http://photo.net/equipment/building-a-digital-slr-system/&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest instead that one use a (prime) [[w:normal lens|normal lens]].

features=Heirloom of Godric Gryffindor|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''The Sword of Gryffindor''''' is one of only two artifacts known to have been the property of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]]. The other is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]], which is more a character than an artifact, having been given limited consciousness by Gryffindor.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Sword of Gryffindor is first seen when it appears in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] in the Chamber of Secrets. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] uses it then to kill a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]]. From then, until the summer before Harry's sixth year, it rests in a glass case in the Headmaster's office.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we discover that the Sword is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblin]]-made blade, and that it had last been taken out of the case by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] who had used it to destroy a ring. Queried whether it had ever been removed from the case for cleaning, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|the portrait of Phineas Nigellus]] had reported that Goblin-made weapons don't need cleaning; they incorporate into themselves anything applied to them which will make them stronger, and the rest just falls away. Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] realize that the ring, which was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], could only have been destroyed because the Sword had absorbed Basilisk venom. We also learn that a fake copy of the sword had been moved to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] for safekeeping after a group of students, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], had attempted to steal it; we don't, at this point, know where the real one is.

Harry then finds it in a pond in the Forest of Dean; as he retrieves it, he is nearly strangled by the Locket Horcrux, but is rescued by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. To prove that it is the real Sword, Harry has Ron attempt to destroy the Horcrux. The attempt is successful, proving that they have found the real Sword and that it can be used to destroy Horcruxes. As this is the only certain means they have of destroying Horcruxes, they will retain the Sword in their travels.

They are still carrying the Sword when they are captured by Snatchers, who suspect that they have caught the real Harry Potter and decide to take him and his group to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] for the reward. There, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] sees the Sword and panics, saying that if that is the true Sword of Gryffindor, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] will be furious at them. Hermione is tortured, but sticks to the story that it is fake; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], the Goblin who has been captured with them, confirms her story when he is brought to the scene. Harry and Ron manage to rescue all of the captives and escape with the sword, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby's]] help, ending up at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]].

Harry knows that a fake Sword of Gryffindor was taken from the school and moved to Gringotts, as mentioned above; from Bellatrix' reaction, he reasons that the fake Sword was placed in her vault, and that there is something else there that is extremely valuable to Voldemort. He determines that it is a Horcrux, most likely the cup of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]]. He discusses with Griphook what is necessary to get into Gringotts and recover this one artifact. Griphook eventually agrees to assist them, but names the Sword of Gryffindor as his price. He feels that the Sword was stolen from goblins and should be returned to them. Harry reluctantly agrees, but does not specify when he will give the Sword to Griphook; he intends to keep it until the last Horcrux is destroyed, and then present it to the Goblin.

Once in the vault, Harry uses the sword to lift the Cup off a shelf. Immediately after opening the door to the vault, Griphook seizes the sword and runs off; Harry, Hermione, and Ron escape on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]]back.

Viewing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape's]] memories in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], Harry sees the portrait of Phineas Nigellus reporting that Harry and Hermione are in the Forest of Dean. Snape then retrieves the Sword from a hiding place behind the portrait of Dumbledore, and goes off to place the Sword where Harry had found it, in the pond.

In the second part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle at Hogwarts]], Voldemort places the Sorting Hat on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]'s head, and sets it and Neville on fire. Neville knows that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] must be killed to end Voldemort's immortality, and evidently he asks for help from the Hat just as Harry did, because the Hat produces the Sword once again, and Neville uses it to cut Nagini's head off.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
#We know there is one fake Sword, that Snape moved to Bellatrix' vault. Could there be more?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Initially, Harry believes that Severus Snape had sent the sword to the Lestrange vault at Gringotts for safety after a group of students try to steal it, possibly unaware that it was a replica. Later in the book, it becomes clear that Snape actually produced the copy of the sword sent to Gringotts. This implies that it was likely Voldemort who ordered Snape to have the sword sent to Gringotts; Snape sent the copy so that Voldemort would be satisfied and so he could keep the original stored safely in the secret compartment behind Dumbledore's portrait. He then delivered the real sword to Harry in the Forest of Dean so Harry could use it to destroy Horcruxes. Snape almost certainly copied the sword on Dumbledore's portrait's instructions.

It is uncertain whether Dumbledore, or later his portrait, ever completely explains to Snape what exactly Harry will have need of the sword to do. We never hear Dumbledore explicitly telling Snape that Harry has been sent to collect Horcruxes, and Dumbledore, as we find out, has a habit of keeping his secrets very tightly indeed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Select Case ==



=== Syntax 1 ===
&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT [CASE] targetExpr
   CASE testExpr [,testExpr ...] [,max32TestExpr ...]
[statementBlock]
   [CASE testExpr [,testExpr ...] [,max32TestExpr ...]
[statementBlock]...]
   [CASE ELSE
[statementBlock]]
END SELECT
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Syntax 2 ===
&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT [CASE]
   CASE booleanExpr [,booleanExpr ...] [,max32T booleanExpr ...]
[statementBlock]
   [CASE booleanExpr [,booleanExpr ...][,max32T booleanExpr ...]
[statementBlock]...]
   [CASE ELSE
[statementBlock]]
END SELECT
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SELECT CASE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement marks the beginning of a &amp;quot;select block,&amp;quot; which must end with an &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;END SELECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement. You can use a select block to conditionally execute a block of statements based on a number of tests that you specify. When there is only one test, it's often more convenient to use a &lt;code&gt;LONG IF...[XELSE]...END IF&lt;/code&gt; block. A select block is useful when there are two or more conditions to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use Syntax 1, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;targetExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be a numeric or string expression. Each &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;testExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has the following syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
   [=|&lt;&gt;|&lt;|&lt;=|&gt;|&gt;=]expr
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is an expression of the same type as &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;targetExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. When the select block executes, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;targetExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is compared against each &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;testExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in order. If the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;testExpr&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;does not include a comparison operator (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt; &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc.), then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;targetExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is compared for equality with &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;targetExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is compared with &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; using the indicated operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the comparison of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;targetExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is true, the &lt;code&gt;statementBlock&lt;/code&gt; (if any) following that &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CASE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed; then execution continues at the first statement after &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;END SELECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If none of the comparisons in any &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CASE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is true, the &lt;code&gt;statementBlock&lt;/code&gt; (if any) following the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CASE ELSE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed; then execution continues at the first statement after &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;END SELECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Each &lt;code&gt;statementBlock &lt;/code&gt;can consist of any number of executable statements, possibly including other &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SELECT...END SELECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use Syntax 2, each &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;booleanExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be a numeric expression that can be evaluated as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; (nonzero) or &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; (zero). Typically, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;booleanExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will be an expression that includes operators such as &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt; &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc. When the select block executes, each &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;booleanExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated in order, until one is found that is nonzero (&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;). Then the &lt;code&gt;statementBlock&lt;/code&gt; (if any) under the corresponding &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CASE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed; then execution continues at the first statement after &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;END SELECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If every &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;booleanExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is zero (&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;), the &lt;code&gt;statementBlock&lt;/code&gt; (if any) following the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CASE ELSE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed; then execution continues at the first statement after &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;END SELECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Notes ===
Remember that the two syntaxes work differently. It's a common mistake to do something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT CASE myVar%
   CASE myVar% = 3
:
   CASE myVar% = 7
:
   CASE ELSE
:
END SELECT
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here the programmer probably intended to compare the value of &lt;code&gt;myVar%&lt;/code&gt; to the values 3 and 7; but that's not what this select block does. Instead, it compares the value of &lt;code&gt;myVar%&lt;/code&gt; first to the value of &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;myVar%=3&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; (which is either -1 or 0), and then to the value of &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;myVar%=7&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; (which is either -1 or 0). This block should have been written in one of these ways:

Using Syntax 1:
&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT CASE myVar%
   CASE 3
:
   CASE 7
:
   CASE ELSE
:
END SELECT
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using Syntax 2:

&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT CASE
   CASE myVar% = 3
:
   CASE myVar% = 7
:
   CASE ELSE
:
END SELECT
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Director's responsibilities can be summarized as follows:

* Keep all group members up to date on deadlines by creating a project calendar. The calendar doesn't have to be completed right way, and in most situations it would be impossible to do so because of the unpredictable nature of interactive projects. However, there are general objectives (such as the completion of the project) for which dates should be set and posted early. Other details can be filled in as the project progresses.
* Together with the team leaders, analyze any ideas that team members or the client have for the project.  If the ideas are worth implementing, the Director is responsible for rearranging the team's assignments to include the new ideas.  If the ideas are impractical or impossible to include in the project, the Director must make and communicate that decision.
* Post current tasks for each team (Interactive, Graphics, and Audio-Visual) so that each team knows what they should be working on at any point in time.
* Stay up to date with the latest developments in the project's general direction to ensure that each team's work is directed properly and efficiently.
* Communicate with the client and any other involved vendors throughout the development and production process. The Director must serve as a liaison between the client, any outside vendors, and the development teams. It is essential for the Director to receive timely and complete reports from the team leaders so that communication errors are minimized.
* Ensure that project is completed as agreed upon by the team and the client.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Chisel.jpg|thumb|500px|Carving knives, chisels, and gouges]]
The primary tool for wood carving is a carving knife.  You can use a pocket knife as well, and many people do.  To sharpen a knife, hold the blade at about a 15° angle and scrape it along a whetstone as if you were trying to shave off a thin layer of the stone.  Be sure to sharpen both sides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A chisel is best used with a mallet.  Chisels can be used for removing great quantities of wood.  They can cut across the grain or slice along its length.  Chisels are sharpened much the same way as knives, but the angle is a bit steeper, ranging from 20° to 35°.  Often they are sharpened at two angles, such as 25° for most of the length of the blade, and 35° near the edge.  This allows the blade to be resharpened by only honing a small portion near the cutting edge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A gouge is a chisel with a curved blade.  If pushed along a piece of wood, it would plow out a U-shaped channel.  Gouges are sharpened with a slipstone, which is a whetstone with a curved edge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Coping saw.JPG|thumb|250px|Coping saw]]
Coping saws are very useful for removing bulk.  A carving can often be roughed in with a coping saw, and once the shape is cut out, knives, chisels, and gouges can be used to clean it up and do the final shaping.  Coping saw blades can be sharpened with a triangle file, though they are cheap enough that they ore more frequently replaced when dull.

The blade can be installed on the coping saw so that it cuts on either the pull stroke or the push stroke.  Experiment to see which you like better.  To make a cut, clamp the piece to a bench or hold it firmly with your free hand or knee.  Align the blade with the pencil mark you have made which will guide the cut.  Gently work the saw up and down to make the cut.  You may have difficulty at first, and this does take a little practice to master.  But once you have it down, it is not all that difficult.  Follow the line until the cut is complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==book title accuracy==
The term &quot;open source&quot; refers to software, &quot;open content&quot; may be a more accurate title for this book, .--[[User:Tradimus|Tradimus]] ([[User talk:Tradimus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tradimus|contribs]]) 14:52, 16 April 2011 (UTC)

:In the context it may be hard to determine what source refers to, it can refer to source of information. I would support a project rename that removes both words from the title. &quot;Handbook of Nursing&quot; would be sufficient and general to any medium that the book is put on...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:39, 7 February 2012 (UTC)
I started a page in this book, but I am unhappy with the anonymous comments on the vocational nursing section which assert the superiority of registered nurses. Vocational nurses (however titled) have a place in the workforce for which a reference text would be useful. I would argue that disagreements about what is appropriate or sufficient for such a text are destructive to the clarity and sensitivity of relationships which a multi-tiered workforce endures. Likewise registered nurses deserve the text which reflects the rigour of their discipline. The [[Nursing Study Guide]] has been abandoned for two years at least. I am thinking that a separate book &quot;Vocational Nursing&quot; could be the way to go.--[[User:Tradimus|Tradimus]] ([[User talk:Tradimus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tradimus|contribs]]) 12:06, 14 February 2012 (UTC)
The opening sentence - Nursing is ... simpler medical tasks ... field of medicine. Nursing is not a field of medicine. Nurses do not focus on medical tasks. This is like arguing that police officers perform judicial tasks and that enforcement is a branch of legislature. Medicine and nursing have seperate faculties in every university I can find. Another good reason for a new book.--[[User:Tradimus|Tradimus]] ([[User talk:Tradimus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tradimus|contribs]]) 12:26, 14 February 2012 (UTC)
Name of book changed and definition tweaked to remove references to medicine as a parent discipline. 04:39, 24 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
there is a navigation issue that requires admin assistance. If I go to the wikibooks homepage and type NURSING into the search window, the wikibooks engine takes me to category MEDICINE (no nursing books there) but should take me to category HEALTH SCIENCES where two nursing books are. A new NURSING subsection could be started under HEALTH SCIENCES for the two nursing books. One nursing book title has been used as a category in health sciences. I hope more contributors can find the book that way.[[User:Tradimus|Tradimus]] ([[User talk:Tradimus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tradimus|contribs]]) 04:56, 6 March 2012 (UTC)

:I disagree that nurses do not practice medicine, they do (the same is valid for the example given, police officers do perform judicial tasks). I would agree that vocational nurses may not practice medicine (here a clear definition of medicine must be provided for instance traditional and most palliative medicine do not require any special recognition of expertise). The work should also state why expertise recognition is required and how it evolved. There is also the other side of the issue most professional nurses rapidly acquire better understanding of general medicine that general practitioners doctors during the same time time-frame (doctors are also part bureaucrats and authority figure next to patients) there are even specific fields that dedicated nurses can substitute medical doctors on the most common cases (natural births, minor surgery, family planing, sexual transmitted diseases can generally be assigned to nurses with special cases referred to specialist). This also depends mostly on the quality of education of nurses and doctors (it can not be generalized).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:10, 6 March 2012 (UTC)

A few issues here. The internal health politics around role boundaries and titles are a little outside my intentions for an entry level nursing text. I don't think references to medicine belong on the front page, but in a later chapter on qualifications as you said. Police and judges roles overlap but are not synonymous, judges don't usually chase crooks down alleys and issue speeding fines - Analogies can go so far. On the whole I agree with your insights, but where do I put them? I was concerned about nursing being portrayed as subservient to medicine. A neutral stance would be to observe the reality that there is some parallel and nursing has expanded in some areas, but nursing training by medical faculties vanished a generation ago. There are only eight pages on nursing and many hundreds on medicine, so the challenge for me is to get enough material up to generate some interest. I think you have answered my lingering doubt a new book with your comments on the different role of vocational nurses - that is my area of interest. My class and I will start our own book where I can write about it and leave these empty shells to the registered nurses.[[User:Tradimus|Tradimus]] ([[User talk:Tradimus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tradimus|contribs]]) 07:41, 9 April 2012 (UTC)

I would argue both Nursing AND medicine are sub-categories of health science. I have attempted to change a re-direct [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Nursing&amp;redirect=no]] which leads people searching for &quot;Nursing&quot; to medicine, but the nursing books are not located there. The re-direct should be changed to Category: Health Sciences. The Health Sciences Category header has the wrong definition.[[User:Tradimus|Tradimus]] ([[User talk:Tradimus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tradimus|contribs]]) 14:36, 8 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A hand plane is a tool for shaping wood. Planes are used to flatten, reduce the thickness of, and impart a smooth surface to a rough piece of lumber.

Hand Planes are one of the most satisfying tools to operate.  Clamp the wood securely to a bench, and then push the plane along the grain.  The blade should be adjusted so that it takes a thin shaving off the plank.  A sharp, well adjusted plane will remove a continuous shaving the entire length of the board.  Pay attention to how the grain runs - if the grain dives into the board, make sure the plane's blade does not break the shaving off below the surface.  If this happens, try planing in the other direction (see illustration). 

[[Image:Planing_wood_with_the_grain.PNG|300px]] [[Image:Planing_wood_against_the_grain.PNG|300px]]

Once the blade has been removed from a plane, it can be sharpened in the same fashion as a chisel.  It should be sharpened frequently, as this will greatly improve its performance.

A plane should be stored on its side to respect the blade.  You should also be very careful to not plane into a nail or a screw, as doing so will put a nasty notch in the blade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Wood rasp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Wood rasp]]
A '''rasp''' is a woodworking tool used for shaping wood. It consists of a point or the tip, then a long steel bar or the belly, then the heel or bottom, then the tang. The tang is joined to a handle, usually made of plastic or wood. The bar has had sharp teeth cut into it. Rasps generally cut more coarsely than files. They are useful for rapidly removing wood from curved surfaces. They remove less wood than a drawknife, so they are easier to control. Even though rasps leave very coarse finishes, the cut-away areas can be easily smoothed with finer tools, such as files.

There are several types and shapes of rasps. There is a half round, round and flat. The several types of rasps are bastard, cabinet and wood (finest to coarsest). All these varieties can be used to make different shapes.

A similar tool to a rasp is a '''surform file'''; it has coarse, individual teeth like a rasp for cutting wood. The difference being that the surform has a small hole near each of the teeth to allow shavings to pass through and prevent clogging. Surform tools come in different styles and shapes including file-plane, round file and shaping/shaving tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''sanding block''' is a block used to hold sandpaper. In its simplest form, it is a block of wood or cork with one smooth flat side. The user wraps the sandpaper around the block, and holds it in place. Fancier versions use clips, teeth or clamps to hold the paper in place. Commercial versions can be constructed of various materials. They are usually sized to hold a quarter or half sheet of sandpaper. Some versions use the sandpaper belts intended for a power belt sander. Sanding blocks are helpful because they prevent the &quot;waves&quot; created by plain sandpaper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About application Usability ==
This program has proven to be completely counter-intuitive and a nuisance in general. I hate to choose Microsoft over open source, but there's really no excuse for how difficult they've made it to create a simple database. (unsigned)
:What version did you not like? I think usability fits more in the wikibook about Openoffice base at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org/Base OpenOffice.org Base]. Since v.2.0 to 2.3 things have changed extremely much, and I could not follow a tutorial which was for v.2.0. [[Special:Contributions/85.74.177.113|85.74.177.113]] ([[User talk:85.74.177.113|talk]]) 08:00, 6 February 2008 (UTC)
:I don't know what is so hard for you about making a simple database, I had no problems with that, and found it rather easy. [[Special:Contributions/218.17.216.172|218.17.216.172]] ([[User talk:218.17.216.172|talk]]) 05:42, 28 August 2008 (UTC)
::While I'm not the original poster, I'm pretty pissed off at how difficult it is to use, too.  I *want* to use open source, and OpenOffice to replace Access, but it's clunky.  Here's what happened to me today:

* Upgraded to the &quot;latest and greatest&quot;: OpenOffice 3.0.
* Created two tables, one with a primary key, the other without. Took me 10 minutes to figure out that I couldn't enter data into the second one because I didn't have a primary key.  Yes, there's a warning, but it appears to be identical to the one that Access uses, complaining about no primary key.  Only, in Access, saying no to the dialog doesn't prevent data entry later.
* Okay, fine, I need a primary key for each table.  I can live with that.  It is good practice, but since I've now got to add a key I don't want to my table, surely I make it an autonumber.  Wrong.  I can't, for some inexplicable reason.  I consult the help.  Okay, so they're called &quot;AutoValues&quot; here, who cares?  But the only help for AutoValues is under &quot;Table Design&quot;, where it tells me that after setting up my primary key, I can make it an AutoValue.  Only it doesn't work.  Poking around on the internet show that other people have issues with AutoValue, but not my issue.  Eventually, I find a forum on OO.o that clues me in, but I can't post my question, because I don't want to register.  So much for openness...  Similar fate for all other avenues.  I want to post a bug, so that somebody will *fix* something, making my life easier, but no dice...  Turns out, the problem is that I've selected the &quot;Numeric&quot; data type, not &quot;Integer&quot;, and &quot;Numeric&quot; doesn't allow AutoValues.  Obvious, right?  I'm sure glad the help mentioned that.  Even knowing what the problem is, I'm still pissed.  In Access I'd be dealing with &quot;Autonumber&quot; and &quot;Numeric&quot; (with various sub-types), but apparently, the OO developers decided that it would be obvious that &quot;Numeric&quot; in Access != &quot;Numeric&quot; in OO.
*So, I have a solution, but OO has made me work a whole lot more that I want to just for basic parity with Access.  Sorry OpenOffice, it's gonna be another release cycle or two before I recommend Base as a replacement for Access!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Wethering''' is the castration of male goats that are to be used for meat, companionship, or brush control. It can be done by banding, crimping, or surgical extraction. 

Wethers can make good companions for either bucks or does, are feminine in appearance, and tend to accept the lowest place in the social hierarchy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pastures can be either fields or woodland areas, the latter generally preferred. When possible maintain at least one more pasture than herd groups, to allow pastures to rest. 

See [[../Fencing/]].

Pastures are best defined in early autumn when most plants will be visible for inspection. Grub out any poisonous plants before letting the goats graze, particularly hightly toxic plants such as snakeroot, false hellebore, ericaceous plants, aconite, foxglove, etc. 

Over winter, knock down or remove stone fruit trees (bark is edible and nutritious). 

Make sure to leave access for tractors.

Check fences after weather events.

Make sure shelters are available for rain and snow.

Make sure water is available.

Maintain pathways around both the inside and outside perimeters of the pasture to ensure easy maintenance of the fence and access to the goats.

==Introduction==
''Information security'' means protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

''Information Security management'' is a process of defining the security controls in order to protect the information assets. 
===Security Program===
The first action of a management program to implement information security is to have a security program in place. Though some argue the first act would be to gain some real &quot;proof of concept&quot; and &quot;explainable thru display on the monitor screen&quot; security knowledge. Start with maybe understanding where OS passwords are stored within the code inside a file within a directory. If you don't understand Operating Systems at the root directory level maybe you should seek out advice from somebody who does before even beginning to implement security program management and objectives. 

'''Security Program Objectives'''
* Protect the company and its assets.
* Manage Risks by Identifying assets, discovering threats and estimating the risk
* Provide direction for security activities by framing of information security policies, procedures, standards, guidelines and baselines
* Information Classification
* Security Organization and 
* Security Education
'''Security Management Responsibilities'''
* Determining objectives, scope, policies, priorities, standards, and strategies.
* Determine actual goals that are expected to be accomplished from a security program
* Evaluate business objectives, security risks, user productivity, and functionality requirements.
* Define steps to ensure that all the above are accounted for and properly addressed

'''Approaches to Build a Security Program'''
* Top-Down Approach
** The initiation, support, and direction comes from the top management and work their way through middle management and then to staff members.
** Treated as the best approach but seems to based on the I get paid more therefor I must know more about everything type of mentality.
** Ensures that the senior management who are ultimately responsible for protecting the company assets is driving the program.
* Bottom-Up Approach
** The lower-end team comes up with a security control or a program without proper management support and direction.
** It is oft considered less effective and doomed to fail for the same flaw in thinking as above; I get paid more therefor I must know more about everything. 
Since advancement is directly tied to how well you can convince others, who often fall outside of your of job duties and department, as to your higher value to the company as stated by your own effective written communication this leads to amazing resume writers and take no blame style of email responses that seems to definitely lead to the eventual failure of company's standards and actual knowledge. It is often covered up by relationships which form at the power levels within any group of people and those who are considered so-called experts having no real idea what is really involved under the hood of the reports/applications they use and no proof presented in emails written when self declared claims of their expertise is made or blame is to be put on another.

===Security Controls===
Security Controls can be classified into three categories

'''Administrative Controls''' which include
* Developing and publishing of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines.
* Screening of personnel.
* Conducting security-awareness training and 
* Implementing change control procedures.
'''Technical or Logical Controls''' which include
* Implementing and maintaining access control mechanisms.
* Password and resource management.
* Identification and authentication methods
* Security devices and 
* Configuration of the infrastructure.
'''Physical Controls''' which include
* Controlling individual access into the facility and different departments
* Locking systems and removing unnecessary floppy or CD-ROM drives
* Protecting the perimeter of the facility
* Monitoring for intrusion and 
* Environmental controls.
  
  '''Security Note:''' It is the responsibility of the information owner (usually a Sr. executive within 
  the management group or head of a specific dept) to protect the data and is the due care 
  (liable by the court of law) for any kind of negligence

===The Elements of Security===
'''Vulnerability''' 
* It is a software, hardware, or procedural weakness that may provide an attacker the open door he is looking for to enter a computer or network and have unauthorized access to resources within the environment.
* Vulnerability characterizes the absence or weakness of a safeguard that could be exploited.
* E.g.: a service running on a server, unpatched applications or operating system software, unrestricted modem dial-in access, an open port on a firewall, lack of physical security etc.

'''Threat''' 
* Any potential danger to information or systems. 
* A threat is a possibility that someone (person, s/w) would identify and exploit the vulnerability.
* The entity that takes advantage of vulnerability is referred to as a threat agent. E.g.: A threat agent could be an intruder accessing the network through a port on the firewall
 
'''Risk'''
* Risk is the likelihood of a threat agent taking advantage of vulnerability and the corresponding business impact.
* Reducing vulnerability and/or threat reduces the risk.
* E.g.: If a firewall has several ports open, there is a higher likelihood that an intruder will use one to access the network in an unauthorized method. 

'''Exposure''' 
* An exposure is an instance of being exposed to losses from a threat agent.
* Vulnerability exposes an organization to possible damages. 
* E.g.:If password management is weak and password rules are not enforced, the company is exposed to the possibility of having users' passwords captured and used in an unauthorized manner. 

'''Countermeasure or Safeguard'''
* It is an application or a s/w configuration or h/w or a procedure that mitigates the risk. 
* E.g.: strong password management, a security guard, access control mechanisms within an operating system, the implementation of basic input/output system (BIOS) passwords, and security-awareness training.

'''The Relation Between the Security Elements'''
* Example: If a company has antivirus software but does not keep the virus signatures up-to-date, this is vulnerability. The company is vulnerable to virus attacks. 
* The threat is that a virus will show up in the environment and disrupt productivity. 
* The likelihood of a virus showing up in the environment and causing damage is the risk. 
* If a virus infiltrates the company's environment, then vulnerability has been exploited and the company is exposed to loss. 
* The countermeasures in this situation are to update the signatures and install the antivirus software on all computers
   
   '''Threat Agent''' gives rise to '''Threat''' exploits '''Vulnerability''' leads to '''Risk'''
   can damage '''Assets''' and causes an '''Exposure''' can be counter measured by '''Safeguard''' 
   directly effects '''Threat Agent'''

=='''Core Information Security Principles'''==
The three fundamental principles of security are availability, integrity, and confidentiality and are commonly referred to as CIA or AIC triad which also form the main objective of any security program.

The level of security required to accomplish these principles differs per company, because each has its own unique combination of business and security goals and requirements. 

All security controls, mechanisms, and safeguards are implemented to provide one or more of these principles.

All risks, threats, and vulnerabilities are measured for their potential capability to compromise one or all of the AIC principles

===Confidentiality===
* Ensures that the necessary level of secrecy is enforced at each junction of data processing and prevents unauthorized disclosure. This level of confidentiality should prevail while data resides on systems and devices within the network, as it is transmitted and once it reaches its destination.
* Threat sources 
** Network Monitoring
** Shoulder Surfing- monitoring key strokes or screen
** Stealing password files
** Social Engineering- one person posing as the actual 
* Countermeasures
** Encrypting data as it is stored and transmitted.
** By using network padding
** Implementing strict access control mechanisms and data classification
** Training personnel on proper procedures.

===Integrity===
* Integrity of data is protected when the assurance of accuracy and reliability of information and system is provided, and unauthorized modification is prevented.
* Threat sources
** Viruses
** Logic Bombs
** Backdoors
* Countermeasures
** Strict Access Control
** Intrusion Detection
** Hashing

===Availability===
* Availability ensures reliability and timely access to data and resources to authorized individuals.
* Threat sources
** Device or software failure. 
** Environmental issues like heat, cold, humidity, static electricity, and contaminants can also affect system availability. 
** Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks 
* Countermeasures
** Maintaining backups to replace the failed system
** IDS to monitor the network traffic and host system activities
** Use of certain firewall and router configurations





----------------------------------
=='''Information Security Management Governance'''==
===Security Governance===
Governance is the set of responsibilities and practices exercised by the board and executive management with the goal of providing strategic direction, ensuring that objectives are achieved, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately and verifying that the enterprise's resources are used responsibly.

Information Security Governance or ISG, is a subset discipline of Corporate Governance focused on information Security systems and their performance and risk management.

===Security Policies, Procedures, Standards, Guidelines, and Baselines===

====Policies====
A security policy is an overall general statement produced by senior management (or a selected policy board or committee) that dictates what role security plays within the organization. 

A well designed policy addresses:
#. What is being secured? - Typically an asset.
#. Who is expected to comply with the policy? - Typically employees.
#. Where is the vulnerability, threat or risk? - Typically an issue of integrity or responsibility.

'''Types of Policies'''
* ''Regulatory'': This type of policy ensures that the organization is following standards set by specific industry regulations. This policy type is very detailed and specific to a type of industry. This is used in financial institutions, health care facilities, public utilities, and other government-regulated industries. E.g.: TRAI.
* ''Advisory'': This type of policy strongly advises employees regarding which types of behaviors and activities should and should not take place within the organization. It also outlines   possible ramifications if employees do not comply with the established behaviors and activities. This policy type can be used, for example, to describe how to handle medical information, handle financial transactions, or process confidential information.
* ''Informative'': This type of policy informs employees of certain topics. It is not an enforceable policy, but rather one to teach individuals about specific issues relevant to the company. It could explain how the company interacts with partners, the company's goals and mission, and a general reporting structure in different situations.

'''Types of Security Policies'''
* Organizational  
** Management establishes how a security program will be set up, lays out the program's goals, assigns responsibilities, shows the strategic and tactical value of security, and outlines how enforcement should be carried out.
** Provides scope and direction for all future security activities within the organization.
** This policy must address relative laws, regulations, and liability issues and how they are to be satisfied.
** It also describes the amount of risk senior management is willing to accept.
** Characteristics 
***  Business objectives should drive the policy's creation, implementation, and enforcement. The policy should not dictate business objectives.
*** It should be an easily understood document that is used as a reference point for all employees and management.
*** It should be developed and used to integrate security into all business functions and processes.
*** It should be derived from and support all legislation and regulation applicable to the company.
*** It should be reviewed and modified as a company changes, such as through adoption of a new business model, merger with another company, or change of ownership.
*** Each iteration of the policy should be dated and under version control.
*** The units and individuals who are governed by the policy must have access to the applicable portions and not be expected to have to read all policy material to find direction and answers
* Issue-specific  
** Addresses specific security issues that management feels need more detailed explanation and attention to make sure a comprehensive structure is built and all employees understand how they are to comply with these security issues
** E.g.: An e-mail policy might state that management can read any employee's e-mail messages that reside on the mail server, but not when they reside on the user's workstation
* System-specific 
** Presents the management's decisions that are specific to the actual computers, networks, applications, and data. 
** This type of policy may provide an approved software list, which contains a list of applications that may be installed on individual workstations. 
** E.g.: This policy may describe how databases are to be used and protected, how computers are to be locked down, and how firewalls, IDSs, and scanners are to be employed.

====Standards====
* Standards refer to mandatory activities, actions, rules, or regulations. 
* Standards can give a policy its support and reinforcement in direction. 
* Standards could be internal, or externally mandated (government laws and regulations).

====Procedures====
* Procedures are detailed step-by-step tasks that should be performed to achieve a certain goal. 
* E.g.: we can write procedures on how to install operating systems, configure security mechanisms, implement access control lists, set up new user accounts, assign computer privileges, audit activities, destroy material, report incidents, and much more.
* Procedures are considered the lowest level in the policy chain because they are closest to the computers and users (compared to policies) and provide detailed steps for configuration and installation issues.
* Procedures spell out how the policy, standards, and guidelines will actually be implemented in an operating environment. 
* If a policy states that all individuals who access confidential information must be properly authenticated, the supporting procedures will explain the steps for this to happen by defining the access criteria for authorization, how access control mechanisms are implemented and configured, and how access activities are audited

====Baselines====
* A baseline can refer to a point in time that is used as a comparison for future changes. Once risks have been mitigated, and security put in place, a baseline is formally reviewed and agreed upon, after which all further comparisons and development are measured against it. 
* A baseline results in a consistent reference point.
* Baselines are also used to define the minimum level of protection that is required. 
* In security, specific baselines can be defined per system type, which indicates the necessary settings and the level of protection that is being provided. For example, a company may stipulate that all accounting systems must meet an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 4 baseline. 

  '''Security Note''' : Baselines that are not technology-oriented should be created and enforced within organizations
  as well. For example, a company can mandate that all employees must have a badge with a picture ID in view while in the 
  facility at all times. It can also state that visitors must sign in at a front desk and be escorted while in the facility. 
  If these are followed, then this creates a baseline of protection.

====Guidelines====
* Guidelines are recommended actions and operational guides to users, IT staff, operations staff, and others when a specific standard does not apply. 
* Guidelines can deal with the methodologies of technology, personnel, or physical security.

====Putting It All Together====
* A policy might state that access to confidential data must be audited. A supporting guideline could further explain that audits should contain sufficient information to allow for reconciliation with prior reviews. Supporting procedures would outline the necessary steps to configure, implement, and maintain this type of auditing.
* policies are strategical(long term) while standards, guidelines and procedures are tactical(medium term).

===Organizational Security Models===
Some of the best practices that facilitate the implementation of security controls include Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT), ISO/IEC 17799/BS 7799, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), and Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE). 
====COSO====
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is a U.S. private-sector initiative, formed in 1985. Its major objective is to identify the factors that cause fraudulent financial reporting and to make recommendations to reduce its incidence. COSO has established a common definition of internal controls, standards, and criteria against which companies and organizations can assess their control systems.

'''Key concepts of the COSO framework'''
* Internal control is a ''process''. It is a means to an end, not an end in itself.
* Internal control is affected by ''people''. It’s not merely policy manuals and forms, but people at every level of an organization. 
* Internal control can be expected to provide only ''reasonable assurance'', not absolute assurance, to an entity's management and board.
* Internal control is geared to the achievement of ''objectives'' in one or more separate but overlapping categories.

The COSO framework defines internal control as a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide '''reasonable assurance regarding''' the achievement of '''objectives''' in the following categories: 
* Effectiveness and efficiency of '''operations'''
* Reliability of '''financial reporting'''
* '''Compliance''' with applicable laws and regulations.

'''COSO Internal Control Framework: the five components'''

According to the COSO framework, internal control consists of five interrelated components. These components provide an effective framework for describing and analyzing the internal control system implemented in an organization. The five components are the following:

* '''Control Environment''': The control environment sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control consciousness of its people. It is the foundation for all other components of internal control, providing discipline and structure. Control environment factors include the integrity, ethical values, management's operating style, delegation of authority systems, as well as the processes for managing and developing people in the organization.

* '''Risk assessment''': Every entity faces a variety of risks from external and internal sources that must be assessed. A precondition to risk assessment is establishment of objectives and thus risk assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant risks to achievement of assigned objectives. Risk assessment is a prerequisite for determining how the risks should be managed. 

* '''Control activities''': Control activities are the policies and procedures that help ensure management directives are carried out. They help ensure that necessary actions are taken to address risks to achievement of the entity's objectives. Control activities occur throughout the organization, at all levels and in all functions. They include a range of activities as diverse as approvals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations, reviews of operating performance, security of assets and Separation of duties/segregation of duties.

* '''Information and communication''': Information systems play a key role in internal control systems as they produce reports, including operational, financial and compliance-related information, that make it possible to run and control the business. In a broader sense, effective communication must ensure information flows down, across and up the organization. Effective communication should also be ensured with external parties, such as customers, suppliers, regulators and shareholders.

* '''Monitoring''': Internal control systems need to be monitored--a process that assesses the quality of the system's performance over time. This is accomplished through ongoing monitoring activities or separate evaluations. Internal control deficiencies detected through these monitoring activities should be reported upstream and corrective actions should be taken to ensure continuous improvement of the system.

====ITIL====
The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a set of concepts and techniques for managing information technology (IT) infrastructure, development, and operations.

ITIL is published in a series of books, each of which cover an IT management topic

'''Overview and Benefits'''

ITIL provides a systematic and professional approach to the management of IT service provision. Adopting its guidance offers users a huge range of benefits that include:
* reduced costs; 
* improved IT services through the use of proven best practice processes; 
* improved customer satisfaction through a more professional approach to service delivery; 
* standards and guidance; 
* improved productivity; 
* improved use of skills and experience; and 
* improved delivery of third party services through the specification of ITIL or ISO 20000 as the standard for service delivery in services procurements.

'''ITIL v3'''

The ITIL v3 which was published in May 2007, comprises 5 key volumes:
#. Service Strategy 
#. Service Design 
#. Service Transition 
#. Service Operation 
#. Continual Service Improvement

====COBIT 4.X ====

The Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT 4.X) is a set of best practices (framework) for information technology (IT) management created by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), and the IT Governance Institute (ITGI) in 1992. COBIT provides managers, auditors, and IT users with a set of generally accepted measures, indicators, processes and best practices to assist them in maximizing the benefits derived through the use of information technology and developing appropriate IT governance and control in a company.

'''Overview'''
* COBIT has 34 high level processes that cover 210 control objectives categorized in four domains: 
** Planning and Organization
** Acquisition and Implementation
** Delivery and Support
** Monitoring
* COBIT provides benefits to managers, IT users, and auditors 
** Managers benefit from COBIT because it provides them with a foundation upon which IT related decisions and investments can be based. Decision making is more effective because COBIT aids management in defining a strategic IT plan, defining the information architecture, acquiring the necessary IT hardware and software to execute an IT strategy, ensuring continuous service, and monitoring the performance of the IT system. 
** IT users benefit from COBIT because of the assurance provided to them by COBIT's defined controls, security, and process governance. 
** COBIT benefits auditors because it helps them identify IT control issues within a company's IT infrastructure. It also helps them corroborate their audit findings.

'''COBIT structure'''
* ''Plan and Organize'': The Planning and Organization domain covers the use of information &amp; technology and how best it can be used in a company to help achieve the company's goals and objectives.  It also highlights the organizational and infrastructural form IT is to take in order to achieve the optimal results and to generate the most benefits from the use of IT.  
* ''Acquire and Implement'': The Acquire and Implement domain covers identifying IT requirements, acquiring the technology, and implementing it within the company's current business processes.   This domain also addresses the development of a maintenance plan that a company should adopt in order to prolong the life of an IT system and its components. 
* ''Delivery and Support'': The Delivery and Support domain focuses on the delivery aspects of the information technology.  It covers areas such as the execution of the applications within the IT system and its results, as well as, the support processes that enable the effective and efficient execution of these IT systems.   These support processes include security issues and training. 
* ''Monitor and Evaluate'': The Monitoring and Evaluation domain deals with a company's strategy in assessing the needs of the company and whether or not the current IT system still meets the objectives for which it was designed and the controls necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.   Monitoring also covers the issue of an independent assessment of the effectiveness of IT system in its ability to meet business objectives and the company's control processes by internal and external auditors.

====ISO/IEC 27000 Series (Formerly BS 7799/ISO 17799)====
Tracking the history of the ISO/IEC 27000-series of standards is somewhat of a challenge. This section provides the history of the ISO standard for information security management that began with BS 7799 and later resulted in ISO 17799 and eventually the ISO 27000 &quot;family of standards&quot; for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). Like the other control and governance models, the ISO 27000 series provides a set of guidelines and best practices for information security management. The standards are the product of ISO/IEC JTC1 (Joint Technical Committee 1) SC27 (Sub Committee 27), an international body that meets in person twice a year. The International Standards Organization (ISO) also develops standards for quality control, environmental protection, product usability, manufacturing, etc.

=====BS 7799=====
The BS 7799 is basically divided into 3 Parts
* '''BS 7799 Part 1''' was a standard originally published as BS 7799 by the British Standards Institute (BSI) in 1995.
** It was eventually adopted by ISO as '''ISO/IEC 17799''', &quot;Information Technology - Code of practice for information security management.&quot; in 2000. 
** ISO/IEC 17799 was most recently revised in June 2005 and was renamed to '''ISO/IEC 27002''' in July 2007.
* '''BS 7799 Part 2''' of BS7799 was first published by BSI in 1999, known as BS 7799 Part 2, titled &quot;Information Security Management Systems - Specification with guidance for use.&quot; It is focused on how to implement an Information security management system (ISMS)
** The 2002 version of BS 7799-2 introduced the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) (Deming quality assurance model), aligning it with quality standards such as ISO 9000. 
** BS 7799 Part 2 was adopted by ISO as '''ISO/IEC 27001''' in November 2005.
* '''BS 7799 Part 3''' was published in 2005, covering risk analysis and management. It '''aligns with ISO/IEC 27001'''.

=====ISO 17799=====
* Derived from BS 7799
* It is an internationally recognized ISM standard that provide high level, conceptual recommendations  on enterprise security
* ISO 17799 has 2 parts
** Part-I is an implementation guide with guidelines on how to build a comprehensive information security infrastructure.
** Part-II is an auditing guide based on requirements that must be met for an organization to be deemed complaint with ISO 17799
* ISO 17799 domains
** ''Information security policy for the organization'': Map of business objectives to security, management's support, security goals, and responsibilities.
** ''Creation of information security infrastructure'': Create and maintain an organizational security structure through the use of security forum, security officer, defining security responsibilities, authorization process, outsourcing, and independent review.
** ''Asset classification and control'':  Develop a security infrastructure to protect organizational assets through accountability and inventory, classification, and handling procedures.
** ''Personnel security'': Reduce risks that are inherent in human interaction by screening employees, defining roles and responsibilities, training employees properly, and documenting the ramifications of not meeting expectations.
** ''Physical and environmental security'': Protect the organization's assets by properly choosing a facility location, erecting and maintaining a security perimeter, implementing access control, and protecting equipment.
** ''Communications and operations management'': Carry out operations security through operational procedures, proper change control, incident handling, separation of duties, capacity planning, network management, and media handling.
** ''Access control'': Control access to assets based on business requirements, user management, authentication methods, and monitoring.
** ''System development and maintenance'': Implement security in all phases of a system's lifetime through development of security requirements, cryptography, integrity, and software development procedures.
** ''Business continuity management'': Counter disruptions of normal operations by using continuity planning and testing.
** ''Compliance'': Comply with regulatory, contractual, and statutory requirements by using technical controls, system audits, and legal awareness.

=====ISO 27000 Series=====
The ISO/IEC 27000-series (also known as the 'ISMS Family of Standards' or 'ISO27k' for short) comprises information security standards published jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

The series provides best practice recommendations on information security management, risks and controls within the context of an overall Information Security Management System (ISMS), similar in design to management systems for quality assurance (the ISO 9000 series) and environmental protection (the ISO 14000 series).

The series is deliberately broad in scope, covering more than just privacy, confidentiality and IT or technical security issues. It is applicable to organizations of all shapes and sizes. All organizations are encouraged to assess their information security risks, then implement appropriate information security controls according to their needs, using the guidance and suggestions where relevant. Given the dynamic nature of information security, the ISMS concept incorporates continuous feedback and improvement activities, summarized by Deming's &quot;plan-do-check-act&quot; approach, that seek to address changes in the threats, vulnerabilities or impacts of information security incidents.

The following are the currently published 27000-series standards:
*'''ISO 27000''' ''Overview and vocabulary'' overview and glossary of terms.
*'''ISO 27001''' ''Information security management systems -- Requirements''. This is the specification/requirements for an information security management system (an ISMS) which replaced the old BS7799-2 standard	
*'''ISO 27002''' ''Code of practice for information security management''. This is the 27000 series standard number of what was originally the ISO 17799 standard (which itself was formerly known as BS7799-1).
*'''ISO 27003'''  ''Information security management system implementation guidance''.This will be the official number of a new standard intended to offer guidance for the implementation of an ISMS (IS Management System) . 	
*'''ISO 27004'''  ''Information security management -- Measurement''. This standard covers information security system management measurement and metrics, including suggested ISO27002 aligned controls..
*'''ISO 27005'''  ''Information security risk management''.This is the methodology independent ISO standard for information security risk management..	
*'''ISO 27006'''  ''Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security management systems''. This standard provides guidelines for the accreditation of organizations offering ISMS certification.

Other 27000-series ISO publications:
*'''ISO 27011''' ''Information security management guidelines for telecommunications organizations based on ISO/IEC 27002 
*'''ISO 27033''' ''Network security -- Part 1: Overview and concepts'' 
*'''ISO 27799''' ''Health informatics -- Information security management in health using ISO/IEC 27002'' 

Although the list of ISO 27000-series standards for information security management continues to grow in number. ''ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27001'' remain the most used standards, because they provide the most basic guidance for an enterprise information security program practices and processes and also because they are the most current versions of their popular predecessors (BS 7799 and ISO 17799).

=='''Organizational Behavior'''==
===Organizational Structure Evolution===
* Today's Security Organizational Structure
===Best Practices===
====Job Rotation====
Job Rotation is an approach to management development where an individual is moved through a schedule of assignments designed to give him or her a breath of exposure to the entire operation.

Job rotation is also practiced to allow qualified employees to gain more insights into the processes of a company and to increase job satisfaction through job variation.

====Separation of Duties====
Separation of duties (SoD) is the concept of having more than one person required to complete a task. It is alternatively called segregation of duties or, in the political realm, separation of powers.


'''***WARNING***''' WARNING about SOD possible shortcomings ******  
This approach can lead to a high level of difficulty when trying to determine what the underlying causes of errors or failures in large scale entity's production automation as no person will be able to view the information flow process from the &quot;big picture&quot; and how an automated program starts an application that is not creating the correct output data but not clearly failing to an error message alert running on a Virtual Server client that transports the data file that is created to an outside client and etc. etc. etc. 
Especially as each separated department individual will just glance at their application software used to manage their specified section on their monitor screen and seeing no obvious errors assume the unknown error causing complete system or process failure problem is not within their section and go back to the practice of effective communicating while writing all the great accomplishments they delivered that furthered the entity's stated goals to have available for their next review with management because that's what HR told them to do. (Not that this behavior is faulty or wrong in any sense and it is actually doing what the entity's incentives are geared to encourage not only for advancement but to keep a job as well.)
 
Without those few and far between expert level techs who can have (or get) the administration rights to view all aspects of any given production process it will be nearly impossible to determine the underlying cause and can lead to outrageous decisions as to what the problem must of been. 
(For example: deciding to quit using all virtual servers and go back to multiple actual server machines with each connected to it's on monitor all because no error handling was encoded in the in-house written .net program.) 
(Or nobody realizing the automated software machine was running into RAM issues because every automated job was set to auto start at exactly 6:00 and MS Windows has a built in limit of a maximum of 10 network connections at one time even at the enterprise level and so forth.)  
'''***'''These SOD positions are of no interest to those high level technical experts who seek to be constantly challenged.'''***'''

'''Overview'''
* SoD in basic terms that is no single individuals should have controls over two or more phases of a transaction or operation, so that a deliberate fraud is more difficult to occur because it requires collusion of two or more individuals or parties.
* With the concept of SoD, business critical duties can be categorized into four types of functions, authorization, custody, record keeping and reconciliation. In a perfect system, no one person should handle more than one type of function.
* In information systems, segregation of duties helps reduce the potential damage from the actions of one person. IS or end-user department should be organized in a way to achieve adequate separation of duties
'''Control Mechanisms to enforce SoD'''

There are several control mechanisms that can help to enforce the segregation of duties:
* Audit trails enable IT managers or Auditors to recreate the actual transaction flow from the point of origination to its existence on an updated file. Good audit trails should be enabled to provide information on who initiated the transaction, the time of day and date of entry, the type of entry, what fields of information it contained, and what files it updated. 
* Reconciliation of applications and an independent verification process is ultimately the responsibility of users, which can be used to increase the level of confidence that an application ran successfully. 
* Exception reports are handled at supervisory level, backed up by evidence noting that exceptions are handled properly and in timely fashion. A signature of the person who prepares the report is normally required. 
* Manual or automated system or application transaction logs should be maintained, which record all processed system commands or application transactions. 
* Supervisory review should be performed through observation and inquiry and the trust built with directory one-level up managers. 
* To compensate repeated mistakes or intentional failures by following a prescribed procedure, independent reviews are recommended. Such reviews can help detect errors and irregularities but are usually expensive can raise questions as to how much can an outside independent review once a quarter know about your processes compared to people within and what level of trust can be built with those independent reviewers.

====Least Privilege (Need to Know)====
'''Introduction'''

The principle of least privilege, also known as the principle of minimal privilege or just least privilege, requires that in a particular abstraction layer of a computing environment every module (such as a process, a user or a program on the basis of the layer we are considering) must be able to access only such information and resources that are necessary to its legitimate purpose.

'''Note:''' This principle is a useful security tool, but it has never been successful at enforcing high assurance security on a system. 

'''Benefits'''
* ''Better system stability''. When code is limited in the scope of changes it can make to a system, it is easier to test its possible actions and interactions with other applications. In practice for example, applications running with restricted rights will not have access to perform operations that could crash a machine, or adversely affect other applications running on the same system. 
* ''Better system security''. When code is limited in the system-wide actions it may perform, vulnerabilities in one application cannot be used to exploit the rest of the machine. For example, Microsoft states “Running in standard user mode gives customers increased protection against inadvertent system-level damage caused by &quot;shatter attacks&quot; and malware, such as root kits, spyware, and undetectable viruses.” [1] 
* ''Ease of deployment''. In general, the fewer privileges an application requires the easier it is to deploy within a larger environment. This usually results from the first two benefits, applications that install device drivers or require elevated security privileges typically have addition steps involved in their deployment, for example on Windows a solution with no device drivers can be run directly with no installation, while device drivers must be installed separately using the Windows installer service in order to grant the driver elevated privileges

====Mandatory Vacations====
Mandatory vacations of one to two weeks are used to audit and verify the work tasks and privileges of
employees. This often results in easy detection of abuse, fraud, or negligence.

====Job Position Sensitivity====

===Security Roles and Responsibilities===
====Levels of Responsibilities====
* Senior management and other levels of management understand the vision of the company, the business goals, and the objectives. 
* Functional management, whose members understand how their individual departments work, what roles individuals play within the company, and how security affects their department directly. 
* Operational managers and staff. These layers are closer to the actual operations of the company. They know detailed information about the technical and procedural requirements, the systems, and how the systems are used. The employees at these layers understand how security mechanisms integrate into systems, how to configure them, and how they affect daily productivity. 

====Classification of Roles and their Responsibilities====
'''Data Owner'''
* The data owner (information owner) is usually a member of management, in charge of a specific business unit, and is ultimately responsible for the protection and use of a specific subset of information. 
* The data owner decides upon the classification of the data that he is responsible for and alters that classification if the business needs arise. 
* This person is also responsible for ensuring that the necessary security controls are in place, ensuring that proper access rights are being used, defining security requirements per classification and backup requirements, approving any disclosure activities, and defining user access criteria. 
* The data owner approves access requests or may choose to delegate this function to business unit managers. And it is the data owner who will deal with security violations pertaining to the data he is responsible for protecting. 
* The data owner, who obviously has enough on his plate, delegates responsibility of the day-to-day maintenance of the data protection mechanisms to the data custodian.

'''Data Custodian'''
* The data custodian (information custodian) is responsible for maintaining and protecting the data. 
* This role is usually filled by the IT department, and the duties include performing regular backups of the data, periodically validating the integrity of the data, restoring data from backup media, retaining records of activity, and fulfilling the requirements specified in the company's security policy, standards, and guidelines that pertain to information security and data protection.

'''System Owner'''
* The system owner is responsible for one or more systems, each of which may hold and process data owned by different data owners. 
* A system owner is responsible for integrating security considerations into application and system purchasing decisions and development projects. 
* The system owner is responsible for ensuring that adequate security is being provided by the necessary controls, password management, remote access controls, operating system configurations, and so on. 
* This role needs to ensure that the systems are properly assessed for vulnerabilities and must report any to the incident response team and data owner.
Security Administrator
* A security administrator's tasks are many, and include creating new system user accounts, implementing new security software, testing security patches and components, and issuing new passwords. 
* The security administrator role needs to make sure that access rights that are given to users support the policies and data owner directives.

'''Security Analyst'''
* This role works at a higher, more strategic level than the previously described roles and helps to develop policies, standards, and guidelines and set various baselines. 
* Whereas the previous roles are &quot;in the weeds&quot; and focusing on their pieces and parts of the security program, a security analyst helps define the security program elements and follows through to ensure that the elements are being carried out and practiced properly. This person works more at a design level than at an implementation level.

'''Application Owner'''
* An application owner, usually the business unit managers, are responsible for dictating who can and cannot access their applications, like the accounting software, software for testing and development etc.

'''Supervisor'''
* This role, also called user manager, is ultimately responsible for all user activity and any assets created and owned by these users like ensuring that all his employees understand their responsibilities with respect to security, distributing initial passwords, making sure that the employees' account information is up-to-date, and informing the security administrator when an employee is fired, suspended, or transferred. 

'''Change Control Analyst'''
* The change control analyst is responsible for approving or rejecting requests to make changes to the network, systems, or software. 
* This role needs to make sure that the change will not introduce any vulnerability, that it has been properly tested, and that it is properly rolled out. 
* The change control analyst needs to understand how various changes can affect security, interoperability, performance, and productivity. 

'''Data Analyst'''
* The data analyst is responsible for ensuring that data is stored in a way that makes the most sense to the company and the individuals who need to access and work with it. 
* The data analyst role may be responsible for architecting a new system that will hold company information or advising in the purchase of a product that will do this. 
* The data analyst works with the data owners to help ensure that the structures that are set up coincide with and support the company's business objectives.

'''Process Owner'''
* Security should be considered and treated like just another business process. The process owner is responsible for properly defining, improving upon, and monitoring these processes. 
* A process owner is not necessarily tied to one business unit or application. Complex processes involve a lot of variables that can span across different departments, technologies, and data types.

'''Solution Provider'''
* This role is called upon when a business has a problem or requires that a process be improved upon. 
* A solution provider works with the business unit managers, data owners, and senior management to develop and deploy a solution to reduce the company's pain points.

'''User'''
* The user is any individual who routinely uses the data for work-related tasks. 
* The user must have the necessary level of access to the data to perform the duties within their position and is responsible for following operational security procedures to ensure the data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability to others.

'''Product Line Manager'''
* Responsible for explaining business requirements to vendors and wading through their rhetoric to see if the product is right for the company
* Responsible for ensuring compliance to license agreements
* Responsible for translating business requirements into objectives and specifications for the developer of a product or solution
* Decides if his company really needs to upgrade their current systems 
* This role must understand business drivers, business processes, and the technology that is required to support them. 
* The product line manager evaluates different products in the market, works with vendors, understands different options a company can take, and advises management and business units on the proper solutions that are needed to meet their goals.

'''Responsibilities of the Information Security Officer'''
* Communicate Risks to Executive Management
* Budget for Information Security Activities
* Ensure Development of Policies, Procedures, Baselines, Standards, and Guidelines
* Develop and Provide Security Awareness Program
* Understand Business Objectives
* Maintain Awareness of Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities
* Evaluate Security Incidents and Response
* Develop Security Compliance Program
* Establish Security Metrics
* Participate in Management Meetings
* Ensure Compliance with Government Regulations
* Assist Internal and External Auditors
* Stay Abreast of Emerging Technologies

===Reporting Model===
* Business Relationships
* Reporting to the CEO
* Reporting to the Information Technology (IT) Department
* Reporting to Corporate Security
* Reporting to the Administrative Services Department
* Reporting to the Insurance and Risk Management Department
* Reporting to the Internal Audit Department
* Reporting to the Legal Department
* Determining the Best Fit
===Enterprise-wide Security Oversight===
====Defining the Goals====
* Vision Statement
* Mission Statement
====Security Planning====
* Strategic Planning
* Tactical Planning
* Operational and Project Planning
====Personnel Security====
There are many facets of personnel responsibilities that fall under management's umbrella and several of these facets have a direct correlation to the overall security of the environment such as 
* Hiring the most qualified individuals
* Performing background checks of the personnel using detailed job descriptions
* Providing necessary training
* Enforcing strict access controls, and 
* Terminating individuals in a way that protects all parties involved.

'''Hiring Practices'''

Depending on the position that needs to be filled, a level of screening should be done by human resources to ensure that the company hires the right individual for the right job. 
* Skills should be tested and evaluated, and the caliber and character of the individual should be examined. 
* Nondisclosure agreements need to be developed and signed by new employees to protect the company and its sensitive information. 
* Any conflicts of interests need to be addressed, and there should be different agreements and precautions taken with temporary and contract employees.
* References should be checked, military records should be reviewed, education should be verified, and if necessary, a drug test should be administered. 
* Many times, important personal behaviors can be concealed, and that is why hiring practices should include scenario questions, personality tests, and observations of the individual, instead of just looking at a person's work history. 

'''Employee Controls'''
* A management structure must be in place to make sure that everyone has someone to report to and that the responsibility for another person's actions is spread equally and intelligently. 
* Consequences for noncompliance or unacceptable behavior must be communicated before an event takes place. 
* Proper supervisory skills need to be acquired and used to ensure that operations go smoothly and any out-of-the-ordinary activities can be taken care of before they get out of control.
* Rotation of duties should be employed in order keep control of each department in a healthy and productive state. No one person should stay in one position for a long period of time because they may end up having too much control over a segment of the business thus resulting in a fraud, data modification, and misuse of resources. 
* Employees in sensitive areas should be forced to take their vacation, which is known as a mandatory vacation policy, giving the scope for the other individual in his place who can usually detect any fraudulent errors or activities. 
* Two variations of separation of duties and control are split knowledge and dual control. 
** In both cases, two or more individuals are authorized and required to perform a duty or task. 
** In the case of split knowledge, no one person knows or has all the details to perform a task. 
** In the case of dual control, two individuals are again authorized to perform a task, but both must be available and active in their participation to complete the task or mission. 

'''Termination'''
* Companies should have a specific set of procedures to follow with each and every termination.

=='''Security Awareness, Training, and Education'''==
===Conducting A Formal Security Awareness Training===
'''The Need'''

The management's directives pertaining to security are captured in the security policy, and the standards, procedures, and guidelines are developed to support these directives. However, these directives will not be effective if no one knows about them and how the company expects them to be implemented. 
* For security to be successful and effective, senior management on down to the rest of the staff needs to be fully aware of the importance of enterprise and information security. 
* All employees should understand the underlying significance of security and the specific security related requirements expected out of them.
* The controls and procedures of a security program should reflect the nature of the data being processed. 
* The security program should be developed in a fashion that makes sense for the different cultures and environments.
* The security program should communicate the what, how, and why of security to its employees.
* Security-awareness training should be comprehensive, tailored for specific groups, and organization-wide with a goal that each employee understands the importance of security to the company as a whole and to each individual.
* Expected responsibilities and acceptable behaviors need to be clarified, and noncompliance repercussions, which could range from a warning to dismissal, need to be explained before being invoked.

'''Diffferent Types of Security Awareness Trainings'''

There are usually at least three separate audiences for a security-awareness program: management, staff, and technical employees.
* Each type of awareness training needs to be geared toward the individual audience to ensure that each group understands its particular responsibilities, liabilities, and expectations.
* Members of management would benefit the most from a short, focused security awareness orientation that discusses corporate assets and financial gains and losses pertaining to security.
* Mid-management would benefit from a more detailed explanation of the policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines and how they map to the individual departments for which they are responsible. 
* Middle managers should be taught why their support for their specific departments is critical and what their level of responsibility is for ensuring that employees practice safe computing activities. They should also be shown how the consequences of noncompliance by individuals who report to them can affect the company as a whole and how they, as managers, may have to answer for such indiscretions.
* The technical departments must receive a different presentation that aligns more to their daily tasks. They should receive a more in-depth training to discuss technical configurations, incident handling, and indications of different types of security compromises so they can be properly recognized.
* Employees should not try to combat an attacker or address fraudulent activities by themselves instead they should be told to report these issues to upper management, and upper management should determine how to handle the situation.
* The presentation given to staff members needs to demonstrate why security is important to the company and to them individually. The better they understand how insecure activities can negatively affect them, the more willing they will be to participate in preventing such activities. 
* It is usually best to have each employee sign a document indicating that they have heard and understand all the security topics discussed and understand the ramifications of noncompliance.
* Security training should happen periodically and continually. 

'''Evaluating The Program'''

Security-awareness training is a type of control, and just like any other control it should be monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness. 
* After the employees attend awareness training, a company may give them questionnaires and surveys to gauge their retention level and to get their feedback about the training, to evaluate the program's effectiveness. 
* A good indication of the effectiveness of the program can be captured by comparing the number of reports of security incidents that were made before and after the training.  
* For online training, capture individuals' names and what training modules have or have not been completed within a specific time period. This can then be integrated into their job performance documentation.
* Security-awareness training must repeat the most important messages in different formats, be kept up-to-date, be entertaining, positive, and humorous, be simple to understand, and--most important--be supported by senior management. 

'''Specialized Training Programs'''
* Train the individuals to use specialized devices and technologies.
* Different roles require different types of training (firewall administration, risk management, policy development, IDSs, and so on). A skilled staff is one of the most critical components to the security of a company, and not enough companies are spending the funds and energy necessary to give their staffs proper levels of security education.

'''Training Topics'''

'''What Might a Course in Security Awareness Look Like?'''

===Awareness Activities and Methods===

'''Job Training'''

'''Professional Education'''

'''Performance Metrics'''

=='''Information Risk Management'''==
Information risk management (IRM) is the process of identifying and assessing risk, realizing the limitations in reducing it to an acceptable level, and implementing the right mechanisms to maintain that level.
===Risk Management Concepts===
'''Categories of Risks'''
* ''Physical damage''- Fire, water, vandalism, power loss, and natural disasters
* ''Human interaction''- Accidental or intentional action or inaction that can disrupt productivity
* ''Equipment malfunction''- Failure of systems and peripheral devices
* ''Inside and outside attacks''- Hacking, cracking, and attacking
* ''Misuse of data''- Sharing trade secrets, fraud, espionage, and theft
* ''Loss of data''- Intentional or unintentional loss of information through destructive means
* ''Application error''- Computation errors, input errors, and buffer overflows
* ''Social Status''- Loss of Customer base and reputation

  '''Security Tip''': The threats need to be identified, classified by category, and evaluated to calculate their 
  actual magnitude of potential loss. Real risk is hard to measure, (more accurately stated it is hard to accept) 
  but prioritizing the potential risks in order of which risk needs to be addressed first is attainable

'''Defining a Risk Management Policy'''
* The IRM policy provides the infrastructure for the organization's risk management processes and procedures.
* Characteristics of an IRM policy
** It should address all issues of information security, from personnel screening and the insider threat to physical security and firewalls. 
** It should provide direction on how the IRM team relates information on company risks to senior management and how to properly execute management's decisions on risk mitigation tasks.
** The IRM policy should be a subset of the organization's overall risk management policy and should be mapped to the organizational security policies. 
* The IRM policy should address the following items:
** Define the objectives of IRM team
** Level of risk the company will accept and what is considered an acceptable risk
** Formal processes of risk identification
** Connection between the IRM policy and the organization's strategic planning processes
** Responsibilities that fall under IRM and the roles that are to fulfill them
** Mapping of risk to internal controls
** Approach for changing staff behaviors and resource allocation in response to risk analysis
** Mapping of risks to performance targets and budgets
** Key indicators to monitor the effectiveness of controls

'''Risk Management Practices'''

A risk management team should have the ability and follow the best practices, some of them which include
* Establishing a risk acceptance level as provided by senior management
* Documenting risk assessment processes and procedures 
* Establishing proper procedures for identifying and mitigating risks
* Getting support from senior management for appropriate resource and fund allocation 
* Defining contingency plans where assessments indicate that they are necessary
* Ensure that security-awareness training is provided for all staff members associated with information assets.
* Strive to establish improvement (or risk mitigation) in specific areas when necessary
* Should map legal and regulation compliancy requirements to control and implement requirements
* Develop metrics and performance indicators to be able to measure and manage various types of risks
* Identify and assess new risks as the environment and company changes
* Integrate IRM and the organization's change control process to ensure that changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities

===Risk Handling Strategies===
As it is impossible to have a system or an environment to be 100 percent secure, there should be an acceptable level of risk. 

'''Residual Risk vs. Total Risk'''
* ''Residual Risk'': Where there is always some risk left over to deal with. 
* ''Total Risk'': Where there are no risk measure and the risk is 100%. These type of risk is acceptable when the cost/benefit analysis results indicate that this is the best course of action
* ''The Relation'':
** Threats*Vulnerability*Asset Value = Total Risk
** Threats*Vulnerability*Asset Value* Control Gap= Residual Risk

'''Ways to deal with Risk'''

There are four basic ways of dealing with risks: 
* Transfer it: If a company's total or residual risk is too high and it purchases an insurance then it is  transfer of risk to the insurance company
* Reject it: If a company is in denial about its risk or ignore it, it is rejecting the risk
* Reduce it: If a company implements countermeasures, it is reducing the risk
* Accept it: If a company understands the risk and decides not to implement any kind of countermeasures it is accepting the risk. And this is actually what all computer systems boil down to. There is no way to mitigate the risk if the system is going to connect to the internet. Having only one user without any networking with others computer systems is the closet you can ever get to not having any risks.

Once given console access (sitting at the actual hardware device be it computer, server, router) there is no security that can keep a skilled person from getting into that system. Not one. '''This is the &quot;beginning of knowledge&quot; of computer system security. And increasing knowledge increases sorrow.''' 

These two things you must accept as they are the facts. If you can't handle these two absolute facts like an adult maybe you should go do something else. Try becoming an actor maybe, or poet, but do not continue with believing you have any computer security knowledge if you can't get into this mindset. It's OK not everyone can handle dealing with the truth, it's hard, uncomfortable and it literally hurts (that feeling of pain is called cognitive indifference.)

===Risk Assessment/Analysis===
Risk analysis is a method of identifying vulnerabilities and threat and assessing the possible damage to determine where to implement security safeguards

'''Why Risk Analysis?'''
* To ensure that security is cost effective, relevant, timely, and responsive to threat.
* To provide a cost/benefit comparison, this compares the annualized cost of safeguards to the potential cost of loss. 
* Help integrate the security program objectives with the company's business objectives and requirements
* To provide an economic balance between the impact of the threat and the cost of the countermeasure.

'''The Risk Analysis Activities'''
* Identifying assets and their values
* Identifying the vulnerabilities and threats
* Analyze the risk- Two approaches
** Quantitative Approach
** Qualitative Approach
* Selecting and Implementing a countermeasure

====Identifying The Risk Elements====

'''Identifying Assets and Their Values'''
* Kinds of assets
** Tangible: measurable - computers, facilities, supplies
** Intangible: immeasurable, difficult to assess - reputation, intellectual property.
* Factors to be considered during assessing the value of information and assets.
** Cost to acquire or develop the assets
** Cost to maintain and protect the assets
** Value of the asset to owners and users
** Value of the asset to adversaries
** Value of intellectual property that went into developing the information
** Price others are willing to pay for the asset
** Cost to replace the asset if lost
** Operational and production activities that are affected if the asset is unavailable
** Liability issues if the asset is compromised
** Usefulness and role of the asset in the organization
* Need for determining the value of assets
** To perform effective cost/benefit analyses
** To select specific countermeasures and safeguards
** To determine the level of insurance coverage to purchase
** To understand what exactly is at risk
** To conform to due care and comply with legal and regulatory requirements

'''Identify the Vulnerabilities and Threats'''

There are many types of threat agents that can take advantage of several types of vulnerabilities, resulting in a variety of specific threats
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;

|-
|}

====A Quantitative Approach to Risk Analysis====
* Quantitative analysis uses risk calculations that attempt to predict the level of monetary losses and percentage of chance for each type of threat.
* Quantitative risk analysis also provides concrete probability percentages when determining the likelihood of threats. 
* Each element within the analysis (asset value, threat frequency, severity of vulnerability, impact damage, safeguard costs, safeguard effectiveness, uncertainty, and probability items) is quantified and entered into equations to determine total and residual risks. 
* Purely quantitative risk analysis is not possible, because the method attempts to quantify qualitative items, and there are always uncertainties in quantitative values

'''Sample Steps for a Quantitative Risk Analysis'''
* Step 1: Assign Value to Assets- For each asset, answer the following questions to determine its value
** What is the value of this asset to the company?
** How much does it cost to maintain?
** How much does it make in profits for the company?
** How much would it be worth to the competition?
** How much would it cost to re-create or recover?
** How much did it cost to acquire or develop?
** How much liability are you under pertaining to the protection of this asset?
* Step 2: Estimate Potential Loss per Threat- To estimate potential losses posed by threats, answer the   following questions:
** What physical damage could the threat cause and how much would that cost?
** How much loss of productivity could the threat cause and how much would that cost?
** What is the value lost if confidential information is disclosed?
** What is the cost of recovering from this threat?
** What is the value lost if critical devices were to fail?
** What is the single loss expectancy (SLE) for each asset, and each threat?
* Step 3: Perform a Threat Analysis- Take the following steps to perform a threat analysis
** Gather information about the likelihood of each threat taking place from people in each department, past records, and official security resources that provide this type of data.
** Calculate the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO), which is how many times the threat can take place in a 12-month period.
* Step 4: Derive the Overall Loss Potential per Threat-To derive the overall loss potential per threat, do   the following:
** Combine potential loss and probability.
** Calculate the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) per threat by using the information calculated in the first three steps.
** Choose remedial measures to counteract each threat.
** Carry out cost/benefit analysis on the identified countermeasures.
* Step 5: Reduce, Transfer, or Accept the Risk- For each risk, you can choose whether to reduce, transfer, or accept the risk:
** Risk reduction methods
*** Install security controls and components.
*** Improve procedures.
*** Alter environment.
*** Provide early detection methods to catch the threat as it's happening and reduce the possible damage it can cause.
*** Produce a contingency plan of how business can continue if a specific threat takes place, reducing further damages of the threat.
*** Erect barriers to the threat.
*** Carry out security-awareness training.
** Risk transfer- Buy insurance to transfer some of the risk, for example.
** Risk acceptance- Live with the risks and spend no more money toward protection.

'''Quantitative Risk Analysis Metrics'''
* Single loss expectancy (SLE) - The amount of loss due to a single occurrence of a threat.
* Annualized loss expectancy (ALE) - The estimated loss per annum.
* Exposure factor (EF) - Represents the percentage of loss a realized threat could have on a certain asset.
* Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) – It is the value that represents the estimated frequency of a specific threat taking place within a one-year timeframe. It can range from 0.0 to 1.0. 
* The Relation
** Asset value * exposure factor (EF) = SLE
*** Example: If a data warehouse has the asset value of $150,000, and if it is estimated that if a fire were to occur, 25 percent of the warehouse would be damaged, then SLE =0.25*$150000=$37,500. 
** SLE * Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) = ALE. If ARO is 0.1 (indicating once in ten years), then the ALE =$37,500* 0.1 = $3750. This tells the company that if it wants to put in controls or safeguards to protect the asset from this threat, it can sensibly spend $3750 or less per year to provide the necessary level of protection. 

'''Results of a Quantitative Risk Analysis'''

The following is a short list of what generally is expected from the results of a risk analysis
* Monetary values assigned to assets
* Comprehensive list of all possible and significant threats
* Probability of the occurrence rate of each threat
* Loss potential the company can endure per threat in a 12-month time span 
* Recommended safeguards, countermeasures, and actions analysis.

'''Quantitative Pros'''
* Requires more complex calculations 
* Is easier to automate and evaluate 
* Used in risk management performance tracking 
* Provides credible cost/benefit analysis 
* Shows clear-cut losses that can be accrued within one year's time

'''Quantitative Cons'''
* Calculations are more complex. Can management understand how these values were derived?
* Without automated tools, this process is extremely laborious.
* Big need to gather detailed information about environment.
* Standards are not available. Each vendor has its own way of interpreting the processes and their results.

====A Qualitative Approach to Risk Analysis====

* In Qualitative approach, we walk through different scenarios of risk possibilities and rank the seriousness of the threats and the validity of the different possible countermeasures.
* The Qualitative analysis techniques include judgment, best practices, intuition, and experience. 
* Qualitative Risk Analysis Techniques 
** Delphi -A group decision method used to ensure that each member gives an honest opinion of what he or she thinks the result to a particular threat will be. This method is used to obtain an agreement on cost, loss values, and probabilities of occurrence without individuals having to agree verbally.
** Brainstorming
** Storyboarding
** Focus groups
** Surveys
** Questionnaires
** Checklists
** One-on-One meetings
** Interviews. 
* The risk analysis team will determine the best technique for the threats that need to be assessed and the culture of the company and individuals involved with the analysis.
* The team that is performing the risk analysis gathers personnel who have experience and education on the threats being evaluated. When this group is presented with a scenario that describes threats and loss potential, each member responds with their gut feeling and experience on the likelihood of the threat and the extent of damage that may result.

'''Qualitative Pros'''
* Requires simple calculations 
* Involves high degree of guesswork 
* Provides general areas and indications of risk 
* Provides the opinions of the individuals who know the processes best 

'''Qualitative Cons'''
* The assessments and results are basically subjective.
* Usually eliminates the opportunity to create a dollar value for cost/benefit discussions.
* Difficult to track risk management objectives with subjective measures.
* Standards are not available. Each vendor has its own way of interpreting the processes and their results.

====Selecting and Implementing a Countermeasure====

'''Countermeasure Selection'''
* A security countermeasure should be cost effective and should be decided based on some cost/benefit analysis.
* A commonly used cost/benefit calculation for a given safe guard is: 
(ALE before implementing safeguard) – (ALE after implementing safeguard) – (annual cost of safeguard) = value of safeguard to the company

'''Functionality and Effectiveness of Countermeasures'''

The following shows some of the characteristics to be considered before committing for a safeguard mechanism 
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
!Characteristic 
!Description
|-
|Modular in nature 
|It can be installed or removed from an environment without adversely affecting other mechanisms.
|-
|Provides uniform protection 
|A security level is applied to all mechanisms it is designed to protect in a standardized method.
|-
|Provides override functionality 
|An administrator can override the restriction if necessary.
|-
|Defaults to least privilege 
|When installed, it defaults to a lack of permissions and rights instead of installing with everyone having full control.
|-
|Independence of safeguard and the asset it is protecting
|The safeguard can be used to protect different assets, and different assets can be protected by different safeguards.
|-
|Flexibility and security 
|The more security the safeguard provides, the better. This functionality should come with flexibility, which enables you
to choose different functions instead of all or none.
|-
|Clear distinction between user and administrator
|A user should have fewer permissions when it comes to configuring or disabling the protection mechanism.
|-
|Minimum human intervention 
|When humans have to configure or modify controls, this opens the door to errors. The safeguard should require the least
amount of input from humans as possible.
|-
|Easily upgraded 
|Software continues to evolve, and updates should be able to happen painlessly.
|-
|Auditing functionality 
|There should be a mechanism that is part of the safeguard that provides minimum and/or verbose auditing.
|-
|Minimizes dependence on other components
|The safeguard should be flexible and not have strict requirements about the environment into which it will be installed.
|-
|Easily usable, acceptable, and tolerated by personnel
|If the safeguards provide barriers to productivity or add extra steps to simple tasks, users will not tolerate it.
|-
|Must produce output in usable and understandable format
|Important information should be presented in a format easy for humans to understand and use for trend analysis.
|-
|Must be able to reset safeguard
|The mechanism should be able to be reset and returned to original configurations and settings without affecting the system or asset it is protecting.
|-
|Testable 
|The safeguard should be able to be tested in different environments under different situations.
|-
|Does not introduce other compromises
|The safeguard should not provide any covert channels or back doors.
|-
|System and user performance 
|System and user performance should not be greatly affected.
|-
|Proper alerting 
|Thresholds should be able to be set as to when to alert personnel of a security breach, and this type of alert should
be acceptable.
|-
|Does not affect assets 
|The assets in the environment should not be adversely affected by the safeguard.

=='''Information Classification'''==
===Introduction===
* After identifying the information to be protected, it is necessary to classify the information and organize it according to its sensitivity to loss, disclosure or unavailability.
* The primary purpose of data classification is to indicate the protection level of confidentiality, Integrity and Availability required for each type of dataset.
* Data classification helps to ensure that the data is protected in the most cost-effective manner.
* Each classification should have separate handling requirements and procedures pertaining to how that data is accessed, used, and destroyed.
===Classification Types===
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
!Classification 
!Definition 
!Examples 
!Organization That Would Use This
|-
|Public 
|• Disclosure is not welcome, but it would not cause an adverse impact to company or personnel.
|• How many people are working on a specific project • Upcoming projects 
|Commercial business
|-
|Sensitive 
|• Requires special precautions to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data by protecting it from unauthorized
modification or deletion. • Requires higher than normal assurance of accuracy and |completeness.

|-
|Private 
|• Personal information for use within a company. • Unauthorized disclosure could adversely affect personnel. or company
|• Work history • Human resources information • Medical information

|-
|}

===Guidelines for Information Classification===
* The classification should neither be a long list nor be too restrictive and detailed-oriented.
* Each classification should be unique and should not have any overlappings.
* The classification process should outline how information and applications are and handled throughout their life cycle.

===Criteria for Information Classification===
* Usefulness of data
* Value of data
* Age of data
* The level of damage that could be caused if the data were disclosed
* The level of damage that could be caused if the data were modified or corrupted
* Legal, regulatory, or contractual responsibility to protect the data
* Effects the data has on national security
* Who should be able to access the data
* Who should maintain the data
* Where the data should be kept
* Who should be able to reproduce the data
* What data requires labels and special marking
* Whether encryption is required for the data
* Whether separation of duties is required
* Which Backup Strategy is appropriate
* Which Recovery Strategy is appropriate
 
  '''Security Note''': An organization needs to make sure that whoever is backing up classified data--and whoever has access 
  to backed-up data--has the necessary clearance level. A large security risk can be introduced if low-end technicians with 
  no security clearance can have access to this information during their tasks. Backups contain all your data and deserve the 
  same considerations in terms of security risk as the entire infrastructure because that is exactly what it is only in a single
  location, often stored as a single file and usually with little thought put into what are the risks involved with that appliance.

===Data Classification Procedures===

The following outlines the necessary steps for a proper classification program:
* Define classification levels.
* Specify the criteria that will determine how data is classified.
* Have the data owner indicate the classification of the data she is responsible for.
* Identify the data custodian who will be responsible for maintaining data and its security level.
* Indicate the security controls, or protection mechanisms, that are required for each classification level.
* Document any exceptions to the previous classification issues. 
* Indicate the methods that can be used to transfer custody of the information to a different data owner.
* Create a procedure to periodically review the classification and ownership. Communicate any changes to the data custodian.
* Indicate termination procedures for declassifying the data.
* Integrate these issues into the security-awareness program so that all employees understand how to handle data at different classification levels.
* [http://trustedtoolkit.com/Documents/DataClassificationPolicySample.pdf DataClassificationPolicySample]

===Classification Controls===

The type of control implemented per classification depends upon the level of protection that management and the security team have determined is needed. Some of the controls are :
* Strict and granular access control for all levels of sensitive data and programs 
* Encryption of data while stored and while in transmission 
* Auditing and monitoring (determine what level of auditing is required and how long logs are to be retained)
* Separation of duties (determine whether two or more people need to be involved in accessing sensitive information to protect against fraudulent activities; if so, define and document procedures)
* Periodic reviews (review classification levels, and the data and programs that adhere to them, to ensure that they are still in alignment with business needs; data or applications may also need to be reclassified or declassified, depending upon the situation)
* Backup and recovery procedures (define and document)
* Change control procedures (define and document)
* File and file system access permissions (define and document)

=='''Ethics'''==
Ethics is the field of study concerned with questions of value, that is,judgments about what type of human behavior is “good” or “bad” in any given situation. Ethics are the standards, values, morals, principles, etc.,on which to base one's decisions or actions; often, there is no clear “right” or “wrong” answer.
===Basic Concepts===
'''Computer Ethics'''

The term &quot;computer ethics&quot; is open to interpretations both broad and narrow. 
* On the narrow side, computer ethics might be understood as the efforts of professional philosophers to apply traditional ethical theories like utilitarianism, Kantianism, or virtue ethics to issues regarding the use of computer technology. 
* On the broad side, it can be understood as a standards of professional practice, codes of conduct, aspects of computer law, public policy, corporate ethics--even certain topics in the sociology and psychology of computing

===Professional Code of Ethics===
Certified professionals, including those holding the CISSP, are held morally,and sometimes legally, to a higher standard of ethical behavior. In promoting proper computing behavior within the industry and the confines of our corporate boundaries, professionals should incorporate ethics into their organizational policies and awareness programs. 

Several organizations have addressed the issue of ethical behavior through ethics guidelines. These include organizations such as 
* The Computer Ethics Institute, 
* The Internet Activities Board, 
* The International Computer Security Association,
* The Information Systems Security Association, and 
* The (ISC)2 Code of Ethics.
====Computer Ethics Institute====
'''The CEI Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics'''
# Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.
# Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work.
# Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.
# Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.
# Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness.
# Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid.
# Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.
# Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output.
# Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing.
# Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.
====Internet Architecture Board====
The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is the coordinating committee for Internet design, engineering, and management. It is an independent committee of researchers and professionals with a technical interest in the health and evolution of the Internet. 

* IAB has two principal subsidiary task forces: 
**  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and
**  The Internet Research Task Force (IRFT). 

The IAB issues ethics-related statements concerning the use of the Internet.It considers the Internet to be a resource that depends upon availability and accessibility to be useful to a wide range of people. It is mainly concerned with irresponsible acts on the Internet that could threaten its existence or negatively affect others. It sees the Internet as a great gift and works hard to protect it for all who depend upon it. IAB sees the use of the Internet as a privilege, which should be treated as such and used with respect.

* IAB considers the following acts as unethical and unacceptable behavior:
** Purposely seeking to gain unauthorized access to Internet resources
** Disrupting the intended use of the Internet
** Wasting resources (people, capacity, and computers) through purposeful actions
** Destroying the integrity of computer-based information
** Compromising the privacy of others
** Conducting Internet-wide experiments in a negligent manner

====The (ISC)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Code of Ethics====
All information systems security professionals who are certified by (ISC)2 recognize that such certification is a privilege that must be both earned and maintained. In support of this principle, all Certified Information Systems Security Professionals (CISSPs) commit to fully support this Code of Ethics. CISSPs who intentionally or knowingly violate any
provision of the Code will be subject to action by a peer review panel, which may result in the revocation of certification.

'''Code of Ethics Preamble:'''
* Safety of the commonwealth, duty to our principals, and to each other requires that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior.
* Therefore, strict adherence to this code is a condition of certification.
'''Code of Ethics Canons:'''
* Protect society, the commonwealth, and the infrastructure.
* Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.
* Provide diligent and competent service to principals.
* Advance and protect the profession.
'''The Code of Ethics'''
* '''''Protect society, the commonwealth, and the infrastructure'''''
** Promote and preserve public trust and confidence in information and systems.
** Promote the understanding and acceptance of prudent information security measures.
** Preserve and strengthen the integrity of the public infrastructure.
** Discourage unsafe practice.
* '''''Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally'''''
** Tell the truth; make all stakeholders aware of your actions on a timely basis.
** Observe all contracts and agreements, express or implied.
** Treat all constituents fairly. In resolving conflicts, consider public safety and  duties to principals, individuals, and the profession in that order.
** Give prudent advice; avoid raising unnecessary alarm or giving unwarranted comfort. Take care to be truthful, objective, cautious, and within your competence.
** When resolving differing laws in different jurisdictions, give preference to the laws of the jurisdiction in which you render your service.
* '''''Provide diligent and competent service to principals'''''
** Preserve the value of their systems, applications, and information.
** Respect their trust and the privileges that they grant you.
** Avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof.
** Render only those services for which you are fully competent and qualified.
* '''''Advance and protect the profession'''''

** Take care not to injure the reputation of other professionals through malice or indifference.
** Maintain your competence; keep your skills and knowledge current. Give generously of your time and knowledge in training others.

===Example Topics in Computer Ethics===
====Computers in the Workplace====
'''Computers posing threat to Traditional Jobs'''

As a &quot;universal tool&quot; that can, in principle, perform almost any task, computers obviously pose a threat to jobs. 
* Although computers occasionally need repair, they don't require sleep, they don't get tired, they don't go home ill or take time off for rest and relaxation. At the same time, computers are often far more efficient than humans in performing many tasks. Therefore, economic incentives to replace humans with computerized devices are very high. 
* In the industrialized world many workers already have been replaced by computerized devices and even professionals like medical doctors, lawyers, teachers, accountants and psychologists are finding that computers can perform many of their traditional professional duties quite effectively. 
* The employment outlook, however, is not all bad. In the short run, computer-generated unemployment will be an important social problem; but in the long run, information technology will create many more jobs than it eliminates.
* Even when a job is not eliminated by computers, it can be radically altered by &quot;de-skilling&quot; the workers and turning them into passive observers and button pushers. 

* Hopefully as the knowledge spreads showing there is no reason for the scarcity driven economics (i.e. man made gold by radiating form of mercury patented USA 1942 and similar accomplishments for diamonds, oil, etc) the world can move away from the dehumanizing practices of the past and let the automated computer systems do the work the plebs, peasants, slaves, and working poor have performed for way too long. But we must always stay vigilant for the abuses of power that stem from the &quot;equal rights for all but entitlements for me&quot; human flaw anyone of us can succumb to which brings such terrible destruction upon societies. And since we are all inherently lazy (would you usually walk to the most farthest away source of water when thirsty as opposed to the closest potable source) we can be assured it will be difficult to keep.

'''Health and Safety at Workplace'''
* Another workplace issue concerns health and safety. According to Forester and Morrison, when information technology is introduced into a workplace, it is important to consider likely impacts upon health and job satisfaction of workers who will use it. It is possible, for example, that such workers will feel stressed trying to keep up with high-speed computerized devices -- or they may be injured by repeating the same physical movement over and over -- or their health may be threatened by radiation emanating from computer monitors. These are just a few of the social and ethical issues that arise when information technology is introduced into the workplace.

====Computer Crime====
'''Security Aspects behind the Crime'''

In this era of computer &quot;viruses&quot; and international spying by &quot;hackers&quot; who are thousands of miles away, it is clear that computer security is a topic of concern in the field of Computer Ethics. The problem is not so much the physical security of the hardware (protecting it from theft, fire, flood, etc.), but rather &quot;logical security&quot;, which according to Spafford, Heaphy and Ferbrache are divide into five aspects: 
* Privacy and confidentiality 
* Integrity -- assuring that data and programs are not modified without proper authority 
* Unimpaired service 
* Consistency -- ensuring that the data and behavior we see today will be the same tomorrow 
* Controlling access to resources 
'''Challenges'''

Malicious kinds of software, or &quot;programmed threats&quot;, provide a significant challenge to computer security. These include 
* ''viruses'', which cannot run on their own, but rather are inserted into other computer programs; 
* ''worms'' which can move from machine to machine across networks, and may have parts of themselves running on different machines; 
* ''Trojan horses'' which appear to be one sort of program, but actually are doing damage behind the scenes;
* ''logic bombs'' which check for particular conditions and then execute when those conditions arise; and 
* ''bacteria'' or ''rabbits'' which multiply rapidly and fill up the computer's memory. 

'''Trusted Persons/Security clearance Persons vs Hackers/Whackers'''
* Computer crimes, such as embezzlement, financial fraud within exchanges, interest rate manipulations or planting of logic bombs, are normally committed by trusted personnel who have permission to use the computer system and/or access to classified information. Computer security, therefore, must also be concerned with the actions of trusted computer users and those with confidential security clearances. 

The higher the trusted level/security clearance access or the higher level within an organization's hierarchy the larger the risk of more extreme damage in terms of costs and security while having the opposite effect in terms of the likelihood for getting caught in the criminal act decrease exponentially. And even more concerning is the chance of actually having criminally charges brought against the once &quot;most trusted&quot; but now criminal falls virtually to zero at the very top levels as those criminals will settle before charges get filed for a fraction of the amount stolen with no damage coming to their reputation whatsoever thus allowing them to maintain that &quot;most trusted&quot; status. This is clearly the most worrisome not just for those within an organization but for all people within a nation or union of nations bound by financial/economic trade agreements since they are based on trust and could lead to large scale wars between those nations. Is there an all inclusive-systems risk more frightening than this?      

* Hackers/Whackers breaks into someone's computer system without permission by way of unknown security risks. Some intentionally steal data or commit vandalism, while others merely &quot;explore&quot; the system to see how it works and what files it contains. These &quot;explorers&quot; often claim to be benevolent defenders of freedom and fighters against rip-offs by major corporations or spying by rogue government agents. Some think of themselves as performing charity wok for the more &quot;IT-challeneged&quot; users of information systems who either through ignorance or just laziness don't find the risks themselves. These self-appointed vigilantes/charity workers of cyberspace say they do no harm, and claim to be helpful to society by exposing security risks for the users who just don't have the natural ability or skills to find them for their selves and for those that are willfully ignorant and just don't put forth the effort. 

Some are of the opinion every act of hacking is harmful, because any known successful penetration of a computer system requires the owner to thoroughly check for damaged or lost data and programs. They claim even if the hacker did indeed make no changes, the computer's owner must run through a costly and time-consuming investigation of the compromised system. While others would claim (and is actually stated in separate security section within this page above) that the data/systems/application owners should already be performing routine checks for damaged or lost data or compromised programs and applications. These people ask would you rather have a benign intruder that found a way to penetrate your computer/network systems and also lets you know of the potential security flaw or have a criminal intruder penetrate your system with intent to steal possibly millions of dollars from you or your customers before you had any clue of the risk you were taking or the risks you were placing on your customers/clients/confidential and or proprietary data? And if you are of the latter opinion should you be held financial or criminally responsible since you willingly prefer this option?

====Privacy and Anonymity====
'''The Privacy Concern'''

Privacy is one of the earliest computer ethics topics to arouse public interest. 
* The ease and efficiency with which computers and computer networks can be used to gather, store, search, compare, retrieve and share personal information make computer technology especially threatening to anyone who wishes to keep various kinds of &quot;sensitive&quot; information (e.g., medical records) out of the public domain or out of the hands of those who are perceived as potential threats. 

'''Factors exposing the Privacy'''

Some of the factors that increases the concern of Privacy are
* Commercialization and rapid growth of the internet; 
* The rise of the world-wide-web; 
* Increasing &quot;user-friendliness&quot; of Computers and Applications 
* Processing power of computers; 
* Decreasing costs of computer technology 
* Data-mining and data matching, 
* Recording of &quot;click trails&quot; on the web etc.

'''Anonymity'''

Anonymity on the internet is sometimes discussed in the same context with questions of privacy on the internet, because anonymity can provide many of the same benefits as privacy.For example, if someone is using the internet to obtain medical or psychological counseling, or to discuss sensitive topics (for example, AIDS), anonymity can afford protection similar to that of privacy. Similarly, both anonymity and privacy on the internet can be helpful in preserving human values such as security, mental health, self-fulfillment and peace of mind. Unfortunately, privacy and anonymity also can be exploited to facilitate unwanted and undesirable computer-aided activities in cyberspace, such as money laundering, drug trading, terrorism, or preying upon the vulnerable.

====Intellectual Property====
'''The Argument'''

One of the more controversial areas of computer ethics concerns the intellectual property rights connected with software ownership. 
* Some people, like Richard Stallman who started the Free Software Foundation, believe that software hoarding should not be allowed at all. He claims that all programs distributed to the public should be free, and all programs distributed to the public should be available for copying, studying and modifying by anyone who wishes to do so. 
* Some argue that software companies or programmers would not invest weeks and months of work and significant funds in the development of software if they could not get the investment back in the form of license fees or sales. Although the Free Open Source Software that is created and maintained for free by thousands worldwide seems to have clearly disproved these claims over the last 20 years.  

'''The Scenario'''
*Today's software industry is a multibillion dollar part of the economy; and software companies claim to lose billions of dollars per year through illegal copying (&quot;software piracy&quot;). 
* Many people think that software should be ownable, but &quot;casual copying&quot; of personally owned programs for one's friends should also be permitted. 
* The software industry claims that millions of dollars in sales are lost because of such copying. Ownership is a complex matter, since there are several different aspects of software that can be owned and three different types of ownership: copyrights, trade secrets, and patents. One can own the following aspects of a program: 
** The &quot;source code&quot; which is written by the programmer(s) in a high-level computer language like Java or C++. 
** The &quot;object code&quot;, which is a machine-language translation of the source code. 
** The &quot;algorithm&quot;, which is the sequence of machine commands that the source code and object code represent. 
** The &quot;look and feel&quot; of a program, which is the way the program appears on the screen and interfaces with users. 
* A very controversial issue today is owning a patent on a computer algorithm. 
** A patent provides an exclusive monopoly on the use of the patented item, so the owner of an algorithm can deny others use of the mathematical formulas that are part of the algorithm. 
** Mathematicians and scientists are outraged, claiming that algorithm patents effectively remove parts of mathematics from the public domain, and thereby threaten to cripple science. 

'''The Challenge'''
* Running a preliminary &quot;patent search&quot; to make sure that your &quot;new&quot; program does not violate anyone's software patent is a costly and time-consuming process and the level of confidence that can be achieved with this search outside of a courtroom is literally nil. As a result, only very large companies with big budgets can afford to run such a search or afford the costly court battles. This effectively eliminates many small software companies, stifling competition and decreasing the variety and quality of programs available to the society.

====Professional Responsibility====
Computer professionals have specialized knowledge and often have positions with authority and respect in the community. Along with such power to change the world comes the duty to exercise that power responsibly. Computer professionals find themselves in a variety of professional relationships with other people including: 
* employer -- employee 
* client -- professional 
* professional -- professional 
* society -- professional 

These relationships involve a diversity of interests, and sometimes these interests can come into conflict with each other. Responsible computer professionals, therefore, will be aware of possible conflicts of interest and try to avoid them and strive to remember everyone involved is human and to have empathy. A good way to think at all times is by asking oneself, is that how I would want to be treated if I was in their position? 

Professional organizations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), also have established codes of ethics, curriculum guidelines and accreditation requirements to help computer professionals understand and manage ethical responsibilities.

====Globalization====
Computer ethics today is rapidly evolving into a broader and even more important field, which might reasonably be called &quot;global information ethics&quot;. 

For the first time in the history of the earth, ethics and values are debated and transformed in a context that is not limited to a particular geographic region, or constrained by a specific religion or culture. This may very well be one of the most important social developments in history but some of the issues like Global Laws, Global Cyberbusiness, Global Education, Information Rich and Information Poor etc. are a growing concern for the networked world.

===Common Computer Ethics Fallacies===
The lack of early, computer-oriented childhood rearing and conditioning has led to several pervasive fallacies. The generation of computer users includes those from 7 to 70 years old who use computing and other information technologies. Like all fallacies, some people are heavily influenced by them, and some are less so. Some of the common fallacies which are probably the most important are
* The Computer Game Fallacy
* The Law-Abiding Citizen Fallacy
* The Shatterproof Fallacy
* The Candy-from-a-Baby Fallacy
* The Hacker's Fallacy
* The Free Information Fallacy

=== Hacking and Hacktivism===
A hacker is a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular. 
====The Hacker Ethics====
The two most common but not widely accepted hacker ethics are
* The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source code and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible. 
* The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.

''Access controls'' are security features that control how users and systems communicate and interact with other systems and resources.

''Access'' is the flow of information between a subject and an object. 

A ''subject'' is an active entity that requests access to an object or the data within an object. E.g.: user, program, process etc. 

An ''object'' is a passive entity that contains the information. E.g.: Computer, Database, File, Program etc.

Access controls give organization the ability to control, restrict, monitor, and protect resource availability, integrity and confidentiality

===Access Control Challenges===
* ''Various types of users need different levels of access'' - Internal users, contractors, outsiders, partners, etc.
* ''Resources have different classification levels''- Confidential, internal use only, private, public, etc.
* ''Diverse identity data must be kept on different types of users'' - Credentials, personal data, contact information, work-related data, digital certificates, cognitive passwords, etc.
* ''The corporate environment is continually changing''- Business environment needs, resource access needs, employee roles, actual employees, etc.

===Access Control Principles===
* ''Principle of Least Privilege'': States that if nothing has been specifically configured for an individual or the groups, he/she belongs to, the user should not be able to access that resource i.e.Default no access
* ''Separation of Duties''
* ''Need to know '': It is based on the concept that individuals should be given access only to the information that they absolutely require in order to perform their job duties

===Access Control Criteria===
The criteria for providing access to an object include
* Roles 
* Groups
* Location 
* Time
* Transaction Type
===Access Control Practices===
* Deny access to systems by undefined users or anonymous accounts.
* Limit and monitor the usage of administrator and other powerful accounts.
* Suspend or delay access capability after a specific number of unsuccessful logon attempts.
* Remove obsolete user accounts as soon as the user leaves the company.
* Suspend inactive accounts after 30 to 60 days.
* Enforce strict access criteria.
* Enforce the need-to-know and least-privilege practices.
* Disable unneeded system features, services, and ports.
* Replace default password settings on accounts.
* Limit and monitor global access rules.
* Ensure that logon IDs are nondescriptive of job function.
* Remove redundant resource rules from accounts and group memberships.
* Remove redundant user IDs, accounts, and role-based accounts from resource access lists.
* Enforce password rotation.
* Enforce password requirements (length, contents, lifetime, distribution, storage, and transmission).
* Audit system and user events and actions and review reports periodically.
* Protect audit logs.

=='''Security Principles'''==
* Fundamental Principles (CIA)
* Identification
* Authentication
* Authorization
* Non Repudiation

=='''Identification Authentication and Authorization'''==
''Identification'' describes a method of ensuring that a subject is the entity it claims to be. E.g.: A user name or an account no.

''Authentication'' is the method of proving the subjects identity. E.g.: Password, Passphrase, PIN

''Authorization'' is the method of controlling the access of objects by the subject. E.g.: A user cannot delete a particular file after logging into the system

'''Note:''' There must be a three step process of Identification, Authentication and Authorization in order for a subject to access an object

===Identification and Authentication===
====Identification Component Requirements====
When issuing identification values to users or subjects, ensure that 
* Each value should be unique, for user accountability
* A standard naming scheme should be followed
* The values should be non-descriptive of the users position or task
* The values should not be shared between the users.

====Authentication Factors====
There are 3 general factors for authenticating a subject.
* Something a person knows-  E.g.: passwords, PIN- least expensive, least secure
* Something a person has – E.g.: Access Card, key- expensive, secure
* Something a person is- E.g.: Biometrics- most expensive, most secure

'''Note:''' For a strong authentication to be in process, it must include two out of the three authentication factors- also referred to as two factor authentication.

====Authentication Methods====
=====Biometrics=====
* Verifies an individuals identity by analyzing a unique personal attribute or behavior
* It is the most effective and accurate method for verifying identification.
* It is the most expensive authentication mechanism
* Types of Biometric Systems
** ''Finger Print''- are based on the ridge endings, bifurcation exhibited by the friction edges and some minutiae of the finger 
** ''Palm Scan''- are based on the creases, ridges, and grooves that are unique in each individuals palm
** Hand Geometry- are based on the shape (length, width) of a persons hand and fingers
** ''Retina Scan''- is based on the blood vessel pattern of the retina on the backside of the eyeball.
** ''Iris Scan''- is based on the colored portion of the eye that surrounds the pupil. The iris has unique patterns, rifts, colors, rings, coronas and furrows.
** ''Signature Dynamics''- is based on electrical signals generated due to physical motion of the hand during signing a document 
** ''Keyboard Dynamics''- is based on electrical signals generated while the user types in the keys (passphrase) on the keyboard.
** ''Voice Print''- based on human voice 
** ''Facial Scan''- based on the different bone structures, nose ridges, eye widths, forehead sizes and chin shapes of the face.
** ''Handy Topography''- based on the different peaks, valleys, overall shape and curvature of the hand.
* Types of Biometric Errors
** ''Type I Error'': When a biometric system rejects an authorized individual ( false rejection rate)
** ''Type II Error'': When a biometric systems accepts imposters who should be rejected (false acceptance rate)
** Crossover Error Rate (CER): The point at which the false rejection rate equals false acceptance rate. It is also called as Equal Error Rate (EER).

=====Passwords=====
* It is the most common form of system identification and authentication mechanism
* A password is a protected string of characters that is used to authenticate an individual
* Password Management
** Password should be properly guaranteed, updated, and kept secret to provide and effective security
** Passwords generators can be used to generate passwords that are uncomplicated, pronounceable, non-dictionary words.
** If the user chooses his passwords, the system should enforce certain password requirement like insisting to use special char, no of char, case sensitivity etc. )
* Techniques for Passwords Attack
** Electronic monitoring- Listening to network traffic to capture information, especially when a user is sending her password to an authentication server. The password can be copied and reused by the attacker at another time, which is called a replay attack.
** Access the password file- Usually done on the authentication server. The password file contains many users’ passwords and, if compromised, can be the source of a lot of damage. This file should be protected with access control mechanisms and encryption.
** Brute force attacks Performed with tools that cycle through many possible character, number, and symbol combinations to uncover a password.
** Dictionary attacks Files of thousands of words are used to compare to the user’s password until a match is found.
** Social engineering An attacker falsely convinces an individual that she has the necessary authorization to access specific resources
* Password checkers can be used to check the strength of the password by trying to break into the system
* Passwords should be encrypted and hashed
* Password aging should be implemented
* No of logon attempts should be limited

=====Cognitive Passwords=====
* Cognitive passwords are facts or opinion-based information used to verify an individual identity (e.g.: mothers maidens name)
* This is best used for helpdesk services, and occasionally used services.

=====One-Time or Dynamic Passwords=====
* It is a token based system used for authentication purposes where the service is used only once
* It is used in environments that  require a higher level of security than static password provides
* Types of token generators
** Synchronous (e.g.: SecureID) - A synchronous token device/generator synchronizes with the authentication service by any of the two means. 
*** Time Based: In this method the token device and the authentication service must hold the same time within their internal clocks. The time value on the token device and a secret key are used to create a one time password. This password is decrypted by the server and compares it to the value that is expected.
*** Counter Based: In this method the user will need to initiate the logon sequence on the computer and push a button on the token device. This causes the token device and the authentication service to advance to the next authentication value. This value and a base secret are hashed and displayed to the user. The user enters this resulting value along with a user ID to be authenticated. 
** Asynchronous: A token device that is using an asynchronous token-generating method uses a challenge/response scheme to authenticate the user. In this situation, the authentication server sends the user a challenge, a random value also called a nonce. The user enters this random value into the token device, which encrypts it and returns a value that the user uses as a one-time password. The user sends this value, along with a username, to the authentication server. If the authentication server can decrypt the value and it is the same challenge value that was sent earlier, the user is authenticated
* Example: SecureID
** It is one of the most widely used time-based tokens from RSA Security
** It uses a time based synchronous two-factor authentication

=====Cryptographic Keys=====
* Uses private keys and Digital Signatures
* Provides a higher level of security than passwords.

=====Passphrase=====
* A passphrase is a sequence of characters that is longer than a password and in some cases, takes the place of a password during an authentication process.
* The application transforms the pass phrase into a virtual password and into a format required by the application
* It is more secure that passwords

=====Memory Cards=====
* Holds information but cannot process them
* More secure than passwords but costly
* E.g.: Swipe cards, ATM cards

=====Smart Cards=====
* Holds information and has the capability to process information and can provide a two factor authentication (knows and has)
* Categories of Smart Cards
** Contact
** Contactless
*** Hybrid- has 2 chips and supports both contact and contactless
*** Combi- has a microprocessor that can communicate with both a contact as well as a contact reader.
* More expensive and tamperproof than memory cards
* Types of smartcard attacks
** Fault generation: Introducing of computational errors into smart card with the goal of uncovering the encryption keys that are being used and stored on cards
** Side Channel Attacks: These are non-intrusive attacks and are used to uncover sensitive information about how a component works without trying to compromise any type of flaw or weakness. The following are some of the examples
*** Differential Power Analysis: Examining the power emission that are released during processing
*** Electromagnetic Analysis: Examining the frequency that are emitted
** Timing: How long a specific process takes to complete
** 	Software Attacks: Inputting instructions into the card that will allow for the attacker to extract account information. The following are some of the examples
*** Microprobing: Uses needles to remove the outer protective material on the cards circuits by using ultrasonic vibrations thus making it easy to tap the card ROM chip
* Smart Card Standards
** ISO/IEC 
*** 14443-1: Physical Characteristics
*** 14443-2: Radio frequency power and signal interface
*** 14443-3: Initialization and anti collision
*** 14443-4: Transmission protocol

===Identity Management===
* Identity Management is a broad term that encompasses the use of different products to identify, authenticate and authorize users through automated means.
* Identity management system is the management of the identity life cycle of entities (subjects or objects) during which:
* The identity is established: 
** a name (or number) is associated to the subject or object; 
** the identity is re-established: a new or additional name (or number) is connected to the subject or object; 
* The identity is described: 
** one or more attributes which are applicable to this particular subject or object may be assigned to the identity; 
** the identity is newly described: one or more attributes which are applicable to this particular subject or object may be changed; 
* The identity is destroyed.
* Identity Management Challenges
* Identity Management Technologies
* Authorization Principles

=='''Access Control Categories''' ==
Access controls can be implemented at various layers of a network and individual systems. 

The access controls can be classified into three layers or categories, each category having different access control mechanisms that can be carried out manually or automatically.
* Administrative Controls
* Physical Controls
* Technical or Logical Controls

Each category of access control has several components that fall within it, as described

===Administrative===
The administrative controls are defined by the top management in an organization. 
====Administrative Control Components====
'''Policy and Procedures'''
* A security policy is a high-level plan that states management’s intent pertaining to how security should be practiced within an organization, what actions are acceptable, and what level of risk the company is willing to accept. This policy is derived from the laws, regulations, and business objectives that shape and restrict the company. 
* The security policy provides direction for each employee and department regarding how security should be implemented and followed, and the repercussions for noncompliance. Procedures, guidelines, and standards provide the details that support and enforce the company’s security policy.

'''Personnel Controls'''
* Personnel controls indicate how employees are expected to interact with security mechanisms, and address noncompliance issues pertaining to these expectations. 
* Change of Status: These controls indicate what security actions should be taken when an employee is hired, terminated, suspended, moved into another department, or promoted. 
* Separation of duties: The separation of duties should be enforced so that no one individual can carry out a critical task alone that could prove to be detrimental to the company. 
Example: A bank teller who has to get supervisory approval to cash checks over $2000 is an example of separation of duties. For a security breach to occur, it would require collusion, which means that more than one person would need to commit fraud, and their efforts would need to be concerted. The use of separation of duties drastically reduces the probability of security breaches and fraud.
* Rotation of duties means that people rotate jobs so that they know how to fulfill the obligations of more than one position. Another benefit of rotation of duties is that if an individual attempts to commit fraud within his position, detection is more likely to happen if there is another employee who knows what tasks should be performed in that position and how they should be performed.

'''Supervisory Structure'''
* Management must construct a supervisory structure which enforces management members to be responsible for employees and take a vested interest in their activities. If an employee is caught hacking into a server that holds customer credit card information, that employee and her supervisor will face the consequences?

'''Security-Awareness Training'''
* This control helps users/employees understand hot to properly access resources, why access controls are in place and the ramification for not using the access controls properly.

'''Testing'''
* This control states that all security controls, mechanisms, and procedures are tested on a periodic basis to ensure that they properly support the security policy, goals, and objectives set for them. 
* The testing can be a drill to test reactions to a physical attack or disruption of the network, a penetration test of the firewalls and perimeter network to uncover vulnerabilities, a query to employees to gauge their knowledge, or a review of the procedures and standards to make sure they still align with business or technology changes that have been implemented.

====Examples of Administrative Controls====
* Security policy 
* Monitoring and supervising
* Separation of duties 
* Job rotation 
* Information classification
* Personnel procedures 
* Investigations 
* Testing 
* Security-awareness and training

===Physical===
Physical controls support and work with administrative and technical (logical) controls to supply the right degree of access control.
====Physical Control Components====
'''Network Segregation'''
* Network segregation can be carried out through physical and logical means. A section of the network may contain web servers, routers, and switches, and yet another network portion may have employee workstations. 
* Each area would have the necessary physical controls to ensure that only the permitted individuals have access into and out of those sections.

'''Perimeter Security'''
* The implementation of perimeter security depends upon the company and the security requirements of that environment. 
* One environment may require employees to be authorized by a security guard by showing a security badge that contains picture identification before being allowed to enter a section. Another   environment may require no authentication process and let anyone and everyone into different sections. 
* Perimeter security can also encompass closed-circuit TVs that scan the parking lots and waiting areas, fences surrounding a building, lighting of walkways and parking areas, motion detectors, sensors, alarms, and the location and visual appearance of a building. These are examples of perimeter security mechanisms that provide physical access control by providing protection for individuals, facilities, and the components within facilities.

'''Computer Controls'''
* Each computer can have physical controls installed and configured, such as locks on the cover so that the internal parts cannot be stolen, the removal of the floppy and CD-ROM drives to prevent copying of confidential information, or implementation of a protection device that reduces the electrical emissions to thwart attempts to gather information through airwaves.

'''Work Area Separation'''
* Some environments might dictate that only particular individuals can access certain areas of the facility.

'''Data Backups'''
* Backing up data is a physical control to ensure that information can still be accessed after an emergency or a disruption of the network or a system.

'''Cabling'''
* There are different types of cabling that can be used to carry information throughout a network. 
* Some cable types have sheaths that protect the data from being affected by the electrical interference of other devices that emit electrical signals. 
* Some types of cable have protection material around each individual wire to ensure that there is no crosstalk between the different wires. 
* All cables need to be routed throughout the facility in a manner that is not in people’s way or that could be exposed to any danger of being cut, burnt, crimped, or eavesdropped upon.

'''Control Zone '''
* It is a specific area that surrounds and protects network devices that emit electrical signals. These electrical signals can travel a certain distance and can be contained by a specially made material, which is used to construct the control zone. 
* The control zone is used to resist penetration attempts and disallow sensitive information to “escape” through the airwaves. 
* A control zone is used to ensure that confidential information is contained and to hinder intruders from accessing information through the airwaves. 
* Companies that have very sensitive information would likely protect that information by creating control zones around the systems that are processing that information

====Examples of Physical Control====
* Fences 
* Locks 
* Badge system 
* Security guard 
* Biometric system 
* Mantrap doors 
* Lighting 
* Motion detectors 
* Closed-circuit TVs 
* Alarms 
* Backups

===Technical===
Technical controls called logical controls are the s/w tools used to restrict subject’s access to objects.
They can be core OS components, add-on security packages, applications, n/w h/w devices, protocols, encryption mechanisms, and access control metrics.

They protect the integrity and availability of resources by limiting the number of subjects that can access them and protect the confidentiality of resources by preventing disclosure to unauthorized subjects.

====Technical Control Components====
'''System Access'''   
* In this type, control of access to resources is based on the sensitivity of data, clearance level of users, and user’s rights and permissions. As technical control for system access can be a user name password, Kerberos implementation, biometrics, PKI, RADIUS, TACACS or authentication using smartcards.

'''Network Access'''
* This control defines the access control mechanism to access the different network resources like the routers, switches, firewalls, bridges etc.

'''Encryption and protocols'''
* These controls are used to protect information as it passes throughout an n/w and resides on computers. They preserve the confidentiality and integrity of data and enforce specific paths for communication to take place.

'''Auditing'''
* These controls track activity within a n/w, on a n/w device or on a specific computer .They help to point out weakness of other technical controls and make the necessary changes.

'''Network Architecture'''
* This control defines the logical and physical layout of the network, and also the access control mechanisms between different n/w segments.

====Examples of Technical Controls====
* ACLs 
* Routers 
* Encryption 
* Audit logs 
* IDS 
* Antivirus software 
* Firewalls 
* Smart cards 
* Dial-up call-back systems
* Alarms and alerts

=='''Access Control Types''' ==
Each of the access control categories – administrative, physical and technical work at different levels, each at a different level of granularity and perform different functionalities based on the type. 

The different types of access control are
* Preventative- Avoid undesirable events from occurring
* Detective- Identify undesirable events that have occurred
* Corrective- Correct undesirable events that have occurred 
* Deterrent- Discourage security violations 
* Recovery- Restore resources and capabilities
* Compensative- Provide alternatives to other controls

=='''Access Control Threats'''==
===Denial of Service(DoS/DDoS)===
'''Overview'''
* A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. Although the means to, motives for, and targets of a DoS attack may vary, it generally consists of the concerted, malevolent efforts of a person or persons to prevent an Internet site or service from functioning efficiently or at all, temporarily or indefinitely.
* The purpose of DoS attacks is to force the targeted computer(s) to reset, or consume its resources so that it can no longer provide its intended service

'''Types of DoS Attacks'''

A DoS attack can be perpetrated in a number of ways. There are five basic types of attack:
* Consumption of computational resources, such as bandwidth, disk space, or CPU time; 
* Disruption of configuration information, such as routing information; 
* Disruption of state information, such as unsolicited resetting of TCP sessions; 
* Disruption of physical network components. 
* Obstructing the communication media between the intended users and the victim so that they can no longer communicate adequately. 

'''Countermeasures'''

Unfortunately, there are no effective ways to prevent being the victim of a DoS or DDoS attack, but there are steps you can take to reduce the likelihood that an attacker will use your computer to attack other computers: 
* Install and maintain anti-virus software. 
* Install a firewall, and configure it to restrict traffic coming into and leaving your computer. 
* Follow good security practices for distributing your email address.Applying email filters may help you manage unwanted traffic.

===Buffer Overflows===
'''Overview'''
* A buffer overflow is an anomalous condition where a process attempts to store data beyond the boundaries of a fixed-length buffer. The result is that the extra data overwrites adjacent memory locations. The overwritten data may include other buffers, variables and program flow data and may cause a process to crash or produce incorrect results. They can be triggered by inputs specifically designed to execute malicious code or to make the program operate in an unintended way. As such, buffer overflows cause many software vulnerabilities and form the basis of many exploits.

'''Buffer Overflow Techniques'''
* ''Stack Buffer Overflow''
** A stack buffer overflow occurs when a program writes to a memory address on the program's call stack outside of the intended data structure; usually a fixed length buffer.
** Stack buffer overflow bugs are caused when a program writes more data to a buffer located on the stack than there was actually allocated for that buffer. This almost always results in corruption of adjacent data on the stack, and in cases where the overflow was triggered by mistake, will often cause the program to crash or operate incorrectly.
** A technically inclined and malicious user may exploit stack-based buffer overflows to manipulate the program in one of several ways:
*** By overwriting a local variable that is near the buffer in memory on the stack to change the behaviour of the program which may benefit the attacker. 
*** By overwriting the return address in a stack frame. Once the function returns, execution will resume at the return address as specified by the attacker, usually a user input filled buffer. 
***By overwriting a function pointer,or exception handler, which is subsequently executed.

* ''Heap Buffer Overflow''
** A heap overflow is another type of buffer overflow that occurs in the heap data area. Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at run-time and typically contains program data.
** Exploitation goes as follows: If an application copies data without first checking to see if it fits into the chunk (blocks of data in the heap), the attacker could supply the application with a piece of data that is too large, overwriting heap management information (metadata) of the next chunk. This allows an attacker to overwrite an arbitrary memory location with four bytes of data. In most environments, this may allow the attacker control over the program execution.

'''Countermeasure'''
* Choice of programming language
* Use of safe libraries
* Stack-smashing protection which refers to various techniques for detecting buffer overflows on stack-allocated variables.The most common implementation being StackGuard, and SSP 
* Executable space protection which is the marking of memory regions as non-executable, such that an attempt to execute machine code in these regions will cause an exception. It makes use of hardware features such as the NX bit (Non Execute bit).
* Address space layout randomization: A technique which involves arranging the positions of key data areas, usually including the base of the executable and position of libraries, heap, and stack, randomly in a process' address space.
* Deep packet inspection:It is a form of computer network packet filtering that examines the data and/or header part of a packet as it passes an inspection point, searching for non-protocol compliance, viruses, spam, intrusions or predefined criteria to decide if the packet can pass or if it needs to be routed to a different destination, or for the purpose of collecting statistical information. It also called Content Inspection or Content Processing.



===Malicious Software===

===Password Crackers===

===Spoofing/Masquerading===
'''Overview'''
* A spoofing attack is a situation in which one person or program successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data and thereby gaining an illegitimate advantage.
* Popular Spoofing Techniques
** ''Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM):''An attack in which an attacker is able to read, insert and modify at will messages between two parties without either party knowing that the link between them has been compromised. The attacker must be able to observe and intercept messages going between the two victims
** ''IP address Spoofing'' : refers to the creation of IP packets with a forged (spoofed) source IP address with the purpose of concealing the identity of the sender or impersonating another computing system.
** ''URL spoofing'': A Spoofed URL describes one website that poses as another 
** ''Phishing'' :An attempt to criminally and fraudulently acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. 
** ''Referrer spoofing'':It is the sending of incorrect referrer information along with an HTTP request, sometimes with the aim of gaining unauthorized access to a web site. It can also be used because of privacy concerns, as an alternative to sending no referrer at all.
** ''Spoofing of file-sharing Networks'': Polluting the file-sharing networks where record labels share files that are mislabeled, distorted or empty to discourage downloading from these sources.
** ''Caller ID spoofing'' :This allows callers to lie about their identity, and present false names and numbers, which could of course be used as a tool to defraud or harass
** ''E-mail address spoofing:''A technique commonly used for spam e-mail and phishing to hide the origin of an e-mail message by changing certain properties of the e-mail, such as the From, Return-Path and Reply-To fields.
** ''Login spoofing'' : A technique used to obtain a user's password. The user is presented with an ordinary looking login prompt for username and password, which is actually a malicious program, usually called a Trojan horse under the control of the attacker. When the username and password are entered, this information is logged or in some way passed along to the attacker, breaching security.
'''Countermeasures'''
* Be skeptical of e-mails indicating that you need to make changes to your accounts or warnings indicating that accounts will be terminated without you doing some type of activity online.
* Call the legitimate company to find out if this is a fraudulent message.
* Review the address bar to see if the domain name is correct.
* When submitting any type of financial information or credential data, an SSL connection should be set up, which is indicated in the address bar (https://) and a closed-padlock icon in the browser at the bottom-right corner.
* Do not click on an HTML link within an e-mail. Type the URL out manually instead.
* Do not accept e-mail in HTML format.



===Emanations===
'''Overview'''
* All electronic devices emit electrical signals. These signals can hold important information, and if an attacker buys the right equipment and positions himself in the right place, he could capture this information from the airwaves and access data transmissions as if he had a tap directly on the network wire.
'''Countermeasure'''
* Tempest: Tempest is the name of a program, and now a standardized technology that suppresses signal emanations with shielding material. Vendors who manufacture this type of equipment must be certified to this standard. In devices that are Tempest rated, other components are also modified, especially the power supply, to help reduce the amount of electricity that is used unlike the normal devices which have just an outer metal coating, referred to as a Faraday cage. This type of protection is usually needed only in military institutions, although other highly secured environments do utilize this type of safeguard. 
** Tempest Technologies: Tempest technology is complex, cumbersome, and expensive, and therefore only used in highly sensitive areas that really need this high level of protection. Two alternatives to Tempest exist
*** White Noise: White noise is a uniform spectrum of random electrical signals. It is distributed over the full spectrum so that the bandwidth is constant and an intruder is not able to decipher real information from random noise or random information.
*** Control Zone: Some facilities use material in their walls to contain electrical signals. This prevents intruders from being able to access information that is emitted via electrical signals from network devices. This control zone creates a type of security perimeter and is constructed to protect against unauthorized access to data or compromise of sensitive information.

===Shoulder Surfing===
'''Overview'''
* Shoulder surfing refers to using direct observation techniques, such as looking over someone's shoulder, to get information. Shoulder surfing is particularly effective in crowded places because it's relatively easy to observe someone as they:
** Fill out a form 
** Enter their PIN at an automated teller machine or a POS Terminal 
** Use a calling card at a public pay phone 
** Enter passwords at a cybercafe, public and university libraries, or airport kiosks. 
** Enter a digit code for a rented locker in a public place such as a swimming pool or airport. 
* Shoulder surfing is also be done at a distance using binoculars or other vision-enhancing devices. Inexpensive, miniature closed-circuit television cameras can be concealed in ceilings, walls or fixtures to observe data entry. To prevent shoulder surfing, it is advised to shield paperwork or the keypad from view by using one's body or cupping one's hand.
* Recent automated teller machines now have a sophisticated display which discourages shoulder surfers. It grows darker beyond a certain viewing angle, and the only way to tell what is displayed on the screen is to stand directly in front of it.
* Certain models of credit card readers have the keypad recessed, and employ a rubber shield that surrounds a significant part of the opening towards the keypad. This makes shoulder-surfing significantly harder, as seeing the keypad is limited to a much more direct angle than previous models. Taken further, some keypads alter the physical location of the keys after each keypress. Also, security cameras are not allowed to be placed directly above an ATM.

===Object Reuse===
'''Overview'''
* Object reuse issues pertain to reassigning to a subject media that previously contained one or more objects. 
* The sensitive information that may be left by a process should be securely cleared before allowing another process the opportunity to access the object. This ensures that information not intended for this individual or any other subject is not disclosed. 
* For media that holds confidential information, more extreme methods should be taken to ensure that the files are actually gone, not just their pointers.
'''Countermeasures'''
* Sensitive data should be classified by the data owners. 
* How the data is stored and accessed should also be strictly controlled and audited by software controls. 
* Before allowing one subject to use media that was previously used, the media should be erased or degaussed.  If media holds sensitive information and cannot be purged, there should be steps on how to properly destroy it so that there is no way for others to obtain this information.

===Data Remanence===
'''Overview'''
* Data remanence is the residual representation of data that has been in some way been nominally erased or removed. This residue may be due to data being left intact by a nominal delete operation, or through physical properties of the storage medium. 
* Data remanence may make inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information possible, should the storage media be released into an uncontrolled environment.

'''Countermeasures'''
* Classes of Countermeasures
** ''Clearing'' 
*** Clearing is the removal of sensitive data from storage devices in such a way that there is assurance, proportional to the sensitivity of the data, that the data may not be reconstructed using normal system functions. The data may still be recoverable, but not without unusual effort.
*** Clearing is typically considered an administrative protection against accidental disclosure within an organization. For example, before a floppy disk is re-used within an organization, its contents may be cleared to prevent their accidental disclosure to the next user.
** ''Purging''
*** Purging or sanitizing is the removal of sensitive data from a system or storage device with the intent that the data can not be reconstructed by any known technique. 
*** Purging is generally done before releasing media outside of control, such as before discarding old media, or moving media to a computer with different security requirements.
* Methods to Countermeasure
** Overwriting
*** A common method used to counter data remanence is to overwrite the storage medium with new data. This is often called a wiping or shredding a file or disk. Because such methods can often be implemented in software alone, and may be able to selectively target only part of a medium, it is a popular, low-cost option for some applications.
*** The simplest overwrite technique writes the same data everywhere -- often just a pattern of all zeros. At a minimum, this will prevent the data from being retrieved simply by reading from the medium again, and thus is often used for clearing.
** Degaussing
*** Degaussing is the removal or reduction of a magnetic field. Applied to magnetic media, degaussing may purge an entire media element quickly and effectively. A device, called a degausser, designed for the media being erased, is used.
*** Degaussing often renders hard disks inoperable, as it erases low-level formatting which is only done at the factory, during manufacture. Degaussed floppy disks can generally be reformatted and reused.
** Encryption
*** Encrypting data before it is stored on the medium may mitigate concerns about data remanence. If the decryption key is strong and carefully controlled (i.e., not itself subject to data remanence), it may effectively make any data on the medium unrecoverable. Even if the key is stored on the medium, it may prove easier or quicker to overwrite just the key, vs the entire disk.
*** Encryption may be done on a file-by-file basis, or on the whole disk.
** Physical destruction
*** Physical destruction of the data storage medium is generally considered the most certain way to counter data remanence, although also at the highest cost. Not only is the process generally time-consuming and cumbersome, it obviously renders the media unusable. Further, with the high recording densities of modern media, even a small media fragment may contain large amounts of data.
*** Specific destruction techniques include:
**** Physically breaking the media apart, by grinding, shredding, etc. 
**** Incinerating 
**** Phase transition (i.e., liquification or vaporization of a solid disk) 
**** Application of corrosive chemicals, such as acids, to recording surfaces 
**** For magnetic media, raising its temperature above the Curie point

===Backdoor/Trapdoor===
'''Overview'''
* A backdoor is a malicious computer program or particular means that provide the attacker with unauthorized remote access to a compromised system exploiting vulnerabilities of installed software and bypassing normal authentication. 
* A backdoor works in background and hides from the user. It is very similar to a virus and therefore is quite difficult to detect and completely disable. 
* A backdoor is one of the most dangerous parasite types, as it allows a malicious person to perform any possible actions on a compromised computer. The attacker can use a backdoor to 
** spy on a user, 
** manage files, 
** install additional software or dangerous threats, 
** control the entire system including any present applications or hardware devices, 
** shutdown or reboot a computer or 
** attack other hosts. 
* Often a backdoor has additional harmful capabilities like keystroke logging, screenshot capture, file infection, even total system destruction or other payload. Such parasite is a combination of different privacy and security threats, which works on its own and doesn’t require to be controlled at all. 
* Most backdoors are autonomic malicious programs that must be somehow installed to a computer. Some parasites do not require the installation, as their parts are already integrated into particular software running on a remote host. Programmers sometimes left such backdoors in their software for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes. Hackers often discover these undocumented features and use them to break into the system.

'''Countermeasure'''
* Powerful antivirus and anti-spyware products



===Dictionary Attacks===
'''Overview'''
* Dictionary attacks are launched by programs which are fed with a lists (dictionaries) of commonly used words or combinations of characters, and then compares these values to capture passwords. 
* Once the right combination of characters is identified, the attacker can use this password to authenticate herself as a legitimate user. 
* Sometimes the attacker can even capture the password file using this kind of activity.
'''Countermeasures'''

To properly protect an environment against dictionary and other password attacks, the following practices should be followed:
* Do not allow passwords to be sent in cleartext.
* Encrypt the passwords with encryption algorithms or hashing functions.
* Employ one-time password tokens.
* Use hard-to-guess passwords.
* Rotate passwords frequently.
* Employ an IDS to detect suspicious behavior.
* Use dictionary cracking tools to find weak passwords chosen by users.
* Use special characters, numbers, and upper- and lowercase letters within the password.
* Protect password files.

===Bruteforce Attacks===
'''Overview'''
* Brute force is defined as “trying every possible combination until the correct one is identified.”
* The most effective way to uncover passwords is through a hybrid attack, which combines a dictionary attack and a brute force attack
* A brute force attack is also known as an exhaustive attack.
* These are usually used for wardialing in hopes of finding a modem that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. 
'''Countermeasures'''

For phone brute force attacks, auditing and monitoring of this type of activity should be in place to uncover patterns that could indicate a wardialing attack:
* Perform brute force attacks to find weaknesses and hanging modems.
* Make sure only necessary phone numbers are made public.
* Provide stringent access control methods that would make brute force attacks less successful.
* Monitor and audit for such activity.
* Employ an IDS to watch for suspicious activity.
* Set lockout thresholds.

===Social Engineering===
'''Overview'''
* Social engineering is a collection of techniques used for manipulation of the natural human tendency to trust in order to obtain information that will allow a hacker to gain unauthorized access to a valued system and the information that resides on that system.
* Forms of a Social engineering attack  
** Physical: the workplace, the phone, your trash(dumpster diving), and even on-line  
** Psychological: Persuasion
** Reverse Social Engineering

'''Common Social Engineering Attacks'''
* At work Place
** In the workplace, the hacker can simply walk in the door, like in the movies, and pretend to be a maintenance worker or consultant who has access to the organization. Then the intruder struts through the office until he or she finds a few passwords lying around and emerges from the building with ample information to exploit the network from home later that night
** Another technique to gain authentication information is to just stand there and watch an oblivious employee type in his password.
* On Phone/Help Desk
** It its the most prevalent type of social engineering attack. 
** A hacker will call up and imitate someone in a position of authority or relevance and gradually pull information out of the user. 
** Help desks are particularly prone to this type of attack. Hackers are able to pretend they are calling from inside the corporation by playing tricks on the PBX or the company operator, so caller-ID is not always the best defense
** Help desks are particularly vulnerable because they are in place specifically to help, a fact that may be exploited by people who are trying to gain illicit information
* Dumpster Diving
** Dumpster diving, also known as trashing, is another popular method of social engineering. A huge amount of information can be collected through company dumpsters (trash can).
** The following items turn to be a potential security leaks in our trash: 
*** company phone books which can give the hackers names and numbers of people to target and impersonate
*** organizational charts contain information about people who are in positions of authority within the organization
*** memos provide small tidbits of useful information for creating authenticity
*** company policy manuals show hackers how secure (or insecure) the company really is
*** calendars of meetings may tell attackers which employees are out of town at a particular time
*** system manuals, printouts of sensitive data or login names and passwords may give hackers the exact keys they need to unlock the network.
*** disks and tapes can be restored to provide all sorts of useful information.
*** company letterhead and memo forms
* Online
** One way in which hackers can obtain online passwords is through an on-line form: they can send out some sort of sweepstakes information and ask the user to put in a name (including e-mail address – that way, she might even get that person’s corporate account password as well) and password.
** E-mail can also be used for more direct means of gaining access to a system. For instance, mail attachments sent from someone of authenticity can carry viruses, worms and Trojan horses
* Persuasion
** This a technique where the hackers themselves teach social engineering from a psychological point-of-view, emphasizing how to create the perfect psychological environment for the attack. 
** Basic methods of persuasion include: impersonation, ingratiation, conformity, diffusion of responsibility, and plain old friendliness.Regardless of the method used, the main objective is to convince the person disclosing the information that the social engineer is in fact a person that they can trust with that sensitive information. The other important key is to never ask for too much information at a time, but to ask for a little from each person in order to maintain the appearance of a comfortable relationship
*** Impersonation generally means creating some sort of character and playing out the role.Some common roles that may be played in impersonation attacks include: a repairman, IT support, a manager, a trusted third party or a fellow employee
*** Conformity is a group-based behavior, but can be used occasionally in the individual setting by convincing the user that everyone else has been giving the hacker the same information requested. When hackers attack in such a way as to diffuse the responsibility of the employee giving the password away, that alleviates the stress on the employee. 
* Reverse Social Engineering
** This is when the hacker creates a persona that appears to be in a position of authority so that employees will ask him for information, rather than the other way around. If researched, planned and executed well, reverse social engineering attacks may offer the hacker an even better chance of obtaining valuable data from the employees; however, this requires a great deal of preparation, research, and pre-hacking to pull off.
'''Countermeasures'''
* Having proper security policies in place which addresses both physical and psychological aspects of the attack
* Providing proper training to employees, helpdesk personnel

=='''Access Control Technologies'''==
===Single Sign-On===
'''Introduction'''
* SSO is a technology that allows a user to enter credentials one time and be able to access all resources in primary and secondary network domains
'''Advantages'''
* Reduces the amount of time users spend authenticating to resources.
* Enable the administrator to streamline user accounts and better control access rights
* Improves security by reducing the probability that users will write down their passwords
* Reduces the administrators time in managing the access permissions
'''Limitations'''
* Every platform application and resource needs to accept the same type of credentials, in the same format and interpret their meaning in the same way.
'''Disadvantages'''
* Once an individual is in, he is in, thus giving a bigger scope to an attacker

===Kerberos===
'''Introduction'''
* Kerberos is an authentication protocol that was designed in mid-1980 as part of MIT’s project Athena.
* It works in a C/S model and is based on symmetric key cryptography
* It is widely used in UNIX systems and also the default authentication method for windows 2k and 2k3 and is the de-facto standard for heterogeneous networks.
'''Kerberos Components'''
* Key Distribution Center (KDC)
** Holds all users and services secret key and info about the principles in the database
** Provides an authentication service with the help of a service called AS
** Provides key distribution functionality
** Provides a ticket granting service (TGS) 
* Secret Keys are the keys shared between principle and KDC generally using symmetric key cryptography algorithm that are used to authenticate the principles and communicate securely
* Principles are users, applications or any network services
* A ticket is a token generated by KDC and given to a principle when one principle need to authenticate another principle
* Realm is a set of principles. A KDC can be responsible for one or more realms. Realms allow an administrator to logically group resources and users. 
* Session Keys  are the keys shared between the principles that will enable them communicate security
'''Kerberos Authentication Process'''
* User enters username and password into the workstation (WS)
* The Kerberos s/w on the workstation sends the username to the Authentication Server (AS) on the KDC.
* The AS generates a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) encrypting it with the user’s secret key stored in DB with the help of TGT and sends it to the user.
* The password entered by the user is transformed into a secret key using which the ticket (TGT) is decrypted and thus the user gains access to the WS.
* Suppose the user wants to use the printer, the users system send the TGT to the TGS on the KDC
* The TGS generates a new ticket with two instances of a session key, one encrypted with the user’s secret key and the other encrypted with the print server’s secret key. This ticket may also contain an authenticator which contains info on user.
* The new ticket is sent to the users system which is used to authenticate with the print server.
* The user’s system decrypts and extracts the session key, adds a second authenticator set of identification information to the ticket and sends the ticket onto the print server.
* The print server receives the ticket, decrypts and extracts the session key, and decrypts and extracts the two authenticators in the ticket. If the printer server can decrypt and extract the session key, it knows that the KDC created the ticket, because only the KDC has the secret key that was used to encrypt the session key. If the authenticator information that the KDC and the user put into the ticket matches, then the print server knows that it received the ticket from the correct principal.
'''Weakness of Kerberos'''
* The KDC can be a single point of failure. If the KDC goes down, no one can access needed resources. Redundancy is necessary for the KDC.
* The KDC must be able to handle the number of requests it receives in a timely manner. It must be scalable.
* Secret keys are temporarily stored on the users’ workstation, which means it is possible for an intruder to obtain these cryptographic keys.
* Session keys are decrypted and reside on the users’ workstations, either in a cache or in a key table. Again, an intruder can capture these keys.
* Kerberos is vulnerable to password guessing. The KDC does not know if a dictionary attack is taking place. 
* Network traffic is not protected by Kerberos if encryption is not enabled.

===SESAME===
'''Introduction'''
* SESAME (Secure European Systems for Applications in a Multi-vendor Environment) is a SSO technology that was developed to extend Kerberos functionality and improve upon its weakness.
* SESAME uses a symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic technique to protect exchanges of data and to authenticate subjects to network resources.
* SESAME uses digitally signed privileged Attribute Certificates (PAC) to authenticate subjects to objects. PAC contains the subject’s identity, access capabilities for the object, access time period, and life time of the PAC

===Security Domain===
'''Introduction'''
* A domain is a set of resources that are available to a subject.
* A security domain refers to the set the resources working under the same security policy and managed by the same group.
* Domains can be separated by logical boundaries, such as
** Firewalls with ACL’s
** Directory services making access decisions
** Objects that have their own ACL’s indicating which individual or group can access them.
* Domains can be architected in a hierarchical manner that dictates the relationship between the different domains and the ways in which subjects within the different domains can communicate. 
* Subjects can access resources in domains of equal or lower trust levels.

===Thin Clients===
'''Introduction'''
* Thin clients are diskless computers that are sometimes called as dumb terminals.
* It is based on C/S technology where a user is supposed to logon to a remote server to use the computing and network resources.
* When the user starts the client, it runs a short list of instructions and then points itself to a server that will actually download the operating system, or interactive operating software, to the terminal. This enforces a strict type of access control, because the computer cannot do anything on its own until it authenticates to a centralized server, and then the server gives the computer its operating system, profile, and functionality. 
* Thin-client technology provides another type of SSO access for users, because users authenticate only to the central server or mainframe, which then provides them access to all authorized and necessary resources.

=='''Access Control Models'''==
'''Introduction'''
* An access control model is a framework that dictates how subjects access objects.
* It uses access control technologies and security mechanisms to enforce the rules and objectives of the model. 
* There are three main types of access control models: 
** Discretionary,
** Mandatory, and 
** Nondiscretionary (also called role-based). 

===Discretionary Access Control===
* The control of access is based on the discretion (wish) of the owner
* A system that uses DAC enables the owner of the resource to specify which subjects can access specific resources
* The most common implementation of DAC is through ACL’s which are dictated and set by the owners and enforced by the OS.
* Examples: Unix, Linux, Windows access control is based on DAC
* DAC systems grant or deny access based on the identity of the subject. The identity can be user identity or a group identity (Identity based access control)

===Mandatory Access Control===
* This model is very structured and strict and is based on a security label (also known as sensitivity label) attached to all objects
* The subjects are given security clearance by classifying the subjects as secret, top secret, confidential etc.) and the objects are also classified similarly
* The clearance and the classification data is stored in the security labels, which are bound to the specific subject and object.
* When the system makes a decision about fulfilling a request to access an object it is based on the clearance of the subject. The classification of the object and the security policy of the system
* This model is used and is suitable for military systems where classifications and confidentiality is of at most important
* SE Linux, by NSA, trusted Solaris are examples of this model 
* Security label are made up of a classification and categories, where classification indicates the security level and the categories enforce need to know rules.

===Non Discretionary or Role Based Access Control=== 
* A RBAC is based on user roles and uses a centrally administered set of controls to determine how subjects and objects interact.
* The RBAC approach simplifies the access control administration
* It is a best system for a company that has high employee turnover.
* Note: The RBAC can be generally used in combination with MAC and DAC systems

=='''Access Control Techniques'''==
Different access control technologies are available to support the different access control models.
* Rule-Based Access Control
* Constrained User Interface
* Access Control Matrix
* Content Dependant Access Control
* Context Dependant Access Control

===Rule-Based Access Control===
* Rule-based access control uses specific rules that indicate what can and cannot happen between a subject and an object.
* A subject should meet a set of predefined rules before it can access an object.
* It is not necessarily an identity based i.e. it can be applicable to all the users or subjects irrespective of their identities.
* E.g.: Routers and firewall use rules to filter incoming and outgoing packets
===Constrained User Interface===
* Constrained user interfaces restrict user’s access ability by not allowing them to request certain functions or information, or to have access to specific system resources.
* There are three major types of restricted interfaces: 
** Menus and Shells: 
** Database Views
** Physically Constrained Interfaces.
===Access Control Matrix===
* An access control matrix is a table of subjects and objects indicating what actions individual subjects can take upon individual objects.
* The access rights that are assigned to individual subjects are called capabilities and that assigned to objects are called Access Control Lists (ACL).
* This technique uses a capability table to specify the capabilities of a subject pertaining to specific objects. A capability can be in the form of a token, ticket, or key.
** Each row is a capability and each column is an ACL for a given user.
** Kerberos uses a capability based system where every user is given a ticket, which is his capability table.
* ACL’s are list of subjects that are authorized to access a specific object and they define what level of authorization is granted ( both at individual and at group level)
* ACL’s map values from the access control matrix to the object.
* Note: A capability table is bound to a subject, whereas an ACL is bound to an object.
===Content Dependant Access Control===
* Access to the objects is based on the content within the object.
* Example: Database Views, E-mail filtering etc.
===Context Dependant Access Control===
* The access decisions are based on the context of a collection of information rather than on the sensitivity of the data.
* Example: A firewall makes a context-based access decisions when they collect state information on a packet before allowing it into the network.

=='''Access Control Administration'''==
Access control administration can be done in two ways.
* Centralized
* Decentralized.

===Centralized Access Control===
* Here one entity (dept or an individual) is responsible for overseeing access to all corporate resources.
* This type of administration provides a consistent and uniform method of controlling users access rights.
* Example: RADIUS, TACACS and Diameter
'''RADIUS'''
* It is a c/s authentication protocol that authenticates and authorizes remote users.
* The access server houses the users credentials 
* It is an open standard protocol developed by Livingston enterprises.
'''TACACS'''
* TACACS has been through three generations: TACACS, Extended TACACS (XTACACS), and TACACS+. 
** TACACS combines its authentication and authorization processes, 
** XTACACS separates authentication, authorization, and auditing processes and 
** TACACS+ is XTACACS with extended two-factor user authentication. 
* TACACS uses fixed passwords for authentication and TACACS+ allows users to use dynamic (one-time) passwords, which provides more protection.
* TACACS+ provides basically the same functionality as RADIUS with a few differences in some of its characteristics. 
** TACACS+ uses TCP as its transport protocol, while RADIUS uses UDP. 
** RADIUS encrypts the user’s password only as it is being transmitted from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server. Other information, as in the username, accounting, and authorized services, is passed in clear text. This is an open invitation for attackers to capture session information for replay attacks. TACACS+ encrypts all of this data and thus does not have the   vulnerabilities that are inherent in the RADIUS protocol
** The RADIUS protocol combines the authentication and authorization functionality whereas TACACS+ uses a true AAA architecture, which separates the authentication, authorization, and accounting functionalities thus giving the ability to authenticate remote users. TACACS+ also enables to define more granular user profiles, which can control the actual commands that users can carry out
'''Note:'''RADIUS is the appropriate protocol when simplistic username/password authentication can take place and users only need an Accept or Deny for obtaining access, as in ISPs. TACACS+ is the better choice for environments that require more sophisticated authentication steps and tighter control over more complex authorization activities, as in corporate networks

'''Diameter'''
* Diameter is a protocol that has been developed to build upon the functionality of RADIUS and overcome many of its limitations. The creator of this protocol decided to call it Diameter as a play on the term RADIUS, as in the diameter is twice the radius. 
* Diameter is another AAA protocol that provides the same type of functionality as RADIUS and TACACS+ but also provides more flexibility and capabilities to meet the new demands of today’s complex and diverse networks where we want our wireless devices and smart phones to be able to authenticate themselves to our networks and we use roaming protocols, Mobile IP, PPPoE and etc.
* Diameter provides a base protocol, which defines header formats, security options, commands, and AVPs (Attribute Value Pairs). This base protocol allows for extensions to tie in other services, such as VoIP, FoIP, Mobile IP, wireless, and cell phone authentication. So Diameter can be used as an AAA protocol for all of these different uses.
* RADIUS and TACACS+ are client/server protocols, which mean that the server portion cannot send unsolicited commands to the client portion. The server portion can only speak when spoken to. Diameter is a peer-based protocol that allows either end to initiate communication. 
** This functionality allows the Diameter server to send a message to the access server to request the user to provide another authentication credential if she is attempting to access a secure resource. 
** This functionality also allows the Diameter server to disconnect the user if necessary for one reason or another. 
* Diameter is backward compatible with RADIUS, uses UDP and AVPs, and provides proxy server support. 
* It has better error detection and correction functionality and failover properties than RADIUS, thus provides better network resilience. 
* Diameter also provides end-to-end security through the use of IPSec or TLS, which is not available in RADIUS. 
* Diameter has the functionality and ability to provide the AAA functionality for other protocols and services because it has a large AVP set. RADIUS has 28 (256) AVPs and Diameter has 232. So, more AVPs allow for more functionality and services to exist and communicate between systems. 
* Diameter provides the following AAA function
** Authentication
*** PAP, CHAP, EAP
*** End-to-end protection of authentication information
*** Replay attack protection
** Authorization
*** Redirects, secure proxies, relays, and brokers
*** State reconciliation
*** Unsolicited disconnect
*** Reauthorization on demand
** Accounting
*** Reporting, ROAMOPS accounting, event monitoring

===Decentralized Access Control===
* A decentralized access control administration method gives control of access to the people closer to the resources 
* In this approach, it is often the functional manager who assigns access control rights to employees. 
* Changes can happen faster through this type of administration because not just one entity is making changes for the whole organization. 
* There is a possibility for conflicts to arise that may not benefit the organization as because different managers and departments can practice security and access control in different ways. 
* There is a possibility of certain controls to overlap, in which case actions may not be properly proscribed or restricted. 
* This type of administration does not provide methods for consistent control, as a centralized method would.

=='''Access Control Monitoring(IDS/IPS)'''==
Access Control Monitoring is a method of keeping track of who attempts to access specific network resources

The ACM system can fall into two categories: Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and  Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

===Intrusion Detection Systems===
====Basic Concepts====
Intrusion detection is the process of detecting an unauthorized use of, or attack upon, a computer, network, or a telecommunication infrastructure.

IDS are designed to aid in mitigating the damage that can be caused by hacking, or breaking into sensitive computer and network systems.

'''Common Components of an IDS'''
* Sensors: collect traffic and user activity data and send it to an analyzer.
* Analyzer: detects an activity that it is programmed to deem as fishy and sends an alert to the administrative interface.
* Administrative Interface: Report the alert details.
'''Common Functions of an IDS'''
* Watch for attacks
* Parse audit logs
* Protect system files
* Alert administrators during attacks
* Expose a hackers technique
* Illustrate which vulnerabilities need to be addressed
* Help track down individual hackers

====IDS Types====
* Network-Based IDS: A network-based IDS (NIDS) uses sensors, which are either host computers with the necessary software installed or dedicated appliances—each with its network interface card (NIC) in promiscuous mode. The NIC driver captures all traffic and passes it to an analyzer to look for specific types of patterns.
* Host-Based IDS: A host-based IDS (HIDS) can be installed on individual workstations and/or servers and watch for inappropriate or anomalous activity. HIDSs are usually used to make sure users do not delete system files, reconfigure important settings, or put the system at risk in any other way.

====IDS Technologies====
Both HIDS and NIDS can employ the following technologies
* Knowledge or Signature Based
* Statistical Anomaly Based
* Rule Based
'''Knowledge or Signature Based'''
* These are knowledge based systems where some knowledge is accumulated about specific attacks and a model called signatures is developed.
* The main disadvantage of these systems is they cannot detect new attacks and a few signatures need to be written and continuously updated.
* Also known as misuse-detection system
* Attacks
** Land Attacks ( packets modified to have the same s/c and destination IP) 
   '''Security Humor''': Attacks or viruses that have been discovered in production environments are referred to as being “in
   the wild.” Attacks and viruses that exist but have not been released are referred to as being “in the zoo.”  

'''Statistical Anomaly Based'''
* These are behavioral based systems, which do not use any predefined signatures, but rather are put in a learning mode to build a profile by continually sampling the environments normal activities.
* The longer the IDS is put in a learning mode, in most instances, the more accurate a profile it will build and the better protection it will provide.
* Once a profile is build, a different profile is build based on the same sampling on all the future traffic and the data are compared to identify the abnormalities.
* Also known as profile-based systems
* Advantages
** Can detect new attacks including 0 day attacks
** Can also detect low and slow attacks in which an attacker tries to stay beneath the radar by sending a few packets at a time over a longer period of time.
* Disadvantages
** Developing a correct profile to reduce false positives can be difficult.
** There is a possibility for an attacker to integrate his/her activities into the behavior pattern of the n/w traffic. This can be controlled by ensuring that there are no attack activities currently underway while the IDS are in learning mode.
** The success factors for these systems are based on determining proper threshold in order to reduce/avoid false positives (threshold set to too low) or false negatives (threshold set to too high)
* Attacks
** Bring the IDS offline by DoS and send the IDS incorrect data in order to distract the n/w and security individuals to make them busy chasing wrong packets, while the real attack takes place.
* Techniques
** Protocol Anomaly based: 
*** These types of IDS have specific knowledge of each protocol that they will be monitoring.
*** The IDS builds a profile (model) of each protocol’s normal usage and uses it to match with the profile build during the actual operation.
*** Common protocol vulnerabilities
**** At the DLL, the ARP does not have any protection against ARP attacks where bogus data can be inserted into its table.
**** At the n/w layer, the ICMP can be used in a LOKI attack to move data from one place to another, when this protocol was designed to only be used to send status information. This data can be a code which can be made to be executed by the backdoor on a compromised system.
**** IP headers can be easily modified for spoofed attacks ( one acting as other) 
**** At the TL, TCP packets can be injected into the connection between the two systems for a session hijack attack.
** Traffic Anomaly based:
*** These systems have traffic-anomaly filters, which detect changes in traffic patterns as in DoS attacks or a new service that appears on the network. 
*** Once there is a profile that is built that captures the baselines of an environment’s ordinary traffic, all future traffic patterns are compared to that profile. 
*** As with all filters, the thresholds are tunable to adjust the sensitivity, to reduce the number of false positives and false negatives. 
*** Since this is a type of statistical anomaly– based IDS, it can detect unknown attacks

'''Rule Based'''
* Rule-based intrusion detection is commonly associated with the use of an expert system. 
* An expert system is made up of a knowledge base, inference engine, and rule-based programming. 
** Knowledge is represented as rules, and the data that is to be analyzed is referred to as facts. 
** The knowledge of the system is written in rule-based programming (IF situation THEN action). These rules are applied to the facts, the data that comes in from a sensor, or a system that is being monitored.
* Example :Consider the Rule-''IF a root user creates File1 AND creates File2 SUCH THAT they are in the same directory THEN there is a call to AdministrativeTool1 TRIGGER send alert.'' This rule has been defined such that if a root user creates two files in the same directory and then makes a call to a specific administrative tool, an alert should be sent.
* The more complex the rules, the more demands on software and hardware processing requirements
* Cannot detect new attacks
* Techniques
** State Based IDS
*** A state transition takes place when a variable’s value changes, which usually happens continuously within every system.
*** In a state-based IDS, the initial state is the state prior to the execution of an attack, and the compromised state is the state after successful penetration. 
*** The IDS has rules that outline what state transition sequences should sound an alarm. The activity that takes place between the initial and compromised state is what the state-based IDS looks for, and it sends an alert if any of the state-transition sequences match its preconfigured rules.
*** This type of IDS scans for attack signatures in the context of a stream of activity instead of just looking at individual packets. It can only identify known attacks and requires frequent updates of its signatures.
** Model Based IDS
*** In a model-based IDS, the product has several scenario models that represent how specific attacks and intrusions take place. The models outline how the system would behave if it were under attack, the different steps that would be carried out by the attacker, and the evidence that would be available for analysis if specific intrusions took place.
*** The IDS takes in the audit log data and compares it to the different models that have been developed, to see if the data meets any of the models’ specifications. If the IDS finds data in an audit log that matches the characteristics in a specific model, it sends an alert.
====IDS Sensors====
* Network-based IDSs use sensors for monitoring purposes. A sensor, which works as an analysis engine, is placed on the network segment the IDS is responsible for monitoring. 
* The sensor receives raw data from an event generator and compares it to a signature database, profile, or model, depending upon the type of IDS.
* If there is some type of a match, which indicates suspicious activity, the sensor works with the response module to determine what type of activity needs to take place (alerting through instant messaging, page, e-mail, or carry out firewall reconfiguration, and so on). 
* The sensor’s role is to filter received data, discard irrelevant information, and detect suspicious activity.
* A monitoring console can be used to monitor all sensors and supplies the network staff with an overview of the activities of all the sensors in the network, but the difficulty arises in a switched environment, where traffic is forwarded through a VPN and is not rebroadcast to all the ports.This can be overcome using Spanning Ports by mirroring the traffic from all the ports to one monitored port.
* Sensor Placement
** Sensors can be placed outside of the firewall to detect attacks
** Inside the firewall (in the perimeter network) to detect actual intrusions. 
** At highly sensitive areas, DMZs, and on extranets
* Multiple Sensors can be used in high traffic environments to ensure all packets are investigated. Also If necessary to optimize network bandwidth and speed, different sensors can be set up to analyze each packet for different signatures. That way, the analysis load can be broken up over different points.
===Intrusion Prevention System===
The traditional IDS only detects that something bad may be taking place and sends an alert. The goal of an IPS is to detect this activity and not allow the traffic to gain access to the target in the first place. 

An IPS is a preventative and proactive technology, whereas an IDS is a detective and after-the-fact technology.

There has been a long debate on IPS and it turned out to be an extension of IDS and everything that holds for IDS also holds for IPS apart for IPS being preventative and IDS being detective.

=='''Access Control Assurance'''==
===Basic Concepts===
''Accountability'' is the method of tracking and logging the subject’s actions on the objects.

''Auditing'' is an activity where the users/subjects actions on the objects are monitored in order to verify that the sensitivity policies are enforced and can be used as an investigation tool.

'''Advantages of Auditing'''
* To track unauthorized activities performed by individuals.
* Detect intrusion.
* Reconstruct events and system conditions.
* Provide legal resource material and produce problem reports.

'''Note''': A security professional should be able to access an environment and its security goals ,know what actions should be audited ,and know what is to be done with that information after it is captured – without wasting too much disk space , CPU power &amp; staff time.

'''What to Audit?'''
* System-level events 
** System performance
** Logon attempts (successful and unsuccessful)
** Logon ID
** Date and time of each logon attempt
** Lockouts of users and terminals
** Use of administration utilities
** Devices used
** Functions performed
** Requests to alter configuration files
* Application-level events
** Error messages
** Files opened and closed
** Modifications of files
** Security violations within application
* User-level events
** Identification and authentication attempts
** Files, services, and resources used
** Commands initiated
** Security violations

'''Review of Audit Information'''
* Audit trails can be reviewed manually or through automated means.
* Types of audit reviews
** Event oriented: done as and when an event occurs.
** Periodic: done periodically to access the health of the system.
** Real time: done with the help of automated tools as and when the audit information gets created.
* Audit trail analysis tools: These tools helps in reducing/filtering the audit log information that is not necessary and provides only those information necessary for auditing.
* Types of audit trail analysis tools 
** audit reduction tools : these tools reduces the amount of information within an audit log, discards mundane tasks information and records system performance ,security and user functionality information that are necessary for auditing.
** Variance – detection tools: these tools monitor computer and resource usage trends and detect variations unusual activities e.g. : an employee logging into the machine during odd hours.
** Attack signature – detection: these tools parse the audit logs based on some predefined patterns in the database. If a pattern matches any of the pattern or signature in the database, it indicates that an attack has taken place or is in progress.
** Key stroke monitoring.

'''Protecting Audit Data and Log Information'''
* Audit logs should be protected by implementing strict access control.
* The integrity of the data should be ensured with the use of digital signatures, message digest tools ,and strong access control.
* The confidentiality can be protected with encryption and access controls and can be stored on CD-ROM’S to prevent loss or modification of the data. The modification of logs is often called as scrubbing.
* Unauthorized access attempts to audit logs should be captured and reported.

= Corn Stalk Defence =

The '''Corn Stalk Defence''', also known as the '''Ware Defense''' or '''Corn Stalks''', is a rare chess opening with the moves:

: 1. e4 a5

It is generally regarded as a dubious response to 1. e4, as it does nothing to aid in Black's development, allows White a free hand in the center, and weakens the b5 and b6 squares. Note the Rook development to a6 is already prevented. However, if played in a style similar to [[Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...a6|1...a6]], namely with Black playing 2...b6 and 3...Bb7, it can be effective. Preston Ware, someone known for playing eccentric openings, often used the Corn Stalk Defence in tournament play, with decent success.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Erlang Processes and Messages==

Processes are easy to create and control in Erlang.

The program chain_hello.erl builds a chain of processes as long as you like. Each process creates one process then sends a message to it. The program creates a chain of N processes which each print out &quot;hello world!&lt;N&gt;&quot; (where &lt;N&gt; is some integer).

Processes send messages to and receive messages from one another. Messages are read with pattern matching. The messages are matched in a fifo (first in, first out) way.

Note 1: The order of the final output depends on process scheduling.

Note 2: Time flows downward (in each vertical line, see note 1).



This is a Process Message Diagram for the execution of: chain_hello:start(1).

      <text xml:space="preserve">More immigrants arrived in the United States during the 1990s than in any other decade on record.  As a result of this increase in immigration a great many students with limited backgrounds in English are entering American classrooms (Eggen, Kauchak, 2007; Gray &amp; Fleischman, 2005).  According to Eggen and Kauchak (2007) experts estimate that by the year 2020 two thirds of the school population will be African American, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American.  This means there will be great cultural diversity in our society and in our schools.  In order for us to have a better understanding of this we must first examine the specific definition of diversity related to this report.&lt;br&gt;
The terms diversity and diverse learners focus primarily on differences related to social class, ethnicity, culture, and language (Zeichner, 1992).  Each of these topics is important to our understanding of diversity and diverse learners.  Culture, which refers to the knowledge, attitudes, values, and customs that characterize a social group can influence school success dramatically (Eggen and Kauchak, 2007).  For instance, culture can influence what foods we eat, how we eat them, and with whom we eat them with. Different cultures have different ways of learning and interacting with society, and when these different cultures are all mixed into one classroom it makes the education process even more difficult.  Eggen and Kauchak (2007) define ethnicity as a person’s ancestry and the way individuals identify with the nation from which they or their ancestors came, an important part of culture.  Members of an ethnic group have a common history, language, value system, and set of customs (Eggen and Kauchak 2007).  For example, a student with English as a second language may be required to speak English in school, but go home and be required to speak their family’s language.  With all these differences within our society, there are going to be many problems in the way that teachers will help educate, communicate, and interact with our culturally diverse schools.

==Problems with Teaching a Diverse Society==
The problem will be to educate teachers to teach for diversity, in most instances; “will continue to be one of educating white, monolingual, and mostly female teacher education students during pre-service teacher education in college and university settings to teach diverse learners effectively” (Zeichner, 1992, p. 2).  According to Zeichner (1992) much of the literature discussing how institutions prepare teachers for diversity isn’t as available to the general teacher education community and shows the low status of this issue in the “official” agenda for teacher education reform.  The main problem is the growing difference between the teaching force, and those students in public schools “Urban schools contain the most diversity, and most teachers don’t want to teach in these schools which need the most time and work” (Zeichner, 1992, p. 4).  Several recent studies have shown that “teacher education students are overwhelmingly white, female, and monolingual, from a rural or suburban community and that they come to their teacher education programs with very limited interracial and intercultural experience” (Zeichner, 1992, p. 4).  Teachers then need to have knowledge of these different cultures before they come into the classroom.

==What Teachers Need to Know and Be Able to Teach==
Teachers need to be aware of differences within minority groups, different ethnic groups and attitudes.  They also need to believe that all students can succeed regardless of diversity and they need to show this belief to the students.  Teachers need to provide challenging work instead of mechanical curricula which is usually the norm for many ethnic and language minority students.  These are all behaviors that Zeichner (1992) said teachers must have in order to effectively teach a diverse classroom.  Teachers are responsible for helping members of cultural minorities to adapt to the dominant culture (including schools) with out causing the minority to lose their cultural identity, a process called “accommodation without assimilation,” other terms are alternation; the ability to comfortably function in both cultures, and code switching; the ability to use nonstandard dialects in social situations but standard English in school (Eggen and Kauchak, 2007, p.106).  People code switch all the time, fact is you probably did it today when you answered a question in class it was most likely not the way you would speak to your peers.  Zeichner (1992) believes that explicit teaching of the codes and customs of the school is necessary so that students will be able to participate fully in the main stream. In order to teach diverse learners, one needs to have knowledge about child and adolescent development; second-language acquisition; and know about the ways that socioeconomic circumstances, language, and culture shape school performance and educational achievement as well as specific knowledge about the languages, cultures, and circumstances of the particular students in their classrooms and then use this knowledge in the organization of curriculum and instruction to stimulate learning (Zeichner, 1992, p.3).  A main point that is repeated over and over again is that teachers need to have knowledge of their particular students, and not just generalize.  This, among other things, needs to be taught to potential educators in order for classroom success.&lt;br&gt;

==The Teaching of Potential Teachers for Diverse Learners==
There are a number of ways that potential teachers can be educated to manage a diverse classroom.  Zeichner (1992) thinks that one way to educate potential teachers for this is to have whole programs that focus on preparing teachers to work with ethnic-and-language-minority students; this can target general minorities or specific groups.  The problem with educating teachers on this matter is that most of the courses that deal with diversity are optional rather than compulsory.  Many universities are entering into partnerships with low-performing public schools to strengthen their students’ ability to succeed in college (Office for Civil Rights, n.d.).  Teachers tend to have low expectations for cultural minorities.  Extensive field work with minorities and a development of one’s own cultural identity is necessary to cross-cultural understanding (Zeichner, 1992, p. 7).  Many low expectations for cultural minorities are related directly to the generally lower socioeconomic status of these minorities.  Socioeconomic status has a significant impact on the learning process.

===Socioeconomic Status===
Socioeconomic status (SES) is the combination of parent’s income, occupation, and level of education that describes relative standing in society.  It is one of the most powerful factors influencing student achievement (Eggen and Kauchak, 2007).  According to Eggen and Kauchak (2007) socioeconomic status consistently predicts intelligence and achievement test scores, grades, truancy, and dropout and suspension rates.  Students from families in the highest income quartile are two and a half times more likely to enroll in college and eight times more likely to graduate than their low SES peers.
SES influences learning in at least three ways:

#Basic Needs and Experiences
##Low-SES children lack medical and dental care and live in substandard housing on inadequate diets.
##Poor nutrition can affect attention and memory and lead to lower IQ scores,
##Number of homeless children is higher than any time since Great Depression.
##Economic problems can also lead to family and marital conflicts which result in less stable homes, these children come to school without a personal sense of security that equips them to tackle school-related tasks.
##High-SES parents are more likely to provide their children with educational activities, such as travel and visits to art galleries and science museums.  They also have more computers, reference books, and other learning materials in the home, and they provide more formal training outside of school, like music and dance lessons, activities that complement classroom learning.
#Parental Involvement
##Higher SES parents also tend to be more involved in their children’s schooling and other activities.
##Time spent working, often at two jobs or more, is a major obstacle to school involvement for low-SES parents.
##In general, high-SES parents talk to their children more and differently than do those who are low-SES; they ask more questions, explain the causes of events, and provide reasons for rules.
##Sometimes called “the curriculum of the house,” these rich interaction patterns together with the background experiences already described, provide a strong foundation for future learning.
#Attitudes and Values
##The impact of SES is also transmitted through parental attitudes and values.
##Many high-SES parents encourage autonomy, individual responsibility, and self control; low-SES parents are more likely to emphasize conformity and obedience.
##Values are also communicated by example:
##*Children who see their parents reading and studying learn that reading is valuable and more likely to read themselves.
##*Students who read at home show higher reading achievement than those who don’t.
##High-SES parents also have positive expectations for their children and encourage them to graduate from high-school and attend college (Eggen and Kauchak, 2007, p.104).

All of this described above shows that coming from disadvantaged homes can make learning and high achievement a challenge for students.  For instance, a lack of parental involvement, a lack of basic needs such as pour nutrition, and a negative environment with negative attitudes all increase this challenge.  Attitudes and values are also demonstrated not only through socioeconomic status, but through culture.

==Attitudes and Values Based on Culture==
When culture was defined, it was said to include attitudes and values that characterize a social group.  These aspects of culture sometimes help school learning and other times they can have negative impacts on it.  A positive example written by Eggen and Kauchak (2007) states that Asian-American parents typically have high expectations for their children, encouraging them not only to attend college, but also to attain a graduate or professional degree.  However, some minorities, because of a long history of separatism and low status sometimes defend themselves through cultural inversion.  This inversion is the tendency of members of cultural minorities to reject certain attitudes, values, and forms of behavior because they conflict with their own cultural values (Eggen and Kauchak, 2007).  This can be seen when students don’t do well in school. To become a high achiever is to “become White,” and students who want to succeed and are involved in school can lose the respect and friendship of other classmates.  One solution to this is minority role models who can provide learners with evidence that they can both succeed and retain their cultural identity (Eggen and Kauchak, 2007).  Many cultural minority students also have different ways of acting and interacting with the traditional teacher-as-authority-figure role.  I think that if teachers interacted with some of these students with a more supportive rather than structural manner, the students might respond in a more positive way.

==Classroom Culture and Organization==
As Eggen and Kauchak (2007) state, in most classrooms, teachers emphasize individual performance, which they can reinforce by test scores and grades.  This can lead to competition, which requires successes and failures; and the success of one student may be tied to the failure of another often detracting from the motivation of those who are not succeeding. One example in Eggen and Kauchak (2007) talks about the Hmong, a mountain tribe from Laos who immigrated to the United States after the Vietnam War:
Hmong culture emphasizes cooperation, and Hmong students constantly monitor the learning progress of their peers, offering help and assistance.  Hmong culture also de-emphasizes individual achievement in favor of group success. Now think about how well these students would learn when involved in the highly competitive instruction and fewer opportunities for student help and teamwork of most schools.&lt;br&gt;

==Summary==
In order to teach a culturally diverse society effectively, educators must take many things into account.  Different cultures have different sets of values and attitudes that can reflect on learning in both positive and negative ways.  Teachers must know their subjects personally and not generalize; stereotyping can lead to lower expectations and unjust treatment of individuals.  Just because in general a specific culture has tendencies in one area, no education can prepare you for the students you will actually encounter.  Eggen and Kauchak (2007) claim that it is virtually certain that you will teach students who are members of cultural minorities, and it is highly likely that English will not be the first language for some of them.  The following principles can help guide efforts by teachers as they work with these students.

*Communicate that you respect all cultures and value the contributions that cultural differences make to learning.
*Involve all students in learning activities.
*Use concrete experiences as reference points for language development.
*Target important vocabulary terms.
*Provide opportunities for all students to practice language.

And finally, teachers should emphasize that learning is the goal of every discussion and should help students understand that wrong answers are an integral and important part of the learning process (Eggen and Kauchak, 2007).  All these factors contribute to the learner diversity and all must be carefully examined before any potential educator steps foot into the classroom.  In order to be an educator prepared for learner diversity, it is shown over and over again that there are many differences in our society and that we need to be aware of all these differences to teach effectively.  Teachers need to be sensitive to certain aspects of their student’s culture, but for heavens sake “don’t stereotype” is the contrasting message that is being relayed to the prospective teaching community.  It is up to the individual educator and the professors that taught them to teach (along with extensive fieldwork), to really effectively teach a culturally diverse classroom.  Educators can have all the knowledge in the world of different cultures, and not be able to relate to them.  In the future there will be more and more diversity in the school system and it is up to the teacher to make sure that high expectations are relayed to all students no matter what ethnicity and culture, so that no matter the general stereotypes, students know that they have the opportunity for success.

==Questions==
#Why is it only white monolingual teachers that are more prominent?
#How important is it for the community to be involved in a diverse education?
#Is group schooling better than individual education?
#Should diversity training be more of a focus for teachers?
#Does socioeconomic status really affect diversity?
#Will teachers really be ready for a more diverse classroom?
#What are differences between rural and urban/suburban schools?
#What is the culture that has the highest percentage of graduates?
#How can educators utilize differences in culture to teach diversity in classrooms to give all students a better understanding of the diverse world in which we live?
#How are teachers to help the minority students?   What activities could they do?  How are they to help them adapt to a system they are not equipped for?
#How do students from a lower socioeconomic background can be expected to compete academically with those from a more privileged background?
#In what ways can diversity strengthen a community as opposed to dividing it?

Security Architecture is one component of a products/systems overall architecture and is developed to provide guidance during the design of the product/system.
 
Security Architecture is the design artifacts that describe how the security controls (= security countermeasures) are positioned and how they relate to the overall systems architecture. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system’s quality attributes such as confidentiality, integrity and availability.

A security policy is a statement that outlines how entities access each other, what operations different entities can carry out, what level of protection is required for a system or software product, and what actions should be taken when these requirements are not me.

A security model outlines the requirements necessary to properly support and implement a certain security policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Old firmwares (pre-&quot;Bastille&quot;, 5.12.88) only collect EPG data for the group of channels associated with the currently viewed channel (i.e. those on the same [http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/dtt/dtt.cgi?reg=UK&amp;by=mux multiplex (or mux)]).  As you change channel, more data is collected but this is reliant on the broadcaster to actually be sending the correct data (and some muxes are occasionally quite lax about this — either wait for them to sort themselves out or upgrade your firmware!).  This is why the Toppy's EPG on these firmwares actually changes channel as you browse the Guide (if it didn't there would probably be no data to show for some channels).  Another issue is that these old firmwares can only hold about half (or less) of the complete list of EPG data currently being broadcast on Freeview (about 10,000 programmes!), so inevitably the data will be incomplete or have problems.

Newer firmwares (5.12.88 onwards) collect the EPG data for ''all'' channels when tuned to ''any'' channel (assuming the broadcaster is sending it — the main BBC channels are pretty reliable).  And they have room for the whole Freeview 7 day EPG, although there are [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/EPG Duplicates|still some bugs]] that cause duplication and waste EPG space.

The channel organisation on Freeview is sometimes [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Freeview Shuffle|shuffled about]] with no obvious change (the channel may still be viewable) apart from missing EPG data, or your local transmitter may be experiencing [http://www.bbc.co.uk/reception/transmitters/index.shtml problems or maintenance].

Looking around at the world around us, where equality is rapidly becoming the norm, it is difficult to imagine that this same world was a place of strife for women, children, and other minorities. In the nineteenth century, milestones were placed in the society we know to create the justice and equality in the workplace and the educational facilities. The following will name and describe the milestones created by women for women, Native Americans, and African Americans.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Functional Programming ===

A function takes a number of arguments and returns a value based on manipulating those arguments.  That's a very abstract definition for something absolutely fundamental to the style of programming encouraged by Clojure.

To look at it more concretely, a function takes some (or no) values, operates on them, then returns a value.

The simplest function possible in Clojure is:

&lt;pre&gt;(fn [])
&lt;/pre&gt;

It takes no values and returns ''nil'' as a result.  Now, this function is not the same as the value of ''nil''.  Instead, it represents a process that gives nil as an answer.

Just typing &lt;tt&gt;(fn [])&lt;/tt&gt; into the prompt, though, returns the function, but then throws it away.  Were we using it within something else, we would write:

&lt;pre&gt;user=&gt; (let [always-nil (fn [])]
            (always-nil))
nil
&lt;/pre&gt;

What that does is say, first off, that within the opening and closing parentheses around the word '''let''', the words '''always-nil''' refer to (fn []).  That's known as '''binding''': always-nil is bound to (fn []).

Then, in the second part, '''always-nil''' is '''called''', meaning that whatever operations it is to perform are done, and then the value that is to be returned is placed where the function was called.

So, &lt;tt&gt;(always-nil)&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;call the always-nil function, do whatever it is to do, then replace the statement (always-nil) with the value that the function returns.

Or, to take that step-by-step:

Because '''always-nil''' is the first item after the opening parenthesis, it is called.  

&lt;pre&gt;(always-nil)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Clojure then looks up what the words '''always-nil''' mean to it, and, because this is within the parentheses around '''let''', the words are bound to &lt;tt&gt;(fn [])&lt;/tt&gt;.  So we substitute in the value to which '''always-nil''' is bound.

&lt;pre&gt;((fn []))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Next, the function is evaluated.  As said before, this function takes no values and returns ''nil''.  Thus, ''nil'' is substituted in for the function:

&lt;pre&gt;nil
&lt;/pre&gt;

While that's the simplest function possible, it's kind of boring and silly.  It doesn't do anything but say &quot;no&quot; to us.  And, while &quot;no&quot; is an awfully fundamental word, it's not exactly the friendliest thing.

==== The koala sorter ====

&lt;pre&gt;(defn classify-koala [extinct really-big]
  (let [valid? (fn [answer] (some (appl eql? answer)
                                  (list :yes :no)))
        no? (appl eql? :no)]
    (cond (not (and (valid? extinct)
                    (valid? really-big)))
          :unknown
          (no? extinct)
          :koala
          (no? really-big)
          :phacolarctos-maris
          true
          :giant-koala)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'll admit that that example is equally silly, but it's a lot friendlier and cuter, because it deals with koalas. What it does, in brief, is take two arguments answering the questions &quot;is this species of koala extinct?&quot; and &quot;is it really big?&quot;, then classifies the koala according to those.

Now, the first thing to look at is what '''defn''' means.  Where '''let''' said that we were binding a value available inside the parentheses around that let, '''def''' says that we are defining a value accessable everywhere.  '''defn''' is shorthand to say &lt;tt&gt;(def name (fn [arguments] ... ))&lt;/tt&gt;, or, &quot;define this function everywhere.&quot;  That's going to be useful, because I intend on classifying a lot of koalas.

Inside the '''let''', we've defined two functions: '''valid?''' and '''no?'''.  '''valid?''' asks, &quot;is my argument either yes or no?&quot; and '''no?''' asks, &quot;is my argument no?&quot;

Finally, we apply a series of conditions, first separating out the things that aren't koalas:

&lt;pre&gt;user=&gt; (classify-koala :deciduous :leafy)
:unknown
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then the koalas that aren't extinct:

&lt;pre&gt;user=&gt; (classify-koala :no :yes)
:koala
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then the extinct koalas that weren't all that big:

&lt;pre&gt;user=&gt; (classify-koala :yes :no)
:phacolarctos-maris
&lt;/pre&gt;

And finally, the extinct koalas that were really really big:

&lt;pre&gt;user=&gt; (classify-koala :yes :yes)
:giant-koala
&lt;/pre&gt;

Of course, after all that, while the behaviour of this koala sorter may be apparent, how it actually gets from &lt;tt&gt;(classify-koala :yes :yes)&lt;/tt&gt; to the value of '':giant-koala'' involves thirteen functions working in harmony and making new functions in order to classify our koalas for us.

Luckily, as we saw above, the set of conditions to classify a koala is remarkably small. This is because we're working in a somewhat contrived example, rather than the real world. Later on, when this koala classifier moves from the calm shores of eucalyptowiki to the big, scary world of production, it's going to have to face up against a mad scientist with an army of robot wallabies, and the example will become really contrived instead of just somewhat.

==== Building our own koala sorter ====

Let's start, then, by actually making a koala sorter.  However, let's not worry about being fancy with it yet.  All we actually need are '''eql?''' and '''cond'''.

'''eql?''' takes a set of arguments and returns true if they're all equal, false if any of them are different.

'''cond''' takes a set of arguments, checks if the first one is true, and if so, returns the second one. If not, cond checks the third and, if it's true, returning the fourth one. It does that until it runs out of arguments.

So, from those two pieces, we can build the koala sorter, mark i:

&lt;pre&gt;(defn classify-koala [extinct really-big]
  (cond (eql? extinct :no)
        :koala
        (eql? really-big :no)
        :phacolarctos-maris
        true
        :giant-koala))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which checks extinction, the koala being really big, then returns our koala.  (''true'' is used as the second-last argument because we want to always return the last argument And, testing it, it does indeed, classifying koalas until one day someone hooks it up to the tree sorter instead:

&lt;pre&gt;user=&gt; (classify-koala :no :no)
:koala
user=&gt; (classify-koala :yes :no)
:phacolarctos-maris
user=&gt; (classify-koala :yes :yes)
:giant-koala
user=&gt; (classify-koala :evergreen :bush)
:giant-koala
&lt;/pre&gt;

And we find out that the juniper bush that the tree sorter was pointed at is actually a Pleistocene marsupial. This causes a brief furor in the botanosophic community, and the scientist discovering the long-lost giant koala in the front garden of his monastery goes on to great acclaim as the discoverer of ... No, actually, he's defrocked and sent to the colonies for having published in the Byzantine Journal of Natural Philosophy based on a mistake.

So, we need to fix that bug before we're done.  At the beginning of the ''cond'' statement, we'll check that the values of ''extinct'' and ''really-big'' are valid for koalas.

&lt;pre&gt;(defn classify-koala [extinct really-big]
  (cond (not (and (or (eql? extinct :yes)
                      (eql? extinct :no))
                  (or (eql? really-big :yes)
                      (eql? really-big :no))))
        :unknown
        (eql? extinct :no)
        :koala
        (eql? really-big :no)
        :phacolarctos-maris
        true
        :giant-koala))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which does the job, except that, well, the logic here has become hard to follow unless you already know how koalas are classified.  Let's look at that first condition.  Well, it seems that we're asking the same question over and over, so let's break it off into its own  function:

&lt;pre&gt;(defn classify-koala [extinct really-big]
  (let [yesno? (fn [answer] (or (eql? answer :yes)
                                (eql? answer :no)))]
    (cond (not (and (yesno? extinct)
                    (yesno? really-big)))
          :unknown
          (eql? extinct :no)
          :koala
          (eql? really-big :no)
          :phacolarctos-maris
          true
          :giant-koala)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Better, but we're still asking &lt;tt&gt;(eql? something :no)&lt;/tt&gt; all over the place.  And, in fact, clojure has a function to take a function like '''eql?''' that takes several arguments and make it into a function that takes fewer arguments: '''appl'''.

So, if we write &lt;tt&gt;(appl eql? :no)&lt;/tt&gt;, that will return a function that asks if its arguments are equal to '':no''.  It's almost the same as writing &lt;tt&gt;(fn [answer] (eql? :no answer))&lt;/tt&gt; except that, if it takes more than one argument, '''appl''' won't break, whereas that function that I wrote will.

So, let's use '''appl''' and add an explicit test for something being &quot;no&quot;.

&lt;pre&gt;(defn classify-koala [extinct really-big]
  (let [yesno? (fn [answer] (or (eql? answer :yes)
                                (eql? answer :no)))
        no? (appl eql? :no)]
    (cond (not (and (yesno? extinct)
                    (yesno? really-big)))
          :unknown
          (no? extinct)
          :koala
          (no? really-big)
          :phacolarctos-maris
          true
          :giant-koala)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Better still.

Which brings up the question, is there a way to condense '''yesno?''' with '''appl'''?  '''yesno?''' repeats the same question twice, but, unlike with '''no?''', the part that remains the same is ''answer'', not '':no''.

Well, '''appl''' will get us halfway there, but trying to build this with just '''appl''' will result in '''yesno?''' growing again with no real gain. 

Well, let's look at it another way, is there anything that '''yesno?''' does that we don't need?  Well, no.  It checks if a value is '':yes'' or '':no''.  How about the other way around?  What if we need to add '':maybe'' later?  Well, then we'd add a new line, check that the parentheses all match up...

Or, maybe we could just say &quot;if the answer is in this list, it's a valid answer.&quot;  After all, we're just using '''yesno?''' to check that we don't get natural philosophers defrocked for hooking up the wrong input to the koala classifier.

For that, we'll need '''some'''.  It returns the first item in a list for which the function we give it returns true.  And, with the functions we have, &lt;tt&gt;(appl eql? answer)&lt;/tt&gt; should return true if the answer and the item are the same.

Also, may as well rename '''yesno?''' to '''valid?''' as it's now checking valid input, rather than strictly yes or no.

&lt;pre&gt;(defn classify-koala [extinct really-big]
  (let [valid? (fn [answer] (some (appl eql? answer)
                                  (:yes :no)))
        no? (appl eql? :no)]
    (cond (not (and (valid? extinct)
                    (valid? really-big)))
          :unknown
          (no? extinct)
          :koala
          (no? really-big)
          :phacolarctos-maris
          true
          :giant-koala)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

And that one loads fine, but fails to run.  Why?  Well, the first thing after a parenthesis is supposed to be the name of a function.  And '':yes'' is not the name of a function.  So, the final step is to use the function '''list''' to say that &lt;tt&gt;(:yes :no)&lt;/tt&gt; is actually a list of things, rather than a function called ''':yes''' being called on the argument ''':no'''.

&lt;pre&gt;(defn classify-koala [extinct really-big]
  (let [valid? (fn [answer] (some (appl eql? answer)
                                  (list :yes :no)))
        no? (appl eql? :no)]
    (cond (not (and (valid? extinct)
                    (valid? really-big)))
          :unknown
          (no? extinct)
          :koala
          (no? really-big)
          :phacolarctos-maris
          true
          :giant-koala)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

And that's the not-so-short story of how one builds a function that actually does something and uses things that Clojure is good at in order to keep the flow of the function as clean as possible.

All of the functions that we've been using ('''appl''', '''and''', '''cond''', '''defn''', '''eql?''', '''fn''', '''let''', '''list''', '''no?''', '''not''', '''some''', '''valid?''' and, of course, '''classify-koala''') meet the nebulous description at the top that a function is something that takes some values, manipulates them and returns a value.

==== What is functional programming? ====

Does this count as functional programming? Well, yes. Are we doing it deliberately? Not quite. Mostly we've applied functional methods because that's what Clojure encourages by language design.

Let's add in another constraint, though. A '''pure function''' should not change anything outside itself. That means that it takes arguments, returns a value, but nothing else changes.

Our functions have all been pure functions, but that's partially happenstance. They didn't exactly have anything outside of themselves to change, so they failed to alter it.  On the other hand, nothing outside of '''classify-koala''' will change when it's called, so it counts as being a pure function.

Functional programming, though, is the process of using primarily pure functions to write programs.  By not changing anything outside themselves, it means that these functions can be used as building blocks from which to build a program without having to worry that the situation outside the function has been properly set up.

==== Higher-order functions ====

One of the fundamental ways in which this is done is via '''higher-order functions'''.  These are functions that take a function as an argument.  In making the '''classify-koala''' function, we used several higher-order functions, specifically '''appl''' and '''some'''.

Let's look at '''valid?''' specifically.  And how '''valid?''' differs from the '''some''' and '''appl''' inside.

&lt;pre&gt;(let [valid? (fn [answer] (some (appl eql? answer)
                                  (list :yes :no)))]
  (valid? :yes))
&lt;/pre&gt;

So, '''valid?''' takes ''answer'' as an argument and passes it into &lt;tt&gt;(appl eql? answer)&lt;/tt&gt;.  '''eql?''', though, is a function.  So '''appl''' is taking a function and an arbitrary argument and returning a function that performs the operations &lt;tt&gt;(fn [arguments] (eql? answer arguments))&lt;/tt&gt;

So, '''appl''' is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a modified version of that same function.  Making it, by definition, higher-order.

But what about '''some'''?  We passed it a call to '''appl''', as well as a list.  Well, since '''appl''' returns a function, it gives that function to '''some''' as an argument.

Finally, '''valid?''' itself takes a single argument, but that is not used later on as a function, so '''valid?''' is a regular function.

Well, this is all getting a little abstract, so let's look at what it is that &lt;tt&gt;(valid? extinct)&lt;/tt&gt; does when it's called.

First, the value to which '''valid?''' is bound is looked up:

&lt;pre&gt;((fn [answer] (some (appl eql? answer)
                    (list :yes :no)))
  :yes)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then, '''valid?''''s arguments (in this case, ''answer'') are bound to the value being passed to '''valid?''':

&lt;pre&gt;(some (appl eql? :yes)
      (list :yes :no))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Next, '''valid?''' is evaluated.  '''some''' is the first thing inside '''valid?''', but '''appl''' is a function and the first thing inside '''some''', so that becomes the first thing evaluated.

'''appl''' evaluates to a function:

&lt;pre&gt;(some (fn [arguments] (eql? :yes arguments))
      (list :yes :no))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then '''some''' calls the function that was passed to it as an argument on each of the items in the list, passing the item as the argument.

&lt;pre&gt;(or (eql? :yes :yes)
    (eql? :yes :no))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then each of the '''eql?'''s are evaluated in order, with '''or''' returning true if any of them are true.

&lt;pre&gt;(or true
    (eql? :yes :no))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, because there is a ''true'' found, that ''true'' is the result of the evaluation.

&lt;pre&gt;true
&lt;/pre&gt;

So, that was rather a lot of math to say nothing that we hadn't already done. We used higher-order functions earlier to simplify logic and the flow in our '''classify-koala''' function. However, those same things could have been written without using higher-order functions to differentiate between koalas.  Why are they useful, then?

==== Mapping and filtering ====

Well, the main purpose for higher-order functions in a functional language is when you want to do something repeatedly.  You define the function once and call it on all the things for which you want to calculate.

I'd said that the mad scientist would make an appearance sooner or later. Well, Horace Smythe, a renegade Australian natural philosopher wants to send us a list of koalas he's seen, in order to get them classified. We've agreed that he'll send the list as a pair of yes/no values, indicating what he knows about these koalas.

&lt;pre&gt;((:yes :yes)
 (:yes :no)
 (:yes :yes)
 (:no :no)
 (:yes :yes)
 (:yes :yes)
 (:no :no)
 (:no :no)
 (:yes :yes)
 (:yes :no))
&lt;/pre&gt;

So the first tape comes in, and all we have to do is enter each of these pairs of koala values into '''classify-koala''' and send him back the list before the Byzantine authorities find out that we're helping a natural philosopher who plays by his own rules.

Except that Smythe apparently has a backlog of koala sightings and he keeps sending us more and more koalas as little lists.  The time taken to classify these is pulling us away from working on the much more difficult task of classifying Finnish lichen.  What we need is a way to take a list of values, run '''classify-koala''' on each value, and get a list of what these koalas were.

That's where the '''map''' function comes in.  '''map''' takes a function and a list, then calls that function on each element of the list, returning a list of the return values of that function.

So, we use map and '''classify-koala''' over Smythe's list and get:

&lt;pre&gt;user=&gt; (map classify-koala
            '((:yes :yes)
              (:yes :no)
              (:yes :yes)
              (:no :no)
              (:yes :yes)
              (:yes :yes)
              (:no :no)
              (:no :no)
              (:yes :yes)
              (:yes :no)))
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong number of args passed
&lt;/pre&gt;

An error. Should have known that it wouldn't have been that easy.  Let's look at why it happened.  '''classify-koala''' takes two arguments: ''extinct'' and ''really-big''.  ''map'', on the other hand, passes &lt;tt&gt;(:yes :yes)&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;(:yes :no)&lt;/tt&gt;.

In other words, we need to extract the data before passing it on to '''classify-koala'''.  While we could change '''classify-koala''' to reflect a pair of yes/no answers, a better solution would be to write an additional function that takes the list of koalas and runs the '''map''' on it itself.

&lt;pre&gt;(defn classify-koala-list [koala-list]
  (map classify-koala
       koala-list))
&lt;/pre&gt;

So, that's what we had before, only extracted into its own function.  The next step, then, is to actually unpack the data.

&lt;pre&gt;(defn classify-koala-list [koala-list]
  (map (fn [koala] (classify-koala (first koala)
                                   (second koala)))
       koala-list))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Better.  This takes our koala list, unpacks each item and feeds it to '''classify-koala'''.  And trying it out, we get:

&lt;pre&gt;user=&gt; (classify-koala-list '((:yes :yes)
                              (:yes :no)

      <text xml:space="preserve">hello ppl!!!! can anyoone please give me the solution of this program

follows:
1) Define three sets A, B and C each contain integers with cardinalities |A| = |B| &lt; |C| ≤ 20. (Notice that the cardinality of the set C should be greater than the cardinality of B, and that the cardinalities of A and B should be equal).
2) Function f should be a one-to-one correspondence f: A → B.
3) Function g should be a one-to-one (but not onto) function g: A → C.
4) Function h should be a not one-to-one function h: B → C.
The program must incorporate the functions f, g, and h of the types indicated above.
The actual functions (mappings) are the student’s choice.
2. Program operation.
1) The program must first display the contents of the sets A, B, and C.
2) For each of the functions f, g, and h, the program must do the following:
a) Prompt the user to enter (type in) an element of the domain of the function.
b) Display the ordered pair that contains the image under the corresponding function of the element entered by the user.
c) Prompt the user to enter an element of the codomain of the function.
d) Display the ordered pair that contains the pre-image under the corresponding function of the element of the codomain entered by the user.
e) In the case of function f, the program should also display the image of the composition of g and f, that is, the image of ))(())((xfgxfg=o.
In each case, the program should display a message when the required image or pre-image does not exist under a given function (f, g, or h, or ). Each of the above prompts and displays should be done several times for each type of function. ))((xfgo
The program must clearly indicate the type of functions considered in each case and provide all the necessary output in an understandable manner.
2. The results
Run your program at least three times showing different situations or scenarios, including cases in which the image, or pre-image of the function does not exist.</text>

}}

== Overview ==
'''''Dexter Fortescue''''', only seen as a portrait in the Headmaster's office, is described as 'a corpulent, red nosed wizard'.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Although he is not named, we see Fortescue shortly after the attack on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]. Having collected all the Weasley children and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] in his office, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] attempts to wake up [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus Black's]] portrait, to confirm that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] is ready to receive a large number of visitors. Phineas expresses unwillingness to help, at which the other portraits in the office express indignation. Three are particularly vocal, those being the wizard later identified as Fortescue, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Armando Dippet|Armando Dippet]], and an unnamed witch with a particularly thick-looking wand, almost a cudgel, who offers to chastise Phineas.

Fortescue is first named when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] is explaining to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] how she learned about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] first meeting in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]]. She explains that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Willy Widdershins|Willy Widdershins]] had been there and reported back. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], also present, comments that she had wondered how Willy had gotten off so lightly after all those regurgitating toilets, and Fortescue erupts, saying that they did not cut deals with petty criminals in his day. Dumbledore responds, &quot;that will do, Fortescue.&quot;

When Dumbledore sends Harry to his office after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle in the Ministry]], Fortescue is among the first portraits to awaken and notice that he is there. He asks if this means Dumbledore will be returning, and comments that it has been dull in his absence. He also remarks that Dumbledore holds Harry in high esteem.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

After the final victory at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle at Hogwarts]], Harry returns to the Headmaster's office to speak with Dumbledore's portrait. As he enters, he is greeted with loud cheers and applause from all the portraits. Dexter Fortescue is mentioned by name, waving his ear trumpet. 

== Strengths ==
As he is a former Hogwarts Headmaster, Fortescue was presumably a very intelligent and magically proficient Wizard during his lifetime. He appears to have an assertive personality, freely speaking out with his opinions. He appears to have a good opinion of Harry, and apparently feels it is important to mention that Dumbledore thinks highly of him.

== Weaknesses ==
Judging by the ear trumpet seen in his portrait, Fortescue must have had some hearing loss, probably due to advancing age.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

As they share a common surname, Dexter may be an ancestor of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Florean Fortescue|Florean Fortescue]], owner of the ice cream parlour in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]]. Florean has a vast knowledge about medieval witch burnings and seems to have an aptitude for teaching, suggesting he could be related to the former Headmaster. Nothing in the books either supports or refutes this relationship.

Along with the other Headmaster portraits, Forescue acts as advisor to Albus Dumbledore and assists him as needed. He also speaks his mind to the other Headmaster portraits, vocally chastising anyone who he believes is acting inappropriately.

Fortescue appears to like Harry and interacts with him more than the other portraits.

== Analysis ==

Fortescue quite clearly has rigid ideas about propriety, and readily expresses them. He probably sees his role in the office panoply as being the guardian of The Correct Way, as clearly everything has deteriorated so badly since he was Headmaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gas Content of the Atmosphere
Gas	         Percent Composition
Nitrogen (N2)	        78.080
Oxygen (O2)	        20.946

Krypton (Kr)	         0.000114
Hydrogen (H2)	         0.00005


If you liken the atmosphere to a football field of
100 yards in length, nitrogen, oxygen and argon make
up the first 99.96 yards.  

Carbon dioxide makes up 0.038 of the total gas in
the atmosphere.  The amount represents approximately
1.4 inches of the 100 yards on the football field.

Surprising that this tiny percentage of the total atmosphere is blamed for climate change over the entire planet.</text>

==1. Identify at least five common kinds of wood, such as pine, walnut, oak, and cedar. ==
Precise identification of wood samples can be very difficult indeed, especially when one considers how ''many'' different types of wood there are.  For this requirement, it will suffice to bring in five samples and teach the student to distinguish between them.  Unless you are already an expert at identifying wood, you would be well served to visit a specialty lumber establishment and ask for a few samples of five species.  These types of stores are staffed by extremely knowledgeable people.  You may also have luck at a hardware/lumber store such as Lowes or Home Depot.  These stores will often display their hardwoods in a different section away from the construction lumber (which is mostly fir and pine).  They commonly carry oak, maple, and poplar lumber, and less commonly, cedar.  Beech, oak, and luan (a cheap grade of mahogany) are usually available in plywood form.  You may also be able to get free samples at a hardwood floor store.

When you have your samples, label them on one side so you can be sure of their identities.

===Pine===
[[Image:Kiefer Holz.JPG|thumb|250px|Pine]]
Pines is among the most commercially important genus of tree, valued for its timber and wood pulp throughout the world. Pine wood is widely used in high-value carpentry items such as furniture, window frames, paneling and floors.  Pine is readily available at commercial lumberyards, being among the least expensive forms of lumber.  Pine is light yellow to white with a reddish tinge.  It darkens to an orange tint with age.  The wood is soft and easily shaped with both hand and power tools, making it a very popular choice for wood craft.  
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===Walnut===
[[Image:Nussbaum Holz.JPG|thumb|250px|Walnut]]
The Persian Walnut, and the Black Walnut and its allies, are important for their attractive timber, which is hard, dense, tight-grained and polishes to a very smooth finish. The colour ranges from creamy white in the sapwood to a dark chocolate colour in the heartwood. When kiln-dried, walnut wood tends toward a dull brown colour, but when air-dried can become a rich purplish-brown. Because of its colour, hardness and grain it is a prized furniture and carving wood. Walnut burls (or 'burrs' in Europe) are commonly used to create bowls and other turned pieces. Veneer sliced from walnut burl is one of the most valuable and highly prized by cabinet makers and prestige car manufacturers.

Walnut is an expensive lumber not usually available at the usual lumberyards (Home Depot, Lowes, etc.).  One generally has to buy it at a specialty hardwood lumber store.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===Oak=== 
[[Image:Traubeneiche.JPG|thumb|250px|Oak]]
Oak has very attractive grain markings, particularly when quarter-sawn. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for use in interior paneling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the British House of Commons in London, England, and in the construction of fine furniture. Today oakwood is still commonly used for furniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and for veneer production.

Oak is a very hard, strong, and durable wood.  It is not easily worked when cured, and is thus not a good choice for the beginning wood crafter.  However, in the hands of a skilled craftsman, it is an excellent choice, holding carving detail well over very long periods of time. 
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===Cedar=== 
The fine-grained, soft brittle pinkish- to brownish-red heartwood is fragrant, very light and very durable, even in contact with soil. Because of its rot resistance the wood is used for fence posts. Because the aromatic wood is avoided by moths it is in demand as lining for clothes chests and closets, often referred to as cedar closets and cedar chests. It was once a premier wood for pencils.

Cedar is available at some lumberyards, but is often located in a section of the store reserved for outfitting closets.  It is more expensive than pine, but not out of reach of the budget-conscious Pathfinder.  Its aroma alone make it well worth the added expense compared to pine, and it works just as easily.  It is an excellent choice for the beginner.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===Maple=== 
[[Image:Ahorn-Maser Holz.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Maple with Birdseye Figure]]
[[Image:Ahorn Holz.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Maple with straight grain]]
Some of the larger maple species have valuable timber, particularly Sugar Maple in North America, and Sycamore Maple in Europe. Sugar Maple wood, often known as &quot;hard maple&quot;, is the wood of choice for bowling pins, bowling alley lanes, pool cue shafts, drums, and butcher's blocks. Maple wood is also used for the production of wooden baseball bats, though less often than ash or hickory.

Some maple wood has a highly decorative wood grain, known as flame maple and quilt maple. This condition occurs randomly in individual trees of several species, and often cannot be detected until the wood has been sawn, though it is sometimes visible in the standing tree as a rippled pattern in the bark.

Maple is a very hard wood, and while that makes it difficult to work with hand tools, it also makes it a very good choice when fine carving details are desired.  Because of its working difficulty, it is a wood better left to the experienced craftsman rather than the beginner.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===Fir=== 
[[Image:Douglasie Holz.JPG|thumb|250px|Fir]]
Douglas-fir wood is used for structural applications that are required to withstand high loads. It is used extensively in the construction industry.  Like pine and cedar, it is a soft, easily worked wood.  
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===Cherry=== 
[[Image:Kirschbaum Holz.JPG|thumb|250px|Cherry]]
Cherry is a beautiful wood highly prized for furniture making.  It has a warm brown tone that changes with age to a dark reddish brown.  Cherry holds carving details well as it is a hardwood, but it is easier to work than oak, ash, walnut, or maple.  Cherry is unlikely to be found in most hardwood/lumber stores, but it is readily available at specialty hardwood outlets.  Cherry takes a finish like almost no other wood, providing a rich luster that takes a high polish.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==2. Know the characteristics for the woods identified, and know one use for each example. ==
The characteristics of each of these woods are described in requirement 1.  We list common uses of each below:
;Pine: Furniture, shelving, flooring
;Walnut: Furniture, paneling
;Oak: Furniture, decorative trim (chair rail, molding, stair rails), paneling, beams, flooring, barrels
;Cedar: Closets, storage chests, plaques
;Maple: Furniture, flooring, musical instruments (guitars, violins, drums, etc.), butcher blocks
;Fir: Construction
;Cherry: Furniture

==3. What is the difference between hard and soft wood? ==
Wood that is produced by cone-bearing trees is classified as softwood.  All other wood is classified as hardwood.  In general hardwoods are harder than softwoods, but there are many hard softwoods (such as yellow pine and yew), and there are many soft hardwoods (such as balsa).  The hardness of the wood is therefore not a reliable indicator of whether a wood is a hardwood or a softwood.

==4. Know how to properly use the following tools in wood handicrafts: ==
===a. Coping saw ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Woodworking Tools/Coping saw}}
===b. Rasp ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Woodworking Tools/Rasp}}

===e. Chisel ===

===f. Sanding block===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Woodworking Tools/Sanding Block}}

==5. Know at least two safety procedures for each of the above tools. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Tool Safety}}

==6. Cut out, assemble, and finish animal bookends or doorstop. ==
Take a piece of wood that is square with a thickness of at least 1/2 inch and draw the animal you want or use carbon paper to trace an existing picture of an animal.  Be sure to leave the bottom edge of the board straight, as this will fasten to the flat part of the bookend.  Use a coping saw to cut out the animal shape.  Sand the board to make it smooth and remove all splinters.  Once this part is ready, fasten it to the lower part of the bookend at a 90° angle using two wood screws.  The screws should go through the horizontal bottom piece first, and then into the endgrain of the vertical piece (with the animal cut-out).  Drill pilot holes before driving the screws or the boards will crack.  The diameter of the drill bit should be equal to the diameter of the screw minus the threads.  This can be estimated by holding the drill bit behind the screw.  The threads should extend past the drill bit, but you should just barely be able to see the drill bit itself.  Bore a countersink hole in the underside of the horizontal piece so that the screw will not extend past the surface of the board.  When the holes are ready, drive the screws.  At this point, you can paint, stain, or varnish the bookend.  Once the finish is dry, glue a piece of plastic craft foam to the bottom of the bookend to protect the bookshelf.  The foam should create a non-slip surface so the books will not cause the bookend to slide over.

==7. Cut out and finish a garden stake or lawn marker, using a design such as a child, bird, flower, or tree. ==
Materials that you will need for this project include: 1/4 inch plywood (3 feet square), 1/2 inch block of wood (can be plywood or wood stock),* a coping saw, a sanding block, and any art materials that you wish to use to color the project once you have finished all other steps.*
* Note: Items marked with an &quot;*&quot; are not required for this project. You do not have to paint the project, but it will look much nicer if you do. Also, you can cut the stake part of this project below the design that you select. However, the finished project will not be as sturdy as one that uses the 1/2 inch block of wood.

Take your 1/4 inch plywood and draw (or trace with carbon paper) the design that you wish to use for this project. When you are finished drawing, take a coping saw and cut out your design. If you find that the plywood is tearing out excessively, put the coping saw away and get out a carton knife (or use a hooked blade on a pocket knife).  Slice a V-groove around where the saw will cut.  This cut should go straight down (90°) along the line, and angle in from the waste side.  Next closely examine the teeth of the coping saw, and re-install the blade so that it cuts on the pull stroke rather than on the push stroke.  You may notice that a saw always rips out on the side of the board that the cutting stroke exits.  By using a knife to cut out around the line, there is nothing to tear out, but this only works if the blade cuts on the pull stroke.

Then, sand the edges gently to remove the excess wood particles that make the design rough and unfinished. Next, take your 1/2 inch block of wood and cut it to about 18 inches in length and cut one end to a point (it is best to make a 45 degree cut from both sides of the stake). Now, attach your design to the stake using wood glue, finishing nails, or wood screws.
* Note: If you are making the entire project from the 1/4 inch plywood, the stake extends from the bottom of the design anywhere from 12-18 inches. Do not cut the stake out separately, but cut down beyond the design to make the stake.
Finally, you may decorate your project with paint, if you wish. It would be best to put a water sealant on your project before placing it outside so that rain will not ruin it.

==8. Make a plaque, tray, notebook cover, or some other useful object in which wood burning is used.==
Woodburning is the art of decorating wood or other materials with burn marks resulting from the controlled application of a heated object such as a poker. It is also known as pokerwork or pyrography.

Pyrography means &quot;writing with fire&quot; and is the traditional art of using a heated tip or wire to burn or scorch designs onto natural materials such as wood or leather. Burning can be done by means of a modern solid-point tool (similar to a soldering iron) or hot wire tool, or a more basic method using a metal implement heated in a fire, or even sunlight concentrated with a magnifying lens.

This allows a great range of natural tones and shades to be achieved - beautiful subtle effects can create a picture in sepia tones, or strong dark strokes can make a bold, dramatic design. Varying the type of tip used, the temperature, or the way the iron is applied to the material all create different effects. Solid-point machines offer a variety of tip shapes, and can also be used for &quot;branding&quot; the wood or leather. Wire-point machines allow the artist to shape the wire into a variety of configurations, to achieve broad marks or fine lines. This work is time-consuming, done entirely by hand, with each line of a complex design drawn individually. After the design is burned in, wooden objects are often colored, sometimes boldly or more delicately tinted.

Light-colored hardwoods such as sycamore, beech and birch are most commonly used, as their fine grain is not obtrusive, and they produce the most pleasing contrast. However, other woods, such as pine or oak, are also used when required. 

By far, the easiest option for meeting this requirement is to decorate a plaque.  Blank, unfinished wooden plaques are readily available at craft stores.  Begin by drawing your design on the wood with a pencil.  You can then proceed to burn your design into the wood with the wood burning tool or with the sun and a magnifying glass.  Choose a simple design for your first attempt, as this technique requires patience and persistence. Once the design is burned into the wood, it can be finished with varnish, tung oil, or lacquer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The XForms Architecture ==
Unlike some technologies, e.g. [[AJAX]], XForms is much more than a collection of languages and techniques.  XForms has a fully developed architecture and a complete set of design patterns.

To start with let's look at the heart of XForms architecture: The Model-View-Controller design pattern.

Most people that have studied [[w:MVC|MVC]] architecture agree on two aspects: The Model and the View.  The model is where you store your data or your business objects.  The View is what the user sees.  But many variations of MVC have very different implementations of a controller.  In the early days of SmallTalk at Xerox PARC the controller was related to user events and how they are gathered and dispatched.  Today our input controls have much of the heavy lifting of events &quot;baked into&quot; them, so the form designers don't have to worry too much about handling mouse events and redirecting them unless they want specific behaviors. Many forms can be created without any knowledge of how events work.

To understand how XForms work you must understand that XForms has two trees in the browser.  

The model is a tree that is not presented to the user directly and holds one or more instances and optionally some binding rules and some named events.

The view is a tree of presentation elements that the user sees.  To build an XForms application you simply wire the two trees together using binding statements.  And there are several ways to do this.

== '''General Description of Mass Spectrometry:''' ==

	One of the main goals of metabolomics is to quantify changes in the concentrations of metabolites, and mass spectrometry offers a way to achieve this.  Mass spectrometers can measure the masses and relative concentrations of molecules in a sample, making mass spectrometry an indispensable tool in metabolomics.

	The technique involves ionizing the molecules to be analyzed and measuring the mass to charge ratio to determine the mass of each molecule present in the sample.  There are four steps to the general process of mass spectrometry:
	
1.Ionization: Molecules are ionized to positive ions.

2.Acceleration: Ions are accelerated.

3.Deflection: Ions are introduced to a magnetic field and deflected in slightly different directions based on their unique masses and the amount of positive charge the ion has.  Less mass and more positive charge both result in more deflection.

4.Detection: The ions are detected electrically.

&lt;small&gt;from here: http://www.shef.ac.uk/aps/apsrtp/seaman-jen/metabolomics.html&lt;/small&gt;


Common types of mass spectrometry used in metabolomics include Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS (MALDI-MS), Tandem MS-MS, Ion Trap MS, liquid chromatography MS (LC-MS), and gas chromatography MS (GC-MS).

&lt;nowiki&gt; 1.  13C-Labeled Gluconate Tracing as a Direct and Accurate Method for Determining the Pentose Phosphate Pathway Split Ratio in Penicillium chrysogenum&lt;/nowiki&gt;

URL: http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1489366&amp;blobtype=pdf

'''Main focus:''' 
	The researchers used the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum in their attempt to accurately quantify the split ratio of 6-phosphogluconate between the oxidative and non-oxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP).  Previous studies attempting to quantify the split ratio in other organisms had results based on assumptions, but these people have overcome these difficulties with a relatively straight-forward approach.  By feeding the cells simultaenously with trace amounts of  13C-labeled gluconate, which enters the pathway by directly being converted to 6-phosphogluconate, and using glucose free of any carbon label.  They used a Quatro-LC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer to analyze the concentrations of the various intermediates in glycolysis and the PPP.  They used a model formula to quantify the split ratio.  They were able to assert that the PPP split ration was 51.1% with a 95% confidence interval, suggesting that the 13C-labeled gluconate tracing method is a much more sensitive and accurate method of determining flux which does not disturb the over all metabolism of the cell.

'''Terms:'''
1.Gluconate: a six carbon molecule with five hydroxyl groups terminating in a carboxylic acid group that can be converted to 6-phosophogluconate, then to fructose-6-phosphate, and used in glycolysis.

2.Isotopomer: Isomers have the same number of isotope atom but with different positions

3.Chemostat:  A chemically static environment for growing microorganisms

4.Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA): technique used for determining the rate at which a metabolite is produced in a metabolic process. 
 
5.Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry:  Combines the physical separation capbabilities of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry.  Generally used to find the composition of complex samples, such as those of biological origin.


'''Connection:'''
	The connection here with what we've learned in the course is obvious – they are trying to determine the flux of molecules between the oxidative and non-oxidative portions of the pentose phosphate pathway, which we learned about in chapter 14.  This is the pathway that converts glucose-6-phosphate to ribose 5-phosophate, which can be used to synthesize nucleic acids and coenzymes.  There is also a connection with what we learned about the regulation of metabolic pathways in chapter 15, where the rate of metabolic flow was introduced – this is flux, and is mentioned throughout the article.





'''2.''' Pathway Confirmation and Flux Analysis of Central Metabolic Pathways in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry

URL: http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1797301&amp;blobtype=pdf

'''Main focus:''' 
	The researchers used the sulfur-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough and tried to determine some information about its metabolism. GC-MS and FT-ICR MS were used to quantitate the amounts and types of metabolites the bacteria produced and to determine whether D. vulgaris's cytric acid cycle was oxidative or reductive (a fact that was previously unknown), and also to examine its glycolytic pathway and Pentose Phosphate Pathway. FT-ICR MS allowed them to confirm that the citric acid cycle in this sulfur-reducing bacterium was was different from most aerobic organisms in that the citrate produced was the stereochemical opposite of the cirtrate found in most other organisms.  This was confirmed with the help of  13C-labeling, similar to that used in the previous article.  The experiments also enabled them to determine the flux rates along the pathways studied, which are annotated as part of figure 1 within the paper.  All of this work was done to supplement the information already assumed about the organism from genomic analysis.

'''Terms:'''
1.Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) – Combines gas-exchange chromatography, in which the mobile phase is a gas, and mass spectrometry.  Is incredibly specific and able to detect even trace amounts of a molecule in a sample.

2.Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) – Determines the mass to charge ratio of ions, which helps to determine the mass of particles.

3.Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA Cycle): Another name for the citric acid cycle.

4.Electrospray ionization (ESI) – Technique used in mass spectrometry to produce ions.

5.collision-induced dissociation (CID) – mechanism which fragments ions in the gas phase.


'''Connection:'''
	Their work ties in with the chapter about the citric acid cycle, chapter 16, because much of the work centered around determining how  Desulfovibrio vulgaris's CAC worked based on what they knew of the genome and what enzymes they found not to be present in the organism, such as a lack of a citrate synthase homolog.




'''3.''' Inactivation of a Predicted Leader Peptidase Prevents Photoautotrophic Growth of Synechocystis sp. Strain PCC 6803

'''URL:''' http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1082817&amp;blobtype=pdf

'''Main focus:''' 
	The goal of this research was to determine the role of leader peptidase proteins LepB1 and LepB2 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.  Mutants of PCC were created by inserting a kanamycin cassette into the genome in the middle of LepB1 and LepB2.  LepB2 mutants were impossible to procure, probably because the protein is essential for cell viability.  LepB1 mutants' rates of photosynthesis decreased dramatically so that the cells were even harmed by high levels of light.  The electron transport system continued to function, however, as long as cells were not exposed to high levels of light and only for short periods.  The conclusion from this is that LepB1, which encodes a protein that removes signal peptides from precursor proteins that need to cross a membrane, actually plays a role in processing proteins that will eventually find their way in the thylakoid membrane.  Mass spectrometry identified 8 proteins whose concentrations were always reduced in the mutants, four of which carried signal peptides, and also proteins not involved in the thylakoid system, suggesting that LepB1 can be found in both the thylakoid and plasma membranes.

'''Terms:'''
1.Peptidase: an enzyme that can break down a protein into single amino acids.

2.Signal/Leader peptides: short peptide chain that directs the post-translational transportation of a protein.

3.Photoautotroph – organism that synthesizes its “food” from inorganic substances using light as an energy source.

4.Phycobiliproteins – water-soluable flourescent proteins in cyanobacteria and algae that capture light, the energy from which is used to fuel photosynthesis.

5.Western Analysis – Another name from the western blot, a method of detecting the presence of a specific protein in a sample.


'''Connection:'''
	Though we did not learn about the photosynthesis of cyanobacteria in the course, some general principles still apply.  Decreasing the amount of active photosynthetic enzymes in the thylakoid membrane by decreasing the activity of the LepB1 gene product, which transports them there, will decrease the rate of photosynthesis

'''Metabolic Networks in Motion: 13C-based flux analysis'''
http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v2/n1/full/msb4100109.html

'''Summary:'''
The main focus of this research is to study complex networks in metabolism through mathematical models that &quot;attempt to monitor concentration changes of small chemical species within a cell&quot; (par. 2). By using 13C-basesd flux analysis this study is able to &quot;quantifies the integrated output of these component interactions&quot; (par. 4). 

'''Terms: '''
Topology-the study of those properties of geometric forms that remain invariant under certain transformations, as bending or stretching.
Moiety- an indefinite portion, part, or share.
Stoichiometric- pertaining to or involving substances that are in the exact proportions required for a given reaction.
Convergent- characterized by convergence; tending to come together; merging.
Oxaloacetate  -  A four-carbon molecule found in the mitochondrion that condenses with acetyl CoA to form citrate in the first reaction of the Krebs cycle.

'''Relevance:'''
This relates to what we have been studying in class because we have just begun to look at flux in metabolic system. Flux is the rate of turnover of molecules or enzymes through a metabolic pathway. And it is vital as it regulates the metabolic pathway's.

'''1.'''  Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry – METLIN metabolite database

'''URL:''' http://metlin.scripps.edu/index.php

'''Main focus:''' 
	The aim of this site is to provide links to various resources of use to someone doing metabolomics research using mass spectrometry.  There is a metabolite search function, an MS-MS search function, an LC-MS search function, and an FT- MS search function.  There is also a downloadable program with the same functions as the site.

'''Terms:'''
1.MS-MS: Tandem Mass Spectrometry.  Can perform multiple steps of mass selection or analysis

2.FT-MS: Fourier transform mass spectrometry – defined above in article #2.

3.Retention Range: period of time for which data should be available for inquiry.

(More new terms could not be found.)





'''2'''.  Human Metabolome Database

'''URL:''' http://www.hmdb.ca/ (MS search here: http://www.hmdb.ca/labm/jsp/mlims/MSDb.jsp) 

'''Main focus:''' 
	This site focuses on obtaining and providing information about various metabolites, including but not limited to Tandem MS data.  From its name, the site obviously focuses on humans as the species of interest.  It seeks to combine clinical and biochemical data.

'''Terms:'''
1.Biomarker – substance indicating a specific biological state.

2.Applet – software program that runs in the context of another program (ie, internet browser).

(More new terms could not be found.)






'''3.'''  MassBank.jp

'''URL:''' http://www.massbank.jp/index.html

'''Main focus:''' 
	The site focuses on providing an all-inclusive, high resolution resource of metabolic mass spectra.  You can search through text, mass spec analysis method, peak, and source of the data.  No specific organism is mentioned, so it may be assumed that the website includes metabolites from various organisms.  The spectra data are mainly from Japanese research universities.  They have over 13,000 spectra on file.

Terms:
(None could be found.)


'''Connection (for all three databases)::'''
	Databases such as these are indespensible tools for biochemists.  The results of a mass spectrometry experiment are useless unless one can decipher the meaning of each of the individual peaks on the graph.  These databases provide mass spectra for hundreds or thousands of metabolites, allowing for identification and quantification of the molecules present in a sample.  This data can then be used to determine the flux through pathways, changes in pathways, and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the same as [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Making_Landscapes_with_heightmaps]]

Commenting here while going through the book in order: shouldn't this be merged with other pages? The &quot;making the mesh&quot; is basically the same thing as the previous page did. The texture generation used here is IMHO better than what the previous page has, since it does not rely on a separate 2d program (not everyone has the Gimp installed, and when it is not installed it can be a bit of a hassle to figure out how to generate a similar texture). The other &quot;material&quot; settings on this page are completely out of the blue, since this part of the book is about modeling (as far as I can tell those settings have no effect in the 3d view, only when rendered).

And just throwing this out there, although it is likely mentioned in a part of the book I have not gotten to yet: should the &quot;displace&quot; modifier be mentioned as an alternative to the &quot;noise&quot; button here? As far as I can tell it does basically the same thing but is not permanent, which can be an advantage.

== Does this belong here? ==

This page seems to assume the reader knows how to use materials, textures, and other topics that haven't been covered yet.

== repetition ==

I'm going through this tutorial and think this page is a good repetition. It's another possibilty to create landscapes and I've learned more about the different buttons. It's a difficult programm so it's helpful to repeat some things. Just leave the page here, it's ok.</text>

With 2...d5 Black signals an intent to maintain an active position. White challenges the center with options of developing quickly.
White normally now chooses to take the pawn on d5.
:*3. exd5 The normal White response leading to a scramble of control of the d5,e4 and e5 squares.
:*3. Nf3 Developing the Knight and controlling the h4 square to prevent Black's Queen check.
:*3. fxe5 is a blunder as ...Qh4+ 4. g3 Qxe4+ 5. Qe2 Qxh1 is most embarassing.

1....c6 this move is playable but has no destination as an opening as it transposes into something else.
Often played to see if White will play 2. e4 and transpose into a Caro-Kann.

Likely possible responses
:*2. c4 or 2. Nf3 Most likely to transpose into a [[Chess/Slav Defence|Slav Defence]] or [[Chess/Semi-Slav Defence|Semi Slav Defence]]
:*2. e4 This move order arrives at a [[Chess/Caro-Kann Defence|Caro Kann Defence]]

With the move 1....b6 Black prepares to develop the Queenside Bishop, it's also a flexible option when played with the e6 development as Black has various ideas involving the e6, Nf6, Bb4, Bb7 moves.

White likely to respond with one of the following:
:*2. c4 A standard reply, White continues in Queen Gambit formation ready to play e4.
:*2. Nf3 May transpose into a [[Chess/Queen's Indian Defence|Queen's Indian Defence]].
:*2. e4 This move order arrives at a [[Chess/Owen's Defence|Owen's Defence]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Techniques of Recursion==

===Simple techniques===

====Assembly-Disassembly====

Often we would like to build a list using a recursive function. Perhaps we would like to reverse a list.  We start with a single-argument version (the public entry point function) and use it to call the double-argument version (private), where the extra argument contains the output we wish to build.  We can take the head off of the input, [H|T], as we build up the output, Build.  When input is empty, we are done.

Observe the nice way that strings are actually processed as lists of chars. Syntactic sugar changes strings into lists and back.

(Here we use the assembly-disassembly technique of recursion.  Johnny-Five would not approve of this technique.  [Reference to the 1986 movie &quot;Short Circuit.&quot;])

Remember, we need to bracket H because it needs to be a list when we do list concatenation with the plus-plus, '++'. T is always a list in [H|T]. H may or may not be a list in [H|T]; either way we need to give it a bracket so it behaves properly.

 %%% provides utility functions
                                  %
 -module(util).                   
 -export([reverse/1]).
                                  %% reverse(L) is for public use

Compile and run.

We can reverse a string, which is really a list. We can reverse a list of integers. We can reverse a list of lists. We can reverse a list of tuples. But we cannot reverse a tuple of lists, because the top level structure is not a list.

If we wanted to be slick, we could use a guard to check the type of the argument at the entry point, then if it is a tuple, change it to a list, execute the reverse, and then change it back to a tuple on the way out.


Please note that the example is purely educational, and in real applications you should avoid appending to the list one element at a time. The correct way to build a list is using the [Head|Tail] form. Often this will cause the list to be in reverse order. To remedy that we then use the lists:reverse built-in-function. See example

 %slow
 build_append()-&gt;build_append(0,[]).
 build_append(N,L) when N &lt; 100000 -&gt; build_append(N+1,L++[N]);  % function calls its self with N+1 and a new list with N as the last element.
 build_append(_,L) -&gt; L.

 %fast
 build_insert()-&gt;build_insert(0,[]).
 build_insert(N,L) when N &lt; 100000 -&gt; build_insert(N+1,[N|L]);   % function calls its self with N+1 and a new list with N as the head.
 build_insert(_,L) -&gt; lists:reverse(L).                          % function has to reverse the list before it retuns it.


Compile and run the functions to compare.

The reason behind the speed difference is in the implementation of Erlang lists as linked lists.

==Exercises==

1) Write a function t_reverse(T) that reverses a Tuple, T, of size 5. (i.e. {a,b,c,d,e})

2) Write a function r_reverse(L) that recursively reverses each sublist in a list of lists, L.

3) Write a function s_reverse(L) that recursively reverses only the sublists but not the top level in a list of lists.

4) Write a function n_reverse(L) that recursively reverses sublists only if they contain integers.

=Chigorin Defence=
===2...Nc6===
With 2...Nc6 Black does not support the central d5 pawn but develops a piece for an uneven game.
Theory in this defence has been extended in recent years in part due to the attempt to create playable lines in the [[Chess/Black Knights' Tango|Black Knights' Tango]] which can transpose into a Chigorin Defence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The tennis court is a flat rectangle surface with a low net stretched across the center. It is generally covered in grass, clay, concrete, or a synthetic compound. The courts dimensions are 78 feet by 27 feet for singles courts, and 78 feet by 36 feet for doubles courts.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

The entire text for this stub says: ''This is another book from me to be published by January 2008. I have already obtained the copyright for this book. Will show the text in next 2 months.'' This sounds like a book that won't ever be a Wikibook. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:44, 27 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} Sure sounds like this one deserves a delete. Probably someone's idea of a test. [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 12:37, 27 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{vd}}, I think the author likely did not understand the concept of the GFDL, and if he or she did, he or she is welcomed to make a comment here. However, I also have doubts about the topic of the book which seems non-textbook material. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 17:19, 27 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{vd}}, A clear case for speedy deletion in my view.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:01, 28 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{vd}} People get some pretty crazy ideas when it comes to donating books, and maybe the point isn't made clear enough that certain books just don't belong here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:32, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{vd}}, nothing that polite I can say about it --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:50, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

:{{vd}} I agree with mike. Some stubs are actually counter-productive because people see the terrible shape of them and are dismayed. It's better to give aspiring authors a blank slate where they can exercise their own creativity, and not lock future authors into poorly thought-out and abandoned stubs. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:35, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{vd}} I normally support giving people huge amount of room to develop a book... and really stretch the definition of a stub.  This doesn't even really fit that quality, and I would have to agree with the above comments that this can be deleted without harming any future effort to expand this topic into a genuine book.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 16:58, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

:{{comment}} I would like to call voters' attention to the fact that this page would, among other violations, become a copyright vio because it would &quot;post diagrams in the order they were presented&quot;, which might include copyrighted diagrams, and the book would probably become NPOV if continued, because we are hearing the view from a student, which is heard from a professor, who would probably express his/her opinions on the topic at hand, which would include some controversial topics, I believe. I leave it to you to read it for yourselves, but this is how I see it. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 01:46, 31 January 2008 (UTC)
::Well this all depends on how direct a copy was... In any case you seem to be making suppositions about the facts, best approach would be to ask the user and indicate/instruct him on how to bypass the direct coping of &quot;original works&quot; (kinda like GNU does about software, can't remember the link but a funny read), in this case it is a dead issue since we seem to have delete consensus, but in general we should attempt to prevent problems but [[meta:Avoid copyright paranoia|lets not be to protective or paranoid]]. Since we don't have the originals (and assuming we wouldn't have access to verify them) only the entity that has the copyrights can raise the issue. We could argue that it is even probable that even the instructor may not have the rights to them (depending on how original they are), but by default and the actual copyright law, we must assumed he has, in this case we could even argue that we should assume the user has the right to use it, so the next point is what license if any did the instructor invoke and in what form did he gave access to them. Best approach is to trust but verify (if possible) and instruct users on possible problems if unsure.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:55, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Keep}}}''' '''Leave content as is until March 30th'''  I appreciate feedback regarding my student's WIKI.  You are providing the first comments we've seen regarding  our content.  I'm new to Wikis but getting up to speed ASAP.  I spend the majority of my time in media and on-line software but this environment does not seem intuitive to me and I have limited time to devote to it.  Along with a dozen media editing tools, students already use on-line courseware (D2L) for class content which I manage as their professor.  Wikiversity is redundant to that tool, so I am resistent to using it for that reason.  Undergraduate students are assigned to manage our Wikibook so it's not surprising that is has evolved inappropriately.  I'll take responsibility to see that content is oriented to a book, not an on-line course, but will need until March 30th 2008 to accomplish this.  Moving our information to Wikiversity duplicates the function of D2L software, so I want to keep info. where it is until changes can be made.  Neither I nor my students have time to re-link images, etc. so this is important to us.  Is it possible to change the name of a book (from Advanced Interactive Media Class to Advanced Interactive Media), once it has been published?

::{{Comment}} I'll try to get in touch with this user and see if i can help &quot;shepherd&quot; this project into a more acceptable state. Some changes to formatting, possibly a change to the title, and changes in organization should set this up nicely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== USB ==

The USB port on the Khepera III robot can be used to establish a network connection between the robot and a Linux computer. Start by connecting your robot and your computer with a USB cable.

=== Connecting for the first time ===

If you just bought your Khepera III robot, the USB network interface is disabled. To enable it, connect your robot with a serial cable (using a KoreConnect, for example), log in with username &quot;root&quot; and type:
 modprobe g_ether
 ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.2
The first line loads the driver, while the second line configures an IP address. On your computer, you can now set a corresponding IP address by typing 
 sudo ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.1
in a terminal, or using your network configuration program. (Note that &quot;usb0&quot; might be called differently on some computers. To get a list of all network endpoints, simply type &quot;ifconfig&quot;.)

=== Connecting after the install scripts have been run ===

On a Khepera III robot on which the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Install Scripts|install scripts]] have been run, the USB network interface will automatically appear with IP address 192.168.1.2 when you connect the cable. Hence, you only need to configure your computer by typing
 sudo ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.1
in a terminal, or using your network configuration program. (Note that &quot;usb0&quot; might be called differently on some computers. To get a list of all network endpoints, simply type &quot;ifconfig&quot;.)

=== Testing the connection ===

To test if the connection works, type
 ping 192.168.1.1
on your robot, or
 ping 192.168.1.2
on your computer. Ping should work in both directions.

== Wireless LAN (802.11) ==

If you are working with more than one robot, or if you want to communicate with your Khepera III while it is running an experiment, you will probably put a WLAN card in the available CompactFlash slot. This adds a new network interface, which is not configured by default. There is an [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Install Scripts|install script]], however, which automatically adds the necessary configuration and configures the interface with an IP address 192.168.141.ID, where ID corresponds to the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Scripts|robot ID]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The folder '''InstallScripts''' in the top folder of the Khepera III Tools contains scripts to set up a couple of useful things on the robot. These scripts require a Khepera III robot to be [[Khepera III Toolbox/Network Setup|connected via USB to the computer]].

Before launching the install scripts, we suggest you to set up SSH public key authentication between your computer and the robot. This can be done with one of the Khepera III Toolbox scripts:
 cd Scripts
 ./k3-ssh-keysetup +usb
 cd ..
To launch all install scripts, type
 cd InstallScripts/Kernel-2.6
 ./install
If you are launching this install procedure for the first time with your robot, the script will first ask you to give your robot an ID. This ID is used to assign a WLAN IP address for the robot, and may also be used by programs running on the robot as a unique identifier of the robot. Needless to say that this ID must be unique among your fleet of robot.
If the robot has been given an ID before, the same robot ID will be used.

If your robot is not connected via USB, but some other mechanism, invoke the install script with the IP address of the robot, e.g.:
 ./install 192.168.141.200

== Default Install Scripts ==

The install script will invoke the following three install scripts (which can also be executed separately if necessary):

* &lt;tt&gt;install_robotid SSHHOST ROBOTID&lt;/tt&gt;: Sets up the robot ID. Invoke this script separately if you wish to change the robot ID of a robot which already has an ID.
* &lt;tt&gt;install_profile SSHHOST ROBOTID&lt;/tt&gt;: Copies a bash profile with a bunch of useful aliases (l, .., ...) onto the robot.
* &lt;tt&gt;install_network SSHHOST ROBOTID&lt;/tt&gt;: Sets up the WLAN network interface. The IP address assigned to the interface is ''192.168.141.ROBOTID''.

== Creating Your Own Install Scripts ==

In some circumstances, you may want to install your own things in addition to the default install scripts. To do that, take a copy of  ''install_my_own_stuff.template'' and write your install commands in there. Do not forget to add your script to ''install''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Scripts''' folder in the Khepera III Toolbox contains a series of scripts that simplify working with a Khepera III robot, or with a fleet of such robots. These scripts simplify common and often-used tasks, such as copying files onto robots, setting up SSH public key authentication, or shutting down robots. Rare and complicated tasks can always be performed using ssh, scp and other commands directly.


== Using the Scripts and Getting Help ==

'''''[http://fosamax-class-action-lawsuit.blogspot.com/ Fosamax Class Action Lawsuit Blog]'''''

All scripts start with the letters ''k3...''. Hence, if you type ''k3'' in a bash shell, followed by pressing the ''tab'' key twice, all scripts are listed. This is especially useful for those scripts that you do not use daily. In addition, all scripts print a short help text when called with the ''-h'' option, e.g.
 k3put -h

== Selecting Robots ==

Most scripts require you to specify the robots you are working with. This is done with +... arguments on the command line. Four methods for selecting robots are available:
* By robot ID, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;+203&lt;/tt&gt; (which translates into the IP address 192.168.141.203)
* By a range of robot IDs, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;+203-205&lt;/tt&gt; (which is the same as &lt;tt&gt;+203 +204 +205&lt;/tt&gt;)
* By IP address, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;+192.168.141.203&lt;/tt&gt;
* By the name of a robot or a fleet, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;+bob&lt;/tt&gt; (which looks up the IP addresses or robot IDs in the environment variable K3_BOB)

A special robot is '+usb' which always translates to 192.168.1.2, the address of a robot [[Khepera III Toolbox/Network Setup|connected via USB]].

== Working with a Fleet of Robots ==

If you are frequently working with a whole fleet of robots, it is [http://pinnaclehiplaw.altervista.org/blog/ Pinnacle Hip Lawsuit] advantageous to give this fleet a name and define it as an environment variable. For instance, if you are working with robots 203, 204, 209, 210, 211 and 212, add the following line to your .bashrc file:
 export K3_MYFLEET=+203 +204 +209-212
and reload that file (&lt;tt&gt;source ~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt;). From now on, you can select these robots using ''+myfleet'' as script argument. For instance, to copy the ''infrared_proximity'' program onto these robots, type
 k3put +myfleet infrared_proximity

== List of Available Scripts ==

=== Core Scripts ===

The following scripts are often used:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! align=&quot;left&quot; | Script
! align=&quot;left&quot; | Description and example
|- style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3put''
| Copies files onto your fleet of robots. In the '''Programs''' folder, you only need to provide the folder name and the script automatically looks for the binary inside this folder.
 k3put +203 +204 battery motor_* motion_*
|- style=&quot;background-color:#ffffff&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3get''
| Copies files from your robots to the PC. The files are put in folders named ''k3-ROBOTIP'' on the PC. These folders are automatically created if necessary. If the destination file exists, it is overwritten without mercy!
 k3get +203 +204 my_measurements
This will create the two folders ''k3-192.168.141.203'' and ''k3-192.168.141.204'', and copy ''my_measurements'' from both robots into the respective folder.
|- style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3go''
| Connects via SSH to one robot and opens an interactive shell.
 k3go +203
|- style=&quot;background-color:#ffffff&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3run''
| Executes a command on all robots and optionally stores the output in folders named ''k3-ROBOTIP'' on the PC. For instance, you can record 10 infrared proximity measurements on two robots by typing
 k3run +203 +204 -o my_infrared_measurements -e my_stderr - /root/your_username/infrared_proximity -r 10
This will create the two folders ''k3-192.168.141.203'' and ''k3-192.168.141.204'', and save the output of the program to a file called ''my_infrared_measurements'' within these folders. Just as with '''k3get''', existing destination files are overwritten without merci.
Note that the programs are started in parallel on all robots. However, program execution is not synchronized, i.e. one robot may start the program before another robot. Differences in starting times mostly depend on the WLAN channel and are usually in the order of 10 - 100 ms, but can be several seconds if the WLAN channel is heavily loaded or jammed.
If you start programs that do not quit automatically, you can stop them using ''k3kill''.
|- style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3halt''
| Shuts robots down by executing the ''halt'' command on each robot.
 k3halt +203 +204
|- style=&quot;background-color:#ffffff&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3ping''
| Pings one robot continuously, e.g.
 k3ping +203
or reports for multiple robots whether they are alive, by sending 3 ping packets:
 k3ping +203 +204
|- style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3kill''
| Stops a running program on all robots.
 k3kill +203 +204 infrared_proximity
|}

=== Development Scripts ===

The following scripts are used for developing new programs and modules:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! align=&quot;left&quot; | Script
! align=&quot;left&quot; | Description and example
|- style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3-create-program''
| Creates a new program on the computer.
 k3-create-program my_new_program
Note that this script does not interact with any robot. For more information, check out the [[Khepera III Toolbox/Writing your Own Programs|program development section]].
|- style=&quot;background-color:#ffffff&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3-create-module''
| Creates a new module on the computer.
 k3-create-module my_new_module
Note that this script does not interact with any robot. For more information, check out the [[Khepera III Toolbox/Writing your Own Modules|module development section]].
|}

=== Administration Scripts ===

The following scripts help with a couple of administrative tasks and are less frequently needed:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! align=&quot;left&quot; | Script
! align=&quot;left&quot; | Description and example
|- style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3-ssh-keysetup''
| Adds your SSH key on the robots.
 k3-ssh-keysetup +203 +204
|- style=&quot;background-color:#ffffff&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3-erase-userfiles''
| Erases your folder (/root/your_username) on the selected robots:
 k3-erase-userfiles +203 +204
Optionally, a username can be specified to delete those folders instead of yours on the robots:
 k3-erase-userfiles another_username +203 +204
|- style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3-diskusage''
| Reports disk usage of each robot.
 k3-diskusage +203 +204
|}

=== Filter Scripts ===

The following scripts convert program output into another format:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! align=&quot;left&quot; | Script
! align=&quot;left&quot; | Description and example
|- style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee&quot; |
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | ''k3-nmea-to-csv''
| Converts NMEA messages of a certain type (command) to CSV (comma separated values) format.
 k3-nmea-to-csv IRPROXIMITY &lt; my_nmea_file &gt; my_csv_file
A more detailed description can be found in the section on [[Khepera III Toolbox/Parsing Program Output|program output parsing]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Programs''' folder contains a series of useful programs and algorithms that run on the Khepera III robot, and interact with its sensors and actuators (motors). These programs are also useful templates to [[Khepera III Toolbox/Writing your Own Programs|implement your own algorithms]]. In this chapter, we briefly explain how to use these programs.

== Program List ==

Infrared sensors (including the two infrared floor sensors):
* ''infrared_ambient'': Measures the ambient infrared light with all infrared sensors.
* ''infrared_proximity'': Measures the proximity to obstacles with all infrared sensors.

Motors:
* ''motor_initialize'': Initializes both motors. This program must be launched after switching on the robot.
* ''motor_setspeed'': Sets the motor speed.
* ''motor_stop'': Stops both motors immediately.
* ''motor_setposition'': Sets the current position of the motor encoders.
* ''motor_gotoposition'': Drives the motor to a specific motor encoder position.
* ''motor_getposition'': Returns the current position of the motor encoders.
* ''motor_configuration'': Prints the complete configuration (registers) of both motors.
* ''motor_setspeedprofile'': Sets the trapezoidal speed profile.

Ultrasound:
* ''ultrasound_enable'': Enables or disables the ultrasound sensors.
* ''ultrasound'': Measures the proximity to obstacles with the ultrasound sensors.

Battery:
* ''battery'': Returns the current state of the battery.

General:
* ''firmware_version'': Returns the firmware version of the dsPIC and the motor PICs.
* ''test_math'': Tests a couple of mathematical functions. This program serves more as a template rather than a useful program.
* ''tcp_server'': Demonstrates how to write a program which accepts a TCP connection.
* ''i2c'': General I2C utility.
* ''i2c_readstream''*: Reads a data stream from an I2C device.

Motion:
* ''motion_braitenberg'': Implements object following, obstacle avoidance and wall following using the Braitenberg algorithm.
* ''motion_arrowkeys'': Allows to drive the robot around using the keyboard.
* ''motion_followline'': Makes the robot follow a line on the ground.
* ''motion_forwardbackward'': Makes the robot continuously move forward and backward.
* ''motion_random'': Drives the robot randomly around.
* ''motion_spiral'': Makes the robot move along a spiral.

Odometry:
* ''odometry_track'': Tracks the position of the robot based on differential-drive odometry using the encoder values.
* ''odometry_goto'': Drives the robot to a given target position, while keeping track of its position using odometry.

Programs marked with an asterisk (*) are currently incomplete and need some reworking to be done.

== Launching a Program ==

Each program is stored - with its source code, a Makefile, a compiled binary and possibly additional material - in a subfolder of '''Programs'''. The binaries are compiled for the Korebot platform (ARM processor running a Linux kernel 2.4) and therefore only run on the Korebot.

To use a program, copy it onto your robot first:
 cd Programs
 k3put +usb infrared_proximity
(If your robot is connected via WLAN, replace the +usb by +RobotID.) Then, log on to your robot by typing
 k3go +usb
and launch the program there
 cd your_username
 ./infrared_proximity
The program will write its output directly in the terminal window.

== Getting Help ==

Each program prints a little help text when launched with the '''-h''' option, e.g.
 ./infrared_proximity -h

== Redirecting the Output of a Program to a File ==

In some cases, you may want to write the output of a program (e.g. infrared proximity measures) to a file instead of displaying it on the screen. The standard Linux tools offer several ways to achieve that:

To write the output to ''a file on the robot'', simply redirect the output to a file when launching the program:
 ./infrared_proximity &gt; my_infrared_proximity_measures
Note that there is only about 1 MB of space available on the robot.

To write the output to ''a file on your computer'', launch your program via SSH and redirect the output to a file. For those not so familiar with SSH, this may get a bit tricky. But fortunately, there is a Khepera III script which does all that for you automatically:
 k3run +usb -o my_output_file /root/your_username/infrared_proximity -r
If your robot is connected via WLAN, replace the +usb by +RobotID. This transfers the output of the program over the network connection and stores it in the file ''my_output_file'' in the folder ''k3-192.168.1.2'' on the computer. This is actually faster than writing the output to a file on the robot (even if this sounds counter-intuitive), because WLAN transmission is usually faster than writing to the flash memory on the robot.

== Running Multiple Programs at the Same Time ==

You can run several programs on the robot at the same time. This can make sense, for instance, if you want to steer your robot with the keyboard (&lt;tt&gt;motion_arrowkeys&lt;/tt&gt;) and log infrared sensor measurements at the same time (&lt;tt&gt;infrared_ambient&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;infrared_proximity&lt;/tt&gt;), or track the path of the robot (&lt;tt&gt;odometry_track&lt;/tt&gt;). This is also useful for monitoring the battery level with a program running in the background.

To achieve that, you can log in several times on the same robot (&lt;tt&gt;k3go&lt;/tt&gt;), run one program in the background (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;./infrared_ambient &gt; my_measures &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;), or launch some programs from the computer (&lt;tt&gt;k3run&lt;/tt&gt;).

There are a few things to keep in mind, however:
* ''It does '''not''' make sense to run two programs which both set motor speeds.'' Each time one programs sets the speed, the old speed is overwritten, resulting in quite unpredictable behavior.
* ''One program may slow down the other program.'' The CPU is a shared and limited resource (use &lt;tt&gt;top&lt;/tt&gt; to check CPU usage), but even more so is the I2C bus which is used to communicate with the sensors and actuators of the robot. You should therefore avoid reading the same sensor value with several programs in parallel.

&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Important note: If you are running programs based on the ''libkorebot'' library from K-Team, you should never run any other program accessing the sensors or actuators in parallel, as this may cause such programs to obtain wrong sensor values or crash.&lt;/span&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Even though the standard programs allow you to interact with all sensors and actuators of the robot, you probably want to implement your own algorithms. The Khepera III Toolbox provides you with a nice and easy-to-use API for accessing the sensors and actuators of the robot, and several hundred lines of sample code in C. In addition, a Makefile is available.

== Preparing the Environment ==

=== Linux for Korebot ===

First of all, make sure that ''make'' is available on your computer by typing
 make -h
If the computer complains that he could not find ''make'', install it using the package management system of your Linux distribution.

Next, you need to install the ARM compiler toolchain. Download the file ''korebot-tools-i386-0.1.2.tar.gz'' (KoreBot Compilation Toolchain for Linux i386 host) from the [http://www.k-team.com/kteam/index.php?site=1&amp;rub=0&amp;page=171&amp;version=EN K-Team website] and unzip it somewhere in your home directory, or in /usr/local/ 
 tar -xfz korebot-tools-i386-0.1.2.tar.gz
Add the ''bin'' directory to your PATH environment variable, preferably by adding the following line to your .bashrc file:
 export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/arm/toolchain/bin
and restarting your bash shell (terminal).

At this point, your computer should not complain any more if you just type
 arm-linux-gcc -h

=== Linux for Korebot 2 ===

First of all, make sure that ''make'' is available on your computer by typing
 make -h
If the computer complains that he could not find ''make'', install it using the package management system of your Linux distribution.

Next, you need to install the ARM compiler toolchain. Download the file ''korebot2-oetools-light-1.0-kb1.2.tar.bz2'' from the [http://ftp.k-team.com/KorebotII/software/light_toolchain/korebot2-oetools-light-1.0-kb1.2.tar.bz2 K-Team website] and unzip it somewhere in /usr/local/. Doing it in /usr/local is necessary so the compiler can find the libraries.
 wget http://ftp.k-team.com/KorebotII/software/light_toolchain/korebot2-oetools-light-1.0-kb1.2.tar.bz2
 tar xvjf korebot2-oetools-light-1.0-kb1.2.tar.bz2
 sudo mv korebot2-oetools-1.0/ /usr/local/

Add the ''bin'' directory to your PATH environment variable, preferably by adding the following line to your .bashrc file:
 export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/korebot2-oetools-1.0/tmp/cross/bin/
and restarting your bash shell (terminal).

At this point, your computer should not complain any more if you just type
 arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi-gcc --help

=== Mac OS X ===

At the time of writing, we are not aware of any ARM compiler toolchain for Mac OS X, although I'm pretty sure there must be one out there. All other steps should be the same as on Linux (see above).

== Creating a New Program ==

To create a new program, type
 cd my_khepera3_project_directory
 k3-create-program my_new_program
where ''my_new_program'' denotes the name of your program. This creates a folder ''my_new_program'' and copies a sample ''main.c'' file as well as a Makefile in there.

To check if everything is all right, try to compile the new program:
 cd my_new_program
 make
This should create a binary executable ''my_new_program'' which you can copy onto the robot and execute there.

You can now edit the file ''main.c'' and implement your algorithm there. In case you have a complex algorithm to implement, you can of course create additional ''*.c'' and ''*.h'' files. All ''*.c'' in the project folder will automatically be passed to the compiler when launching ''make''.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== Renaming a Program ===

The name of the binary executable can be changed in the ''Makefile'' by modifying the line
 TARGET := my_new_program
Note that by convention, the executable should always have the same name as the project folder. (The script [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Scripts|k3put]] relies on that when specifying a program folder.)

=== Including Modules ===

The ''Makefile'' also contains a list of [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Modules|modules]] that must be compiled with your program. Most programs will use the following modules:
 MODULES := khepera3 commandline i2cal
If your program needs another modules (e.g. ''measurement''), simply add these modules to that line.

=== Including the ''libkorebot'' Library ===

Even though the Khepera III Toolbox does not need the ''libkorebot'' library (and implements nearly its whole functionality), you may have code that needs to be compiled against that library. To do that, add the following lines to your Makefile:
 LIBKOREBOT := /path/to/libkorebot-1.10/build-korebot/
 INCS_ADD   := -I $(LIBKOREBOT)/include 
 LIBS_ADD   := -L $(LIBKOREBOT)/lib -lkorebot
Note that the compiled programs will only work if the library ''libkorebot.so'' is available on the robot.

=== Programming Style ===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style Programming style] is an art rather than an exact science. The Khepera III Toolbox uses a rather compact programming style, but does not follow any specific convention. For your own programs, you are of course free to stick to your own coding style.

There are tools available to automatically format your source code conforming to some rules. One of these tools is [http://astyle.sourceforge.net Artistic Style], a very easy to use open source program. After installing this program, the following command applies minimal formatting (even spacing between the operators and indentation using tabs):
 astyle -p --indent=tab main.c
A copy of the original file will be saved as ''main.c.orig''.

=== SVN / Versioning System Issues ===

We strongly suggest using a versioning system such as [http://subversion.tigris.org SVN (Subversion)] to store your Khepera III programs. SVN is probably the most prominent system today, and easy to set up and use.

If you are using a versioning system, you should check in the following files of your program:
* All source files (*.c, *.h)
* The Makefile
* The compiled program (such that a compiled copy is available for those who don't have a compiler set up)
* Any additional files that the program needs

You should '''not''' check in:
* Intermediate compilation files (*.o, *.d)

The Bishop moves to its ideal square, bearing down on the central dark squares. Black has so far kept the options open by not committing a central pawn move.
White can now take control of e4 ready for occupation or develop in a more passive way, the most common is to play g3 and fianchetto the kingside Bishop.

      <comment>/* Expressions */  Missing word &quot;is&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Expressions==

Erlang statements look a little like sentences. One statement is a series of comma separated expressions ending with a period. Erlang expressions can either be ignored, stored, or returned depending on their position and structure in a statement.

 4+3, H=6-2, lists:reverse([3,4,5]).
   [5,4,3]

In this Erlang example the expression: 4+3 is computed, the expression H=6-2 is computed, and the reverse of the list [3,4,5] is computed and returned. The results of 4+3 are ignored and the pattern 4 is matched to the variable H.  For ever after H will have the unchangeable value 4. &quot;lists&quot; is the name of a standard module (library) that provides list utility functions.

Problems:

1) Write an expression that matches the pattern H2 to the reverse of the list [{1,2},{2,1}].

2) Write an expression that matches the pattern H3 to the length of the list [{1,2},{2,1}].

3) Write an expression that matches the pattern H4 to the length of the flattened version of the list [{1,2},{2,1}].

      <text xml:space="preserve">With the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC, Iranm became the target of semi-barbarous hordes and Central Asian adventurers. The Seleucids, the Kushans, the Sakas and the Huns each in turn ruled Persia for a period of time. Eventually, they were all superceded by the Parthians or the Pahlavas a Northern Iranian tribe which had conquered the whole of Persia by the 1st century BC.


== The Revolt of Bactria ==



== Origin of the Parthians ==

Following the death of Alexander, Persia partially recovered her former glory under the Parthians also called Parthva or Pahlava. They were the residents of Parthia a country to the south of Hyrcania and around the present-day Mashhad in the province of Khorasan. Parthia had been one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire and the Greeks.

== Arsaces (Arshaka) I 250 - 247 BC ==

Arcases I was the first major ruler of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia. He declared his independence from the Seleucids and ruled from  250 BC to 247 BC. He was eventally speared to death in 247 BC and was succeeded by his brother Tiridates who ascended the throne as Arsaces II.

== Tiridates 247 - 214 BC ==

Tiridates succeeded his brother Arsaces I as Arsaces II. He is credited with having consolidated the kingdom established by his brother. However, in 245 BC Ptolemy Euergetes the Ptolemian ruler of Egypt invaded and occupied Syria and proceeded to ravage the Empire upto the frontiers of Parthia.  However, fortunately, Parthia was spared as Euergetes had to rush back to quell an insurrection back home. But the invasion of Ptolemy Euergetes have dealt a severe jolt to the crumbling seleucid Empire and Tiridates took advantage of this to liberate Hyrcania. The Seleucid king, Seleucus II responded by invading Parthia in 237 BC in alliance with Diodotus the king of Bactria. Tiridates resorted to strategem and won the king of Bactria to his side. Isolated, Seleucus II was never going to be a formidable force and was defeated by Tiridates in league with Bactria and the Central Asian tribe of the Aspasiacae. Meanwhile, as Selucus II was planning a second invasion of Parthia there arose problems back home due to the insurrection of his brother Antiochus Hierax forcing him to leave for Syria. Tiridates was left unmolested for the rest of his reign and he used this oppotunity to consolidate his empire.    

Tiridates built a new capital city in the vicinity of the moder-day Mashhad and called it Dara (Dareium to the Greeks). He spent the remained of his reign adorning his new capital and improving it to the state of a world metropolis.

Tiridates died in 214 BC and was succeeded by his son Artabanus I.

== Artabanus I 214 - 196 BC ==

As soon as he ascended the throne, Artabanus I captured the entire tract between Hyrcania and the Zagros Mountains taking advantage of a civil war in Syria. He even took the imperial city of Ecbatana. However, soon after the civil war had concluded, Antiochus III the Great of Syria set out for Parthia at the head of a large army and easily retook Ecbatana which was undefended. He then proceeded all the way north to Parthia and conquered the capital Hecatompylos forcing Artabanus to take shelter in Hyrcania. The Parthian monarch's hopes were dashed when Antiochus III completely surrounded Hyrcania with his troops. Artabanus was forced to surrender and conclude peace with the Seleucids. Artabanus I proceeded further eastward and fought a battle with the Bactrians. Finally, in 206, his eastern campaign having come to a conclusion, he returned unmolested to Antioch.

== Priapatius ==

== Phraates I ==

Priapatius was succeeded by his son Phraates I (''Old Persian'':Farhaud). During his seven year long reign, Phraates invaded the Mardians and defeated them. He then invaded the western district of Media and conquered it. The conquest of Media brought the Girduni Sudurrah pass under Phraates' control.  This pass was of great strategic importance and its conquest by the Parthians brought Persia within Parthia's grasp. Phraates was succeeded by his brother Mithridates.

== Mithridates I ==

Mithridates I (Old Persian: ''Mithradatha''; New Persian:''Mehrdad'') ruled for thirty-seven years and was singularly responsibl;e for elevating Parhtia from the status of a minor principality to a powerful Empire. 

=== War with Bactria ===

Eucratidas, the monarch of Bactria and his predecessor Demetrius had expanded the Bactrian kingdom beyond the limits of Afghanistan into North-west India and had added the Punjab to the kingdom. To the south, the kingdom extended almost upto the mouths of the Indus. However, not satisifed, Eucratidas wanted to expand further to the East and conquer the rich plains of India. Hence he was involved in constantr wars with the East. Taking advantage of the king'd eastern campaign the north-western provinces of the Empire began to break off one by one. Mithridates took advantage of the situation prevailing in Bactria and attacked the kingdom annexing the country of the Turanians and that of the Aspasiacae. 

=== Invasion of the Seleucid Empire ===

During this time, Syria was ruled by Antiochus Epiphanes who was infamous for his religious fanaticism and intolerance. He fought a three-year long war with the Egypt over the disputed south-western frontiers of the kingdom. He tried to suppress Judaic culture and tried to impose Hellenism and Hellenic Gods upon the Jewish people. This evoked widespread reaction and provoked civil war. He died a few years later and was succeeded by his son Antiochus Eupator a boy of nine who ruled for a short period before being deposed by hsi cousin and rival claimant to the throne Demetrius. Soon after his accession, he began concentrating his energies on controlling internal rebellion in the kingdom. 

Finding the king busy with his campaign in Judea, soon after the successful invasion of Bactria, Mithridates invaded the Seleucid kingdom and occupied Media Magna. However a rebellion in Hyrcania forced Mithridates to return immediately.  

=== Second War with Bactria ===

In about 150 BC, Eucratidas was succeeded by his son Heliocles who initiated war with Parthia to recoved the provinces his father had lost. However, Mithridates easily defeated him and carried the Parthian arms as far as the frontiers of India.

=== Demetrius' Campaign ===

In 142 BC, when the civil war in Syria came to an end, Demetrius II invaded the Parthian Empire in order to recover lost territories. His campaign was initially successful as the Greek citizens of the Parthian welcomed him as their deliverer. But Mithridates took recourse to strategem and successfully vanquished him and captured him. The Seleucid Emperor Demetrius II became a hostage of the Parthian king Mithridates I and was allotted a residence in Hyrcania.

Mithridates I died soon after the victory over Demetrius II.

=== Administration under Mithridates I ===

The king was assisted in his duties by an advisory body made up of members of the Royal House on one hand and the Magi and the wise men on the other. In the event of a monarch passing away with no rightful heir to succeed him, his successor would be nominated by this assembly. This assembly also held the power to depose monarchs.

The Parthians followed the very system of governance practised by the Achaemenids. The country was divided into satrapies governed by satraps. Besides, there were a nmber of kingdoms and dependencies which pedged allegiance to the Parthians. They are Persia, Elymaiis, Adiabene, Osrhoene, Armenia and Media Atropatene. The satraps were fourteen or fifteen in number. 

The king styled himself &quot;Shahenshah&quot; or &quot;Kings of Kings&quot; and &quot;brother of the sun and the moon&quot;.  

=== Character of Mithridates ===

Though the Parthian kingdom was founded by Arsaces I, Mithridates I is credited with having transformed the kingdom into an Empire. He was brave and fearless and was quick to grab opportunities. At the same time, history describes him as a mild and clement monarch who pardoned defeated monarchs and treated them graciously. He is undoubtedly, one of the greatest monarchs of the Arsacid dynasty.

== Phraates II ==

Mithridates I was succeeded by his son Phraates II in about 134 BC.

=== War with Syria ===

After the capture of Demetrius by the Parthians, Antiochus Sidetus had been crowned the Seleucid Emperor at Antioch. Soon afterwards he was locked in a deadly conflict with Tryphon a pretender to the throne whom he defeated and killed. After the death of Tryphon, Antiochus Sidetus ravaged Palestine and forced them to submit to his authority which they did in 133 BC. Following the subjugation of Palestine, he turned his attention towards Parthia and invaded the Parthian Empire in 129 BC. 

With a contingent of over 100,000 fighting men, Sidetus conquered Babylonia and Assyria and advanced with great speed upon Parthia. However, just as he approaching the frontiers of Babylonia, winter broke out forcing the Seleucid troops to scatter. Phraates, meanwhile, was actively abetting rebellion in the conquered provinces, inciting the discontented people of Babylonia and Assyria to rebel against Sidetus and his Syrian troops. On an appointed date, insurrection broke out on a massive scale. Local people revolted against the haughtiness and arrogance of Syrian soldiers and fell upon them. They were offered all aid by the Parthian frontier garrisons. Sidetus and his army were eventually cut to pieces before they cross the border into Syria. '''This would be the last attempt made by the Seleucids to reclaim their lost territory. Never again, would the Seleucids even come close to fighting a war with the powerful Parthian Empire. This war also spelt the end of the Seleucid Empire as a major power in Asia'''.

=== Rebellion of the Greeks and Phraates' Death ===

Soon after the defeat of Antiochus Sidetus, Phraates II desired to invade Syria. However, he had to call off the campaign when the Scythian contingent of the Parthian army rebelled demanding more pay. When Phraates II refused, they ravaged Parthia itself forcing Phraates II to shift the capital to Babylon. Having established his seat at Babylon, Phraates II set out with a Greek contingent to fight the Scythians and drive them off. In the ensuing battle, the Greeks deserted Phraates and joined the Scythians. Phraates and his army suffered a crushing defeat and a large number of them were slaughtered. Phraates himself was among the slain and was succeeded by his uncle Artabanus.

== Artabanus II ==

Phraates was succeeded by his uncle Artabanus, a son of Priapatius who ascended the throne as Artabanus II. 

Artabanus ascended the throne when the kingdom was in peril. The Greeks and Scythians were advancing upon Babylon to finish off the Parthian Empire. However, Artabanus II was saved by by the fortunate turn of events. The Greeks had lost interest in invading Parthian territories while the Sakas were satisfied with the plunder they had made. So, the victorious forces dispersed soon after satisfying their thirst for plunder. The Parthian Empire was saved. 

Artabanus swore revenge and soon afterwards, attacked the Tochari, one of the Scythian (Saka) tribes. However, in the clash that followed, Artabanus was defeated and killed.

== Mithridates II ==

Artabanus II died in about 124 BC and was succeeded by his son Mithridates II, also known as Mithridates the Great. 

=== Conflict with the Scythians or Sakas ===

Mithridates fought the Scythians and completely routed them. He even seized portions of Bactria which the Scyths had taken. With this, the Sakas abandnoned all plans to invade the Parthian Empire and began to concentrate on Sistan and India.

=== First Armenian War ===

Armenia had been first conquered by the Assyrians in the 8th century BC. Since then, it had been a part of sccessive empires which ruled Persia -- the Mede, the Achaemenid, the Greek and the Seleucid. In 190 BC, when Antiochus was defeated by the Romans Armenia declared its independence. Bt it was reconquered by Antiochus Epiphanes in 165 BC and its king Artaxias made prisoner.

During the rule of Mithridates I when Parthian power was established all over Asia, Armenia became independent under an Arsacid prince. When Mithridates II ascended the throne he invaded Armenia. The Armenians pleaded for peace when their defeat became imminent and war came to an end by a treaty advantageous to the Parthians. Ortoadistus, the Parthian king was replaced by his son Tigranes whon ceded large chunks of territory to Parthia.

=== Alliance with Rome and the Second Armenian War ===

In around 96 BC, Tigranes, the king of Armenia allied with Pontus with the intention of conquering Cappadocia. The Roman republic  was alarmed at the rise of a new power along its eastern frontiers and sent Sulla in 92 BC with a large army to fight this emerging power. Sulla invaded Asia Minor and inflicted a crushing defeat on Pontus and Armenia.

At about the same time, Tigranes invaded Parthia in order to break Parthian power and recover lost territories. Tigranes rapidly overran Upper Mesapotamia and threatened Parthia forcing Mithridates to conclude an alliance with Rome.

Mithridates II died soon afterwards.

== Gotarzes ==

Mithridates II was succeeded by Gotarzes. His original name might have been ''Gudarz'' which had been Hellenized to Gotarzes.

== Orodes I ==

== Sinatroces ==

In around 76 BC, Orodes I was succeeded by Sinatroces a son of Mithridates I and a cousin of Phraates II.  He was over eighty years old at the time of his accession. 

Meanwhile, Armenia had reached the zenith of its power under its king Tigranes.Even in the reign of Mithridates II, he had waged a successful war against Parthia and conquered Northern Mesapotamia. By 83 BC,  he had established his suzerainty all over Syria, Cilicia, Palestine and Sophene. The Armenian kingdom was at  its greatest extent when Tigranes shifted the capital to Gordyene in Northern Mesapotamia.

In 72 BC, Rome launched a second war against Armenia. Sinatroces remained neutral and had to face-off the invasion of the Roman general Lucullus which followed. Lucullus invaded the Parthian Empire but faced a determined resistance from the garrison at Nisibis which blocked his advance.

At this juncture, Sinatroces passed away and was succeeded by his son Phraates III.

== Phraates III`==

Phraates III is notable for his alliance with the Roman general Pompey against Tigranes. To tackle Armenia, he formented disunity and civil war by aiding Tigranes' son Tigranes against his father. The latter was banished from Armenia and returned with a body of Parthian troops to challenge his father. In the battle that followed, the Parthian troops had to face defeat. However, Armenia submitted to a Roman invasion which had worsted Mithridates of Pontus. Parthia took advantage o this defeat to recover the provinces that it had earlier lost to Armenia.

However, from the very beginning,  Pompey was not much inclined towards having an alliance wit Parthia whom he perceived as a potential rival to Rome.  He allowed the Parthians to take Adiabene but he handed over Gordyene to Ariobarzanes, the Cappadocian monarch. Soon war broke out between Tigranes and Phraates III over the disputed region of Gordyene. Pompey switched sides and supported the Armenians against the Parthians and drove them off. He even refused to address the Parthian monarch as &quot;king of kings&quot;. Peace was however soon conclded between Parthia and Armenia.

Phraates III was assassinated by his two sons Mithridates and Orodes in 62 BC.

== Mithridates III ==

Mithridates III ruled for a short span of three years. During his reign, the Parthians recovered the province of Gordyene which they had lost to Armenia. However, three years after his accession, trouble broke out in the Empire forcing him to flee. He sought the assistance of Rome to recover his throne.  But an internal rbellion in Parthia had already placed his younger brother Orodes on the throne. Mithridates was captured and killed and succeeded by Orodes.

== Orodes II ==

Mithridates III was succeeded by his brother Orodes II. 

=== Roman Invasion ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">The kingdom of Parthia entered a new stage in the early years of the Christian Era. From 51 AD onwards, Parthian kings took names such as Vologasses (''Valkhash'') which the earlier Parthian kings had never used. 

== Artabanus III ==

Artabanus III was the first Parthian monarch to ascend the Parthian throne since the commencement of the Christian era. In 12 AD, the Parthian nobles, weary of the the Latinized monarch Vonones deposed him and chose Artabanus, the Arsacid king of Media Atropatene as their King-Emperor.  Artabanus accepted and at once pursued Vonones who first fled to Armenia and then Syria. After a short war, Armenia was taken by the Parthians forcing Vonones to seek permanent refuge in the Roman province of Syria. 

The Roman Emperor Tiberius dispatched his nephew Germanicus to negotiate with the Armenians and Parthians. He imbibed in him all power, glory and grandeur, in short making him the ''de facto'' &quot;King of all Roman provinces to the east of the Hellespont&quot;. Germanicus arrived in Armenia and supported the candidature of one Zeno who , unlike Vonones, was acceptable to the Armenians. He was also able to successfully negotiate with the Parthian Emperor. Vonones was moved to Cilicia virtually a Roman prisoner and was killed while trying to escape.

In 34, when Zeno died, Artabanus III, foreseeing little resistance before him now that Tiberius was too old, invaded Armenia and placed his son Arsaces on the throne. However, Tiberius responded by abetting a conspiracy against Artabanus. Artabanus acted swiftly and responded by diverting the attention of one of the conspirators and poisoning another. 

In 36, Pharasmanes the King of Iberia killed Arsaces and raised his own brother Mithridates on the Armenian throne with help from Albania and Rome. Artabanus sent his son Orodes to fight the invaders and secure Armenia but the Parthians were defeated by the combined forces of Rome, Iberia, Armenia and Albania and tens of thousands were slain. Artabanus then personally marched against Armenia but the threat of a Roman invasion of Mesaapotamia forced him to retreat and retire to the safety of Hyrcania leaving the Persian capital undefended. 

Artabanus ruled from 12 to 38 and for the most part of his reign, his kingdom was afflicted by civil war and internal strife. Artabanus, himself, was deposed twice and twice reinstated. He died soon after his second reinstatement.

== Gotarzes II and Vardanes ==

Gotarzes II a son of Artabanus III ascended the throne on the death of his father. According to Tacitus, immediately after his accession he was deposed and replaced with his brother Vardanes who ruled for about three years. During his short reign, Vardanes seems to have indulged in the subjugation of Seleucia. His brother Gotarzes rebelled and with support from Hyrcania, plotted to capture the throne. But the brothers set aside their differences and concluded peace once they realized that there was a conspiracy to make a non-Arsacid the Emperor of Parthia. Soon after this conspiracy was quelled, Vardanes planned to invade Armenia but was opposed in his designs by Izates the ruler of Mesapotamia. Furstrated, Vardanes declared war against Izates but was drawn to the north-east by a rebellion in Hyrcania and was assassinated on the way.

Immediately after the death of Vardanes, Gotarzes was crowned king. Once again his conduct hadf become som ubearable that the nobles schemed to do away with him. They contacted the ROman Emperor Claudius who sent Mithridates, a grandson of Phraates IV and a son of Vonones with a formidabe force to claim the throne of the Arsacids. Mithridates penetrated Mesapotamia with aid from the king of Osrhoene and Izatus of Adiabene but was let down by his allies in the course of the final battle and defeated. Gitarzes died soon afterwards and was succeeded by Vonones II who ruled for a few months. Vonones was succeeded by Vologesses I.

== Vologasses I ==

Vonones II had three sons Vologasses, Tiridates and Paeorus of whom Vologasses succeeded him. His name in Old  Persian would have been ''Valkhash'' and ''Balas'' in Middle Persian.

=== First Invasion of Armenia ===

In 47, Pharasmanes the king of Armenia had a nephew named Rhadamistus who killed him and ascended the throne. The rule of an usurper was highly resented by the people of Armenia. Vologasses took advantage of the situation to invade the country. Artaxata the capital and Tigranocerta were easily taken. Rhadamistus was deposed and Tiridates the brother of the Parthian Emperor was made king of Armenia. However, no sooner had he ascended the throne that winter and pestilence broke out forcing the Parthians to withdraw their contingent allowing Rhadamistus ti reclaim his throne.

=== Rebellion of Izatus ===

Izatus, the king of Adiabene had greatly increased in strength and stature that he now contrived to overthrow the Parthian yoke and establish himself as an independent monarch than a Parthian feudatory. At length, Vologasses invaded Adiabene but met with little success as Izatus applied the scorched-earth policy and laid waste the whole countryside.  At this juncture, an attack of the Scuythians briefly drew Vologasses to the northern frontiers of the Emnpire. By the time the Scythian war came to an end, Izatus had died. His brother Monobazus  who succeeded him submitted to Vologasses and ascended the throne as a feudatory of Parthia.

=== Second Invasion of Armenia and the War with Rome ===

In 54, when Rhadamistus was in the third year of his reign, Tiridates, brother of Vologasses invaded Armenia forcing him to flee. The latter soon took over as the king of Armenia. This precipitated in a war with Rome whose interests in Armenia were being threatened. Corbulo, regarded as the best general of the time, was sent with Ummidius to fight the Parthians. Both, hopwever, on taking their position, sent emissaries to negotiate with Vologasses who agreed to a temporary peace.

Vologasses was in perilous sitation when Rome had sent its legions to invade Parthia. Vardanes, the crown prince was in rebellion. The temporary peace however enabled him to devote his attention to the civil war raging in his own country. In about 58, Vardanes was finally defeated and killed. However, no sooner had the civil war come to an end that a rebellion broke out in Hyrcania. Devoid of support, Tiridates and the small Parthian contingent in Armenia were easily overpowered and forced to flee. By 61, the whole of Armenia was under the Romans who entrusted the government to one Tigranes a grandson of the King of Cappadocia.

In 61, when the war in Hyrcania had come to an end, Vologasses sent two armies under  Monseses and Monobazus to invade Armenia and caputre Tigranocerta the capital while he stationed himself at the junction of Armenia and Syria. Monseses and Monobazus invaded Armenia but the siege of Tigranocerta failed. Vologasses proceeded as far as Nisibis but a plague of locusts forced him to withdraw. The hostilities came to an end when peace was concluded between the warring armies.

However, at this juncture, Rome made a strategic error of judgement when it appointed Cassinius Paetus to take command in Armenia. Paetus was thoroughly incompetent, At first, he entered Armenia from Cappadocia but was surrounded and defeated. Vologasses proposed peace with Rome. However, Nero rejected Vologasses' terms and sent Corbulo with a large army to invade Parthia.

Corbulo invaded Armenia at the head of 80,000 men forcing the Parthians to withdraw. Tiridates surrendered and accepted the Roman Emperor Nero as his overlord. He was, in turn, sent to Rome to receive the diadem at the hands of the Roman Emperor. In a ceremony whoch was a showpiece of Rome's imperial authority, Nero placed the diadem on the head of Tiridates and crowned him king of Armenia.

In around 72, Paetus the proconsul of Syria deposed the king of Cappadocia suspecting him of negotiating an accommodation with Parthia. However, his son was reinstated by Vespasian when he was convinced that they were innocent.

Vologasses I died in around 79 succeeded by his son Pacorus.

== Pacorus II ==

Pacorus ascended the throne as Pacorus II in 79 and ruled till 108. He supported a pretender of Nero in Rome. He is also credited with expanding and beautifying Ctesiphon. He also sold Osrhoene to a prince from Edessa. He must have passed away in around 108 and was succeeded by his son.

== Khusro ==


== Vologasses II ==

In 133, a vast horde of the Alanni invaded the Parthian Empire at the instigation of Pharasmanes, king of Iberia who was a vassal of Rome. Vologasses made a formal complaint at Rome but instead of chastising Pharasmanes, the Roman Emperor Hadrian honored him. Vologasses was furious but barely made a complaint. Hadrian died in 138 and was succeeded by Antonius Pius. Vologasses at once sent a message of congratulations requesting the restitution of the golden throne which Trajan had captured during his expedition. But Antonius Pius flatly refused.    

Vologasses II died in around 148.

== Vologasses III ==

In 148, Vologasses II was succeeded by Vologasses III who must have probably been his son. 

=== War with Rome ===

In 161, the Roman Emperor Antonius was succeeded by his adopted son Marcus Aurelius. Taking advantage of the presence of a minor on the throne of Rome, Vologasses invaded Armenia and expelled the Amrenian king Sosemus whom the Romans had raised on the throne. Severianus, the prefect of Cappadocia and Attidius Cornelianus opposed him but were defeated by a huge army under Khusro which crossed the Euphrates into Syria and ravaged the Roman provinces. Marcus Arelius responded by sending an army under the command of Cassius to recover the lost provinces. Cassius defeated Vologasses in a great battle at Europus in 163 and drove the Parthians back across the Euphrates. Armenia was invaded by Statius Priscus who conquered the capital Artaxata and restored Sosemus on the throne.

Cassius, meanwhile, crossed the Euphrates into Mesapotamia and ravaged the country. Selucia, which had a population of 400,000 was burnt to the ground. Ctesiphon on the other side of the Tigris was also occupied and the summer palace of the Parthian king destroyed along with its temples and monuments.The Roman army even crossed the Zagros mountains into Media and conquered a portion of the province. However, soon afterwards pestilence borke out and the Romans contended with the successes they had achieved did not press any further. Thus, the war came to an end in 165.

Vologasses died in 192 and was succeeded by his eldest son Vologasses IV.

== Vologasses IV ==

Vologasses IV succeeded his father Vologasses III in 192. During his accession Rome was in turmpil. Three individual Roman commanders, Clodius Albinus, in Britain; Severus, in Pannonia and Pescennius Niger, in Syria, had declared themself Emperor of Rome. Meanwhile, Pescennius Niger hoped to garner support amongst the small kingdoms on the either side of the Euphrates which might be beneficial in the event of an invasion by Severus. So, he sent emissaries to Parthia, Armenia and Hatra in retrn for support. Vologasses IV did not himself involve in the war or offer troops but encouraged his dependent kingdoms to do the same. So when, Armenia and Hatra supported the cause of Niger Vologasses did not chastise them but instead, encouraged them. 

No sooner had the kingdoms resolved to support Niger that Severus invaded Asia plunging the Asian Empire of Rome in turmoil. Supported by Adiabene, Northern Mesapotamia rebelled. The Roman garrisons stationed in Mesapotamia were cut to pieces and soon afterwards, Nisibis itself was besieged. Severus established himself in Syria and rushed to the scene rescuing Nisibis and retaking Mesapotamia. He even crossed the Euphrates into Parthian territory and conquered the Parthian feudatory of Adiabene. But civil war in Rome triggered by the claim to the throne by Clodius Albinus forced Severus to quit the newly occupied territories and return to Rome. Soon after his departure, Vologasses invaded and conquered Adiabene and Northern Mesapotamia and penetrated deep into Syria. Severus, after settling the issue in Rome in his favor, rushed to scene and soon recovered all the lands lost in the preceding months. He then crossed over to the other side of the Euphrates into Babylonia and besieged the capital city of Ctesiphon which fell after a brief resistance. The inhabitants were massacred and the treasury was plundered by the invading Romans. After accumulating an enormous spoil, the Roman army recrossed the Euphrates largely unmolested. Hatra was the only province which offered a stout resistance thereby forcing the Roman Emperor to call of its invasion. But it was a resounding win for the Romans overall and greatly diminished the reputation of Parthia as a major world power.

Vologasses IV died in around 207. His death was followed by a war of succession and the rise of Vologasses V.

== Vologasses V ==

Vologasses held supremacy in Parthia over his brother Artabanus from 207 to around 213 and ruled the kingdom during a period when it was engrossed in civil war. The Roman Emperor Caracallus, who in 211 succeeded his father, Severus, as Emperor of Rome, congratulated the Senate in 212 on the strife still going on in Parthia, which could not fail (he said) to inflict serious injury on that hostile state. Starting from 213 onwards he rapidly lost ground in the western parts of the Empire yielding sovereignty to his brother Artabanus. He, however, continued to exercise sovereignty over the eastern parts till 223.

 
== Artabanus V ==

In around 213, Artabanus gained control over the capital Ctesiphon and the western provinces from his brother Vologasses V. Soon after his accession to the throne, the Roman Emperor Caracallus sent an emissary to him demanding the hand of his daughter which Artabanus politely refused.

In order to avenge the insult, Caracallus invaded Parthia at the head of a huge army. The invasion was swift as the invading troops entered the Parthian Empire through Babylonia and laid waste the country. Arbela fell after a brief resistance and the Roman avenged his insult by ordering the desecration of the sepultures of the Parthian monarchs. However, the Roman troops soon withdrew by way of Adiabene and Upper Mesapotamia and wintered at Edessa. On April 8, 217, while Caracallus was on way to pay obeisance at the famous temple of the Moon God at Carrhae, he was treacherously murdered by one of his guards Julius Marcialis. Caracallus was succeeded as the Roman Emperor by Macrinus who was not favorably inclined towards continuing the war. Macrinus proposed peace to Artabanus which was rejected by the latter. The Parthian cavalry attacked the Romans at Nisibis precipitating war. The battle which was fought at Nisibis was extremely fierce and resulted in the defeat of the invading Romans who were compelled to pay a huge ransom for their safe return.

== Fall of the Parthian Empire ==

In about 220, Ardeshir, the feudatory king of Persia, rose against his Parthian overlord and declared independence from Parthia. Artabanus led a large body of troops into Persia to quell the insurrection but was defeated in a series of three battles in the last of which he was slain. Ardeshir crowned himself the independent king of Persia and conquered the outlying Parthian provinces one by one culminating in the conquest of Parthia itself. The Arsacids made one last stand in Armenia under Artavasdes, an uncle of Artabanus who ruled from 227 to 229 but by 229, Ardeshir had conquered most of Armenia hastening the demise of the Parthian Empire.

== Parthians after the fall of the Empire ==

Even after the demise of the Parthian Empire, Parthians continued to play a major part in Asian politics. The seven Parthian families maintained their status, power and influence intact right up to the Arab conquest of Iran. One of them, the Qarens established a Zoroastrian principality in Taraistan and exercised regal authority till the 16th century AD. 


=== The Pahlavi Dynasty ===

In 1925, Reza Khan, an officer in the Persian army established the Pahlavi dynasty and ruled from Tehran. He claimed to be a descendant of the Parthians or Pahlavas of yore. The rule of the Pahlavis from 1925 to 1979 saw a resurgence of ancient Persian traditions and was characterized by the emergence of a new found love for Iran's Zoroastrian past. In 1979, Reza Khan's son Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi was forced into exile by the 1979 revolution and an Islamic republic was established.

      <text xml:space="preserve">After the defeat of Yazdegerd at Nehavend, Persia literally came under Arab rule. However, the Arabs were not in control of far flung corners of the Sassanid Empire which resisted Arab expansion for a long time after the end of the Sassanians. 


== Yazdegerd after the Battle of Nehavend ==

According to certain accounts, after the defeat of Yazdegerd at the Battle of Nehavend in 642, he fled to Persepolis and made it his capital. He then fled to Khorasan and settled over there. According to the Bundahis, he wanted to get the assistance of Indians to tackle the Arabs. However, he was killed by a greedy miller for the costly clothes and ornaments he wore. With this, ended the Sassanian Empire. According to another version, Yazdegerd was killed at Merv in 690 AD even while the Second Court at Istakhr survived the Arab onslaught. According to this account, Yazdegerd's advisor Farokhzad crowned himself king and issued coins and continued to negotiate with the Arabs.  We are not sure of the Farokhzad and the Second Courts' end, but it is probable that it was eventually taken over by the Arabs. But then, if Yazdegerd had died in 690 he would have been 76 years of age by then. However, lack of evidences make it  highly doubtful whether he ever lived beyond his thirty-seventh year.

== Piruz ==

When Yazdegerd III died, his son Piruz fled to the east. According to ''The Old Book of the Tang'', in around 661, he appealed to the Chinese for help. Shortly afterwards, he settled in Tang China and was made 'Martial Leader and Guard of the Right Flank'. He was instrumental in the expansion of the western frontiers of Tang China to Kyrgyzstan and even Bactria. In 678, during Tang China's successful invasion of Zaranj in western Afghanistan by Pei Xingjan, Piruz was sent escorted by an army. He served as the Chinese Governor of Zaranj for thirty years till his death in 709.  The Zoroastrian holy book ''Bundahis'' claims that a son of Yazdegerd III went to the land of the Hindus (India) to seek their help and that he returned with an &quot;Army of Champions&quot; to reclaim his throne. This is possibly a reference to Piruz's flight to China and his return to his homeland as the commander of a Chinese battalion in the invasion of Zaranj. However,  the Bundahis wrongly states that the &quot;Army of Champions&quot; dispersed upon reaching Afghanistan. The Chinese army did not disperse. On the contrary they established a permanent garrison at Zaranj.      

== Narsieh ==

Piruz's son Narsieh also served with distinction in the Chinese army. However with his passing in the middle of the 8th century AD, the Persian as well as the Chinese chronicles become silent on the fate of the Sassanians. It could either be that Narsieh did not have children of his own. It is also quite possible that his children adopted Chinese customs and intermarried with the Chinese thereby losing their Persian identity. Either way, it spelt the end of the Sassanian dynasty.

In 728, a descendant of Yazdegerd named Khosro was mentioned fighting alongside Soghdians and Turks against the Islamic forces besieging Bokhara. This is, possibly, the last reference to any direct descendant of Yazdegerd III.

== The last Sassanian Principalities ==

Even with the extinction of the Empire in the 7th century AD a few principalities pledging allegiance to the defunct Sassanian Empire did manage to survive the Empire itself. 

=== Deyleman ===

When Yazdegerd III was fighting the Arabs, Gil Gaubareh, a distant cousin of Khusro Perviz and the Sassanid Governor of Gilan established the kingdom of Deyleman by annexing Tabaristan and uniting Gilan with Tabaristan. The Sassanian Empire fell but the Arabs were unable to conquer Tabaristan. Gil was succeeded by his son Dabuy whose influence was spread throughout the Tabarestan, Kohestan, Royan, and even parts of Ray and western Khorasan.    Dabuy ruled from 660 to 676 and was succeeded by his brother  Padhuspani, the governor of Royan who consolidated the Empire. In 759, Khurshed II, the great-grandson of Dabuy was defeated by the Arabs and unable to bear the humiliation, he consumed poison and thus ended his life. His successors converted to Islam and ruled Deyleman for the next 800 years. The last Padhuspani king, Espahbodh of Shemiran, was removed by Shah Abbas I  in the 16th century AD.   

=== Bavandi ===

Bav a son of Shapur and grand-newphew of Khusro I fled from Ctesiphon and established an empire in Tabaristan and Kohistan. His successors established the Bavandi dynasty. The descendants of Bav stretched their territory to include parts of Shemiran, Qazvin, and even Taleshan. In 679, Bav was killed by Valash. But the Bavandi synasty was reinstated eight years later by Suhrab a son of Bav who married into the house of Ziyar. 

=== Padeshkargar ===

Padeshkargar was partially held by the Qarens who were one of the Seven Families. In 537, Khusro Anushirvan made Zarmihr of the House of Qaren the Governor of Tabaristan and Padeshkargar. In about 650, Tabaristan was conquered by the Sassanid Governor of Gilan Dabuy who established the independent kingdom of Deyleman. Soon afterwards, however, the Qarens managed to reak off from the shackles of thew Padhuspanis. In 783, Vindad-Ormuzd of the House of Qaren allied with Shervin I, the Bavandi and the Padhuspani prince Shahriyar I and defeated the Arabs. Howver, he had to surrender to Hadi and was  deported to Baghdad where he remained till 785. His grandson Maziyar broke into a full-scale revolt against the Arabs. He was captured after prolonged warfare and executed by the Arabs in 839. He was often seen as a symbol of Iranian resistance to Arab rule by later Iranian nationalists. '''Maziyar was also the last Zoroastrian ruler of Tabaristan'''. The kingdom was integrated into the Caliphate after his death and was placed under the viceroyaty of the Tahirids.  

== Abu Muslim ==

Abu Muslim was a soldier of Persian origin who was responsible for the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate. He hailed from Balkh in Khorasan (Afghanistan) and was a second generation convert to Islam. He led the anti-Omayyad movement playing a major role in the conquest of Merv in December 747 and served as the Abbasid governor of Khorasan after defeating the Omayyad representative in the area. In Battle of the Zab in 750, he led the Abbasid forces against the Omayyads. The battle resulted in a resonding win for the Abbasids and the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate. It also heralded the fall of the Omayyad Caliphate in its stronghold Damascus. Following this victory, Abu Al Abbas became the Caliph replacing the last Umayyad Caliph Marwan II. Later, however, Abu Muslim was killed by the second Abbasid Caliph Al Mansur who feared his rising influence and popularity amongst the masses. He, along with Babak Khoramdin, is universally regarded as the symbol of Persian nationalism and identity. With the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate ended the century-long period of persecution and discrimination against non-Arab people introduced by the Omayyad regime.

== Sunpadh ==

'''Sunpadh''' or '''Sinbad''' was a Zoroastrian ''magi'' or priest and a close associate of Abu Muslim. On his execution in 755, Sunpadh swore to destroy the ''Holy Kaaba''. He also preached that Abu Muslim was ''mahdi'', the Messiah of the Muslims. Soon he had rallied a considerable body of troops against the Caliph. Consequently, revolts broke out in Ray, Herat and Sistan.

The rebellion subsided within a few days. Sunpadh's forces were crushed within a period of 70 days by Juhar ibn Murad, an Arab general and Sunpadh was captured and slain.

== Al Muqanna ==

Al Muqanna or the '''veiled one''' was a Persian revolutionary from Merv named Hashim ibn Hakim who fought the Arab Caliphate. He was a contemporary of Abu Muslim and Sunpadh. Al Muqanna was reputed to wear a veil in order to cover up his beauty; however, the Abbasids claimed that he wore a veil to hide his ugliness, being one-eyed, and bald. His followers wore white clothes as the Abbasids who were their enemies wore black.

Al Muqanna's followers started raiding towns and mosques of other Muslims and looting their possessions. The Abbasids sent sev4eral armies against him and finally succeeded in besieging and burning his house. Al Muqanna took poison to avoid capture.


== The Khorramdin Movement ==

The Khorramdin or '''Khurramite''' Movement was a socio-religious and political movement which originated in the 8th century AD. Its birth was the result of public discontent in Iran following Abu Muslim's execution in 755. The movement was actually founded by Sunpadh, a close associate of Abu Muslim.

Under the leadership of Babak, the Khurammites proclaimed the breakup and redistribution of all the great estates and the abolition of Islam. In 816 they began making attacks on Muslim forces in Iran and Iraq. The Abbasid Caliph Al-Mamun sent four armies to deal with the problem, but they were defeated each time with Byzantine support.The sect continued to attract followers until the sixteenth century when the Safavids took control of Iran.

=== Babak Khorramdin ===

Babak Khorramdin was one of the main leaders of the Khorramdin Movement. He was born in around 795 near the modern-day Ardabil in the Azerbaijan province of Northern Iran. He was a neo-Mazdakite. According to Waqed, Babak's father was a Persian from Madā'īn (formerly known as Ctesiphon, former capital of Sassanian Persian Empire. At the age of 18, Babak's father passed away and the young Khorramdin had to take charge of his family. He established himself in the city of Tabriz and traded in arms for a short while before plunging into the liberation movement.

Babak was adopted and mentored by one Shahrak who was a leader of the Khorramdin Movement. Soon Babak took over from Shahrak and lead the movement from 816 to 837. Babak earned huge support from Persians all over Isfahan, Azarbaijan, Ray, Hamadan, Armenia, Gorgan and the rest of Persia. In 836, Babak routed the forces of Bugha Al Kabir, a military officer of the Caliphate. 

In 837-838 Al Mu'tasim, the Abbasid Caliph sent Afshin with clear military instructions to capture Babak. Afshin successfully captured Babak's stronghold of Badhdh. Babak sought refuge with the Armenian leader Sunbat. However, he was betrayed by Sunbat and handed over to the forces of the Caliphate. Babak was eventually executed.  During Babak’s execution, the Caliph's henchmen first cut off his legs and hands in order to convey the most devastating message to his followers. The legend says that Babak bravely rinsed his face with the drained blood pouring out of his cuts, thus depriving the Caliph and the rest of the Abbasid army from seeing his pale face, a result of the heavy loss of blood

== Maziar ==

Maziar was the grandson of the Padhuspani prince Shahriar I and a scion of the House of Karen. He was a contemporary of Afshin Kheydar and Babak Khorramdin. Maziar led the revolutionary troops at the height of the Persian nationalist struggle even defeating the forces of Caliph once. 

According to the medieval historian Ibn Esfandyar in his ''Tarikh-e-Tabaristan'', Maziar is said to have proclaimed: &quot;Afshin Kheydar, son of Kavus and Babak, and I had made an oath and allegiance that we take the country back from the Arabs and transfer the government and the country back to the family of Kasraviyan(Sassanid).&quot;

Maziar was eventually betrayed by his brother Kuhyar and handed over to the soldiers of the Caliphate. He was deported to Baghdad in 839. While some accounts say that he was executed, other say that he took poison to escape humiliation at the hands of the Arabs.
 
== The Legacy of the Sassanians ==

The Sassanians have been remembered both for good and bad reasons. There was a revival of art and architecture during the Sassanian period. The reign of Khusro Anushirvan experienced a literary renaissance. Religion and religious literature which had grown moribund during the rule of the Parthians was actively revived by the Sassanians who were zealous Zoroastrians themselves. The Sassanians ruled over a vast Empire and had a well-organized army. The Sassanian Empire, at its zenith, was the only military power capable of challenging the Romans.

But the Sassanian rule has also been remembered for a fair share of negative reasons. Zoroastrian monarchs as Ardeshir Babagan, Yazdegerd II and Bahram V have gained an infamous reputation by indulging in zealous persecution of communities professing non-Zoroastrian creeds. The Manichean, Mazdakite and Christian minorities in the Empire were unhappy with the amount of religious freedom they had. Naturally, when the Arabs invaded Iran during the reign of Yazdegerd III they welcomed them with open arms.

With the end of Yazdegerd III's reign, the Sassanian Empire died a virtual death. However, small principalities which paid allegiance to the Sassanians or run by parallel branches of the Sassanid royal family survived for many centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Errors==

We can deal with errors with throw and catch. In this example the value of an argument causes an error which causes an exception to be thrown.  The function g() is happy only when the argument is greater than 12. If the argument is less than 13 then an exception is thrown.  We try to call g() in start().  If we run into trouble then the exception is caught in the &quot;case catch&quot; structure inside of start().

what about memory leak? --[[Special:Contributions/84.237.120.178|84.237.120.178]] ([[User talk:84.237.120.178|talk]]) 04:58, 8 February 2008 (UTC)

:Can you be more specific ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:40, 8 February 2008 (UTC)

::There is operator '''new''' in the function '''Instance'''. There is private destructor in the class '''StringSingleton'''. So, we cannot delete instance in the outer scope and there is no operator '''delete''' in the class '''StringSingleton'''.

| [[Image:More_CPP_Idioms.jpg|190px|More C++ Idioms]]
| '''C++ has indeed become too &quot;expert friendly&quot;''' -- Bjarne Stroustrup, [http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/17831 ''The Problem with Programming''], Technology Review, Nov 2006. 

Stroustrup's saying is true because experts are intimately familiar with the idioms in the language. With the increase in the idioms a programmer understands, the language becomes friendlier to him or her. The objective of this open content book is to present modern C++ idioms to programmers who have moderate level of familiarity with C++, and help elevate their knowledge so that C++ feels much friendlier to them. It is designed to be an exhaustive catalog of reusable idioms that expert C++ programmers often use while programming or designing using C++. This is an effort to capture their techniques and vocabulary into a single work. This book describes the idioms in a regular format: ''Name-Intent-Motivation-Solution-References'', which is succinct and helps speed learning. By their nature, idioms tend to have appeared in the C++ community and in published work many times. An effort has been made to refer to the original source(s) where possible; if you find a reference incomplete or incorrect, please feel free to suggest or make improvements.

The world is invited to catalog reusable pieces of C++ knowledge (similar to the book on design patterns by GoF). The goal here is to first build an exhaustive catalog of modern C++ idioms and later evolve it into an idiom language, just like a pattern language. Finally, the contents of this book can be redistributed under the terms of the [[More C++ Idioms/GNUFDL|GNU Free Documentation License]].

'''Aimed toward:''' Anyone with an intermediate level of knowledge in C++ and supported language paradigms&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Very weak REPL ==

Although this is a wonderful wikibook in general, I have to say that this REPL is to all intents and purposes utterly useless, because it will only parse Scheme expressions that fit entirely on one line.

yields

== 4. Nf3 ==
This Knight development is solid but leaves the options open for Black to either play The King's Indian or the Grunfeld Defence.
If Black wishes to play the Grunfeld then responding immediately with d5 is required as white next move is likely to be 5. e4 which prevents d5 from being played.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The American school has come quite far in the past four decades, but still has some way to go.  It has been 36 years since fifteen-year-old Elizabeth Eckford walked
through a group of raging whites to attend Central High school in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Today the overt influence of the Ku Klux Klan is gone, and racial tension has died
down, but cultural differences still play a huge roll in certain student’s education.  This is one of the most serious issues in the school systems of the United States today.

There are several different and effective ways we can help minorities in the community.  One of the most serious issues in the United States today is how to meet the educational needs of culturally diverse students.   If our old habits of education continue, millions of students, mostly poor Asian, Native American, Hispanic, and African American students will not get the education necessary to obtain a healthy lifestyle in the United States.  We need to start thinking about the child’s education early in their lifetime.  It is said that differences in academic performance appears early in the education setting.  Students from low economic backgrounds and many children of color consistently achieve below the national level in mathematics and language skills.  The gap widens as children progress through school.  Gradually, the chance of academic success disappears for poor and minority students (Alexander &amp; Entwisle, 1998, P.1).  Early childhood is the best time to intervene in the schooling of these children if we expect to change the outcomes of their futures.  A lot of individuals make wrong assumptions about minority students.  Some people might think there is something wrong with poor children or children of color and that their genes are not as developed as others.  This is wrong.  Some children are at risk for unhealthy development because of the downfalls due to living in poverty or in troubled families, most poor and minority children develop normally and their families are able to carry out the necessary childhood functions.  Poor and minority students range of learning capabilities is just as broad as other children's. The explanation for the differences in school performance lies in the difference in life experiences between groups.  Children of different cultural backgrounds do not encourage the same beliefs and values as other children therefore; they don’t pay attention to the same skills.  Most schools ignore the difference between children, their experiences, and their beliefs.  These schools are not utilizing their full ability.  It is mostly white, middle class teachers teaching way different from the values and learning styles of their students.  Citizens commonly overlook the Childs education in its most developing years.

By the time children reach the age of five, they have learned a great deal.  They have reached maturity by mastering their own language, having relationships with friends and family, and how they understand to react to familiar situations (Kagan, 1991).  Poor and minority children might meet the typical educational requirements for their home and other surroundings, but when placed in school, it’s a lot harder for these children to adapt to the school atmosphere.  When the children enter school, the teachers assume these qualifications have already been met.  That is a huge problem.  Certain children from different cultural backgrounds might not be as well equipped with this information.  This is where the community fits in.  The children need to be ready for all aspects of school.  School readiness can be increased by higher quality preschool education and day care.
Children should come to school ready to learn. If they fit into their families and communities, then we know that they are good learners.  We only need to worry about the small minority of children who have handicapping conditions or who live in extremely hazardous environments and therefore, have not learned what their community teaches.

When a child’s previous knowledge and skills do not prepare him for a new setting, like school, it is extremely hard.  A child may be developed in their home environment, but yet unable to adapt easily to a school environment or succeed at the academic tasks valued by teachers (Kagan, 1991).
Children become what they live.  Cultural patterns of interaction guide the growing child, but they also become the root for their definitions of themselves.  When adults and children do not share common experiences or hold common beliefs about the meaning of experience, they are quick to misunderstand cultural interchanges (Bowman, 1989). Some teachers do not appreciate the real similarities and differences between their understanding of the world and that of children and families who come from different backgrounds.  That is why we need to further educate the teachers of America.  Most teachers in the United States come from a rural background and don’t understand the learning habits of minority students.  We need to hire teachers with experience in cultural studies.

Standardized testing of young children demonstrates the danger of using white, middle-class children as the gauge for judging other children.  It is not coincidence that poor and minority children are common in certain types of special education and at-risk programs. Standardized tests do not separate culture from development.  The child may know something else that is equal in knowledge, but if he or she does not know what’s on the test, we assume that there is something wrong.

Racism also contributes to conflicts between schools, poor and minority children and families. For example, when schools represent an Anglo centric and middle-class viewpoint, students and their families often feel devalued. This experience is common to many Spanish speaking children.  Instead of building children's confidence and self-esteem, school compromises their learning ability by rejecting their language and culture. Even more serious, by degrading the culture of poor and minority children, teachers encourage a threatening cultural choice: identify with family and friends and stay out of the school, or embrace school and face social isolation. The result is that many young children go for family and friends and end up without an education.
Teachers are victims of their own past experience. Teachers, like all of us, make generalizations about other people, ideas, and events on the basis of their past experience and knowledge.  Considerable research documents that teachers have difficulty incorporating new visions of reality that conflict with their own personal beliefs and experience (Ball, 1989). When met with disagreement, teachers stick to their own &quot;meaning making&quot; theories, forcing students to not get the correct education.  This often makes students mad and frustrated with their teachers and administrators, sometimes leading to negative impacts on the student’s future education.

Some minorities just simply won’t give any effort towards the schooling system.  Mostly African Americans, Hispanic, and Native Americans are the minorities that this applies to.  These groups are more likely to avoid learning skills associated with the white middle class, since their efforts will not pay off with the same opportunities that the other students will obtain (Ogbu, 1992). Consequently, they develop a poor education.  The preschool and primary years are critical ones if children are to be successful in school, and we must carefully review the treatment of children during these years.  School readiness can be increased by higher quality preschool education and day care (Kagan, 1991).  One way of making a difference would be to change how schools interact with other community organizations.  Relationships with social services, parks, libraries, day care centers, and homes are very important when it comes to the minorities’ education.  Any school that is not making a relationship with these organizations cannot seriously claim to be focusing on educational success for all.  Another remedy to the situation is to listen to the voices of the minorities.  It is very important that minority communities feel a better sense of ownership on school standards if they are to help in preparing their children (Kagan, 1991).  Involvement by parents and community members from these minority groups is crucial for making a change.  A last and final suggestion would be to further educate teachers and schools for a better understanding of the minority students.  Teachers and the schools really need to get involved in all the different communities and community organizations.  This would give the minorities a much better chance to succeed in the classroom and pursue their future education.  The kind of change we want to have accomplished is not easy. It will require a lot of skill and effort from all of us if it is to happen. Unless we speak out about the relationship between culture, development, and education, we cannot hope to provide the kind of schooling needed to carry us safely into the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Unit step responses from the (jitter) transfer functions===
The unit step response can be obtained from the (jitter) transfer function as follows:
* take the (jitter) transfer function that is in the s domain ''&lt;small&gt;(maybe using r in lieu of s/ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to simplify the notation, i.e. scaling ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to 1 )&lt;/small&gt;'' : its  reverse transform (that is a function of t) is the unit impulse response. ''&lt;small&gt;(The transform of the unit impulse is just a constant 1 in the s domain.)&lt;/small&gt;''
* multiply the (jitter) transfer function by the transform of the unit step function, that is 1/s
* inverse-transform into the time domain, i.e. obtain the USR. &lt;small&gt;(Note: when the change of scale property ''f(s/a) → a*F(t*a)'' is used, it does not apply to the factor 1/s coming from the unit step, because the step is a &lt;u&gt;unit&lt;/u&gt; step!)&lt;/small&gt;

===Architectures of just order 1 and 2?  Not by chance! ===

There are just two orders of CDR architectures that are used in actuality.

They can be identified by the order of their jitter transfer functions:
#&lt;u&gt;first order, for the phase aligner CDR&lt;/u&gt;, ''(that was introduced  [[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Models can only be linear..#First order systems|at the beginning of the book as:]])''
#&lt;u&gt;second order, for both the possible types 1 and 2&lt;/u&gt;, ''(that were also [[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Models can only be linear..#Second order systems|introduced in the same page]])''.
This “a posteriori” result can be associated elegantly with an “a priori” mathematical theory.

It is known that any possible transfer function can be well approximated by a rational function of the complex frequency “s” (i.e. by the ratio of two polynomials in s).&lt;br&gt;
A rational function in turn can be represented by '''a partial fraction expansion''':

&lt;center&gt;F(s) = &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_{i=0}^m b^i s^i}{\sum_{i=0}^n a^i s^i}&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_{i=0}^m b^i s^i}{\prod_{i=1}^r (s+p_i)^n_i}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; b_n + \sum_{i=1}^r \sum_{k=1}^{n_i} \frac{c_ik}{(s+p_i)^k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;F(s) = &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_{i=0}^m b^i s^i}{\sum_{i=0}^n a^i s^i}&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt; b_n + \frac{c_{11}}{(s+p_1)} + \frac{c_{22}}{(s-\sigma -j\omega)(s-\sigma +j\omega)} +&lt;/math&gt; more complex terms&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''(the denominator polynomial has &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; roots equal to &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; roots equal to &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;, ... , &lt;math&gt;n_r&lt;/math&gt; roots equal to &lt;math&gt;p_r&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{i=1}^r \textstyle n_i&lt;/math&gt; = n)''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''which –in simpler terms- means that a CDR can be made with a first order loop, or with a second order loop''', or with a product/sum of them.

Common engineering sense dictates that a design be “as simple as it can be made”.

Therefore just one of the simplest possibilities will be chosen:
*a constant &lt;math&gt;b_n&lt;/math&gt; is a flat jitter transfer function, and not a real choice;
*a first order (jitter) transfer function will be the choice when the prime considerations are a simple implementation, a quick response (=acquisition) and a high resilience to parameter drifts and non-linearities;
*a second order (jitter) transfer function  will be the choice when either the low frequency performances (steady state error = d.c. phase error ; rejection of low frequency generated noise; ..) or the high frequency performances (tight bandwidth for input jitter filtering) are prime concerns. The 2.2 will be selected in the first case, the 2-1 in the second.
*any other (inevitably more complex) possibility does not offer much more performances while it makes the circuit more sensitive (often too sensitive) to parameter variations and to small non-linearities.

The three fundamental models are further developed in three dedicated chapters :
#[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR based on a first order PLL|1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order (type 1) PLL]]
#[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1|2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 PLL]]
#[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 2|2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 PLL]].

They run on any standard PC and simulate the acquisition phase of a PLL inside a CDR circuit.&lt;br&gt;
:The first in the list simulates the signals inside a PLL circuit based on a linear phase detector.&lt;br&gt;
:The second in the list simulates the signals inside a PLL circuit based on a bang-bang phase detector.&lt;br&gt;
:The third in the list models the magnitudes of the jω functions of the small signal linear model of the circuits simulated in the first program in the list.&lt;br&gt;
Each of the three programs covers the three main topologies of a PLL: 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order (type 1), 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2.&lt;br /&gt;

===== Hardware platform =====
It has been developed on a Dell Studio 1555, with Intel® Core2® Duo CPU @2.20 GHz, 4.0 GB RAM, Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium.&lt;br&gt;

===== Software platform =====
This simulator file has been developed with: &lt;u&gt;''OpenOffice.org Calc''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
OpenOffice.org is a free open software that can be downloaded from [http://www.openoffice.org/| www.openoffice.org]&lt;br&gt;

==== Purpose ====

Didactic, to:
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;'''identify and point out the fundamental blocks''' of the PLL, and consequently of the clock recovery part of the CDR.
   &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Each block is identified in its function, its input/output connections, its characteristic and its main limitations (= its inevitable non-linearities).
     &lt;li&gt;The simulated structure is the complete structure of a 2nd order PLL.
     &lt;li&gt;The filter is the full feature 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order filter, represented as a block of flat gain G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, followed by a single pole at ω&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. 
   &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;'''understand the overall PLL''' (= clock recovery) '''operation'''.
 &lt;li&gt;'''get familiar with''' the '''formulas and equations''' that constitute the mathematical model (and with their implementation in the simulator or modeling calcsheets).
 &lt;li&gt;'''introduce the concept of discrete time''', as actual PLLs are often made with digital, discrete-time circuitry. In fact this tool:
::*only uses 1500 time or frequency steps,
::*uses difference equations in form of recurrence relations. See also:  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_equations| Difference_equations]  for the formulas used in the simulation of the loop filter and of the VCO.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

===== Previous versions =====
An early version of this simulator ('''Rev. 1.x''') used only:
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Values of   ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;, ζ ,  or G and τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, very close to 1. In fact, all values were “normalised”. This avoided the scaling burden to the software, but requested a corresponding effort to the user.
 &lt;li&gt; The loop filter was represented as an true  analog circuit, made of an operational amplifier, two resistors and one capacitor. Input values were the values of the resistors and capacitor in the filter circuit.
&lt;li&gt;  A single page to input data and to picture the corresponding  acquisition waveforms as well as the filter and jitter transfer functions.
&lt;/ul&gt;
A later version of this simulator ('''Rev. 2.x''') used :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Automatic scaling of x-axis (frequencies or times) and of y-axis (phases, voltages or magnitudes).
 &lt;li&gt; Coverage of only the 2nd order type 1 topology of PLL.
 &lt;li&gt; No added bias at the VCO input to simulate the difference between line frequency and oscillator free running frequency ( that was introduced only in the 2011 versions).
 &lt;li&gt;  A separate sheet (Input data) to input data and others to picture the corresponding acquisition waveform as well as the filter and jitter transfer function.
 &lt;li&gt; Acquisition and magnitude functions in the same file.
&lt;/ul&gt;

====How they are made====

Each file includes some description sheets that give a lot of details on how the software is constructed, so that it becomes easy to understand and even to modify.&lt;br /&gt;
The reader is invited to take advantage of those pages as much as of those that do the actual computations.&lt;br /&gt;
Each block simulated follows the description that can be found inside this book, that is repeated and furter detailed in the explanation sheets of each software piece.&lt;br /&gt;

====Limitations====

These programs are simple tools and are correspondingly limited.&lt;br&gt;
Necessary cautions are related to:
::The period of the received line pulses does not coincide with the time step used in the simulations. The latter is -in most of the possible cases- significantly longer.
:::The only frequencies that appear are the frequencies that characterize the loop operation. They are the only ones that are really simulated or plotted.
:::The line frequency shall always be  -for the cases you want to simulate - significantly higher (typically 20 or more times higher) than any frequency significant for the loop operation.
::The programs only use 1500 time or frequency steps.
::A PLL is simulated, not an entire CDR. The simulator will show events like :
:::stuttering of the phase error as the input sinusoidal variations (that represent mostly the intersymbol interference jitter) trick the phase comparator back and forth across the tooth edges of the sawtooth characteristic;
:::clock slips, that are easily detected when the PLL ends tracking a signal parallel to the input signal, but with a gap that is multiple of the comparator range.								
::The simulator programs will not be able to show:
:::bit errors, because the simulations do not consider the input bit stream, but only its phase;
:::loop gain variations (consequence of variable input transition density, or of non linear gain of the phase detector). This is because of the same reason already mentioned for the point above. See: [[Clock_and_Data_Recovery/Structures_and_types_of_CDRs/The_CDR_phase_comparator|The CDR phase comparator]] for more considerations. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''In spite of the many limitations, these tools are valid and complex enough to assist the average electronic engineer'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''towards a better comprehension of the PLL operation inside a CDR'''.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

=== Burst-mode upstream: 20 to 50 transitions for locking into an incoming burst. Case of the 2.5 Gbps US/ 1.25 Gbps DS GPON===
http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.984.2/en ITU-T Rec. G.984.2
:The example of GPON is more significant than EPON could be, because:
*GPON specs are more demanding in the burst acquisition phase, and 
*GPON specifications define the fastest burst-mode receiver (in acquisition) that be still good in locked state performances,  at the frequencies of the optical access applications.

==== Physical Layer Overhead ====
:In the GPON defined with 2.5 Gbps downstream and 1.25 Gbps upstream, the upstream burst is allowed as many as 96 bits for the so-called Physical Layer Overhead (Plo).&lt;br&gt;
:These bits are meant to allow for the detection of the burst appearance, for the phase lock of the CDR circuit and for the precise identification of the beginning of the reception of information bits of the burst (= burst delimiting function).

==== Allocation of the bits of the Plo to the OLT functions ====
:The first 32 bit times of the 96 are allocated to generate the guard time between bursts.
:: 16 of the 32 are allocated to mask the transient of extinction of the remote transmitter of the previous burst.&lt;br&gt;
::The following 16 are allocated to give margin against the transient of activation of the remote transmitter that takes over and sends the new burst.
:The last 20 bits of the 96 are used for the burst delimiting function.
:''During the intermediate 44 bits of the 96, the remote transmitter in the ONT sends a preamble pattern that provides maximal transition density for fast level and clock recovery functions.''
:Depending on implementation choices the OLT receiver may be allowed as many as 50 transitions since the start of the burst (p1=0, p2=0, p3= 10 repeated 22 times,  plus some initial pulses of the delimiter), or as little as 20 transitions, to achieve lock. The figure that follows shows an actual possible transient in the latter case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Today education is a complex and or compelling topic that is often debated. Questions about school quality, accountability, curriculum, and teacher training arise each day, and we explore them in the newspapers and during political debates. Even the distinction between public and private schools is no longer as straightforward as it once was. It may well be that a local public school is a better educational match for a child, than that of an exclusive private school with a national reputation and a price tag too match. Some research shows that private schools tend to have superior academic programs in comparison to public schools; however, this is not always the case. There is a wide variety of factors that may influence parents’ decisions to sending their child to either a private or public school. These factors may include; academic reputation, religious views, location, costs, and school size. Some differences between the two schools are obvious and clear, others tend to be overlooked or unseen at times. Should this debate try to figure out what establishment will produce a better student? Or should the argument contemplate which school creates a better person?
The first American private schools opened during the colonial era. As the colonies began to develop, many began to adopt mandatory education policies. This widespread trend became popular in most colonies in the 1640s and 1650s. Virtually all of the schools opened as a result were private (Wikipedia, 2005). Private schools date back to the schools opened by Catholic missionaries in the sixteenth century. These Catholic schools were the start of a private education revolution. At this time there was no public school system which gave no basis of comparison to the quality or productivity of a school.  In some places denominational schools were basically public schools, operated with goals of promoting faith, knowledge, making good citizens of the church and commonwealth. However, the priests of the Catholic Church disagreed with some of the ways religion was taught outside of their private establishments. For example, other schools gave readings from the King James Bible, which is not used by the Catholic Church. These differences put a spark to the fire of the religious private school movement. By the end of the colonial period the institution of school was firmly rooted on the American continent. However, nothing resembled the modern concept of free, universal schooling (Thattai, 1999).

Many aspects of the American private school differ from that of a public school. Private schools are run in a closed door manner, which most believe boosts their academic stature. It also provides flexibility to create specialized programs for students. For example, private schools may use art or science in all classes. They can develop a customized system for assessments, although many choose to use standardized tests. Most people are drawn to the alternative curricula that private schools have to offer.  Another aspect of religious private school is which specific religion the establishment is based on. Obviously this is one of the biggest factors that differentiate one private school from another. Seventy-nine percent of all private schools were found to have a religious affiliation. Thirty percent were affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church and forty nine percent are based on other religious groups. The remaining twenty two percent were nonsectarian. Although Catholic schools accounted for thirty percent of the total number of private schools, they enrolled forty eight percent of all private school students. Keep in mind that the Catholic school is the oldest form of school to date. For the most part, trends in the locations of private schools are constant throughout America. Most private schools are located primarily in central cities and the urban fringe, or large towns. Only eighteen percent of private schools were found in rural areas, which is not the case with most public schools.  When thinking about the downfalls of a private school, the first thing that most people will look at is the cost. Private schools are funded through tuition, donations and private grants. Therefore, it is obvious private schools cost more than the public schools. On average, the tuition fees for private day schools in the United States is close to $12,000 for grades 1 to 3, $13,000 for grades 6 to 8, and $15,000 for grades 9 to 12. More often than not, these costs will not cover books or school supplies. People choose to pay thousands of dollars a year in hopes that their child will strive at a higher level of academics, be in a safer environment, and hopefully adopt some religious beliefs along the way. A major difference between private and public schools is the size of the school and the number of students. The average American private school has a mere one hundred and ninety three students.  Another way to look at this is to see that eighty percent of private schools have less than just three hundred students. A smaller school will no doubt have a more controlled academic setting in the classroom, which also provides an easier system of discipline.  Small schools have some disadvantages as well, such as providing a fewer set of programs and services. Private schools are known to be more demanding and controlling; this isn’t quite the case when it comes to a public school in America (Great School Staff 1.2).

Until the 1840s, school systems were localized and available only to wealthy people. Reformers who wanted all children to benefit the education process opposed this. These reformers fought for the case that public schooling could create good citizens, unite society and prevent crime and poverty. As a result of their efforts, free public education at the elementary level was available for all American children by the end of the nineteenth century. By 1918 all states had passed laws requiring children to attend at least elementary school (Great School Staff, 2003). The first publicly supported secondary school in the United States was founded in 1635. The attendance in secondary schools was very little because the curriculum was specialized and difficult. A demand for more intelligence and skills within the labor force led Benjamin Franklin to start a new kind of secondary school. Franklin established, the American Academy which was established in Philadelphia in 1751. American high schools eventually became more prominent. The rise in American high school attendance was one of the most shocking developments in the U.S. education system during the twentieth century. As the twentieth century progressed, high school was becoming more and more important to society.  The effects that the history of public education took on shaping America in the early years of the twentieth century are often overlooked. Likewise, things like The Great Depression, wars with other countries, civil rights movement, student protests and the numerous political events within the country all had their effects on the education system.  All of these, plus more were key ingredients to the efforts in shaping the American public school (Thattai, 1999).

American public schools are built around the beliefs of everyone is welcome and no child will be left behind.  Public schools are schools that are provided by state and federal funding. Ninety percent of the children in America attend a public school. Obviously, there are many more public schools to give education to American students than their private counterparts. Public school systems vary greatly in their academic reputation. For all those quality, above average public schools that exist, there are also those that perform under the bar (Clayton, 2005). A drawback for most families is that students must go to the public school that their home is zoned in. Considering that if the school a student is zoned in is one of the lower quality of schools, produces a big reason why a child would be sent to a private school in the area. When thinking about the religious stature of a school, a person will not be considering a public school. This is because the American public school is not religiously affiliated. Locations of public schools around the country are not that consistent. They are widespread, scattered, and more prominent in higher populated areas. As mentioned before, families are either within the zoning district of the public school they want or they aren’t. If you aren’t, you’ll need to consider relocating your family in order to get your children enrolled in your public school of choice. Perhaps the biggest reason an American student is attracted to a public school is the cost, this is because it’s free. A public school is able to do this from its financial support by the state from taxes and federal funding. School size is usually directly related to the density of the population in the surrounding area. An average size public school is around five hundred and thirty five students. Only twenty nine percent of public schools have less than three hundred students. A disadvantage of larger classes is that it will most likely cause teachers to give less attention towards each individual student. On the flip side, a larger student body could produce better programs and more diversity. No matter how good or bad the curriculum of a public school is, it will remain the most popular choice for students nationwide. This is simply because it is free, convenient, and open to the public; a normal standard of schooling (Clayton, 2005).
 
When comparing public schools and religious private schools in America, there are many differences between the two systems. Some factors favor one type of school and some favor the other. Perhaps the most controversial attribute between a public and a private school is the academic reputation of the school. Most people will place a private school ahead of the public school system when it comes to the academic standards. As time progresses however, more and more research raises the question that public schools may be making up ground on private schools. Comparing the two academically is not so easy, but is usually done through standardize tests. This is a big reason why this debate will not only continue, but may be adopting somewhat of a snowball effect. If any family or student is taking the religious views of a school into consideration, than a private school will be the only choice. Public schools in America have no religious views and will deny no student admittance based on his or her beliefs. In the battle of convenience of the location of a school, the public school system takes the cake. With locations widespread all over the country and the adaption to more schools in heavily populated areas, it is obvious why public schools are better located than private schools. Not to mention the convenience that the public school system provides a form of transportation for all students within the zoned area. Seeing that our nation is revolved around money, cost is a major factor in anything people do. Considering costs of private schools are upward from ten thousand dollars a year and that the public schools policy is free for all students indicates a financial benefit for a student enrolled in the public school system. Finally, the last major factor differentiating private and public schools is the size of the student body. Public schools are, on average, at least twice the size of private schools. This arises some benefits of more students and also some disadvantages. This makes the size of the school factor a tossup, depending on what the student wants to obtain from his or her schooling (Clayton, 2005).

Religious private and public schools in America are different in many ways, yet they share a fair amount of similarities. When comparing the two there are major factors that must be considered; academic reputation, religious views, location, costs, and school size. These attributes of a school make it difficult to be in favor of one school over the other. Perhaps the most significant factor in determining which school has the upper hand is looking not at the school’s system, but at what the student is looking to obtain throughout their schooling experience.  Because of this there will never be a clear answer to which education system produces a better student. Some people’s perspectives will point at a free, less disciplined, larger public school. Others may favor a costly, religious based, smaller private school. No matter what happens to the views of the American people on education, the school system may always be a school divided. 

Should faith based schools be eligible for government money? In what ways can privatization of education go too far? Does a private school or public school produce a better student? Which school would produce a better person? Do you think that the selective curriculum of private school helps or hurts students? Do public and private schools receive an equal amount of money per-head?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History of Charter and Public Schools==
In 1991 the first charter school law in Minnesota was approved; the school was developed according to three basic values: choice, opportunity, and responsibility for results. By 1995 there were 19 states that adopted the charter school law. However, the term “charter” was believed to have originated in the 1970s by an educator named Ray Budde. He suggested that a small group of teachers be given contracts to facilitate new approaches by the local school board. In Philadelphia in the late 1980s, there were a number of schools-within-schools called &quot;charters”, which were referred to as choice schools. Public education was in existence in the 1600s in the New England colonies; however, the national system of education was not started until the 19th century when Jefferson suggested an education system. He wanted public education to be under the control of the government, free from religious biases and available to all people no matter their social status.  As of 2006, there were 4,000 charter schools opened in the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; however, there are 10 states yet to have a charter school law passed.

==Purpose of the Charter School==
Charter schools operate in a different manner than traditional public schools. All charter schools seem to have the same purpose. The main purpose is having an alternative means within the public school system in to increase innovation in learning creative ways outside the traditionalism of the public system. Another purpose is having the teachers, both new in the system and ones that have experience, be responsible for their own education program and teaching methods. Teachers and student both get the opportunity to explore new ways of learning through education this system.

Charter schools are the fastest growing innovation resulting from education policy to challenge the public schools notion.  Chartering sometimes caters to the needs of the community by providing after school activities and programs to keep the student connected to the instructors while increasing their performance in academics and to aid in keeping students out of trouble with authority. For example Drew Charter School in Atlanta, Georgia is attached to their local YMCA program that serves the physical education for the school.

Differences in state laws bring wide diversity in the organization, operation, and philosophies of charter schools. Some states give charter schools considerable autonomy, while other states exercise more control. The charter sponsor may be a school district, college or university, state education agency, teachers, parents, or other community members.

==Pros and Cons of Charter School==
[[Image:Charter School Performance Study.svg|thumb|250px|A study done by Stanford University found that charter schools on average perform about the same or worse compared to public schools.]]

There are many benefits to attending a charter school, one main benefit is that innovative systems allow for a unique way of educating. Because of school choice the parent and the student are more likely to be involved in the commitment to the school.  Another pro to a charter school is the competition. Charter schools must work to maintain their academic performance, student’s retention, and finances. Another pro to charter schools act as a catalyst for improvement of the public system. One common con to charter schools is that they are funded by the government. Nevertheless, they have the potential of closing if they don’t make the numbers in the areas mentioned above. And finally the biggest debate with charter schools is that they do a better job of reaching students than public schools, because of their style of teaching and educating. The charter schools system allows for teachers to be creative in their own work. Along with the environment being welcoming and encouraging to both the parents and students there are a few downsizes to the of charter school for example the financial jeopardy the school could fall under or even potential of not making numbers. Either way it goes the pros and cons challenge people to do a true comparison of the school system they would put their children into. See a video clip at: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eLcm1pACtEM

==Advantages and Disadvantages of Public Schools==
Ever since the 19th century, public education was the main foundation of education for children. Just like charter schools, public schools have advantages and disadvantages to their system. First and foremost public education is free, since taxes pay for the child’s education. Another advantage of public schools are the various extracurricular activities, trained personnel/administration, and offering of scholarships and continual education to college. Public education also offers transportation to and from school that is hard to come by in charter schools. The few example of advantages expressed indicate that public education has been providing students with an equal amount of thumbs up whether then thumbs down for the education.

One disadvantage to public school is that parents’ don’t have a say in the curriculum because of the general standard set by the government as a result innovative thinking is squashed. Another disadvantage is the large classroom sizes that can be disturbing to the student in need of the extra attention and to teachers that desire to reach all their students.   One pro and con is that parents are required to have students from age five to seventeen attend school (2000). It's a pro because children need education to advance in society, even if it is basic reading comprehension and math. The con to requirement of attendance in today’s society is many school systems lack the adequate material to teach students, therefore, most of the teachers' efforts well fall short because of time and the restriction to the curriculum.

==Comparative funding of Charter and Public Schools==
Public schools are funded by the government, while charter schools are funded through sponsors and grants. According to the National Center for Education Statistic and the Common Core of Data that collects public and secondary education expenditures and revenues data, approximately $487.6 billion dollars was collected in revenues in 2005 fiscal year. The expenditures totaled $424.6 billion also in 2005 . Seventy percent of the funding was spent on instructions and instructional-related activities, while only eighteen percent was spent on the operation of the schools. The public schools system received about $8,000 per pupil for both secondary and elementary education. On top of the $8,000 for each pupil, the schools received an additional $5,000 for education and educational-related activities. The dollar amount for each pupil varies from state to state. For example the expenditures in New York schools may receive about $9,000, while schools in Utah may be given $3,000 per pupil.

Federal support for charter schools began in 1995 with the authorization of the Public Charter Schools Program (PCSP), administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED).  Charter schools are mainly funded by grants/sub-grants and sponsors; however, in 1965 there was a federal act called the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that obligates charter schools to meet accountability requirements to obtain financial assistance. Unlike public education, charter schools are awarded grants on a three-year cycle instead of year to year like public schools. The grant amount was given out in 1995 was $6 million which then increased to $218.7 million in 2004 because of the growth of charter schools. Just like the public school systems, charter schools use a majority of their funds on instructional materials.  

==No Child Left Behind==
Charter schools are subject to the No Child Left Behind act (NCLB) act because they are funded under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), Title 1 and considered public schools. NCLB’s, main objective is to have students “proficient” in the basics.  The charter school law requires accountability, thus schools have to produce an adequate yearly progress report (AYP) similar to the public school. Therefore, charter schools must make satisfactory improvement each year toward the goals of NCLB. Charters have to keep in contact with the State Education Agency (SEA) to make sure they are meeting AYP standards to determine and if individual schools are in need of improvement. This comes as an advantage to parents who want to switch their children to schools that are meeting the State Education Agency and the Local Education Agency (LEA) satisfactory progression. &lt;br&gt;
The same goes with public schools that fall under Title 1 here are certain guidelines to follow that may hinder a system or boost moral. The biggest competition that comes from NCLB is the fact that charter schools are making the grade faster than public schools. There are some charter schools that don’t make AYP therefore, just like public schools they receive an in need of improvement pass and parents are contacted to give them the choice of relocating their children to another school in their district for the following school year.

==Summary==
Public and charter schools are not much different. The biggest difference is the innovative style of education encouraged in charter schools. Each system has their downfalls whether in students, location, teachers, and administrators. However, there is the common goal of educating children with the basics needed to survive in society. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is making it even more challenging for both systems to compete for student and parent attention in their districts. Financial assistance has aided charter school to accomplish their goals of making a school system without many boundaries. Along with the cooperation of students, community, and the commitment from parents many charter schools have been able to jump the hurdles of traditionalist. Today, school systems are having a hard time keeping students in school than keeping them out. I believe if students were given the opportunity to be part of the process of education and tell what they would like out of the educational board then students wouldn’t be reluctant to attend. The educational system has quite a ways to go before it reaches a status were no one is truly left behind.

==Questions==
#Do charter schools have sports and extracurricular activities like other schools? Yes, some schools do offer alternative activities while others do not.
#What kind of educational background do teachers need at charter schools? Just like public schools, teachers have to be licensed in the state they are working in and other prerequisites depending on who the charter school is being sponsored by.
#Are special education classes offered in charter schools? Depending on the school  because charter schools are partially funded by the state board of education it makes them responsible for giving services to special needs children. The problem with that is the school may not have a certified teacher to teach the student.
#Are standardize test scores higher in public schools or charter schools? Surprisingly they can fall short of public schools in certain states and districts. Read this article link from a newsletter for more information  http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20010324charter2.asp
#Are school uniforms required? Yes and no, like we have seen in some of the footage, some charter school students did have uniforms on. Many charter schools administrators’ believe it unifies the students, ushers a degree of honor and a good method of promoting the school’s image of focused education.

'''London Fog''' (also known as Vanilla Tea Misto or an Earl Grey Tea Latte, and in Scotland it is known as a Vancouver Fog) is the name of a drink which originated in Vancouver, British Columbia, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada|Canada]], although the creator remains unknown, among several claims. One such claim is from the Island Coffeehouse in Langley, Washington, a non-profit student run organization, where it was originally made with Peppermint Tea in 2006. However, patrons of Starbucks in Calgary, Alberta have asked for this drink since the winter of 2004. It is common in Washington and Oregon, as well as in BC's lower mainland and throughout British Columbia and Alberta. Canadian Second Cup cafés also carry the drink.

The &quot;London Fog&quot; was recently the subject of an investigation on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's afternoon show ''Freestyle''.

== Recipe ==
* 16 oz of [[Cookbook:milk|milk]].  (2% or whole)
* 1 shot of [[Cookbook:vanilla|vanilla]] syrup per 16 oz of milk
* 1 bag of Earl Grey [[Cookbook:tea|tea]]
* 1/2 cup boiling water

== Procedure ==
# Brew a small amount of Earl Grey tea. Add about ½ cup of boiling water to a mug along with a bag of Earl Grey. The result is an Earl Grey tea concentrate. Let steep for 2-4 minutes to achieve optimum flavor.
# Heat up milk. Access to a steamer is preferred. 
# Add the vanilla syrup. (adjust according to taste)

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* San Francisco Fog - In a punch bowl place 2 quarts cold black coffee and 1 bottle (750ml) brandy. Float one quart of vanilla ice cream (cube shaped ice-cream  looks best). Facilitate ice cream to melt by spooning liquid over it and watching it turn into a delicious &quot;fog.&quot; (Created by E. Ralph DeGeer)
* Manchester Fog - steamed [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] with a sugar free vanilla syrup in Earl Grey tea.
* Seattle Fog - soy misto (½ water, ½ soy, steamed) with 2 pumps of vanilla syrup and one pump of [[Cookbook:hazelnut|hazelnut]] syrup, in 2 bags of Earl Grey Tea. Also known as the &quot;No Wang's Special&quot;.
*Oregon Mist- The same as London Fog, substituting Green tea and amaretto for Earl Grey and vanilla.  Popularized by the Glenwood restaurants in Eugene, Oregon.
* Sweet Treat London Fog - a sweet, simple, tea-less version of a cold London Fog, which is best served in a punch bowl, consists of chilled ginger ale and copious amounts of either lime sherbet or orange sherbet. As the sherbet melts, it gives the drink a foggy appearance.
*Dublin Fog- The same as London Fog, only replacing Earl Grey with Irish Breakfast Tea
*Bangalore Fog - The same as London Fog, only replacing Earl Grey with Chai (created by Kavya Raman at Roosters Coffeehouse, Carleton University, Ottawa ON).  Also known as a Bombay Fog (coined in Concordia-Loyola's Second Cup, Montreal, QC).
*Atlantic City Fog - The same as London Fog, only replacing Earl Grey with Rose Tea. (Created by Alexis V. Juneau at MCB Quantico, Quantico VA)
*Winter Fog - A London Fog in which the amount of vanilla is reduced and clover honey is added to taste.
*Maui Fog - The same as London Fog, only substituting coconut for vanilla syrup.
*Starbucks Earl Grey Latte is a version of London Fog. 
* Tokyo Fog - The same as London Fog, only substituting Matcha-based Green Tea for Earl Grey.
* Cape Town Fog - The same as London Fog, only replacing Earl Grey with Rooibos Tea
* Durban Fog - A cross between a Cape Town Fog and a Bangalore Fog, basically the same as a London Fog, but replacing Earl Grey with Rooibos Tea and adding a pinch of tea masala.
* Nanaimo Mist - Variation on the London Fog, using almond syrup rather than vanilla. Accredited to Ravenna. 
    16 oz of milk. (2% or whole)
    1 shot of almond syrup per 16 oz of milk
    1 bag of Tazo Awake™ tea
    1/2 cup boiling water
* Victoria Fog - The same as a London Fog, substituting lavender scented tea for Earl Grey.
* Fog on the Tyne - Variation on the London Fog. (Started in a Newcastle office when the Breakfast Tea had ran out) a cup of hot milk, heaped spoonful of sugar, drop in an Earl Grey tea bag and let it diffuse directly into the milk for 30-60 seconds.
* Oxford Haze - substitute English Breakfast and Hazelnut syrup - first served at Shatterbox Coffee Bar in Victoria, BC in January 2013
   The method used at Shatterbox is this:
   In a 12oz. cup place tea bag, 2/3oz hazelnut syrup and top with 2oz near boiling water. 
   Let steep, swirling occasionally, while steaming milk. Milk should be brought to just over 
   140 degrees F (60C) and poured directly over the steeping tea mixture until the cup is full. 
   Enjoy!
* Montreal Fog - A London Fog that uses Yerba Mate instead of Earl Grey. Both vanilla and hazelnut syrup are added.
* London Smog - A regular London Fog with the addition of a shot of espresso.

NOTE: London Fog is a proprietary name for a tea blended exclusively by Carnelian Rose Tea Co.  Starbucks no longer used the name after being informed of the potential trade name conflict.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Defining &quot;Curriculum&quot;==
First of all, what is a curriculum? What is its purpose in the educational system? A curriculum is a syllabus that creates a general guideline for the education of students. It includes what subjects should be taught, as well as specific goals to be met by teachers and students in the duration of those courses. It ensures that all students receive an adequate educational experience, one that allows them to use their knowledge and understanding of core subjects to be successful in life, whether in post-secondary studies or in the job market. For example, the online credit requirement newly integrated into the Michigan Merit Curriculum, is designed to give students the opportunity to learn how to use the internet in conducting research and completing homework in an effort to give the students the knowledge and experience needed in a society that values technology in college and the work place. 

==The Role of Federal Government==
The Federal government is responsible for developing laws which mandate a minimum level of requirement for every school district in the United States. This includes passing legislation that requires schools to conform to national standards; often as a requirement for continuing to receive federal funding. Federal legislation gives general guidelines that are to be followed by State legislators as well as local school districts as they develop the curriculum and make decisions regarding how the curriculum should be implemented. 
The US Department of Education (USDE) was created in 1980, and is the federal government’s educational department. Their mission is “to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access” to resources (http://www.ed.gov/about/landing.jhtml?src=gu). The USDE establishes policies on federal financial aid for education and distributes and monitors those funds. They also collect data on America’s schools, focus national attention on key educational issues, prohibit discrimination and ensure equal access to resources.
The federal government also holds a supportive and guiding role to State governments and local school districts. This legislation is meant to assist these groups in creating and maintaining an effective curriculum. Many laws have been passed that impact today’s curriculum. These laws are aimed at supporting the efforts of state governments and local school districts and also to provide a guideline for required action, especially among local school districts that are falling behind the nation in standardized test scores and other measures of school accountability. One law that has a direct bearing on today’s curriculum is the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. This law has been the source of much controversy and has implemented many new standards into the public school curriculum.

==No Child Left Behind Act:==
This law was passed to raise school accountability and literacy standards across the country. According to the White House press release website, the bill was meant to provide and require: 

#Accountability for results
#Unprecedented state &amp; local flexibility &amp; reduced red tape
#Focusing resources on proven educational methods
#Expanded choices for parents (http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020108.html).

Schools are required to hire highly qualified teachers and show improvements in test scores on standardized achievement tests in order to continue to receive federal funding. The controversy around this law is centered on the possibility of some school districts “teaching to the test” in an effort to improve standardized test scores. It was believed that children were not getting a comprehensive educational experience because they were being taught only those things that they would be tested on. Another issue of controversy is whether NCLB is providing all of the things that it is supposed to and whether it is in fact leaving children behind by its new requirements. This law is currently undergoing a revision. The government intends to revise the law in the following ways:

*A stronger effort must be made to close the achievement gap through high state standards and accountability.
*Middle and high schools must offer more rigorous coursework that better prepares students for postsecondary education or the workforce.
*States must be given flexibilities and new tools to restructure chronically underperforming schools, and families must be given more options.

By making these changes, the government is hoping to make the law more effective in closing the achievement gap that exists between racial minorities and whites, as well as low socioeconomic groups and their more wealthy counterparts. Giving students more rigorous standards better prepares them for college and the job market, and ensures that all children in every school district across America receive adequate coursework. States must also have the resources and flexibility to create and implement curriculum standards that work for the state and its local districts. 

==The Role of State Government==
“Under the U.S. Constitution public education is a responsibility reserved to the states” (California State Government Guide to Government from the League of Women Voters of California: About Public Education, June 2008). State governments are largely responsible for creating the basic outline and guidelines of public school curriculum. They develop a standard for the types of subjects taught, as well as the number of credits required of each of those subjects. States provide course expectations and guidelines as an assistive measure to local school districts. States have control of setting the main body of the public school curriculum. On a fundamental level, states are responsible for determining what constitutes a credit and developing guidelines and content expectations for determining if a student has completed a course successfully. Although this is ultimately determined by local school systems, the state is involved in setting the guidelines for this determination.

States are also responsible for determining which subjects will be taught and the number of credits per subject required for graduation. For instance, Michigan recently adopted a new set of standards for graduation, called the Michigan Merit Curriculum, which makes the Michigan public school system one of the more rigorous educational systems in the country. “The Michigan Merit Curriculum defines a common set of required credits for graduation and provides educators with a common understanding of what students should know and be able to do for credit (Michigan Department of Education: Frequently Asked Questions, November 2006). These new requirements include:

*Four years of English
*Four years of Math
*Three years of Science
*Three years of Social Studies
*Two years of Foreign Language
*One year of Physical Education, and
*One online course (not necessarily for credit)

These requirements shape the curriculum of local school districts throughout the state of Michigan. Schools are required to implement these standards into their curriculum and all students must take these classes in order to graduate from high school. These standards are considerably more rigorous than any previous standards set by the state. Michigan developed these standards to give students a more comprehensive education and to ensure that they are taking rigorous courses in high school that can prepare them for the future. The state views these requirements as fundamental for future success in college and the job market. One of the most innovative additions to the new Michigan curriculum is the online course requirement, explained below in further detail. 

==Online Course Requirement==
This requirement is a reflection of the growing trend in the utilization of technology by businesses and universities in their daily operations. It is imperative that students be knowledgeable about and comfortable using technology such as computers, the worldwide web, and various types of computer software. The online experience is defined as, “a structured learning activity that utilizes technology with intranet/internet-based tools and resources as the delivery method for instruction, research, assessment, and communication” (Michigan Department of Education website). Today’s youth routinely utilizes technology in their daily lives so why is it necessary to implement it as a course requirement? “While students informally develop technology skills and gain experience through their media-rich lives, an online learning experience will require them to complete assignments, meet deadlines, learn appropriate online behavior, and effectively collaborate with others in an instructional setting” (Michigan Department of Education website).

==The Role of Local School Districts==
Local school systems are charged with the task of implementing the standards of the curriculum set forth by the Federal and State governments within their own school system. This requires that local school systems “…align curriculum, determine what constitutes a credit, establish a credit award system, identify assessments, set school calendars, select and purchase textbooks, etc. Local school boards and districts will continue to have flexibility to determine “how&quot; to implement these new graduation requirements and when students have earned the credits” (Michigan Department of Education: Frequently Asked Questions, November 2006).

Local school systems are given flexibility in determining how to meet State curriculum requirements. This means districts may implement “alternative instructional delivery methods such as teaching certain subjects in certain years, district partnerships, online courses, dual enrollment, [and] community college partnerships” (Michigan Department of Education: Frequently Asked Questions, November 2006).  Implementing new standards may also mean hiring new teachers, navigating around scheduling conflicts, and finding a way to manipulate limited resources to accommodate the new requirements.&lt;br&gt;
Local school systems must also establish the number of total credits required for graduation (including the required credits set forth by the State, as well as electives requirements set forth by the school system itself). 

==Assessing Credits==
Local school systems have the authority to determine if students have successfully completed the course and should be granted credits for that class by determining the type of assessment given and the time of that assessment. Assessments can be developed by the local district or by the state. “While the law requires a district to base a student's successful completion, at least in part, on student performance on subject area assessments, the amount the assessment counts toward a student's total grade is up to the district” (Michigan Department of Education: Frequently Asked Questions, November 2006). This leaves the decision of determining whether students have successfully completed curriculum requirements up to the local school district, following guidelines initiated by the state.

==The Role of Today’s Society==
As society has evolved, education has had to change also. A more competitive job market and the emphasis on a global economy, has led many to pursue post-secondary education through skill centers and universities. Americans are competing in a global market, one where it is important to be able to gain an advantage through comprehensive educational experiences. Because of this global competition and the requirement of most jobs that employees possess some form of higher education, legislators have begun to implement standards meant to aid students in the process of furthering their education by giving them a solid foundation of knowledge and experience during high school. “States are implementing and developing strategies to increase student participation in rigorous college preparatory courses, better align expectations between high school and postsecondary education, hold these systems accountable, and ensure students graduate from high school ready for college or the workplace in the global economy” (National Governors Association: Policy Position).

States are finding it necessary to pass more rigorous standards to not only give students a better education, but one that will more appropriately prepare them for the future. For example, “to ensure Michigan's students have the skills and knowledge needed for the jobs of the 21st Century global economy, on April 20, 2006, Governor Jennifer M. Granholm signed into law a rigorous new set of statewide graduation requirements that are among the best in the nation” (Department of Education, Copyright: 2001-2007, Michigan.gov). Advances in technology and the importance of computers in the workplace was a driving factor in the decision of Michigan legislators to implement the online course requirement in their curriculum. This requirement is meant to give the students of Michigan an edge in the university classroom as well as the job market.

Society is changing the way that legislators and educators are developing the curriculum by requiring the implementation of rigorous standards. These standards include a wide range of subject matter, including foreign language and online requirements.

The society in which one lives has a direct impact on the type and number of courses that are necessary for an adequate education. Students in today’s world must be knowledgeable and have appropriate experience with technology, world cultures, as well as more traditional subject matter to be successful.

==Conclusion==
The Federal government is responsible for passing laws that govern the national standards for public education. These standards are required for the continuance of federal funding. State legislators and state Departments of Education often work together to develop detailed guidelines of required subjects, standards, and goals for high school students. They develop state assessments to test students on these standards and to measure their comprehension of the subject matter.

Local school districts are required to adopt standards set by the Federal and State government and to determine how best to implement them. It is the local school district’s responsibility to determine if students have successfully fulfilled the requirements of a course and should be granted credit for it. It is also up to individual school districts to set the minimum number of credits required for graduation.

Society has also played a major role in the shaping of public education curriculum. Advances in technology, a more competitive job market, and an increased need for post-secondary education have driven the need for more rigorous curriculum standards.

The curriculum is a vital aspect of the public school system. It ensures that all students receive an adequate education, are held accountable for learning required material, and gain a knowledge base that provides them with the ability to achieve. Many forces are present in the shaping of public school curriculum. Federal, State, and local school districts all have a major stake in the success of American students, as they are the key to the continuation and success of our society. Students must be prepared to meet the demands of today’s culture. The curriculum of public education reflects this need by implementing standards that are rigorous and innovative, recognizing the need for change to better prepare students for a progressive world. Curriculum standards will continue to evolve as public opinion and community and educator expectations adapt to provide America’s students with the fundamentals necessary for their achievement.

==Questions==
What are the most common curriculum choices for high schools? What types of liberal arts and electives classes do they offer to students?
Why are physical education and other liberal arts electives being cut from many curriculums? Are they considered less important than core subjects, such as math and science?
If education is a function of the state, why does the Federal government intervene?
Should the Federal government set national standards for all schools? What would be the advantages and disadvantages if national standards were created?

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 2006, President Bush sent a bill to congress with a proposed thirty-nine million dollar increase in funding for schools that taught “abstinence-only until marriage” sex education.  A recent review of federally funded sexual education prepared by Henry Waxman (D-Ca) in 2005 showed that two-thirds of the programs had distorted information about abortion, contraceptives, and gender stereotypes.  Backed by no credible evidence, one school went as far to claim that five to ten percent of women became sterile after an abortion. Another school incorrectly claimed that the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) could be contracted through sweat and tears.  A proposed medical accuracy requirement was attempted to be added on to the legislation, however the effort fell on deaf ears.- (Melling, 2005) In 2007, after a congressional evaluation had been completed, the results of the multiyear surveys proved that there was no difference in how sexual education is taught in classrooms.- (Trenholm, 2007) 

Abstinence-Only Education Censors Vital Health Care Information:&lt;br&gt;
According to Merriam Webster abstinence is a voluntary forbearance of a something usually food but in this case sex. In abstinence-only education, two-thirds of all teenagers are having sex before marriage. (Kaiser, 2002) Ventura (2006) estimates in 2002, an estimated 757,000 pregnancies were accounted to 15-19 year olds. Approximately 9.1 million STD’s/STI’s, nearly half of the new STD’s/STI’s in the US, were occurring in people under the age of 25. (CDC, 2001)  The numbers are recently on the decline, but not enough to take away from how these programs have failed in relations to their purpose.

Because abstinence-only can only teach children not to have sex, there is a severe shortcoming in the teaching of protection and contraceptives.  According to Zabin, (1986) after a school in Baltimore began to provide condoms for those who would use them, the pregnancy rate dropped an astounding thirty percent in the first 28 months alone! Contraceptives have shown to be very effective, not only in regulating a menstrual cycle, but also protecting against pregnancy.  In abstinence-only, contraceptives use cannot be taught, as the focus must be complete abstinence.  Critics argue that if contraceptives were taught, then it would increase the amount of teenage intercourse, although studies show the exact opposite.- (Pardini, 2001) “It is not realistic that all teens are going to remain abstinent. Withholding information will not change that.”-(Mills, see Pardini, 2001)  Mills feels that withholding information can be harmful, even deadly.  Abstinence with contraceptives and protective methods makes the most sense in protecting children. Coupling this technique, along with thorough family comprehension, will delay first- time intercourse and help prevent the contraction of STDs/STIs.

==Students' View on What Should be Taught==
A blind online survey, performed within a global teenage puberty Question and Answer online community, revealed what kids wanted to be taught about sex education.  This site allows children between the ages of 13 and 19, and also twelve year olds with parental consent, to ask questions and get the answers not provided to them through sex education programs at school.  The question that was asked was, “What would you like to see taught?”   Responses demonstrated that education about protection was severely lacking.  Objective reasons about what to do if such things occurred, like a broken condom, STDs/STIs, pregnancy, HIV, and AIDs were most common. Education involving things like contraceptives, the morning after pill, and where to find condoms, should be taught in sex education classes and this compensates for that.

Videos are one thing that can be used to discuss sex education with children. Although  informational, they do not give the same type of effective information that a thorough conversation with a responsible adult would.  “Some schools show a few movies and hand their kids a tampon and a stick of deodorant and tell them to make it their best friend.”-(Govteen, 2007)  There is a consensus that showing kids pictures of infested genitals and lying to them about condom failure rates is not the way to teach.  Scaring and scarring young kids is not needed and does not work as often as a thorough explanation given by an understanding adult.

Anatomy is another topic of discussion that needs to be addressed.  A serious lack of understanding exists, and needs to be fixed.  Every day, girls and boys question themselves as being normal or not, because they grow at a different pace than the others they are growing up with.  The online global teen community mentioned that the earlier development component has approximately 34,000 members. Most of those teens question whether they are as developed enough or at the right speed.  Over the course of January 1, 2007 to September 29, 2007, over 2,000 posts had been on the topic of boy’s’ penis size alone. - (Govteen, 2007)  Boys also question circumcision rates; and whether they are or are not cut themselves; bringing in approximately 1,300 questions. - (Govteen, 2007)

Girls tend to accept their development a bit more than boys, as their development is a bit more public than that of boys.  This is not to say they have questions just the same as boys do, but they are just in different terms as they have different parts as boys do.  Girls worry more about breast size, periods, and appearance. Development in girls varies individually; and it is highly noticeable when girls grow.  Menstrual cycles are hard to predict, for the first year of so, and so is the frequency. However, they are usually preceded by a pre-menstrual cycle; where girls endure cramps, bloating, fatigue, and increased irritability.

With the onset of puberty, teenagers begin to experiment sexually.  Besides condoms and contraceptives, the teaching of masturbation should also be considered, however careful consideration should be undertaken.  A video or demonstration is inappropriate, but a pamphlet or text would do just fine.  Children of both sexes go through hormonal swings during this time, and would be less tempted to partake in intercourse if they knew how to relieve their sexual tension and urges.

==Teacher's Ideas and Responses==
“I am in favor of teaching students how to protect themselves and have safe sex.  I want them to be able to make safe decisions,”- (Lenca, Interview September, 2007) says Mrs. Cecile Lenca, a fifth grade teacher at a Midwest Elementary School.  Upon this explanation, one can assume that there are teachers who want a variety of lessons being taught, not just the option of no touching.

Mrs. Lenca has had forty hours of training in reproductive health. She has taught reproductive health to her students for many years.  When this chapter is taught at the Midwest Elementary School, parental permission forms are passed out asking if it is okay to teach their children reproductive health.  Mrs. Lenca makes sure that she maintains her student’s confidentiality and comfort during her teaching.  Students are required to hand in pieces of paper after a lesson, just in case their more uncomfortable questions still remain.  Not all pieces of paper returned have a question.  Most just say “Hi,” but some are legitimate questions that need more attention. “We must remember they are children and are very influential”-(Lenca, 2007).

The top answer from parents when it comes to teaching their children about sex is, “Just say no.” Does it work?

“No, because this is the real world.  It is better for girls to realize the pressure that boys will put on them to have sex.  It is better for boys to know how to control their sexual drives. Students need to know what is out there to prevent a child from being conceived if they have sex. Students need to know how to prevent diseases.  Protected sex is a necessity in today’s promiscuous society”-(Lenca, 2007).

What should be taught in schools?  Ninety percent of America’s parents think that sexual education should be taught in schools, but are unsure at to what is appropriate.  Should we move away from abstinence-only? 

“There is nothing wrong with abstinence.  Do I believe ninety percent of people used abstinence before marriage? No. Therefore, students need to know more. The problem comes with what to teach. Ministerial groups say abstinence, Catholics say procreation, and therefore masturbation is out and wrong, homosexuals want their beliefs taught.  Since public schools are for everyone, are we opening Pandora's Box in which we have to teach all the above and more?  What is the parent’s role in this?  Is it truly a responsibility of schools to teach this?  I am in favor of teaching students how to protect themselves and have safe sex.  I want them to be able to make safe decisions.” - (Lenca, 2007)

==Summary==
America’s schools need to take another look at how sexual education is taught.  A balance of abstinence and what to do if something were to go wrong. That’s what  should be taught; albeit difficult, it has to be done.  Teaching sexual education one way is only one way, when it could be taught several ways, is preposterous and ignorant. Since the public feels that an education on this subject should be taught in our schools, why are we teaching them only one side of the story and not how to protect themselves if the situation arises? Shouldn’t a public education be as rounded as possible? Should we not teach them what to do in case of emergencies? Should we ignore the facts? The information is right in front of us.  Will our government take action or will an ugly public debate gain more and more speed? Will the reproductive health program, that is most needed by our children fade into the distance as our youth has?

==Questions==
;What age do you think Sexual Education is appropriate to be taught?
:&quot;Personally I believe that the parents and teachers need to get together and teach the children the parts of the body at a young age, as young as six.  Reproductive processes need to be taught at an early middle school age just as or before puberty takes place.  This is the time where adolescence takes over and hormones flood the body at a pace never before seen in their bodies. At this age they can now learn what will and could happen when they do have intercourse and if they have a problem during that time.&quot;

;What do you think, should there be a balance sex-ed. at home and at school?
:&quot;I think that at a time before the subject is taught at school there should be a meeting with the parents and a discussion should be had over what needs to be addressed and what not to address.  When the child comes home from school they should have one on one discussions with their parent’s’ or guardian and discuss any questions not answered at school.  This way if the child is nervous to ask their parents they have a teacher to ask and vice versa if they can’t ask their teacher.&quot;

      <comment>/* Break Down of Public and Private School Attendance and Extracurricular Sports */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This country has long been an athletic nation; the competition gets to the very heart of American values and illustrates the concept that if you work hard you will be rewarded. For this reason, sports have been a mainstay in American culture. The school systems, both public and private, implement athletic programs to keep their students active and healthy. This paper will endeavor to explore the differences and similarities in the participation rate and demographics of those students who are active in these extracurricular activities; it will contrast female and male participation, as well as different ethnic groups and socioeconomic status all under the framework of the basic public-private division.  

==Sports in Relation to American Life==
Sports in relation to American life is much bigger than any other type of activity found in America because there is; “No other single type of activity brings people from completely different social, economic, political, religious, and racial backgrounds to participate in common, directly, or indirectly, as school sports and other co-curricular activities” (Jeziorski, 1994, p 30). Bringing people together is very important for the nation as a whole because America is such a mixed nation. Knowing this, sports and its inclusion of any race or background continues to this day to bring people of America together than segregate. Under the banner of sportsmanship, these differences become insignificant.

Another relation to sports, America, and education are the sets of rules. In every country, there are laws that you have to abide by to be a good citizen. Sports help define this fact and allow students and participants to understand this basic structural principle. “During a sports contest, student-participants are presented rules that are defined and sanctions that are enforced immediately upon violation of those rules” (Jeziorski, 1994, p. 27). As schools prepare students for the outside world this skill and understanding is very important to their success as American citizens and as people in general.
 some of the sports are Basketball, Volleyball, and Cross Country.

==Competition and cooperation==
Both are fundamental to democracy. And it is very important in our free enterprise economic system that these principles be properly integrated and practiced by citizens as part of the socialization process within our schools. Competition is at the very base of our political system of electing our officials” (Jeziorski, 1994, p. 37). With the American economic system and the very values which this country was founded upon, competition remains to this day to be the driving force of its culture. The search for the best is not limited to athletic competition but in the market between business and consumers. Products, politicians, American Idols, and the job market are all examples of the competitive nature of this country, and the sooner a student can realize this and become accustomed to this type of social interaction the better they will be able to survive in this country. 

For where I am from (Russia) we do not contribute it in our daily lives unless our perfection is a particular sport, nor do we contribute it to our private or public schools curriculum seeing is are schools are separated for scholars and schools for athletes. I was shocked when I came to this country that whenever I told someone that I am from Russia their first question to me was if I play or played hockey. Maybe it is because of the stereotype that most Russians play hockey but there are many examples or stereotypes about Russians that do not pertain to sports whatsoever, which tells me that most Americans think of sports more than other things. I am not trying to stereotype at all because I have been to numerous countries and sports are at the least of their concerns. Of course people from other countries admire their country’s popular sport but I guess we are not as able to think of it so much because life in other countries is not as easy as it is in America. There are many examples in everyday life in America that I figured out why sports are so popular.

One example is television. From sports channels, to sports related commercials, to the drive of being better at something than another person is what drives a person to think about sports all the time. If it is all around you, you will have no way to escape it and as much as you hate it in the beginning if it is around you so much eventually you will fall victim to being a sports addict.

Another example of why sports are so big in America is because the amount of sports teams there are. In other countries you would usually have one country team and one club team for all the major sports. In America almost every major city you go to there is a certain team for some sport. And as much as it is in people hearts to be patriotic to something they will like a team from their city that they never watch or even like the sport the team is in they will instinctively root for that team because the team represents their city. This opens up the cause and effect for the person in time to eventually like the team and the sport. I have a great example about something like that. When I came to this country I hated baseball and football and never wanted to watch it. But through out time I began liking the baseball and football team from my city just for the sole purpose because they represented my city. I never watched any games and never wanted to. But later down the line I just wanted to see what I was rooting for and started watching them knowing in my head that I hate these sports. The team and sport was around me so much that I had to watch it just once and just like all before me got hooked on it.

The last and final example on why sports are so big is because of the private and public schools. In many other countries there were schools for either scholastic students and sports athletes and at a young age you were put in either or on what you were better at or what your strengths and weakness were. So the majority of the children that were put in the academic schools as opposed to the athletic schools never got the opportunity or interest to be in a sport or like it. In America though it is different, any school you go to either  if it is public or private, sports is included into the curriculum raging from just gym class to actual sports teams you can play on. It was not just open to particular kids that were chosen but any child at any age or year can join a team, not saying that he would play but join it and get interested in the sport. Schools out of everything play a very important role in America of why sports are so big here.  Although sports in schools play roles for all types of kids there are schools that offer more and have more money to fund sports, than some other schools. The example of this that I will be talking about in this paper is the difference between private sports and public sports.

==Break Down of Public and Private School Attendance and Extracurricular Sports==
Public Schools are very different than Private schools in attendance and extracurricular ranging from the amount of students, funding, and the eligibility for each school. Since public school are state owned schools meaning that any child in the area of the school lives by can go for free as opposed to private schools that require the parents or guardians to pay for their student to go to there is a large gap in the amount of student that go to each one. “There was also a considerable difference in sports participation rates among school types. Approximately 75 percent of private school students (both Catholic and other private) indicated participation in sports at some level, while over one-half of the public school students reported the same. As SES and parents’ education rose, participation rates in academic clubs, sports, hobby clubs, and music increased” (Ingels, 2005, 70).  This fact helps illustrate both the divide in income for students and their undertaking of extracurricular activities, when it comes to the question of enrollment in public versus private schools. Because of the more specific schedule and higher expectations one encounters in a private school environment the push for extracurricular activities is higher and therefore the students, usually of privileged backgrounds, are more likely to partake in all the athletic offerings of their institution.

The graph below shows the percentage of sophomores in 2002 that attended public schools as opposed to private catholic schools and other private schools.
This graph shows the high percentages of students that attend high school in America are usually in public schools as opposed to private schools. Since public schools are open to any student and private schools tend to charge for admission for the students that attend it there is a huge gap on the amount of students in each school. Funding in public school is provided by the state and the tax payers. The gap between the number of those enrolled in public has gone from nearly identical enrollment, 283,000 to 247,000 public to private in 1955 to a larger comparative gap, 954,000 to 607,000 public to private in 2005, enrollment in 4-year degree granting institutions (NCES, 2006). The number of enrollees to private colleges has only doubled in fifty years whereas the number of students enrolled in public institutions has more than tripled, which would significantly strain the resources of the educational system.

This creates the gap in which public schools and private schools differ in the amount of extracurricular sports they have to offer for their students because of their budget, which brings me to my next point.

Extracurricular sports in private schools are usually better of then public schools because the average student has to pay a lot more for a year to go to that school as opposed to the public school where the average student does not have to pay out of pocket. &lt;br&gt;
One reason is because private schools curriculum is much more tougher than public, and private schools tend to be more religious schools meaning that they will only choose people that they think are well qualified and will be a asset rather than a liability to their school where as public schools do not have this opportunity because anybody may attend. Things like drugs and the area that the school is in plays a large role on the type of students they will have. If you have public schools in the heart of a crime infested area of a city the school will not generate many scholars or athletes because of the lives of the students outside of school. This is different for private schools because of the requirements and tuition needed to attend a private institution and even if the schools were given the same group of kids that attended the greater access to resources and staff gives the private schools academic as well as athletic advantage over public schools. Some schools get used to playing each other and become enemies.

==Gender Differences==
Gender is a huge topic on sports for private and public schools. An official for the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Judith M. Sweet states that “…based on the number of women who are playing sports at the high-school level, I think there's still more room to increase participation in college. There's a dramatic difference in resources provided to men's and women's teams for recruiting. And the facilities have improved, but my sense is that there is still a gap in the quality, in comparison to men's teams” (Lipka, 2006).
The federal government has intervened in the world of sports by introducing Title IX which supports equality in sports between men and women mandating that for every male sport there be a female sport as well. This development came out of the equal rights movement and gender equality movements of the seventies.

But with the age of time and the changing of views on many values and influence from other countries woman began to break out of the house mom mold and not only start going into the work place but the athletic place too. One huge occurrence in America that kind of paved the way to woman being in sports was because of WW2. When all the men went off to Europe or Asia to fight the war woman were, in turn, put in the work place and were further included in sports. This as time progressed made woman more confident to stand out and put out their voice to be heard, universal suffrage as it is called. Nowadays, women are as active in sports as much as men are. Public and private schools almost all have woman and men sport teams. This differs though with public and private schools because of the religious aspect, however the ratio of men to women participation is still low. Judith Sweet says: “Interestingly, when you look at the participation opportunities that are available nationally, they're still at 41 percent for female athletes. So while there may have been an increase in the female student population, we're still a long way even from 50-50” (Lipka, 2006). College and high schools for woman sports differ a lot when it comes down to public and private schools and the amount of woman play sports because of that people are much understanding about things like gender races in sports.

==Race Differences==
Out of all the races looked at in the 2002 Sophomore study, only Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives, (55% and 54.6% respectively) had a participation rate comparable to whites (57%) (Ingels, 2005). It was not until the rights movement though that African Americans were allowed to play sports with white people and now they are very active in the world of sports. As opposed to public and private sports I believe there are a lot more in public schools than in private for two reasons. Even though private schools can recruit minorities and give them scholarships to go to the school if they cannot afford it, often too few minority youth have these opportunities. Given the economic situation in the inner city, the access to private schools is usually nonexistent and the public schools are overextended. Another issue regarding private school enrollment of minority students is the basic differences in the religious affiliations of those attending, Catholicism is the primary denomination of private schools and many minorities tend to be in different denominations further alienating that population. 

==Conclusions==
In conclusion, there are many differences between public school sports in relation to private school sports. Gender, race, attendance, and extracurricular subjects that I briefly mentioned in this paper are just a couple of topics that differ between the two. Sports is also very good for everybody’s future because “Athletes were more likely than sports nonparticipants to expect to earn a 4-year degree or higher (78 percent for athletes versus 64 percent for nonparticipants), and none sport extracurricular participants were likewise more likely to hold this educational expectation than their nonparticipating counterparts (79 percent versus 64 percent)” (Ingels, 2005, 71).  Sports will be the highlight of American culture for years to come, because of its important role in American life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">American public schools are largely a product of the quest for progress (Cassidy, 2004).  Schools are constantly looking for ways to enrich their curriculum for students and provide educational tools for them that will help them with life further in time.  Americans were not the first to invent schooling but were the first to believe that if the people are educated to a certain degree then they can rule themselves.  The first sentence of this paper could also read that American technology is largely a product of the quest for progress, is this not true also?  That is why education and technology or the media go hand in hand in the 21st century.
	
The role of media and technology in education is quite obvious in today’s educational settings.  Schools are loaded with computers and even here at Northern Michigan University students receive a laptop to help them with academic studies.  This is part of NMU’s Laptop Initiative plan that believes providing every student with a laptop will help improve their academic performance.  However media comes in many different forms, such as; internet, TV, radio, and books, all of these media have affected the way students learn.  Around the world students are being globally connected with one another via internet (Rolls, 2007).  These mass media tools have made the world a smaller place in a way, also called (globalization).  The way media affects education are great and varied when you think about it.  Back when Columbus sailed the ocean blue the world had the misconception that the earth was flat, and why did they have this theory? Because that is what was printed on every map that was distributed back then making media at fault.  Media is such a massive part of our lives and it is everywhere we turn.  How could it not affect our lives in terms of education?  Before we can dive into all the benefits of media to education it is important that the educators of students and students themselves become what is called “media literate”.  This is the ability to decipher the hidden messages in mass media.  Teacher education needs media literacy as an essential tool and topic in the new millennium (Schwarz, 2001).  Let’s face it, media has changed the world.  Media such as internet, is constantly growing and changing, thus educators must stay with the times and keep up by using these tools for their students.  With the help of new media power teachers would be more able to offer students information from around the world at an even faster and easier rate.

==Why should teachers be media literate?==
Media literacy merits a place in teacher education because it encourages critical thinking in a media-dominated age (Schwarz, 2001).  This also engages students more and makes connections between life and school. It is not enough for students just to become media literate.  Teachers must model media literacy for their students also.  This goes way back to when you were just a baby. A baby learns at first by replicating what it sees others do.  If a teacher demonstrates media literacy then so will the students.  This can be seen if anybody has ever been taught the difference between legitimate and illegitimate websites.  What information to trust online can be based almost by the dot com ending of the website address.  Information with a dot gov ending is more reliable that a dot com.  It is easy to place media literacy in established school curriculum such as social science, language, and communications; media affects all of these areas of study (Cassidy, 2004).   Media literacy in social studies allows future teachers to &quot;uncover hidden assumptions, to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information, to recognize biases, to separate fact from opinion, and ultimately, to determine the strength of the mass medium's message (Schwarz, 2001).  Already media has effected education in the sense that it has created a new subject area to study, a special way just to decipher the media messages that both student and teacher alike should learn.  Of all the new fields created by media evolution, Public Relations, or PR is the best example.  It is based solely on ones ability to create media for a mass audience with certain undertones of persuasiveness to it, like getting people to go to a concert.  PR people control media and bend it to their will so they can manipulate people.  As this paper progresses it will look at other ways the educational system has been shaped and molded by today’s ever growing mass media market.  Understanding media literacy however is the first step before moving forward with explain the other parts of media in education.

==Media's Influence on Children==
Media's influence on children has steadily increased as new and more sophisticated types of media have been developed and made available to the American public.  Beneficial effects include early readiness for learning, educational enrichment, opportunities to view or participate in discussions of social issues, exposure to the arts through music and performance, and entertainment. Harmful effects may result from sensationalization of violent behavior, exposure to subtle or explicit sexual content, promotion of unrealistic body images, presentation of poor health habits as desirable practices, and exposure to persuasive advertising targeting children (Influence on Children media, retrieved on Sept 23rd 07).  As you can tell, media acts as that double-edged sword that can hurt as much as help whoever wields it.  That is why it is so important to stress the education of media literacy starting at a young age.  If that happens I believe that video games would be blamed less for violent actions because the child should know the difference between real world and fantasy.  I have taken many media courses and even a media literacy course here at NMU but with the way media is changing the world today children need to learn before the college level about media literacy.  A child who is media illiterate is more vulnerable to being influenced by messages in all kinds of media (Williams, retrieved on Sept 23rd 07).
	
Specific domains of influence exist that could affect children, they are; violence and aggressive behavior, sexual content, body image and self-esteem, and finally physical health and school performance.  Everyone has heard about violence being a problem in media today.  Kids watch TV or movies and want to mimic their favorite stars; however they must learn to be able to separate reality from fantasy. This comes from a good solid education in media literacy.  Girls more than boys have personal image problems from the constant pressure of media for them to waif thin and so called “pretty.”  This in turn would lead to worse academic performance mainly because the student might be starving themselves and without proper nutrition they cannot learn properly in a school environment.  Teachers should not bear the sole responsibility for educating kids about media literacy though; parental monitoring is a key factor, since the research studies show that increasing guidance from parents is at least as important as simply reducing media violence. Children may learn negative behavior patterns and values from many other experiences as well as TV programs, and parental guidance is needed to help children sort out these influences and develop the ability to make sound decisions on their own(Influence on Children Media, retrieved on Sept 23rd 07).

==Media in Terms of Globalization==
Could it be that economic and social changes brought about by globalization are forcing us to revolutionize our approach to education?  This is a very tough question and the answer depends on who you talk to and what you read.  In fact, with the widespread use of internet around the globe information is available at our fingertips quicker than ever these days.  This in my opinion would have to alter all school curricula.  Students are more aware of the world outside of their birthplace thanks to the internet. In “College Goes Global” William R. Brody speculates that there will be a rise to what he calls a “megaversity.”  He defines this as a research and educational dynamo electronically linking the best faculty and most capable students in a worldwide academic community.  The key word in the definition is “linking”; linking is what makes it all possible for students to utilize the internet for the benefit of gaining knowledge from a worldwide standpoint.  Imagine a classroom with all current and the best technology in it.  Projectors, computers, TVs, and anything else in it, this would be a true media laced learning center.  Students would be able to connect to all parts of the world easily to obtain information they need to learn.  The media center concept has received widespread support from educational organizations and from professionals who consider a sound media program a prerequisite to higher quality education (Poston, 1978).

==Technology in Education==
Computers and Internet connections are becoming widely available in schools and classrooms. In 1999, 99 percent of teachers in the United States had access to a computer in their schools, and 84 percent had one or more computers in their classrooms.  These are staggering numbers and that was only eight years ago.  Just imagine what the numbers would look like now. The availability of media is everywhere.  One angle that you might not have thought of are the benefits of media to teachers.  Teachers can use media to help find problems that fit real world situations for their students.  A good example of this for construction students or math students, figuring out correct angles to build a bridge or build underground tunnels is a very real life job.  Students could use real bridges numbers and statistical information in their problem solving helping them really learn what it took to build that bridge.  But sometimes problems are not as easy as this, unlike problems that occur in the real world, technology can incorporate graphics, video, animation, and other tools to create problems that can be explored repeatedly. Multimedia representations are easier to understand than problems presented as text (Williams, retrieved Sept 23 07).

Internet and videoconferencing technology allow students to participate in projects sponsored by researchers around the world. In the Jason Project, satellite and Internet technology bring classroom students into direct real-time contact with leading scientists, conducting scientific research expeditions around the globe (Williams, retrieved sept 23 07).  This sense of global community is one of the largest benefits to education from media development.  Everyone sharing one common pool of knowledge where no one man is smarter than the next and all information is equally available to both.

==Media’s Non-direct Effects on Education==
Following a shooting near one Detroit public school and another inside a school, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and Detroit Public Schools CEO William Coleman have developed a short-term plan for stronger school security (Moore, 2005). Just this past year at Virgina Tech University a massive school shooting took place also.  These shootings were started by disturbed students, but why? And why at school?  Is it possible that the students were brainwashed by forms of media and had such poor training in media literacy that they could not socialize with other students and not tell the difference between real life and fantasy. On April 20, 1999, two seniors killed 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado.  This marked the first school shooting ever and America’s citizens were stunned.  Not too long after the incident forms of media were being blamed for the horrible situation.  Violent video games and music had the fingers pointed their ways but was it really media’s fault?  I believe that it was a case of media fueling media, and Glenn Muschert agrees with me.  Muschert, who studies mass media coverage of high profile crimes, with attention to how the media defines social problems, maintains the fear created from Columbine fuels a misperception of how violence affects the country's youth. While most believe violence leads to more violence, that doesn't track with reality. Statistics at the time of Columbine showed that one child in 2,000,000 will be fatally shot at school per year--the same odds as being struck by lightning (Muschert, 2003).  This blame of media causing school violence also lead to a nationwide security crackdown of all schools and campuses.  Police officers patrol halls of high schools with loaded guns, metal detectors are in place at the buildings front doors to deter anyone wanting to smuggle in a gun.  Entire drill plans like a tornado or fire drill have been invented in case of a school shooting.  The media blew Columbine out of proportion in a sense that is was over covered and saturated everyone’s TV screen for the next 2 weeks, it did place this element of fear in parents heads that their children are no longer safe even at school.  All because the media decided to show how horrific the event at Columbine was and repeated it time after time after time.  Community recovery was hampered by a common response among those with responsibility for Columbine, especially members of the school staff and journalists who continued to mine the story (Cote, Simpson, 2006).

==Role of Media in Education Revisited==
As the reader can see, media plays a large direct and non-direct role in education.  Through the advent of new technology the world has been brought closer together in attempts to share knowledge and educate the masses.  Media can help and hinder in an educational environment, but as long as its use is monitored by someone who is media literate there should be limited problems.
As this paper has highlighted media is everywhere in today’s world.  One cannot help but be exposed to it at all times.  Logically, it would make sense that media would play a role in education around the globe.  From violence to sharing global ideas in a virtual community it is because of media and the recent media explosion i.e. the internet lately that education can thank for helping push young minds forward at an accelerated learning pace.  Although media literacy is a problem students seem to be finding their own ways in the world of technology and are making the best of it to really better their minds.  

==Questions==
#How do television shows, movies, and video games teenagers watch interact with their education?
#What if a school is unable to afford computers or current technology?
#With students becoming more able minded with technology does that not make it easier for them to cheat?
#Are there any differences between public and private schools use of media?

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a bi-polar era of American history in which a sharply divided citizenry lends itself to an often heated debate concerning the role this nation should play in an increasingly globalized and connected world, the fact that any bi-partisan legislature can exist at all seems a small miracle.  However the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) represents exactly that, stimulating the ongoing debate about how best to socialize America’s youth while at the same time displaying the immense amount of passion involved in any discussion of a topic so important and fundamental to a democratic people’s security and well being.
	
NCLB is about a thousand pages long and represents one of the single greatest efforts in our nations modern history to reform not only the viability of quality education to all who reside here, but the act also identifies who is accountable when the educational institutions of this country fail or do not perform satisfactorily (Popham, 2004).  NCLB was passed in Congress with the support of both Republicans and Democrats.  It was signed into law in 2001 with the signature of President Bush (Irons &amp; Harris, 2007).  The act is essentially a reauthorization of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act and concerns itself with virtually every facet of the education system in America.  NCLB deals with issues ranging from standardized testing to closing the achievement gap between wealthier white students and poorer minorities (Popham, 2004, p. 14).

==Standardized Testing and AYP==
The issue of standardized testing is a major point of contention in the act.  The main provisions of the law decree that every state in the union accepting federal funds must test students every year in grades 3-8, once again in high school in the subjects of reading and mathematics, with science testings introduced by 2008 (Wood, 2004).  While few reject the notion of standardized testing outright, many think that excessive emphasis on such testing attempts to centralize American education past the point of practicality.  This in turn ends up defining schools only by their test scores (Reese, 2005).   

Additionally, schools are required to show gradual progress from one year to the next on such tests, an expectation phrased as Adequate Yearly Progress or AYP (Wood, 2004).   AYP is a relatively controversial issue due to the fact that schools are expected to constantly raise their expectations of satisfactory learning.  In short, if students do well on the tests they are met with harder tests.  Any teacher will tell you harder does not necessarily mean better (Kohn, 2004).  

Opponents also argue that such an emphasis on testing compromises the quality of teaching in our classrooms.  It forces teachers to concern themselves with raising test scores and preparing their students for a test rather than adequately covering their subjects and giving their students a true understanding of the curricula they are taught (Kohn, 2004).  “Teaching to the test,” as it is often called, represents a dangerous corruption of education.  In the words of Alfie Kohn, “…it is the equivalent of shooting an arrow into a wall and then drawing a target around it…” (Kohn, 2004, p. 82).

==Special Education and Standardized Testing==
Another common complaint lodged against standardized testing regards the fact that 95% of all students in a school must take the state standardized tests in order to meet the requirements called for under the No Child Left Behind Act (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  This requirement was made for obvious reasons.  Before such requirements, schools often would not test groups of students who were expected to do poorly.  Increasingly deceptive methods were employed by some ambitious administrators who would only test the cream of the crop as special education students and those perceived as “bad testers” would often be unavailable on test day due to a “field trip” (Popham, 2004).  This was often indirectly encouraged by policymakers such as George Bush, whose “Texas Miracle” in education was soiled by the revelation that principals of schools scoring highly on such tests received cash bonuses in return for their “good results” (Reese, 2005).  

While preventing students with disabilities or other learning problems to boost test scores only masks an issue, requiring them to take the test (which the 95% requirement in effect does) introduces a myriad of new obstacles to overcome.  Since such students have unique requirements and abilities, they cannot be expected to perform as well as general education students on evaluative tests.  The Illinois State Board of Education reported that 201 districts and 142 schools failed solely due to testing results reported for special education students (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  For this reason a provision was made to allow states to make alternative tests for academically challenged students.  While it looked great on paper, the reality was that few states ended up using alternative tests.  The effort, expertise and cost of making the tests were usually far beyond the means available.  Additionally, teachers would need additional training to implement such new methods (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  Clearly, the balancing act between trying to treat all students equal and giving special needs students the additional and unique attention they need to succeed is as elusive as any attempts to perfect education in America.

==Title I and Supplemental Tutoring==
As discussed earlier, AYP plays a significant role in determining whether a school is classified as meeting the goals of No Child Left Behind or of failing to do so.  If a school fails in three consecutive years to meet testing result requirements, it must allow students from low income families to use Title I funds to either obtain supplemental academic services from public or private organizations. These services usually come in the form of after school tutoring or the chance to transfer to another school that has shown adequate AYP (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  In an attempt to ensure that adequate funds reached the schools in greatest need, Title I became an essential component of the NCLB Act.

Title I was reauthorized by President Bush as part of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001.  With $10.4 billion allocated to provide a helping hand rather than insure local compliance with federal guidelines, it represented the largest federal program supporting education in America, with funds intended for those schools in greatest need (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  These goals were largely achieved.  Ninety six percent of schools with 75% or more low income students received Title I funds.  It intended to make teachers and administrators accountable for their low performing schools and help close the achievement gap in American education.  Responsibility for such inefficiencies now fall on schools and even individual class rooms while in the past it had traditionally fallen on state level departments (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).

While the initial purpose of such tutoring was to provide disadvantaged students the extra help they need in academics, several unforeseen consequences developed as a result of supplemental tutoring provided by the government (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  If opted for, the tutoring could be sought out from either public resources or private organizations.  Each state pre-approved a list of private sources that were deemed qualified to provide the tutoring, and an estimated $5 billion of the Title I funds went to ensure this resource (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  However much of the tutoring ended up being outsourced to foreign companies that provided their services via the internet, where they were unrestricted by the law and the United States Department of Education was forced to admit that they had little control over the business practices of such companies (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  Further complicating the issue was the fact that many low income families did not have easy access to the internet (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  Additionally, religious organizations such as the boy scouts were approved on the government lists.  Subsequently the government was providing these faith based initiatives with tax payer money and clearly forwarding the interests of such groups, a clear violation of the concept involving separation of church and state in the constitution (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  Concern grew over this issue until the Congressional Investigative Agency was called on to determine the exact nature of overseas tutoring companies and to ascertain the extent to which they operate (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).

Another disconcerting feature that affected public opinion regarding the No Child Left Behind Act was the fact that wherever President Bush went, his big business allies were always soon to follow.  In fact, allowing private interests to run education has historically ended with less than desirable results.  Most notably with Chris Whittle who provided free televisions and computers to public schools and in return the students were made to watch television commercials for a set time during the day and read textbooks with clever product placement within them (Reese, 2005).  It is with little surprise that many began to resent President Bush’s allowance of private businesses to run government funded tutoring.  Further complicating the issue is that the tutoring provided by Title I funds remained largely unused, as only 18% of those eligible for the service actually used it (Harris &amp; Irons, 2007).  Furthermore, since much of the money is directed towards private companies on a government contract, this money is essentially wasted when it could be re-circulated back to the public schools that are in such dire need of additional funding.

==Flagrant Opposition and the Trojan Horse Theory==
It seems recent developments to the No Child Left Behind Act has inflamed the age old issue of state’s rights.  The setting of education policy traditionally has been the domain of the state governments, with the primary exceptions being the Great Society reforms and aid to vocational education.  However a new trend is developing in which the federal government is increasingly involved in setting national guidelines by which the states must now follow (Reese, 2005).  According to James Popham, the message sent by federal lawmakers is, “We have ample funds to send your way, but to get it you must play by our rules” (2004, p. 14).  This inevitably ends up with many teachers, despite their personal inclinations toward such tactics, jumping through the hoops in order to gain extra funding.  Other educators have made no secret their opposition to parts of or all of the No Child Left Behind Act.  Some states have been able to gather enough public support to allow individual districts enough leeway to make their own tests despite federal regulations, most notably in Nebraska (Popham, 2004).  Additionally Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico and Vermont have rejected parts of the new law’s guidelines.  The legislatures of Utah and Virginia have voted almost unanimously not to comply with requirements of No Child Left Behind (Wood, 2004).  Much of the logic behind resistance to the act is that it is often considered to be an attempt to embarrass low performance schools which are mostly populated by minorities.  This is perceived to be done by imposing sanctions on already troubled institutions and allowing increased privatization of American schooling, a goal which many believe is President Bush’s real motivation for signing the act (Reese, 2005).  Even this viewpoint is far from the most extreme ones.  Alfie Kohn, described by Time magazine to be one of the most outspoken critics of the current American fixation on tests and statistics, has claimed that the act is a Trojan horse meant to deliberately undermine public schooling in America despite its publicly professed goals of strengthening it (Wood, 2004).  While to some the Trojan horse theory may sound like a far-fetched conspiracy theory, significant resistance to the implementation of the regulations called for by the act cannot be denied or ignored any longer.

==Summary==
The heated debate over the No Child Left Behind Act shows not only the differing viewpoints regarding the national governments role in education but also the immense amount of interest in how best to socialize and educate our nation’s youth so as to create a greater and more prosperous nation.  The debate over the act did not initiate the discussions involving standardized testing, privatizing education and closing the achievement gap between whites and minorities.  These have been issues hotly disputed long before the act was signed in 2001, and they no doubt will be debated well into the future.  Whether one supports the act or not, serious matters face America; first and foremost the relative lack of quality education that blacks, Hispanics and other minorities receive is of immense concern.  Cuts in school budgets in poorer areas have taken their toll, and it is now estimated that 39% of black students have no recess during a school day, whereas with white students the number is a mere 15% (Prince, 2004).  Although some may feel a lack of recess is not dooming one to a life of poverty and crime, any teacher knows that it doesn’t stop there.  White students across the board receive far better funding and education than do minorities and blacks who by in large inhabit low income schools in America’s cities.  The acts stated goals are to impose a range of mandates tied to federal money to encourage quality education and make schools acknowledge their own flaws to those who are considering attending them.  However, it cannot be denied that the act needs serious retooling if it is to have a serious chance of accomplishing any of these goals (Berkman &amp; Plutzer, 2005).  While few now would agree with Barry Goldwater’s claim in 1964 that a child without education can still “do fine,” there can be some concern in the eyes of the nation’s educators when everyone looks to them, their schools and education itself as the cure to the issues that ail our nation and on a larger scale our society.  But they will no doubt perform their role to the best of their ability to teach and enrich the children of a culture that often spends more time admiring trashy heiresses and ruined former playmates than academic overachievers.

#Do standardized tests just force teachers to teach a strict curriculum based on these tests and inhibit the overall learning the students deserve?
#Do the schools that need the most work often not get the funding that they need, because of their low test scores?
