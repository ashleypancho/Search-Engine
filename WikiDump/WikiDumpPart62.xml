== Overview ==

'''''Gringotts''''' is the only known bank of the wizarding world and it is operated primarily by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblins]]. Wizards and witches keep their money and other valuables in vaults that are protected by very complex and strong security measures.  

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Gringotts is a large multistoried white building, near the intersection of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], that towers over all neighbouring shops. Customers pass through a set of bronze doors and then silver ones before entering the lobby; the floor is paved with marble and has long counters stretching along its length with doors leading off to the vault passageways. The vaults extend for miles under the city and are accessible through rough stone, complex and interconnected passageways by means of speedy carts that are operated by goblins. 

The inscription on the front door reads:

''Enter, stranger, but take heed &lt;br /&gt;Of what awaits the sin of greed &lt;br /&gt;For those who take, but do not earn, &lt;br /&gt;Must pay most dearly in their turn. &lt;br /&gt;So if you seek beneath our floors &lt;br /&gt;A treasure that was never yours, &lt;br /&gt;Thief, you have been warned, beware &lt;br /&gt;Of finding more than treasure there.'' &lt;br /&gt; 
([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']])

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] first visits Gringotts, he is told by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] that one would have to be mad to try to rob Gringotts and that, apart from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts|Hogwarts]], it's the safest place for anything valuable to be kept. Goblins are extremely greedy and would protect their money and valuables at any cost, which makes them ideal guardians for the valuables of the wizarding world. The goblins have a code that forbids them to speak of the bank's secrets, and would consider it &quot;base treachery&quot; to break any part of that code. 

Gringotts use a variety of security systems:

* Lower security vaults require a key; higher security vaults (generally deeper underground and owned by the oldest wizarding families) require the touch of a certified Gringotts goblin.
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragons]] guard the highest security vaults. They can only be controlled by Clankers, which only the goblins possess.
* The Thief's Downfall can be activated; a charmed waterfall that the goblin carts must pass through, it cancels all enchantments and magical concealments, and throws the carts off their tracks.
* Some vaults use the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gemino|Gemino]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flagrante|Flagrante]] charms; when any item is touched by a thief, it multiplies rapidly and burns them, eventually crushing and scorching them to death.
* Objects within Gringotts cannot be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|summoned]].
* At times, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Probity Probe|Probity Probes]] are used on customers to detect enchantments, magical concealments and hidden magical objects.

We note that depositors are given individual vaults to keep their valuables, rather than having their funds pooled the way Muggle banks do. We presume that this is an example of the Wizarding world's general archaic atmosphere; just as so many other aspects of the Wizarding world have remained firmly planted in the older ways of doing things, with individual fireplaces and stoves for the rooms, gaslights, and so forth, it seems that the banking style of the day has remained limited to the ancient model encompassing only exchange and storage of valuables. We note that this could be construed also as a security measure, as luck alone determines what you will find when you enter a vault. You could pick one full of riches like the Lestrange vault; but equally, you could end up with a dusty, empty vault like the Hogwarts one mentioned below, or the Weasleys'.
 
At the beginning of the first book, Gringotts Vault 713, a higher-security vault, held a small grubby bag, inside of which was the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] sends Hagrid to retrieve it while he escorts Harry to Diagon Alley. Later that very same day, someone, apparently a very powerful wizard, breaks into the vault. Although he is unsuccessful in obtaining the Philosopher's Stone, the break-in shocks the Wizarding world because it is practically unheard of for Gringotts to be robbed. The culprit is not caught, though we later learn that it was almost certainly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]], acting under orders from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]].

While Gringotts is largely staffed by goblins, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] and Ragnok, it is known that the bank does employ humans. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] works as a Curse Breaker for Gringotts in Egypt, retrieving artifacts from ancient Egyptian tombs and pyramids. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] took a part-time job with Gringotts after participating in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], apparently to improve her English skills, and wizard guards are mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] during the break in. Griphook mentions at that time that the goblins resent &quot;wand-bearer&quot; interference in their internal affairs.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], aided by a reluctant Griphook in exchange for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]]'s sword, break into the vault of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] where a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff]]'s cup, is hidden. However, when they go into Bellatrix's vault, which is stocked with all manners of treasure, they find out that the treasure has Gemino and Flagrante charms placed on it. Though burned and nearly buried in false treasures, the Trio manage to escape with the Horcrux by fleeing on a half-blind dragon that was part of the security for the vault, leaving parts of the bank in ruins.

== Analysis ==

It is only to be expected that there would be banks for wizards, just as there are for Muggles. As magic makes it possible to pass through nominally locked doors, it is also to be expected that security measures at Wizarding banks would be more stringent, and more Wizard-specific, than at Muggle banks; no Muggle bank could stand attack by a single reasonably-determined wizard. Thus the vaults are deep underground, protected presumably by anti-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] spells, and concealed by the use of the Goblin-specific carts and confusing routes.

The fact that Gringotts has never been robbed is mentioned in the first book, along with the fact that a break-in had happened. It is interesting to note that in the seventh book, Griphook, despite no longer working for the bank, still attempts to defend Gringotts' record of having no successful burglaries, claiming that the break-in did not count because the vault in question was already empty. It is only blind chance that allowed Gringotts to claim its security was still intact. After the Trio's venture, however, their record is broken; and one must wonder how Griphook explained matters once he returned to the bank.

Initially, the use of dragons to guard the high security vaults is only a rumor. It is possible that the author included that as no more than a way to introduce Hagrid's love of dangerous creatures in general, and dragons in particular, and as a way to establish background for the introduction of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 14|Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback]].

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is noted that Voldemort hides a Horcrux in the Lestrange vault. This does seem a rather pedestrian place to put something as important as a Horcrux, and Hermione says as much when Harry first mentions that he believes a Horcrux is there. However, Harry points out that only the oldest Wizarding families have vaults in the high-security part of the bank, and so holding a key to one of those vaults is equivalent to claiming ancestry from the oldest of Wizarding families. Voldemort clearly seems to believe that ancestry is of more value than anything else, even the laws of the land, a belief his grandfather [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo]] also espoused, and so the trappings of that heredity, such as access to a Gringotts deep vault, are of almost incalculable value to him.

      <comment>/* C implementation */ add note about non-standard code</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">* This page could use a little bit of test code to demonstrate the algorithms do work on some inputs. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:76.186.105.183|76.186.105.183]] ([[User talk:76.186.105.183|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/76.186.105.183|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

Does anyone recognise the &quot;Teslock&quot; language? I can't find any reference to it aside from this page. [[User:Di Gama|Di Gama]] ([[User talk:Di Gama|talk]]) 23:14, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

Me either. And it's hard to believe a language that absurdly verbose actually exists. Except if it had been invented specifically to cause repetitive strain injury. --[[Special:Contributions/84.184.173.186|84.184.173.186]] ([[User talk:84.184.173.186|talk]]) 06:08, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

The alternative C++ algorithm is wrong.

== Bug in Python implementation ==

The current Python implementation works as follows:

&gt;&gt;&gt; levenshtein('cab','ab')
0

: And I would not call it “pythonic”.  It has an abbreviated name, crams the suite of `if`s into the same line, doesn't have spaces around the `+` operators and has a liner longer than 80 characters.  Poor choice of names and three violations of the style guide (PEP008) in four lines.  Python &quot;culture&quot; favors readability over terseness -- this code snippet does not. --[[User:BlackJack|BlackJack]] ([[User talk:BlackJack|talk]]) 04:57, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

== Ruby implementation == 

The proposed Ruby implementation is awfully slow !
Even unusable...
I've found that : 
http://text.rubyforge.org/classes/Text/Levenshtein.html
Do you think we could take the code since it's MIT licence ?

== Removed VBA example ==

I removed the VBA example - it seems to be a copy of this code, which is copyrighted: http://www.planet-source-code.com/URLSEO/vb/scripts/ShowCode!asp/txtCodeId!71576/lngWid!1/anyname.htm and in addition, it removed the header detailing the author and licensing information. [[Special:Contributions/217.204.106.166|217.204.106.166]] ([[User talk:217.204.106.166|talk]]) 15:27, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

== ABAP implementation ==

ABAP implementation seems to be not working correctly. I am getting wrong results all the time.
Distance &quot;hello&quot; to &quot;hellx&quot; is 4, according to the program...

== C implementation ==

The C implementation is nonstandard.  It uses variables to declare arrays rather than constants, and declares arrays after some executable code.  It could be rewritten to call alloca() and then it would be standard.

Could anyone give an example of how to use the function ?

== C++ implementation ==

It seems wrong. In my opinion it implements the 'Optimal String Alignement' and not the Damerau-Levenshtein, see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau–Levenshtein_distance]].
:If you look a little closer at that reference, it looks like the 'Optimal String Alignment' actually is the Levenshtein distance, with the additional consideration of the transposition distance. The Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm is more complex, and, as you say, it requires the alphabet size... but I'm not sure I understand what it does. Is it just a more efficient (time-wise) algorithm, or is it doing something more? [[User:JoshBowman|JoshBowman]] ([[User talk:JoshBowman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JoshBowman|contribs]]) 07:15, 28 July 2011 (UTC)

The following code does the trick though:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
uint32_t damerau_levenshtein_distance(const std::string &amp;s1, const std::string &amp;s2,
                                      const uint32_t &amp;c)
  {
    const uint32_t len1 = s1.size(), len2 = s2.size();
    uint32_t inf = len1 + len2;
    uint32_t H[len1+2][len2+2];
    H[0][0] = inf;
    for(uint32_t i = 0; i&lt;=len1; ++i) {H[i+1][1] = i; H[i+1][0] = inf;}
    for(uint32_t j = 0; j&lt;=len2; ++j) {H[1][j+1] = j; H[0][j+1] = inf;}
    uint32_t DA[c];
    for(uint32_t d = 0; d&lt;c; ++d) DA[d]=0;
    for(uint32_t i = 1; i&lt;=len1; ++i)
      {
       	uint32_t DB = 0;
	for(uint32_t j = 1; j&lt;=len2; ++j)
          {
	    uint32_t i1	= DA[(int)s2[j-1]];
            uint32_t j1 = DB;  
            uint32_t d = ((s1[i-1]==s2[j-1])?0:1);
            if(d==0) DB = j;
            H[i+1][j+1] = std::min(std::min(H[i][j]+d, H[i+1][j] + 1),
                                   std::min(H[i][j+1]+1,
                                            H[i1][j1] + (i-i1-1) + 1 + (j-j1-1)));
          }
        DA[(int)s1[i-1]] = i;
      }
    return H[len1+1][len2+1];
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

c is the size of the alphabet. I don't know about the other implementations though.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Context switching is the procedure of storing the state of an active process for the CPU when it has to start executing a new one. For example, process A with its address space and stack is currently being executed by the CPU and there is a system call to jump to a higher priority process B; the CPU needs to remember the current state of the process A so that it can suspend its operation, begin executing the new process B and when done, return to its previously executing process A.

Context switches are resource intensive and most operating system designers try to reduce the need for a context switch. They can be software or hardware governed depending upon the CPU architecture.

Context switches can relate to either a process switch, a thread switch within a process or a  register switch. The major need for a context switch arises when CPU has to switch between user mode and kernel mode but some OS designs may obviate it.

A common approach to context switching is making use of a separate stack per switchable entity (thread/process), and using the stack to store the context itself. This way the context itself is merely the stack pointer. For example,

pusha //push all registers
mov OLD_ESP, SAVED_LOCATION
move NEW_ESP, esp
popa

here the act of context switching is done by changing the stack pointer to a new location, and the registers are stored on the stack itself.

You probably worked out, the image up there is an example of counterpoint. Well, counterpoint is ruled by one major thing - cadence. A cadence is a series of intervals that end a section of music. However, cadences can be made to clash, and create what is known as a 'dissonated cadential trill'. There are several types of cadence.

1. Perfect Authentic Cadence. This is chords V to I (e.g.: in C it would be G chord to C chord)

3. Imperfect Authentic Cadence. Similar to a PAC, but the V chord can be a diminished vii in first inversion, or the V or I chords ar inverted. 

5. Half cadence: any cadence ending on V, whether preceded by ii, IV, or I, or any other chord. Because it sounds incomplete or &quot;suspended&quot;, half cadence is considered a weak cadence - the weakest cadence, in fact. A progression of a diminished second in first inversion to V is considered the Phrygian Half Cadence.

6. Plagal cadence: IV to I, also known as the &quot;Amen Cadence&quot; because of its frequent appearance in hymns.

7. Deceptive (or interrupted) cadence: V to any chord except I (typically vi or VI). This is considered a weak cadence because of the &quot;hanging&quot; (suspended) feel it invokes. 

Cadences can also be classified by their rhythmic position. A masculine cadence occurs on a strong position, typically the downbeat of a measure. A feminine cadence occurs in a metrically weak position, for instance, after a long appoggiatura (see also feminine ending). Masculine cadences are considered stronger and are generally of greater structural significance. (To avoid offending those sensitive to sex stereotypes, the Society for Music Theory endorses the terms &quot;metrically accented&quot; and &quot;metrically unaccented cadence&quot; in their Guidelines for Nonsexist Language.)
Likewise, cadences can be classified as either transient (a pause, like a comma in a sentence, which implies that the piece will go on after a brief lift in the voice) and terminal (more conclusive, like the period or other terminal punctuation, which implies that, at least for the time being, we are done). Most transient cadences are half cadences (which stop momentarily on a dominant chord), though IAC or deceptive cadences are also usually transient, as well as Phrygian cadences. Terminal cadences are usually PAC or sometimes plagal (&quot;Amen&quot;) cadences.

Neo-Harmony. You may think it means 'new harmony', which technically it ''should''. However, it in fact represents a certain sequence of notes. It is a sequence in which a certain mode, melody or key is hinted at, but then turned into something else.

S=VI*/2 only if V and I are in peak values. S=VI* if V and I are in rms values.
:Thank you! The article never explained what V and I were so I thought they were the entire functions for voltage and current - very confusing and I was wondering why it was conflicting with my own textbook.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Set theory is the mathematical theory of sets. In naive set theory, sets are introduced and understood using what is taken to be the self-evident concept of sets as collections of objects considered as a whole. In axiomatic set theory, the concepts of sets and set membership are defined indirectly by first postulating certain axioms which specify their properties. In this conception, sets and set membership are fundamental concepts like point and line in Euclidean geometry, and are not themselves directly defined.

Today, when mathematicians talk about set theory as a field, they usually mean axiomatic set theory. Informal applications of set theory in other fields are referred to as applications of naive set theory, but usually are understood to be justifiable in terms of an axiomatic system (normally the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory).

Proofs are arranged in the following sections:
* [[/Zermelo–Fraenkel Set Theory/]]
* [[/Positive Set Theory/]]

== Overview ==

Like Muggle binoculars, '''''omnioculars''''' are designed to allow the viewing of distant events, most especially sporting events.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Being magical, Omnioculars have additional capabilities, such as instant replay, slow motion, and annotation. Watching the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] puts his Omnioculars into slow-motion replay, and sees the action of the game in slow motion, complete with labels for the various maneuvers that the players are carrying out. Harry later comments that he never really understood the Wronsky feint, a technique used by Seekers, until he had seen it at the World Cup; quite possibly he had also used the Omnioculars to slow it down and analyze the moves.

Omnioculars become one of the few points of tension between Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. They are expensive, at 10 [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]] apiece, and Harry immediately buys a set for Ron as well as one for himself. Ron is dismayed at this excess of generosity, and is only mollified by Harry's telling him not to expect anything for Christmas for the next ten years or so. The Irish team mascots, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Leprechaun|Leprechaun]]s, drop gold on the audience at the start of the game, and Ron collects a great lot of it, giving it all to Harry and saying that makes them even. Several months later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is teaching a lesson on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Niffler|Niffler]]s, which hunt for shiny objects, including gold; he says that what he has buried is Leprechaun gold, and it will vanish in a few hours. Thinking about this after class, Ron wonders why Harry had not told him that the gold he had given Harry for the omnioculars had vanished. Harry says that he had not noticed. Dejected, Ron wonders what it would be like to be so rich that he wouldn't even notice when a great lot of gold simply vanished.

== Analysis ==

Omnioculars are a rather amazingly useful device, with their ability to magnify and play back images. One rather wonders why they appear only at the Quidditch World Cup and then are forgotten.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The '''''Order of the Phoenix''''' is a secret society formed with a common goal: to aid in the defeat of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. It is apparently headed up by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], as it is he who directs the remaining members to reform the Order on Voldemort's return. It is unknown why it is called the Order of the Phoenix, though we can surmise that it may have something to do with Dumbledore's pet, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]].

== Event Details ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

While the Order is not mentioned by name at that time, we see it being reorganized at the very end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] has denied that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] could have returned, and leaves, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] requests that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] return to his human shape. He then sends Sirius to gather up &quot;the old crowd: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Arabella Figg]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]],&quot; and then lie low at Lupin's house and wait for instructions. Sirius returns to his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] shape and does so.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

The first time we hear of the Order by name is when the Advance Guard arrives to bring Harry to London, following the Dementor attack. Once in London, Harry is given a note saying that the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix is at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. As he reads the note, which is in Dumbledore's writing, a house appears in front of Harry.

Entering the house, Harry is then taken upstairs, where he meets with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. They say that they had wanted to tell Harry about what was going on, but had been asked not to by Professor Dumbledore. They are joined by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], who together explain what they have learned: the Order is a secret society, secret because Dumbledore is being discredited in the press, as Harry himself is, for daring to say that Voldemort had returned. Despite being in Headquarters, they have learned very little, as the meetings are always closed; all they have really managed to gather is that there is something that is being guarded. Harry points out that this something quite possibly is himself.

About this time, the current meeting ends, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] is seen to leave through the front door. Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys are called down to dinner. At dinner, Harry learns that among the members of the Order are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Emmeline Vance|Emmeline Vance]], who had been part of the Advance Guard that brought him to Grimmauld Place; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] (who owns the house at Grimmauld Place and has donated it to act as Headquarters), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr.]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], their sons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], and one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]]. Charlie is not present; the Order has him recruiting wizards in Romania. Bill has taken a desk job in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]]. Harry has earlier met Mundungus Fletcher, and so knows that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|crazy old Mrs. Figg]] is also working for the Order; and of course we have now seen Snape leaving an Order meeting.

After dinner, Sirius suggests that Harry might have some questions about the Order. Mrs. Weasley immediately objects, saying that he is too young, but is overruled by Lupin, Sirius, and her own husband. She is equally unsuccessful in getting Hermione, Ron, Fred, and George out of the meeting, so eventually simply marches Ginny off to bed. In answer to Harry's questions, the Order members disclose to Harry and the others that the Order is a group of wizards, led by Dumbledore, who agree with Harry and Dumbledore than Voldemort has returned. To Harry's question why Voldemort has not shown himself, we hear that Voldemort is staying hidden, gathering strength in preparation for his return. Lupin also says that Voldemort has a very great disadvantage, in that he had hoped that knowledge of his return would be restricted to his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] only. Thanks to Harry, however, within an hour of his return, that information had reached the one person, Dumbledore, that Voldemort did not want to know about it.

Lupin also discloses that this time, they know that there is something that Voldemort is after, a weapon, but at that point Mrs. Weasley intervenes again, saying that really is enough, and the party breaks up. Later, the Twins mention to Harry and Ron that the bit about the weapon was the only thing they had not already known about.

Over the next few weeks, while Sirius, Hermione, Harry, Mrs. Weasley, and the Weasley children attempt to make Grimmauld Place habitable, several Order members enter and leave the house. One that Harry recognizes is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], who looks very odd in Muggle dress. At one point a little later in the story, Dumbledore also visits, but he apparently does so at a time when Harry will not see him.

Harry must attend a hearing at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] regarding his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|use of magic]] in front of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]. While walking through the ministry with Arthur, Harry notes that Arthur seems to pretend only a casual acquaintance with Kingsley Shacklebolt.

In the party that is held to celebrate the appointment of Ron and Hermione as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]], many Order members return to Grimmauld Place. One of them is Alastor Moody, who shows Harry a photo of the Order as it was the last time Voldemort was in power. Many of the current members of the Order are present, as well as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alice Longbottom|Alice Longbottom]] who had been driven insane, and many who had died, like Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|father]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]].

The Order is not mentioned much through the main body of the book. The individual members of the Order play fairly substantial roles, but until the end of the book, there is little mention of the Order as a group. Sometimes we are told that something is Order business, or, as when the Trio wonder why Arthur Weasley is in the Ministry to be attacked by the snake, we are allowed to watch Harry infer that.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 31|Near the end of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Harry becomes convinced that Voldemort has trapped Sirius Black in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic, and determines that he must find a member of the Order who can communicate with Sirius to find out if Sirius is being tortured. Professor Dumbledore has been driven away from the school, and Professor McGonagall had been hit by multiple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunners]] the previous night and had been sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. Harry attempts to use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]'s fireplace to communicate directly with Sirius by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]], but is caught. It is only when Snape is summoned by Umbridge, to provide a dose of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]], that Harry recalls that Snape is also a member of the Order. Harry's message to Snape seems to go astray, however, and Harry resigns himself to attempting Sirius' rescue alone.

As the rescue attempt turns into an ambush and Harry's fate seems hopeless, however, six members of the Order arrive to counter the ten [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. The resulting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle]] results in the revelation to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] that Voldemort has returned, thus making the Order once again legitimate.

Dumbledore reports later to Harry that Snape had, in fact, checked on Sirius' whereabouts, and had summoned the Order to Harry's rescue when Harry had entered the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] with Umbridge and then not returned.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

With Sirius' death, ownership of the house at Grimmauld Place falls into question. Sirius has left it to Harry in his will, but Dumbledore suspects there may be a magical entail that forces ownership to follow the line of inheritance among the Black children.  This would mean that the house had passed to the next in line among the Black offspring, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Until this is resolved, the house cannot be used as Headquarters of the Order. Dumbledore devises a test that confirms that ownership has passed to Harry. We assume that the house is then used as Headquarters, though we do not visit it during the year. Instead, we see a number of Order members passing through [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]].

We learn that the Order is watching over Hogwarts, supplementing the Ministry wizards who have been given that job and the defensive measures placed on the school itself. Occasionally we see Order members, most notably Tonks, patrolling the halls. In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|final battle]] of the book, we see that none of the defenders of Hogwarts are from the Ministry, with the possible exception of Tonks who is also an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]]. Everyone on the Hogwarts side in that battle is either a member of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], a teacher, or a member of the Order.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

We hear in Voldemort's council that the Order has plans to move Harry away from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] before the date scheduled by the Ministry. Snape tells Voldemort that the Order believes the Ministry has been thoroughly infiltrated by Voldemort's organization and doesn't trust the Ministry to manage the escape. Apparently Snape, now Voldemort's most trusted deputy, is somehow able to retrieve information from the Order.

We next learn of the Order's plan to arrange the safety of the Dursleys and Harry. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]], and cousin Dudley drive off in the company of a pair of Order wizards, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dedalus Diggle|Dedalus Diggle]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hestia Jones|Hestia Jones]]. Meanwhile, thirteen Order members arrive, preparing to be seven protectors each with a Harry Potter simulated by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]], and each pair heading for a different Order safe house. Harry ends up at the house of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. In this battle, the Order suffers two casualties: Alastor Moody is killed when his Potter, Mundungus Fletcher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparates]] out of the path of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]] thrown by Voldemort, and George Weasley loses an ear to a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]] curse cast by Snape. Harry and his escort, Hagrid, crash on their motorcycle, but are healed by the time their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] activates.

As Dumbledore had been the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Secret-Keeper]] for the Order, on his death every Order member becomes a Secret-Keeper for those secrets about the Order to which he had been privy. In particular, this means that the location of Headquarters is almost certainly no longer a secret, as Snape, who is quite obviously now a Death Eater, knew of Headquarters. We hear that the Burrow has become something of a headquarters for the Order, with large numbers of Order members stopping there for dinner frequently.

After leaving The Burrow, there is little mention the Order as a group until Ron's return. At that time, Ron mentions the taboo on Voldemort's name. The effects of the taboo, breaking protective spells and attracting Snatchers to the location of anyone speaking the name, are aimed squarely at the Order, those being the only people who dare to speak Voldemort's name.

As preparations begin for the final [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle at Hogwarts]], Harry is alarmed to find that, not only has Neville summoned Dumbledore's Army to make a stand, but that the Order members are appearing as well. Harry feels that he is acting to drag all these people he cares about into clear and imminent danger, and considers himself responsible. Nonetheless, the Order has decided that this will be where they make their stand, and several start taking active and leadership roles in the defence of the school.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|Snape's memories]], we learn that Snape had remained true to the Order until his death, acting as a double agent. While it was the portrait of Dumbledore that had originated the idea of having decoy Harrys at the escape from Privet Drive, it was Snape's task to get that idea to the Order. Possibly knowing that Mundungus Fletcher would be the member most likely suspected by the Order to have leaked Harry's departure date, and that Voldemort's being unaware of that aspect of the plan would exonerate Fletcher, Snape planted the idea of decoy Harrys in Fletcher's mind.

== Notable Consequences ==

Throughout the course of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', the Ministry's official platform was that Voldemort had not returned. The Order, while it had to operate in secret due to this, provided a group where plans and preparations could be made for Voldemort's reappearance. The order thus provided a seasoned core of individuals who were able to thwart Voldemort's plans to some extent while he was still operating covertly, and were already organized and operational when Voldemort moved back into the open.

The existence of the organization provided a central clearing house where information about Harry's progress in the raid at the Ministry could be tracked. It was because this group existed that Harry was rescued from the ambush.

The following year, in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', the Order seems to be among the few groups which are actively and effectively fighting Voldemort. While the Ministry has accepted Voldemort's return, much of what we see the Ministry doing could be considered &quot;security theatre&quot;, activities being carried out to make the Wizarding world feel safer without actually having much effect on actual safety.

In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', the Ministry comes completely under Voldemort's control, and the Order of the Phoenix is the only organization actively fighting against him. There are other, small pockets of resistance here and there, including the reactivated Dumbledore's Army, but active resistance seems to be centered on the Order.

== Analysis ==

During the entire course of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', the Ministry, in a manner that by design echoes the actions of the government of Britain under Neville Chamberlain in the late 1930s, steadfastly denies the possibility of Voldemort's return. In order to publicly maintain this belief, the government must discredit anyone who suggests they may be wrong. Dumbledore, as such a voice, must be silenced, or at the very least discredited, so that his message will not weaken the government. Because of this, the Order of the Phoenix must work as secretively as Voldemort himself. It is because of this that the Weasley family has split, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] adhering to the Ministry line in what he sees as his only choice to retain his job and possibly gain promotion, while the rest of his family chooses to believe Dumbledore's version of events. The Order's secrecy ends at the same time Voldemort's does; once Voldemort is visibly returned, the Order equally does not have to hide, and though they will remain separate from the Ministry, they work towards the same ends in relative harmony until the Ministry itself falls in the opening chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.

While Harry is the hero of the story, a hero cannot work in a vacuum. Harry must, in the end, stand alone against Voldemort, but as Voldemort has his Death Eaters, so must there be an approximately equally strong organization opposing them. It would be something of an immature belief that this organization would be the government. An adult knows that the government's prime directive is to preserve itself, a tendency that has been shown to us multiple times by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] and the Ministry under his control. It would be equally immature to believe that under Fudge's successor, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]], it would be any more effective. We see, in fact, that the Ministry is looking for some sign of approval from Harry that it can publicize to make their onerous actions more palatable. Given that the Ministry is being shown as ineffective, there must be some group that can take up Harry's banner and assist him against the Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, there is Dumbledore's Army, of course, but none of them can have any skill, individually, that Harry does not, as he is teaching them. The Order of the Phoenix, on the other hand, a group of mature and powerful wizards with the single goal of Voldemort's defeat, provides the background resistance to Voldemort that the Ministry cannot provide. Without the Order or something akin to it, Harry's job would be immeasurably more difficult.

Although Harry is slow to realize it, the Order has a much more direct effect on him as well. Upon hearing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] concerning himself and Voldemort, Harry leaps to the conclusion that the entire battle against Voldemort rests on him. As such, he accepts far more responsibility for the risks others take than he should. In particular, he feels that it is his fault that Voldemort chooses to attack Hogwarts, putting the lives of everyone within in danger, rather than seeing it as purely Voldemort's doing. The Order, by its existence, and by the fact of its existence before Harry was born, acts to remind Harry that there are wizards who, for their own reasons totally separate from Harry, are quite willing to risk their lives in the battle against Voldemort's oppression.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''motion''', also known as a '''proposition''' or '''resolution''' in other formats, is a statement that usually sets the topic for the given debate.  Usually, this is an unambiguously worded statement that is general in terminology in order to be understood by not only the debaters themselves but also by the general audience.

In any debate, the motion is always supported by the government and opposed by the opposition, regardless of how the motion is worded.

==Types of motions==
===Parliamentary debate===
There are three types of motions in any parliamentary debate, depending on how specific or broadly defined it is.  These are known as ''open'', ''semi-closed'' and ''closed'' motions, of whom regardless of the type of motion, the terms are always defined by the Prime Minister.

An ''open motion'' is a motion or resolution that is broad and can be defined quite liberally.  For example, a motion like ''This house would pay'' can be defined on a wide range of topics, from African countries paying their debts to lender countries to paying one's personal debt to a friend to the German government paying compensation for atrocities committed during the Nazi regime.  However, given that open motions are so ambiguously worded that they tend to lead to much confusion among teams and debaters, as well as the propensity for abuse (such as defining the motion based on personal experience), they are rarely given in tournaments today.

A ''semi-closed motion'', like an open motion, is also broad in scope.  However, the context for which the motion is set is more limited than in an open motion.  Such a motion could be worded as ''This house would pay compensation to victims of abuse''.  In such a motion, the terms ''compensation'' and ''victims of abuse'' would still have to be defined, while clearly stating that the motion calls for the compensation of abuse victims.

Lastly, a ''closed motion'', unlike the previous two types of motions, is a motion that is usually specific in scope while still leaving room for interpretation.  For example, ''This house would make Germany compensate victims of Nazi atrocities'' is a closed motion.  In this case, the motion is specifically defined as forcing Germany to compensate victims of Nazi atrocities, although the term ''Nazi atrocities'' is still left to interpretation.

Within those types of motions include ''policy'' and ''value-judgment'' motions, which respectively are about policies and values.  In some cases, these types of motions overlap each other, forming motions that have semblances of both the policy and value-judgment types.  An example of this is ''This house believes that the government should fund exclusively homosexual schools''.  In the motion, while it is worded to that of a value-judgment motion, it also calls for a proposal.

===Policy debate===
In policy debate, a proposition is usually related to that of a closed motion in parliamentary debate.  However, policy debate resolutions are worded as ''Resolved:'' followed by the subject of the debate.  An example would be ''Resolved: That the United States federal government should establish a foreign policy substantially increasing its support of United Nations peacekeeping operations'', which was used in the 2004-2005 National Speech and Debate Tournament of the National Forensics League.  This naming format is also shared with the Oregon-Oxford, Lincoln-Douglas and classical debate formats.

There are generally three types of propositions, namely propositions ''of fact'', ''of value'' and ''of policy''.

A ''proposition of fact'' is an objective statement containing a fact.  It is the most specific and least controversial (although not completely ''free'' of controversy) of the three types of propositions as their verifiability can be objectively affirmed by using other facts or statistics.  An example of this would be ''Resolved: That freedom of speech is an inviolable right''.  Usually, only a few issues are involved in a proposition of fact, which are the following:

#What occurred
#What information is required to verify such
#What information is available

A ''proposition of value'' expresses judgment about the qualities of the person, place or object being pointed to in the proposition.  This would consider current opinions and attitudes of people based on the issue, which are neither true nor false, while still being backed by facts, which are either true or false.  However, debates based on propositions of value can be challenging as there are no set values being defended or detracted in the debate, as well as because personal values always conflict with each other.  An example of this type of proposition would be ''Resolved: That restraint is better than brute force''.

Lastly, a ''proposition of policy'' expresses a course of action that should be considered for adoption.  There are three general categories of propositions of policy:

#Formulation of new policies to guide decisions not covered by existing policies
#Recommendation for the amendment of existing policies that are no longer satisfactory to the given context
#Repeal or abolition of existing policies

In the course of the debate, each team would present their arguments for or against the proposition, of which is usually judged based on the merits of the case.  An example of such a proposition would be ''Resolved: That the United States pull out of Iraq by 2008''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to install PSoC Forth ==

Ingredients:
* A PSoC microcontroller
* A PSoC flash-burner such as the ICE-Cube (it lets you debug, set breakpoints, single-step through your code, etc.) or the MiniProg (costs less).
* A PC that can run PSoC Designer for Windows or the M8Cutils for Linux.

* Create the hex file &quot;psoc_forth.hex&quot;: either
** If you have a Windows box, use PSoC Designer (details below), or
** If you have a Linux box or a Macintosh, use M8Cutils.
** (Both development tools are free downloads.)
* Use the PSoC programmer to burn the hex file into the microcontroller.

== Creating the hex file with M8Cutils ==

&lt;!-- ''Unfinished -- needs work'' --&gt;

One-time install:
* Install the M8Cutils for Linux http://m8cutils.sourceforge.net/.

&lt;!--  ... ''Need more details here'' ...  --&gt;

== Creating the hex file with PSoC designer ==

''Unfinished -- needs work''

One-time install:
* Install PSoC Designer for Windows http://www.cypress.com/psocdesigner.

* Run PSoC Designer to create a new project
** Create new project. New project name: &quot;interactive&quot; (without quotes). Base part: 27443.
** Generate 'Main' file using: Assembler. Finish.
* Download &quot;One Wire User Module&quot; by Wes Randall from http://www.psocdeveloper.com/uploads/media/OneWire_v1.3.3.zip , and install the &quot;OneWireSW&quot; custom user module. ''(FIXME: how?)''
* In the &quot;user module selection view&quot;, choose the &quot;user modules&quot; you might need: (You can select and place one at a time, or select all of them, then place all of them).
** Digital Comm: Uart (double-click on it to create UART_1)
** Temperature: FlashTemp
** Three &quot;SAR6&quot; modules -- rename them &quot;sar1&quot;, &quot;sar2&quot;, and &quot;sar3&quot;.
** One &quot;OneWireSW&quot; module
** One INSAMP -- rename it &quot;amp&quot;.
* In &quot;interconnect view&quot;, place all the user modules (right-click on each one and choose &quot;place&quot;). (The &quot;placed&quot; modules have a thick colored rectangle around them. The ones you haven't placed yet don't have any rectangle or only a thin black rectangle around them.)
* In the &quot;ApplicationEditor&quot; view, hit &quot;Build&quot; (F7).
** You should get the message &quot;0 error(s) 0 warning(s)&quot;.
* Copy the psoc_forth.asm source code into a file &quot;psoc_forth.asm&quot;, in the same directory as the &quot;main.asm&quot; we just created.
* Download [http://download.cypress.com.edgesuite.net/design_resources/application_notes/contents/algorithm___unsigned_multiplication___an2032_13.zip &quot;Algorithm - Unsigned Multiplication - AN2032&quot;] by Dave Van Ess, and extract the file &quot;unsignedmath.inc&quot; and put it in the same directory as &quot;psoc_forth.asm&quot;:
** ''(Um... wouldn't &quot;Algorithm - Signed Multi-Byte Multiplication - AN2038&quot; be better?)''
* In the &quot;ApplicationEditor&quot; view, select Project | Add to project | Files... and select &quot;psoc_forth.asm&quot;.
* In the &quot;ApplicationEditor&quot; view, hit &quot;Build&quot; (F7).
** You should get the message &quot;0 error(s) 0 warning(s)&quot;. ''(FIXME: ... I never got this far ...)''
* Edit the source file &quot;main.asm&quot; and just before the &quot;.terminate&quot;, add the line
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
        jmp start ; start Forth interpreter
&lt;/source&gt;

* In the &quot;ApplicationEditor&quot; view, hit &quot;Build&quot; (F7) to create the hex file.

== Interactive development ==

* Connect serial port on the microcontroller to a terminal. (Perhaps the same PC used above, running a terminal emulator; or a PDA serial port, or a dumb terminal.) &lt;!--  ''need more details''  --&gt;
* ...

== The source ==

David, is this a good technique, wiki-wise, to include changes we've made? - Bill

Sure, that's great.
After I figure out what your changes mean, I'll edit
Wikibooks:PSoC Forth
so it shows only one version -- the latest and greatest.

This latest version still supports all the chips that the original one
ran on, right?
(People can always go to
Wikibooks:PSoC Forth history
to see the original version or any other version).

&quot;What is rp?   Return pointer?&quot;
Yes, it's the pointer to the top of the &quot;return stack&quot;.
Would it be less confusing if we did a search-and-replace to rename it
&quot;RSP&quot;, so we're using the same terminology as Brad Rodriguez and the
FigUK: &quot;The Heart of Forth&quot; articles?

Right now the most mystifying (to me) change is adding &quot;w&quot; to a bunch
of comments -- for example, I see
&quot;;drop ( x -- ) drop TOS&quot;
changed to
&quot;;w drop ( x -- ) drop TOS&quot;
.
Does that &quot;w&quot; mean anything to you?

I found that it is not very practical to try to fit this to the newer 466 chips. The best I could do was to get the newer chips to &quot;emulate&quot; Pforth, which was not very useful. It would be better to start from scratch. Chris Burns

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Regarding wa and ga in one sentence ==
Hello! I saw some changes on [[Japanese/Grammar/Basic Particles]]. What concerned me, was that you changed the part about wa and ga in one sentence. I've not changed it back, since I don't know whether you are a native speaker. However, I did start a discussion on the discussion page there. Maybe you could have a look at it? If you are a native speaker, please explain why you think this is acceptable, because I heard from (other) native speakers that it is NOT acceptable at all and even confusing for Japanese speakers... Thanks for your reaction! Regards, [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 22:04, 29 September 2007 (UTC)

'''Update''': As I clarified on the discussion page of the mentioned module, the given example is indeed an incorrect use of ''wa'' and ''ga'' in one sentence. I will change it into a good example, where both particles are used in one sentence. [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 09:06, 30 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

What was wrong with the style of having the cover as the first page of the book and the table of contents second? Seems rather odd to me for the cover not to be the first page of the book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:46, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

There currently isn't a manual of style for the book, and the main manual of style implements that the cover be as PAGENAME/Cover. Btw, we do need to make a manual of style so that all is understood.
[[User:Extremecircuitz|Extremecircuitz]] 22:49, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

:If you think it would help sure. I think most books haven't really bothered with writing down a specific style for the book or gotten to the point where one was thought to be needed. Having a cover for the main page of a book is much an accepted style as any. I believe whats referred to in [[WB:MOS]] as a title page is different from the covers used by JavaScript and other books. Its by no means describes what the book is about. I would prefer to have the cover page back as the main page of the book. It doesn't really make much sense to have it otherwise. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:40, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

:::I noticed that you moved some pages, but had copy+pasted others when trying to switch pages around. You should avoid copy+pasting when you intended to move pages around, because it causes unintended duplications with the original contribution history missing. I've already gone ahead and fixed pages that I noticed which were done this way. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:57, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

::::Thank you for that. Even though I joined WikiPedia several months ago (recently I joined this wiki) I've never used the move feature, so I'm not sure how to move one page to another and then another page to where that page had been. I don't know how to get rid of the redirect to move another page to that. Am I making sense to you?

== [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] ==

I undid your last edit to this page. &quot;Non-fiction&quot; was the correct word in that sentence, although it is a little ambiguous. What the sentence means to say is that many books which are called &quot;non-fiction&quot; are not instructional and are therefore not textbooks. In other words, we only accept a ''subset'' of all non-fiction books.

Also, all fiction books are prohibited here, not just a subset. It's confusing, to be sure. Can you maybe suggest a wording that would be less confusing? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:37, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

:Oh, okay. Perhaps it could be made a little more explanatory as to the instructionality part? [[User:Extremecircuitz|&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;Extreme&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#330066&quot;&gt;circuitz&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:27, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

==Kana Lessons==

The reasons I removed the links is that they fit the scope of [[v:|wikiversity]] better and indeed the [[v:kana|kana]] page on wikiversity does include links to the various games.--[[User:Balloonguy|Balloonguy]] 19:34, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

==Japanese Mini-tutorial lesson==

Hi! Thank you so much for your work on the mini-lesson. I am trying to learn Japanese but had trouble because what I was given from my teacher was all in Roma&lt;s&gt;n&lt;/s&gt;ji. You will never know how much I really appreciate your efforts. Is Japanese your mother tongue?

Just curious, how many languages do you know?

Best regards,
Iman
:Hi Iman, 
:First of all, no problem at all, ''daijoubu desu''! It's kind of fun doing it and I can also repeat some of the old material. Secondly, this needs to be said, it is not ''Roma'''n'''ji'', but ''rōmaji''. You are not the first one, in fact this is a common mistake that I see all over the internet, unfortunately. So, from now on, please write ''rōmaji'' or ''roomaji'' (in kana: ローマじ, see, there is no ''n''!). If you do want to use a western word, then it's &quot;romanization&quot;. 
:But, I pretent to know it all, I have to be honoust with you, Japanese is not my mother tongue, and I don't even speak it fluently. I do have a Japanese girlfriend and have been studying Japanese for a couple of years now. I saw the effort to make some mini tutorial here in WikiBooks, but also noticed that besides the difficult to read layout, that there were many mistakes. So my hands began to itch... ;-) 
:Anyway, ''Nihongo o ganbatte''! Good luck! (Btw, my mother tongue is Dutch, so I might make some mistakes in English sometimes). [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 19:44, 10 November 2007 (UTC) 
:P.S.: If you need some tips as how to write Japanese on WikiBooks, read this: [[Japanese/Contributor%27s_Guide|Contributor's_Guide]]
Oh, btw, I also have a question for you. Did you write this sentence: ''&quot;Oaidekite arigataku omoimasu.&quot;''??? I was really curious where you got that from. I found it a strange sentence and spoke about this with my girlfriend. She laughed and actually said this is the kind of Japanese that a ''peasant'' would use to the ''Shōgun'' in the Shogunate era... Haha... So I am rather curious where on earth you picked it up! Btw, I removed the sentence and replaced it with &quot;''Douzo yoroshiku o-negai shimasu''&quot;. Much easier and definately much more common. Regards! [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 19:51, 10 November 2007 (UTC)

::Shinjitsu, ben je ernstig? Ik heb nooit dat geweten! Dat past aan erg goed! Ik spreek maar 'n klein beetje Nederlands hoewel ben ik geen Nederlander. Ik ben van Hong Kong afkomst maar sedert 2002 heb ik in Amerika gewoont... ja! Waar kom jij vandaan in Nederland?

::umm... ten opzichte van &quot;''Oaidekite arigataku omoimasu''&quot;, ik denk dat de oorspronkelijke uitdrukking was &quot;'''''Oaidekite ureshi desu'''''&quot;... het is mogelijk dat 'n fout was gemaakt, maar ben ik zeker dat &quot;''Oaidekite ureshi desu''&quot; is niet verkeerd...

::Mooi blijf!
::Iman

:::Wow, careful with those on-line translators! ;-) They do generate a bunch of nonsense too! I think I do understand though. I'll better answer in English... 
:::Hong Kong is cool. Have been there many times and I love it there! Especially the food! ''Oishii desu ne!'' Where I am from? I am from the city of Maastricht (in the south, close to Belgium and Germany), but now I live about 30 km west of Amsterdam. How come you learned (some) Dutch? 
:::Oh, btw, why don't you create an account with Wikibooks? It's easy, it's free... Regards, [[User:Shinjitsu|真実 - ''Shinjitsu'']] [[User_Talk:Shinjitsu|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;To my Talk page!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 06:03, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

::::I was wondering did the Dutch make sense to you? I did not really use a translator but I am still an amateur in Dutch. Hope that didn't bother you too much! I learned Dutch primarily from my friend who lived in the Netherlands in Venlo but is now in America.
::::I am going to create an account right after this post, my account name will be Iman0613.

:::::Haha, no man, it didn't bother me at all. It was just funny, because it looks exactly as if you had run it through an on-line translator... Sorry, I hope I didn't offend you with this? I did understand it, but it is really a &quot;weird&quot; Dutch. Especially the &quot;Mooi blijf!&quot; Where did you get that? Literally it means &quot;Nice, stay!&quot; (like talking to a dog, haha!, don't worry, I am not offended). Anyway, your Dutch is still a lot better than my Cantonese! ;-)
:::::What does the 0613 stand for in your account name??? Btw, you can sign your messages with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; (or simply click the signature button above the text block). It automatically generates your account name and the date and time of the post... In the preferences you can change the format of your name, as I have done, to make it look nicer and more &quot;professional&quot; (I've already been around on Wikipedia (under a different name) for a while). Regards, [[User:Shinjitsu|真実 - ''Shinjitsu'']] [[User_Talk:Shinjitsu|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;To my Talk page!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 06:30, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

::::::Thanks for your ''uitlegging''! About the ''mooi blijf'', my Afrikaner friend always signs off with ''mooi bly'' meaning stay nice, so I thought this also applies in Dutch... now I see that Afrikaans have diverged quite a bit from Dutch since the ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' first landed in Zuid-Afrika!
::::::the 0613 in my username stands for my birthday, which is June 13. About the &quot;''Oaidekite arigataku omoimasu''&quot;, I had first put down &quot;''Oaidekite ureshi desu''&quot; originally, but I think that the latter is more correct than the former. I can try to help with your Cantonese if you want though!
::::::Sorry to get completely off-topic on the Japanese wikibook ''deelpagina'', but would you mind suggesting me what my message in Dutch would have looked like if it is in good Dutch? I would appreciate it a lot! :)
::::::Have a nice day! [[User:Iman0613|Iman0613]] 16:06, 11 November 2007 (UTC)
:Ah, now I see. Yes, &quot;Afrikaans&quot; (as it is called) is a bit different from Dutch, but as long as they (and us) speak slowly, we can understand eachother for about 80-90%. I've been to South Africa a couple of times, but usually help myself with English. They speak too fast in Afrikaans to really understand it fully. Reading Afrikaans is no problem, that is 99% understandable. Just looks funny to us Dutchies.
:I would love to speak Mandarin (instead of Cantonese), but I am already too busy with Japanese to learn more languages. Also Russian is still on my list. I need to live 300 years to do everything I want in my life! ;-)
:''Oaidekite ureshii desu'' is still very formal (I believe ''ureshii'' is with two i's in this case). Not bad, but it's a lot more easy to say &quot;''(Douzo) yoroshiku onegai shimasu.''&quot; This sure is formal enough and easier to pronounce and remember. Almost every Japanese schoolbook/course uses this phrase, so as they say, &quot;do as the Romans do&quot;. 
:About the Dutch part you wrote, you want me to write it in good Dutch. Okay:
::Shinjitsu, meen je dat serieus? Ik heb nooit dat geweten! (Grammatically correct, but in this case better: Dat wist ik niet!) Je past je goed aan! Ik spreek maar 'n klein beetje Nederlands hoewel ik geen Nederlander ben. Ik kom uit Hongkong, maar woon sinds 2002  in Amerika... Ja! Waar kom jij vandaan in Nederland?
::Umm... Met betrekking tot &quot;''Oaidekite arigataku omoimasu''&quot;: ik denk dat de oorspronkelijke uitdrukking &quot;'''''Oaidekite ureshii desu'''''&quot; was... het is mogelijk dat 'n fout was gemaakt, maar ik ben er zeker van dat &quot;''Oaidekite ureshii desu''&quot; niet verkeerd is...
::Groeten! (-&gt;This is quite informal, like English: &quot;Regards!&quot; It's okay to fellow Wikipedians (Wikibookians?) for example. If you want to be more formal, write: &quot;Met vriendelijke groet, Iman&quot; This is similar to &quot;Yours sincerely, Iman&quot;.)
::Iman
:Something like that... Groeten! [[User:Shinjitsu|真実 - ''Shinjitsu'']] [[User_Talk:Shinjitsu|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;To my Talk page!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 16:38, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

== Japanese Wikibook discussion ==

Hi Shinjitsu,

I just added a comment on [[Talk:Japanese#Wow._This_is_a_mess]] which I wanted to draw your attention to as you've been involved in this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:46, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

:Sorry for the veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery late reaction (year and half, mwoah...), but I haven't been active here anymore. Was very busy having a kid in 2008. That absorbs quite a lot of time (and money I might add to that!). Anyway, I agree it was quite a mess back then. Don't know what came out of it now, will have a look at it later (in another year and a half? ;-) ). Regards, [[User:Shinjitsu|真実 - ''Shinjitsu'']] [[User_Talk:Shinjitsu|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;To my Talk page!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 01:42, 6 January 2010 (UTC)

:: No worries, and congratulations on having had a child! For catching up on the latest developments, you can read the [[Japanese/Introduction/About|introduction]] or the [[Talk:Japanese|talk page]]. In a nutshell, the book went from being an attempt at a linear course to a collection of modules. These were categorised on the [[Japanese/Contents|contents]] page and duplicate topics were merged. A whole [[Talk:Japanese/Deletion Archive 1|truckload]] of pages were subsequently deleted. Not much is happening right now. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:27, 6 January 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Roles and Responsibilities ==
Let us decide on the roles and responsibilities for each one of us. As a starting point we are working on the outline of the chapter drafted by Bobby. After the initial research we will be able to come up with a complete outline of what we will include in this chapter.

==UPDATES==
11.27.07

Hey guys,
   I moved the roles and responsibilities section to the top like Dr. G. requested.

Bobby


11.20.07

Hey guys,

I also got through all the material in our section and I'm incredibly relieved.  Our content seems very solid.  As far as your point Naime, I am concerned about being too verbose as well, however I don't want to miss anything either.  I tried to briefly revise minor details here and there and that is why i created an external page for my training section.  But, I think I have a decent balance.  Please let me know if you feel a section is lacking information and if another section contains too much information.  I'm looking forward to our presentation.  Thanks for everything guys.

Bobby

Good job Naime and Bobby..This sections looks great now.
I have finally completed maintaining technology page. I have also read your section and I think its fine. Your table looks fine in my browser and I think its useful and you can keep it. Lets see what others think after we present on Tuesday.

11/16/07

Hi Bobby and Ali,

my other concern is warranties and licensing. i think ali, you have wtitten something on maintenance agreements section. it looks nice, too. 

ali, i have seen your little &quot;i&quot; icon on your section. it looks well, too. 

on the other hand, i have added a table to my section tech. support staff. i thought it would be nice to summarize everything in a table for visual learners.i donot know how it looks on your browser. let me know. i can work on it.However, do not forget my limited ability on HTML.

i am worrying about the heavy text issue. remember, paige has pointed that out about the others presentation. i do not know should i bullet everything. what do you think it is oky with this. 

----

i canoot reach my lehigh e mail account if you want any concern about chapter you can e mail my gamil acoount also.
''thanks ali (i guess)... i have been working onn my chapter hardly. i have a question on your section, when i click maintaining technology, it starts a new page, i am trying to figure that out.i wan to do the same with yours because it looks nicer (i had look to the other groups they are ot starting anew page for each section, i donot know we have to or not, but yours looks nicers and cleare and more organized.)

and also thanks about references... i have just learned it.

and guys, about software support i named this sectiona physical and electronic security. or should it be software supporting.

my other question is where i should talk about warranties...

i havenot got anything form Bobby, yet.''

----


Good job Naime. I just saw what you posted under supporting technology. If you are having difficulty in adding references I can help you here.
______________________

when you need to insert reference just type this &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''your reference source'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
this will be marked as reference and it will added to the bottom of page under reference. 

Did Bobby email Dr.G about the class presentation on our chapter. When is our presentation. 
I am trying to add more to maintaining technology section. I am looking for some graphics and samples to put there.~ali



==='''Maintaining and Supporting technology'''===
I found a  very useful document published by National Center for Educational Statistics. According to this document, we should address the following  when talking about maintenance and support.

*Resources and ideas for establishing support system and tracking maintenance incidents and support calls
*Suggestions for ensuring quality technical support and thorough maintenance.
*Understanding the need to include maintenance and support in new technology purchases, including personnel resources.

== Chapter outline [ first draft ]==

==='''Maintaining'''===

*''Hardware''
*''Software''

==='''Supporting'''===

*''Setting expectations''
*''What is your vision?''
*''How do you plan to ensure achievement of these expectations?''

Ensuring quality, and effectiveness
Solid synergy between education and technology
Starting from nothing
organizing materials used to plan into a presentation
selling how to support technology
technology implementation requires nuturing

==='''Training'''===

* technology staff
* PD for instructional technology 
* explaining uses and applications
* setting rules and boundaries

== Useful Resources ==

Let us list any resources that we find may helpful. List any Websites, books or other documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In November 1918, as the First World War ended, both Germany and Russia found themselves in a common position: severe political weakness and turmoil.  Germany had just been defeated in battle by the Entente Powers; while in Russia, the Bolsheviks under Lenin had taken over the government, igniting a brutal civil war between the Bolsheviks and the Whites, who wished to restore Russia's monarchy.  The next year at Versailles, Britain and France imposed harsh and humiliating peace terms on Germany.  The Kaiser had abdicated, and political factions and free-booting former soldiers battled each other within Germany.  The defeat of Germany and Austria allowed eastern European nations such as Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to gain independence.  Russia was excluded from the Versailles conference and denied a say in the new shape of postwar Europe.

By 1922, Russia's civil conflict had ended with the defeat of the White monarchist forces and the establishment of the Soviet Union.  Germany had also mostly stabilized its internal situation after several years of turmoil, with a democratic government in place.  In postwar Europe, both countries remained potentially powerful but found themselves political outsiders.  As a result, Lenin's government and the German government began to consider cooperation.  Germany's generals, although enemies of Bolshevism, saw in Russia a means of evading the treaty of Versailles, which constrained the size of and arms allowed to the German military.  They could build and test tanks and aircraft within the Soviet Union, away from the prying eyes of Allied inspectors.  The Soviets also saw benefits in such an arrangement, in terms of trade and technology transfer with Germany.

A diplomatic conference was held at Rapallo, Italy, in 1922, where the British and French snubbed German requests.  German and Russian representatives at the conference then began meetings of their own.  When British diplomats learned of these meetings, they understood what was going on, and urgently asked the Germans to re-open talks with them  However, it was too late, as a German-Russian treaty had been already signed.  The Rapallo Treaty opened the door to a decade of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany's Weimar Republic.  Soviet factories built German military equipment, and a generation of German officers trained in Russia and got to know their Soviet counterparts.  When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, the contacts were terminated, not to be restored until the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 which was the opening act of the Second World War.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 1974 a military junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). A constitution was adopted in 1994 and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in 1995. A two and a half year border war with Eritrea ended with a peace treaty on 12 December 2000. Even though the war is over the countries still have animosity towards each other. Final demarcation of the boundary is currently on hold due to Ethiopian objections to an international commission's finding requiring it to surrender sensitive territory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A set is a collection of items which have something in common. 
They are usually designated by upper case letters. 
The members of the set are called elements. 

The number of elements in set A = n(A) or |A|

&lt;math&gt;2\in A&lt;/math&gt;; 2 is an element of set A.

&lt;math&gt;2\not\in C&lt;/math&gt;; 2 is not an element of set C.  

&lt;math&gt;B\subset A&lt;/math&gt;; B is a subset of A which means every element of B is an element of A.
&lt;math&gt;B\not\subset A&lt;/math&gt;; B is not a subset of A. 

U; universal set and varies for each collection under construction. 

&lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; is the empty set and has no elements in it. &lt;math&gt;n(\emptyset) = 0.&lt;/math&gt; 

Operations on Sets: 

&lt;math&gt;A\cap B&lt;/math&gt;; Intersection between sets: elements common to both sets.

&lt;math&gt;A\cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;; A and B are said to be disjoint if they have no common elements. 

&lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt;; The union between the sets A and B is the set of all the elements found in either A or B. 

The complement of set A is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not found in A. A’ or  . *Note: the complementation must be done in the context of the universal set. 

For sets A and B;
&lt;math&gt;n(A\cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A\cap B)&lt;/math&gt;

Venn Diagrams: 

The relationship between sets and the operations performed on them can be represented graphically by using Venn Diagrams. 

In Venn Diagrams, rectangles are usually used to represent universal sets and sets are usually defined on them represented by shaded circles or ovals. 

Complement of a set: 

Complement of set A is the set of all elements in the universal set NOT set A; A’ or  .

Subsets: 

Every element of a subset is also in the set. 
The set itself is also considered a subset. The empty set is also considered a subset. 

Rules:

n(AB) = n(A) + n(B) – n(A  B)

n(ABC) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) – n(A  B) – n(A  C) – n(B  C) + n(A  B  C)

&lt;big&gt;Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma&lt;/big&gt;


==[[Radiation_Oncology/NHL/Treatment_high_grade|Diffuse Large B-Cell]]==
*'''GELA LNH93-4''' (France) (1993-2002) -- CHOP x4 vs. CHOP x4 + RT
**Randomized. ''Stopped early after no difference on interim analysis and new evidence showing Rituximab benefit.'' 576 patients. Age &gt;60, localized Stage I-II aggressive lymphoma, IPI 0. Arm 1) CHOP x4 alone vs. Arm 2) IF-RT 40 Gy (involved nodes/extranodal + adjuacent uninvolved nodes)
**'''7-year update, 2007''' PMID 17228021 -- &quot;CHOP alone compared with CHOP plus radiotherapy for localized aggressive lymphoma in elderly patients: a study by the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte.&quot; (Bonnet C, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Mar 1;25(7):787-92.)
***5-year EFS: CHOP 61% vs. CHOP/RT 64% (NS). Survival affected by Stage II and male sex
***Relapses: CHOP local 47%, distal 37%, both 16%; CHOP-RT in-field 21%, out-of-field 66%, both 13%
***Second cancers: 29 (14%); 9 in CHOP alone vs. 20 in CHOP-RT
***Subset analysis (49 patients) showed no benefit to RT in bulky disease either (small #)
***Conclusion: No advantage to adding RT
**Comment: As a result of this study and GELA93-1, GELA abandoned RT in first line treatment of localized aggressive lymphoma. CHOP-R is used instead
**Editorial PMID 17228015 -- &quot;Role of radiation therapy in localized aggressive lymphoma.&quot; (Ng AK, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Mar 1;25(7):757-9.)

*'''GELA LNH93-1''' (France)(1993-2000) -- ACVBP vs. CHOP x3 + RT
**Randomized. 647 patientss, &lt;61 years, localized Stage I or II aggressive lymphoma (Working Formulation: diffuse mixed, diffuse large (80%), or immunoblastic; or anaplastic according to Kiel), no age-adjusted IPI adverse features. Stage I 67%, extranodal involvement 49%, bulky disease 73%. Arm 1) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|CHOP]] x 3 + involved-field RT vs Arm 2) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|ACVBP]] plus sequential chemo consolidation (MTX, leucovorin, etoposide, ifosfamide, Ara-C). RT one month after last cycle of CHOP, 39.6 Gy. Involved field was involved nodal group and adjacent uninvolved nodes.
**'''5-years; 2005''' PMID 15788496  - &quot;ACVBP versus CHOP plus Radiotherapy for Localized Aggressive Lymphoma.&quot; (Reyes F, N Engl J Med. 2005 Mar 24;352(12):1197-205.) Median F/U 7.7 years
***Outcome: 5-year EFS ACVBP 82% vs CHOP-RT 74% (SS), true for both bulky and non-bulky subsets; OS 90% vs 81% (SS)
***Conclusion: In younger patients, ACVBP + consolidation is better than CHOP x3 + RT
**Comment:  ACVBP arm used higher doses of doxorubicin and cytoxan with higher dose intensity than CHOP and used a consolidation phase with different drugs not used during induction. 

*'''National Medical Center, Mexico''' (1989-97) -- Residual disease: RT vs. Observation
**Randomized. 166 patients, DLBCL, high-intermediate/high clinical risk, with residual disease (&lt;5 cm mass) after chemotherapy. Arm 1) RT 30/20 vs Arm 2) observation. 
**'''2005''' PMID 16260856 &amp;mdash; &quot;Residual disease after chemotherapy in aggressive malignant lymphoma: the role of radiotherapy.&quot; (Aviles A, Med Oncol. 2005;22(4):383-7.) Median F/U 13.5 years
***Outcome: 10-yr PFS RT 86% vs observation 32% (SS). Of 57 relapses in the observation arm, 31 were in the site of initial residual disease, 23 disseminated. 10-year OS 89% vs 58% (SS).
***Conclusion: Salvage RT improves outcome in patients with residual disease after chemotherapy

*'''SWOG 8736''' (1988-1995) -- CHOP x8 vs CHOP x3 + RT
**Randomized. 401 patients, intermediate/high grade (Working Formulation), Stage I-IE, or non-bulky (&lt;=10 cm) II/II-E. 67% Stage I, 73% IPI 0-1. Arm 1) CHOP x 8 vs Arm 2) CHOP x 3 + involved field RT. RT dose was 40 Gy, with a boost to 50 Gy for residual disease (majority received 45-50 Gy)
**'''5-years; 1998''' PMID 9647875 &amp;mdash; &quot;Chemotherapy alone compared with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy for localized intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&quot; (Miller TP, N Engl J Med. 1998 Jul 2;339(1):21-6.)
***Outcome: 5-yr PFS CHOP-RT 77% vs CHOP 64% (SS), OS 82% vs 72% (SS). PFS by IPI: 0-1 77%, 2 60%, 3 34%
***Toxicity: 2 deaths (CHOP arm neutropenia, RT arm RILD), Grade 4 CHOP 40% vs. RT 30% (p=0.06)
***Conclusion: CHOP x3 + RT superior to CHOP x8
**'''8-years; 2001''' &lt;u&gt;Abstract&lt;/u&gt; &quot;CHOP Alone Compared to CHOP Plus Radiotherapy for Early Stage Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas: Updated of the SWOG Randomized Trial.&quot; (Miller TP, Blood 98: 724A, 2001, abstr 3024.) Median F/U 8.2 years
***Outcome: 7-year FFS curves overlap (NS), 9-year OS curves overlap (NS). Continuous decline, with no plateau 
***By risk factors (age &gt;60, elevated LDH, PS &gt;1, Stage II): 5-year OS no RFs 94%, 1 RF 71%, 3 RFs 50%
***Conclusion: Excess late (&gt;5 years) relapses and deaths in CHOPx3-RT arm negate initial benefit. CHOPx3 + RT remains best standard treatment for Stage I and non-bulky Stage II, but optimal treatment may include more/different systemic chemo
**'''Histology; 2004''' [http://abstracts.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/11/3263 ASH Abstract] -- &quot;Histologic Subtypes Do Not Confer Unique Outcomes in Early-Stage Lymphoma: Long-Term Follow-Up of SWOG 8736.&quot; (Spier CM, Blood (ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts) 2004 104: Abstract 3263)
***Outcome: 10-year OS and FFS no difference, no survival plateau. No difference by histology. Only 1 CNS failure (in a patient with testis involvement; none in Burkitt's Lymphoma)
***Conclusion: Histology should not be used to exclude early stage intermediate/high grade patients 
**Comment: Trial was trying to address if addition of RT can reduce amount of chemo required. Results from the abstract update suggest that 3 cycles of CHOP are insufficient, even in this reasonably low risk population, due to higher rate of late (&gt;5 years) failures

*'''ECOG 1484''' (1984-1992) - CHOP x 8 + RT vs CHOP x8 
**Randomized. 352 patients, 172 assessable for +/- RT. Diffuse aggressive lymphoma (Working Formulation: diffuse large cell (80%), diffuse mixed large cell and small cell, and diffuse small cleaved cell). Stage I with risk factors (mediastinal or retroperitoneal involvement; or bulky disease &gt; 10 cm), Stage IE, Stage II-IIE (68%). Patients in CR after 8 cycles of CHOP were randomized to Arm 1) 30 Gy involved-field RT vs Arm 2) observation. If PR, 40 Gy.  
**'''6-years; 2004''' PMID 15210738 &amp;mdash; &quot;Chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy in limited-stage diffuse aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study 1484.&quot; (Horning SJ, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Aug 1;22(15):3032-8. Epub 2004 Jun 21.) Median F/U for CR patients 12 years
***CHOP x8 outcome: 69% assessable. CR 71% (n=172 assesable for +/- RT), PR 29% (treated with RT). Most patients with Stage II bulky disease had PR
***RT randomization outcome (n=172): 6-year DFS RT 73% vs. control 56% (SS, p=0.05). 10-year OS 68% vs. 65% (NS)
***RT boost outcome (n=71): 31% CR rate, median OS 9.9 years. Overall, 10-year DFS 78% for all patients treated with chemo + RT
***Conclusion: After CHOP x8, low-dose RT provided better local control and DFS, with no impact on OS

==Mantle Cell==
*'''GLSG''' (Germany) -- '''CHOP +/- Rituxan'''
**Randomized. 122 untreated patients, advanced-stage MCL. Treated with Arm 1) CHOP vs. Arm 2) R-CHOP. Patients &lt;=65 with CR/PR second randomization to ASCT vs. IFN-alpha. Patients &gt;65 received IFN-alpha maintenance
**'''2005''' PMID 15668467 -- &quot;Immunochemotherapy with rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone significantly improves response and time to treatment failure, but not long-term outcome in patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma: results of a prospective randomized trial of the German Low Grade Lymphoma Study Group (GLSG).&quot; (Lenz G, J Clin Oncol. 2005 Mar 20;23(9):1984-92.)
***Outcome: R-CHOP better for CR (34% vs. 7%, SS), and TTF (21 months vs. 14 months, SS), but no difference in PFS or OS
***Conclusion: Better response rate, but no diffference in PFS or OS

**316 pts. Phase III. Stage I NHL of Waldeyer's ring. Randomized to extended-field RT alone, chemotherapy alone (CHOP or CHOP-like), or combined therapy with chemo + RT. 
**Median f/u 6.8 yrs. CR in 93%, 87%, 97%. 5-yr FFS 48%, 45%, 83% (SS); OS 56%, 58%, 90% (SS).

== Overview ==

'''''Andrew Kirke''''' is a Beater on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Jack Sloper|Jack Sloper]], he takes over for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

In the last meeting of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] before Christmas, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]] tells Harry that they have finally managed to get replacement Beaters. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alicia Spinnet|Alicia Spinnet]] says the new beaters are Andrew Kirke and Jack Sloper, and that they are nowhere as good as Fred and George, but were the best of a very bad lot. 

On February 14th, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] says that he can't go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] because Angelina wants a full day's practice. Ron is sceptical that it will help, because Sloper and Kirke are even worse than he is.

The following weekend, in the match against Ravenclaw, it is mentioned that one of the low points of the game is Kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Zacharias Smith|Zacharias Smith]] zooms towards him with the Quaffle.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When try-outs happen, Kirke is passed over; the new Beaters are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Jimmy Peakes|Jimmy Peakes]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ritchie Coote|Ritchie Coote]].

== Religious comments not appropriate here ==

This page is generally pretty well written and is a nice introduction for the beginner. However the sentence that reads &quot;Is calculus then perhaps a manifestation of some divine ordering of the universe?&quot; is totally out of place here. Asking the question whether calculus is indication of the existence of a supernatural being has no place in an article teaching calculus. It is a point of view.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would not call those non-points 'balls', but rather 'discs'. Especially since 'ball' means sphere in the next chapter ('Lines').

==Plane shapes==
I am going to change back &quot;plane shapes&quot; to something like balls, discs or circles.  I think it is bad enough to have an informal discussion of limits for elementary school students, we shouldn't push toward generality at this point.  If the &quot;limit&quot; of one particular shape suffices we should stick to it.  

Also, It is also not clear to me that any plane figure would do, at least with the definition I think of as the limit of a sequence of sets in the plane.  But this point is kind of irrelevant, since it probably wouldn't come up again in ones education until measure theory.

== A typo detected ==

In the paragraph:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;When we name a point, we always use an uppercase letter. Often we will use P for &quot;point&quot; if we can, and if have more than one dot, we will work our way through the alphabet and use Q, R, and so on. However, nowadays many people &lt;u&gt;'''with'''&lt;/u&gt; start with any letter they like, although the P still remains the best way.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
the underlined bold word should be removed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And good work!!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like to select specific structures within an XML document.  You would like to use a language that is consistent across all W3X XML Standards.  This language is XPath.

== Sample Input File ==

Put this file in '''/db/apps/training/data/books.xml'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;books&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;A list of books useful for people first learning how to build web XML web applications.&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;book&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;XQuery&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;author&gt;Priscilla Walmsley&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;This book is a highly detailed, through and complete tour of the W3C Query language.  It covers all the
        key aspects of the language as well as&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;format&gt;Trade press&lt;/format&gt;
        &lt;license&gt;Commercial&lt;/license&gt;
        &lt;list-price&gt;49.95&lt;/list-price&gt;
    &lt;/book&gt;
    &lt;book&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;XQuery Examples&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;author&gt;Chris Wallace&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;author&gt;Dan McCreary&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;This book provides a variety of XQuery example programs and is designed to work with the eXist open-source native XML application server.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;format&gt;Wiki-books&lt;/format&gt;
        &lt;license&gt;Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0 Attribution-Non-commercial&lt;/license&gt;
        &lt;list-price&gt;29.95&lt;/list-price&gt;
    &lt;/book&gt;
    &lt;book&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;XForms Tutorial and Cookbook&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;author&gt;Dan McCreary&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;This book is an excellent guide for anyone that is just beginning to learn the XForms standard.  The book
        is focused on providing the reader with simple, but complete examples of how to create XForms web applications.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;format&gt;Wikibook&lt;/format&gt;
        &lt;license&gt;Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0 Attribution-Non-commercial&lt;/license&gt;
        &lt;list-price&gt;29.95&lt;/list-price&gt;
    &lt;/book&gt;
    &lt;book&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;XRX: XForms, Rest and XQuery&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;author&gt;Dan McCreary&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;This book is an overview of the key architectural and design patters.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;format&gt;Wikibook&lt;/format&gt;
        &lt;license&gt;Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0 Attribution-Non-commercial&lt;/license&gt;
        &lt;list-price&gt;29.95&lt;/list-price&gt;
    &lt;/book&gt;
&lt;/books&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

XPath provides a number of functions and axes to move around an XML structure.

== Sample Test XQuery Script ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
Here is a sample XQuery &quot;driver&quot; for these tests.  To use it just replace the function after the '''return''' on the last line.
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
let $books := doc('/db/apps/training/data/books.xml')

return count($books//book)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Screen Image of XQuery Results in oXygen ==

There are several ways to test your XPath expressions.  On of the most useful is to put you XML test data in document within eXist and then use a tool such as oXygen to execute the test on the server but then display the results in the oXygen results window.  This can be done within oXygen by setting up eXist (not the default internal Saxon) as your &quot;transformation scenario&quot;.

The following is a screen image of how these results look when viewed with the oXygen IDE:

[[File:Oxygen-xquery-screen-image.png‎|screen image of XQuery execution in oXygen IDE]]

== Sample XPath Expressions ==

Return the entire data file

   $books

Get just books and all the data for each book.

   $books//book

Get all the book titles

   $books//title

Get the collection description

   $books/description/text()

Get the descriptions for all the books

   $books//book/description/text()

=== Counting and Math ===

Count the number of books using a absolute path

   count($books/book)  (: should return 4 :)

Count the number of books using '''//'''.  With eXist executes much faster on larger collections.

   count($books//book) (: should return 4 :)

Get a sequence of all the titles in the book collection.

   $books//title/text()

Calculate the total and average price of all the books in the collection.

   sum($books//list-price/text())  (: Should return a number such as 139.84 :)
   avg($books//list-price/text())  (: Should return a number such as 34.96 :)
   min($books//list-price/text())  (: Should return a number such as 29.95 :)
   max($books//list-price1/text())  (: Should return a number such as 44.99 :)

The following scripts show some of these functions and axes in use.

=== Adding Predicates ===
A '''predicate''' is a qualifier that is added to the end of an XPath expression.  It is usually used to filter out nodes from result set.  Predicates are similar to WHERE constructs in SQL.

   $books//book[format='Wikibook']

Get just the titles of the wikibooks

   $books//book[format='Wikibook']/title/text()

Get all the books that contain the word: 'XQuery&quot; somewhere in the title

   $books//book[contains(title, 'XQuery')]/title/text()

=== Complex Predicates ===

# node()
# text()
# *
# string(..)
# data(..)
# child::
# parent::
# following-sibling::
# preceding-sibling::
# descendant::
# descendant-or-self

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

I saw your [[Old English]] book. It's looking good so far, but it seems like you could use some help with the formatting. The first tip i can give you is to not indent your paragraphs. When you do that, the formatting gets a little strange. Make sure your paragraphs do not start with a tab or a space. 

Also, the pages in your book should be named &quot;BOOK/PAGE&quot;, not &quot;BOOK:PAGE&quot; (notice the forward slash in place of the colon). This is a small issue and I can go through and fix it if you would like. Let me know what you need on [[User talk:Whiteknight|my user talk page]], and I can help you out.

==Overview==
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Alveoli with blood supply.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 9.1''': Alveoli with blood supply]]
Animals require a supply of energy to survive. This energy is needed to build large molecules like proteins and glycogen, make the structures in cells, move chemicals through membranes and around cells, contract muscles, transmit nerve impulses and keep the body warm. Animals get their energy from the large molecules that they eat as food. Glucose is often the energy source but it may also come from other carbohydrates, as well as fats and protein.
The energy is made by the biochemical process known as '''cellular respiration''' that takes place in the '''mitochondria''' inside every living cell.

The overall reaction can be summarised by the word equation given below.

'''Charbohydrate Food (glucose) + Oxygen = Carbon Dioxide + Water + energy'''

As you can see from this equation, the cells need to be supplied with '''oxygen''' and '''glucose''' and the waste product, '''carbon dioxide''', which is poisonous to cells, needs to be removed. The way the digestive system provides the glucose for cellular respiration will be described in Chapter 5 (???), but here we are only concerned with the two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, that are involved in cellular respiration. These gases are carried in the blood to and from the tissues where they are required or produced. 

Oxygen enters the body from the air (or water in fish)and carbon dioxide is usually eliminated from the same part of the body. This process is called '''gas exchange'''. In fish gas exchange occurs in the gills, in land dwelling vertebrates lungs are the gas exchange organs and frogs use gills when they are tadpoles and lungs, the mouth and the skin when adults.

Mammals (and birds) are active and have relatively high body temperatures so they require large amounts of oxygen to provide sufficient energy through cellular respiration. In order to take in enough oxygen and release all the carbon dioxide produced they need a very large surface area over which gas exchange can take place. The many minute air sacs or '''alveoli''' of the lungs provide this. When you look at these under the microscope they appear rather like bunches of grapes covered with a dense network of fine capillaries (see diagram 9.1). A thin layer of water covers the inner surface of each alveolus. There is only a very small distance -just 2 layers of thin cells - between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the capillaries. The gases pass across this gap by '''diffusion'''.

==Diffusion And Transport Of Oxygen==
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals cs of an alveolus.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 9.2''': Cross section of an alveolus]]
The air in the alveoli is rich in oxygen while the blood in the capillaries around the alveoli is deoxygenated.  This is because the haemoglobin in the red blood cells has released all the oxygen it has been carrying to the cells of the body. Oxygen diffuses from high concentration to low concentration. It therefore crosses the narrow barrier between the alveoli and the capillaries to enter the blood and combine with the haemoglobin in the red blood cells to form '''oxyhaemoglobin'''.

The narrow diameter of the capillaries around the alveoli means that the blood flow is slowed down and that the red cells are squeezed against the capillary walls. Both of these factors help the oxygen diffuse into the blood (see diagram 9.2).

When the blood reaches the capillaries of the tissues the oxygen splits from the haemoglobin molecule. It then diffuses into the tissue fluid and then into the cells.
{{clear}}

==Diffusion And Transport Of Carbon Dioxide==
Blood entering the lung capillaries is full of carbon dioxide that it has collected from the tissues. Most of the carbon dioxide is dissolved in the plasma either in the form of '''sodium bicarbonate''' or '''carbonic acid'''. A little is transported by the red blood cells.
As the blood enters the lungs the carbon dioxide gas diffuses through the capillary and alveoli walls into the water film and then into the alveoli. Finally it is removed from the lungs during breathing out (see diagram 9.2). (See chapter 8 for more information about how oxygen and carbon dioxide are carried in the blood).

==The Air Passages==
When air is breathed in it passes from the nose to the alveoli of the lungs down a series of tubes (see diagram 9.3). After entering the nose the air passes through the '''nasal cavity''', which is lined with a moist membrane that adds warmth and moisture to the air as it passes. The air then flows through the '''pharynx''' or throat, a passage that carries both food and air, to the '''larynx''' where the voice-box is located. Here the passages for food and air separate again. Food must pass into the oesophagus and the air into the windpipe or '''trachea'''. To prevent food entering this, a small flap of tissue called the '''epiglottis''' closes the opening during swallowing (see chapter 11). A reflex that inhibits breathing during swallowing also (usually) prevents choking on food.

The trachea is the tube that ducts the air down the throat. Incomplete rings of cartilage in its walls help keep it open even when the neck is bent and head turned. The fact that acrobats and people that tie themselves in knots doing yoga still keep breathing during the most contorted manoeuvres shows how effective this arrangement is. The air passage now divides into the two '''bronchi''' that take the air to the right and left lungs before dividing into smaller and smaller '''bronchioles''' that spread throughout the lungs to carry air to the alveoli. Smooth muscles in the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles adjust the diameter of the air passages.

The tissue lining the respiratory passages produces''' mucus''' and is covered with minute hairs or '''cilia.''' Any dust that is breathed into the respiratory system immediately gets entangled in the mucous and the cilia move it towards the mouth or nose where it can be coughed up or blown out.

==The Lungs And The Pleural Cavities==
[[File:The respiratory system.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 9.3''': The respiratory system]]
The lungs fill most of the chest or '''thoracic cavity''', which is completely separated from the abdominal cavity by the '''diaphragm'''. The lungs and the spaces in which they lie (called the '''pleural cavities)''' are covered with membranes called the '''pleura'''. There is a thin film of fluid between the two membranes. This lubricates them as they move over each other during breathing movements.

===Collapsed Lungs===
The pleural cavities are completely airtight with no connection with the outside and if they are punctured by accident (a broken rib will often do this), air rushes in and the lung collapses. Separating the two lungs is a region of tissue that contains the oesophagus, trachea, aorta, vena cava and lymph nodes. This is called the '''mediastinum'''. In humans and sheep it separates the cavity completely so that puncturing one pleural cavity leads to the collapse of only one lung. In dogs, however, this separation is incomplete so a puncture results in a complete collapse of both lungs.

==Breathing==
[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Inspiration &amp; expiration.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 9.4a''': Inspiration; '''Diagram 9.4b''': Expiration]]
The process of breathing moves air in and out of the lungs. Sometimes this process is called '''respiration''' but it is important not to confuse it with the chemical process, '''cellular respiration''', that takes place in the mitochondria of cells. Breathing is brought about by the movement of the diaphragm and the ribs.

===Inspiration===
The diaphragm is a thin sheet of muscle that completely separates the abdominal and thoracic cavities. When at rest it domes up into the thoracic cavity but during breathing in or '''inspiration''' it flattens. At the same time special muscles in the chest wall move the ribs forwards and outwards. These movements of both the diaphragm and the ribs cause the volume of the thorax to increase. Because the pleural cavities are airtight, the lungs expand to fill this increased space and air is drawn down the trachea into the lungs (see diagram 9.4a).

===Expiration===
'''Expiration''' or breathing out consists of the opposite movements. The ribs move down and in and the diaphragm resumes its domed shape so the air is expelled (see diagram 9.4b). Expiration is usually passive and no energy is required (unless you are blowing up a balloon).

===Lung Volumes===
[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Lung volumes.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 9.5''': Lung volumes]]
As you sit here reading this just pay attention to your breathing. Notice that your in and out breaths are really quite small and gentle (unless you have just rushed here from somewhere else!). Only a small amount of the total volume that your lungs hold is breathed in and out with each breath. This kind of gentle “at rest” breathing is called '''tidal breathing''' and the volume breathed in or out (they should be the same) is the '''tidal volume''' (see diagram 9.5). Sometimes people want to measure the volume of air inspired or expired during a minute of this normal breathing. This is called the '''minute volume'''. It could be estimated by measuring the volume of one tidal breath and then multiplying that by the number of breaths in a minute.
Of course it is possible to take a deep breath and breathe in as far as you can and then expire as far as possible. The volume of the air expired when a maximum expiration follows a maximum inspiration is called the '''vital capacity''' (see diagram 9.5).

===Composition Of Air===
The air animals breathe in consists of 21% oxygen and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Expelled air consists of 16% oxygen and 4.4% carbon dioxide. This means that the lungs remove only a quarter of the oxygen contained in the air. This is why it is possible to give someone (or an animal) artificial respiration by blowing expired air into their mouth.

Breathing is usually an unconscious activity that takes place whether you are awake or asleep, although, humans at least, can also control it consciously. Two regions in the hindbrain called the '''medulla oblongata''' and '''pons''' control the rate of breathing. These are called '''respiratory centres'''. They respond to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. When this concentration rises during a bout of activity, for example, nerve impulses are automatically sent to the diaphragm and rib muscles that increase the rate and the depth of breathing. Increasing the rate of breathing also increases the amount of oxygen in the blood to meet the needs of this increased activity.

===The Acidity Of The Blood And Breathing===
The degree of acidity of the blood (the '''acid-base balance)''' is critical for normal functioning of cells and the body as a whole. For example, blood that is too acidic or alkaline can seriously affect nerve function causing a coma, muscle spasms, convulsions and even death.
Carbon dioxide carried in the blood makes the blood acidic and the higher the concentration of carbon dioxide the more acidic it is. This is obviously dangerous so there are various mechanisms in the body that bring the acid-base balance back within the normal range. Breathing is one of these homeostatic mechanisms. By increasing the rate of breathing the animal increases the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide that is expelled from the blood. This reduces the acidity of the blood.

===Breathing In Birds===
Birds have a unique respiratory system that enables them to respire at the very high rates necessary
for flight. The lungs are relatively solid structures that do not change shape and size in the same way as mammalian lungs do. Tubes run through them and connect with a series of air sacs situated in the thoracic and abdominal body cavities and some of the bones. Movements of the ribs and breastbone or sternum expand and compress these air sacs so they act rather like bellows and pump air through the lungs. The evolution of this extremely efficient system of breathing has enabled birds to migrate vast distances and fly at altitudes higher than the summit of Everest.

==Summary==
* Animals need to breathe to supply the cells with oxygen and remove the waste product c'''arbon dioxide'''.
* The lungs are situated in the '''pleural cavities''' of the '''thorax'''.
* '''Gas exchange''' occurs in the '''alveoli''' of the lungs that provide a large surface area. Here oxygen  diffuses from the alveoli into the red blood cells in the capillaries that surround the alveoli. Carbon dioxide, at high concentration in the blood, diffuses into the alveoli to be breathed out.
* '''Inspiration''' occurs when muscle contraction causes the ribs to move up and out and the diaphragm to flatten. These movements increase the volume of the pleural cavity and draw air down the respiratory system into the lungs.
* The air enters the nasal cavity and passes to the '''pharynx''' and '''larynx''' where the '''epiglottis''' closes the opening to the lungs during swallowing. the air passes down the trachea kept open by rings of cartilage to the '''bronchi''' and '''bronchioles''' and then to the alveoli.
* '''Expiration''' is a passive process requiring no energy as it relies on the relaxation of the muscles and recoil of the elastic tissue of the lungs.
* The rate of breathing is determined by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. As carbon dioxide makes blood acidic, the rate of breathing helps control the '''acid/base balance''' of the blood.
* The cells lining the respiratory passages produce mucus which traps dust particles, which are wafted into the nose by cilia.

      <comment>using erl 5.7.4 you use -record, not -define to define a record, not sure about other versions.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Records in Erlang are syntactic sugar for tagged tuples. The functionality is provided by the preprocessor, not the compiler, so there are some interesting restrictions on how you use them and their support functions.


== Defining Records ==

 -record(myrecord, {first_element, second_element}).

The code above defines a record called ''myrecord'' with two elements: &quot;first_element&quot; and &quot;second_element&quot;. From now on we can use the record syntax '''#myrecord{}'''.

== Equivalent to Tuples ==

Records are syntactic sugar for tuples.

 #myrecord{first_element=foo, second_element=bar} =:= {myrecord, foo, bar}.
 #myrecord{} =:= {myrecord, undefined, undefined}.

The record we defined with two fields is equivalent to a tuple with a tag ''(the name of the record)'' and as many elements as the record has fields -- two, in our case.

==Objectives==
After completing this section, you should know:
* the function of the lymphatic system
* what the terms tissue fluid, lymph, lymphocyte and lymphatic mean
* how lymph is formed and what is in it
* the basic structure and function of a lymph node and the position of some important lymph nodes in the body
* the route by which lymph circulates in the body and is returned to the blood system
* the location and function of the spleen, thymus and lacteals

==Lymphatic System==
When '''tissue fluid''' enters the small blind-ended '''lymphatic capillaries''' that form a network between the cells it becomes '''lymph'''. Lymph is a clear watery fluid that is very similar to blood plasma except that it contains large numbers of white blood cells, mostly '''lymphocytes'''. It also contains protein, cellular debris, foreign particles and bacteria. Lymph that comes from the intestines also contains many fat globules following the absorption of fat from the digested food into the lymphatics ('''lacteals''') of the villi (see chapter 11 for more on these). From the lymph capillaries the lymph flows into larger tubes called '''lymphatic vessels.''' These carry the lymph back to join the blood circulation (see diagrams 10.1 and 10.2).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Capillary bed with lymphatic capilaries.jpg]]




Diagram 10.1 - A capillary bed with lymphatic capillaries

===Lymphatic vessels===
Lymphatic vessels have several similarities to veins. Both are thin walled and return fluid to the right hand side of the heart. The movement of the fluid in both is brought about by the contraction of the muscles that surround them and both have valves to prevent backflow. One important difference is that lymph passes through at least one '''lymph node''' or gland before it reaches the blood system (see diagram 10.2). These filter out used cell parts, cancer cells and bacteria and help defend the body from infection.



Lymph nodes are of various sizes and shapes and found throughout the body and the more important ones are shown in diagram 10.3. They consist of lymph tissue surrounded by a fibrous sheath. Lymph flows into them through a number of incoming vessels. It then trickles through small channels where white cells called '''macrophages''' (derived from '''monocytes''') remove the bacteria and debris by engulfing and digesting them (see diagram 10.4). The lymph then leaves the lymph nodes through outgoing vessels to continue its journey towards the heart where it rejoins the blood circulation (see diagrams 10.2 and 10.3).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Lymphatic system.jpg]]

Diagram 10.2 - The lymphatic system

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Circulation of lymph w major lymph nodes.jpg]]

Diagram 10.3 - The circulation of lymph with major lymph nodes

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Lymph node.jpg]]

Diagram 10.4 - A lymph node

As well as filtering the lymph, lymph nodes produce the white cells known as '''lymphocytes'''. Lymphocytes are also produced by the '''thymus''', '''spleen''' and '''bone marrow'''. There are two kinds of lymphocyte. The first attach invading micro organisms directly while others produce '''antibodies''' that circulate in the blood and attack them.

The function of the lymphatic system can therefore be summarized as transport and defense. It is important for returning the fluid and proteins that have escaped from the blood capillaries to the blood system and is also responsible for picking up the products of fat digestion in the small intestine. Its other essential function is as part of the immune system, defending the body against infection.

===Problems with lymph nodes and the lymphatic system===
During infection of the body the lymph nodes often become swollen and tender because of their increased activity. This is what causes the swollen ‘glands’ in your neck during throat infections, mumps and tonsillitis. Sometimes the bacteria multiply in the lymph node and cause inflammation.
Cancer cells may also be carried to the lymph nodes and then transported to other parts of the body where they may multiply to form a secondary growth or '''metastasis'''. The lymphatic system may therefore contribute to the spread of cancer. Inactivity of the muscles surrounding the lymphatic
vessels or blockage of these vessels causes tissue fluid to ‘back up’ in the tissues resulting in swelling or '''oedema'''.

==Other Organs Of The Lymphatic System==
The '''spleen''' is an important part of the lymphatic system. It is a deep red organ situated in the abdomen caudal to the stomach (see diagram 10.3). It is composed of two different types of tissue. The first type makes and stores lymphocytes, the cells of the immune system. The second type of tissue destroys worn out red blood cells, breaking down the haemoglobin into iron, which is recycled, and waste products that are excreted. The spleen also stores red blood cells. When severe blood loss occurs, it contracts and releases them into the circulation.

The '''thymus''' is a large pink organ lying just under the sternum (breastbone) just cranial to the heart (see diagram 10.1). It has an important function processing lymphocytes so they are capable of recognising and attacking foreign invaders like bacteria.

Other lymph organs are the '''bone marrow''' of the long bones where lymphocytes are produced and '''lymph nodules''', which are like tiny lymph nodes. Large clusters of these are found in the wall of the small intestine (called Peyer’s Patches) and in the tonsils.

==Summary==
* Fluid leaks out of the thin walled capillaries as they pass through the tissues. This is called '''tissue fluid'''.
* Much of tissue fluid passes back into the capillaries. Some enters the blind-ended lymphatic capillaries that form a network between the cells of the tissues. This fluid is called '''lymph'''.
* Lymph flows from the '''lymphatic capillaries''' to '''lymph vessels''', passing through '''lymph nodes''' and along the thoracic duct to join the blood system.
* Lymph nodes filter the lymph and produce '''lymphocytes'''.
* Other organs of the lymphatic system are the '''spleen, thymus, bone marrow''', and '''lymph nodules'''.

==Objectives==
After completing this section, you should know:
* what is meant by the terms: ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation, egestion, peristalsis and chyme
* the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of a herbivorous, carnivorous and omnivorous diet
* the 4 main functions of the gut
* the parts of the gut in the order in which the food passes down it

==The Gut And Digestion==
Plant cells are made of organic molecules using energy from the sun. This process is called '''photosynthesis'''. Animals rely on these ready-made organic molecules to supply them with their food. Some animals (herbivores) eat plants; some (carnivores) eat the herbivores.


==Herbivores==
Although '''herbivores''' eat plant material they have a basic problem. Their own digestive enzymes do not break down the large '''cellulose''' molecules in the plant cell walls. '''Micro-organisms''' like bacteria, on the other hand, can break them down. Therefore herbivores employ micro-organisms to do the job for them.

There are two types of herbivore: 
:The first, '''ruminants''' like cattle, sheep and goats, house these bacteria in a special compartment in the enlarged stomach called the '''rumen'''.

:The second group has an enlarged large intestine and caecum, called a '''functional caecum''', occupied
by cellulose digesting micro-organisms. These non-ruminant herbivores include the horse, rabbit and rat.

Even with the help of microorganisms, eating plants still poses problems. Plants are not a good source of nutrients, and herbivores have to eat large quantities of food to obtain all they require. Herbivores like cows, horses and rabbits typically spend much of their day feeding. To give the micro-
organisms access to the cellulose molecules, the plant cell walls need to be broken down. This is why herbivores have teeth that are adapted to crush and grind. Their guts also tend to be lengthy and the food takes a long time to pass through it.

Eating plants does have some advantages. Plants are immobile so herbivores normally have to spend little energy collecting them. This contrasts with the other main group of animals- the carnivores
that often have to chase their prey.

==Carnivores==
'''Carnivorous animals''' like those in the cat and dog families, polar bears, seals, crocodiles and birds of prey catch and eat other animals. They often have to use large amounts of energy finding, stalking, catching and killing their prey. However, they are rewarded by the fact that meat provides a very concentrated source of nutrients. Carnivores in the wild therefore tend to eat distinct meals often with long and irregular intervals between them. Time after feeding is spent digesting and absorbing the food.

The guts of carnivores are usually shorter and less complex than those of herbivores because meat is easier to digest than plant material. Carnivores usually have teeth that are specialised for dealing with flesh, gristle and bone. They have sleek bodies, strong, sharp claws and keen senses of smell, hearing and sight. They are also often cunning, alert and have an aggressive nature.

==Omnivores==
Many animals feed on both animal and vegetable material – they are '''omnivorous.''' Most primates including humans belong to this category as do pigs and rats. Their food is diverse, ranging from plant material to animals they have either killed themselves or scavenged from other carnivores. Omnivores lack the specialised teeth and guts of carnivores and herbivores but are often highly intelligent and adaptable reflecting their varied diet. 

==Treatment Of Food==
Whether an animal eats plants or flesh, the '''carbohydrates''', '''fats''' and '''proteins''' in the food it eats are generally giant molecules (see chapter 1). These need to be split up into smaller ones before they can pass into the blood and enter the cells to be used for energy or to make new cell constituents. 

For example:
:'''Carbohydrates''' like cellulose, starch, and glycogen need to be split into '''glucose''' and other '''monosaccharides''';
:'''Proteins''' need to be split into '''amino acids''';
:'''Fats''' or '''lipids''' need to be split into '''fatty acids''' and '''glycerol'''.

==The Gut==
The '''digestive tract, alimentary canal''' or '''gut''' is a hollow tube stretching from the mouth to the anus. It is the organ system concerned with the treatment of foods.

At the mouth the large food molecules are taken into the gut - this is called '''ingestion'''. They must then be broken down into smaller ones by digestive enzymes - '''digestion''', before they can be taken from the gut into the blood stream - '''absorption'''. The cells of the body can then use these small molecules - '''assimilation'''. The indigestible waste products are eliminated from the body by the act of '''egestion''' (see diagram 11.1).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals From ingestion to egestion.jpg]]

Diagram 11.1 - From ingestion to egestion

The 4 major functions of the gut are:
:1. Transporting the food;
:2. Processing the food physically by breaking it up (chewing), mixing, adding fluid etc.
:3. Processing the food chemically by adding digestive enzymes to split large food molecules into smaller ones.
:4. Absorbing these small molecules into the blood stream so the body can use them.

The regions of a typical mammals gut (for example a cat or dog) are shown in diagram 11.2.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Typical mammalian gut.jpg]]

Diagram 11.2 - A typical mammalian gut

The food that enters the '''mouth''' passes to the '''esophagus''', then to the '''stomach''', '''small intestine''', '''cecum''', '''large intestine''', '''rectum''' and finally undigested material exits at the '''anus'''. The '''liver''' and '''pancreas''' produce secretions that aid digestion and the '''gall bladder''' stores '''bile'''. Herbivores have an appendix which they use for the digestion of cellulose. Carnivores have an appendix but is not of any function anymore due to the fact that their diet is not based on cellulose anymore.

==Mouth==
The mouth takes food into the body. The lips hold the food inside the mouth during chewing and allow the baby animal to suck on its mother’s teat. In elephants the lips (and nose) have developed into the trunk which is the main food collecting tool. Some mammals, e.g. hamsters, have stretchy cheek pouches that they use to carry food or material to make their nests.

The sight or smell of food and its presence in the mouth stimulates the '''salivary glands''' to secrete '''saliva'''. There are four pairs of these glands in cats and dogs (see diagram 11.3). The fluid they produce moistens and softens the food making it easier to swallow. It also contains the enzyme, '''salivary amylase''', which starts the digestion of starch.

The '''tongue''' moves food around the mouth and rolls it into a ball for swallowing. '''Taste buds''' are located on the tongue and in dogs and cats it is covered with spiny projections used for grooming and lapping. The cow’s tongue is prehensile and wraps around grass to graze it.

Swallowing is a complex reflex involving 25 different muscles. It pushes food into the oesophagus and at the same time a small flap of tissue called the '''epiglottis''' closes off the windpipe so food doesn’t go ‘down the wrong way’ and choke the animal (see diagram 11.4). 

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Salivary glands.jpg]]

Diagram 11.3 - Salivary glands

Diagram 11.4 - Section through the head of a dog

==Teeth==
Teeth seize, tear and grind food. They are inserted into sockets in the bone and consist of a crown above the gum and root below. The crown is covered with a layer of '''enamel''', the hardest substance
in the body. Below this is the '''dentine''', a softer but tough and shock resistant material. At the centre of the tooth is a space filled with '''pulp''' which contains blood vessels and nerves. The tooth is cemented into the '''socket''' and in most teeth the tip of the root is quite narrow with a small opening for the blood vessels and nerves (see diagram 11.5).

In teeth that grow continuously, like the incisors of rodents, the opening remains large and these teeth are called '''open rooted teeth'''. Mammals have 2 distinct sets of teeth. The first the '''milk teeth''' are replaced by the '''permanent teeth'''.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Stucture of tooth.jpg]]

Diagram 11.5 - Structure of a tooth

===Types Of Teeth===
All the teeth of fish and reptiles are similar but mammals usually have four different types of teeth.

The '''incisors''' are the chisel-shaped ‘biting off’ teeth at the front of the mouth. In rodents and rabbits the incisors never stop growing (open-rooted teeth). They must be worn or ground down continuously by gnawing. They have hard enamel on one surface only so they wear unevenly and maintain their sharp cutting edge.

The largest incisors in the animal kingdom are found in elephants, for tusks are actually giant incisors. Sloths have no incisors at all, and sheep have no incisors in the upper jaw (see diagram 11.6). Instead there is a horny pad against which the bottom incisors cut.

The '''canines''' or ‘wolf-teeth’ are long, cone-shaped teeth situated just behind the incisors. They are particularly well developed in the dog and cat families where they are used to hold, stab and kill the prey (see diagram 11.7).

The tusks of boars and walruses are large canines while rodents and herbivores like sheep have no (or reduced) canines. In these animals the space where the canines would normally be is called the '''diastema'''. In rodents like the rat and beaver it allows the debris from gnawing to be expelled easily.

The cheek teeth or '''premolars''' and '''molars''' crush and grind the food. They are particularly well developed in herbivores where they have complex ridges that form broad grinding surfaces (see diagram 11.6). These are created from alternating bands of hard enamel and softer dentine that wear at different rates.

In carnivores the premolars and molars slice against each other like scissors and are called '''carnassial''' teeth see diagram 11.7). They are used for shearing flesh and bone.

===Dental Formula===
The numbers of the different kinds of teeth can be expressed in a '''dental formula'''. This gives the numbers of incisors, canines, premolars and molars in '''one half''' of the mouth. The numbers of these four types of teeth in the left '''or''' right '''half of the upper jaw''' are written above a horizontal line and the four types of teeth in the right '''or''' left '''half of the lower jaw''' are written below it.

Thus the dental formula for the sheep is: 
:::::::0.0.3.3
:::::::3.1.3.3

It indicates that in the upper right (or left) '''half''' of the jaw there are no incisors or canines (i.e. there is a '''diastema'''), three premolars and three molars. In the lower right (or left) '''half''' of the jaw are three incisors, one canine, three premolars and three molars (see diagram 11.6).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Sheeps skull.jpg]]

Diagram 11.6 - A sheep’s skull

The dental formula for a dog is: 
:::::::3.1.4.2
:::::::3.1.4.3

The formula indicates that in the right (or left) '''half''' of the upper jaw there are three incisors, one canine, four premolars and two molars. In the right (or left) '''half''' of the lower jaw there are three incisors, one canine, four premolars and three molars (see diagram 11.7).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Dogs skull.jpg]]

Diagram 11.7 - A dog’s skull

==Oesophagus==
The '''oesophagus''' transports food to the stomach. Food is moved along the oesophagus, as it is along the small and large intestines, by contraction of the smooth muscles in the walls that push the food along rather like toothpaste along a tube. This movement is called '''peristalsis''' (see diagram 11.8).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Peristalis.jpg]]

Diagram 11.8 - Peristalsis

==Stomach==
The '''stomach''' stores and mixes the food. Glands in the wall secrete '''gastric juice''' that contains enzymes
to digest protein and fats as well as '''hydrochloric acid''' to make the contents very acidic.
The walls of the stomach are very muscular and churn and mix the food with the gastric juice to form a watery mixture called '''chyme''' (pronounced kime).
Rings of muscle called '''sphincters''' at the entrance and exit to the stomach control the movement of food into and out of it (see diagram 11.9).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Stomach.jpg]]

Diagram 11.9 - The stomach

==Small Intestine==
Most of the breakdown of the large food molecules and absorption of the smaller molecules take place in the long and narrow small intestine. The total length varies but it is about 6.5 metres in humans, 21 metres in the horse, 40 metres in the ox and over 150 metres in the blue whale.

It is divided into 3 sections: the duodenum (after the stomach), jejunum and ileum. The duodenum receives 3 different secretions:
:1) '''Bile''' from the liver;
:2) '''Pancreatic juice''' from the pancreas and
:3) '''Intestinal juice''' from glands in the intestinal wall.

These complete the digestion of starch, fats and protein.
The products of digestion are absorbed into the blood and lymphatic system through the wall of the intestine, which is lined with tiny finger-like projections called '''villi''' that increase the surface area for more efficient absorption (see diagram 11.10).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Wall of small intestine showing villi.jpg]]

Diagram 11.10 - The wall of the small intestine showing villi

==The Rumen==
In ruminant herbivores like cows, sheep and antelopes the stomach is highly modified to act as a “fermentation vat”. It is divided into four parts. The largest part is called the '''rumen'''. In the cow it occupies the entire left half of the abdominal cavity and can hold up to 270 litres. The '''reticulum''' is much smaller and has a honeycomb of raised folds on its inner surface. In the camel the reticulum is further modified to store water. The next part is called the '''omasum''' with a folded inner surface. Camels have no omasum. The final compartment is called the '''abomasum'''. This is the ‘true’ stomach where muscular walls churn the food and gastric juice is secreted (see diagram 11.11).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals The rumen.jpg]]

Diagram 11.11 - The rumen

Ruminants swallow the grass they graze almost without chewing and it passes down the oesophagus
to the rumen and reticulum. Here liquid is added and the muscular walls churn the food. These chambers provide the main fermentation vat of the ruminant stomach. Here bacteria and single-celled animals start to act on the cellulose plant cell walls. These organisms break down the cellulose to smaller molecules that are absorbed to provide the cow or sheep with energy. In the process, the gases methane and carbon dioxide are produced. These cause the “burps” you may hear cows and sheep making.

Not only do the micro-organisms break down the cellulose but they also produce the '''vitamins E, B and K''' for use by the animal. Their digested bodies provide the ruminant with the majority of its protein requirements.

In the wild grazing is a dangerous activity as it exposes the herbivore to predators. They crop the grass as quickly as possible and then when the animal is in a safer place the food in the rumen can be regurgitated to be chewed at the animal’s leisure. This is ‘chewing the cud’ or '''rumination'''. The finely ground food may be returned to the rumen for further work by the microorganisms or, if the particles are small enough, it will pass down a special groove in the wall of the oesophagus straight into the omasum. Here the contents are kneaded and water is absorbed before they pass to the abomasum. The abomasum acts as a “proper” stomach and gastric juice is secreted to digest the protein.

==Large Intestine==
The '''large intestine''' consists of the '''caecum''', '''colon''' and '''rectum'''. The chyme from the small intestine that enters the colon consists mainly of water and undigested material such as cellulose (fibre or roughage). In omnivores like the pig and humans the main function of the colon is absorption of water to give solid faeces. Bacteria in this part of the gut produce vitamins B and K.

The caecum, which forms a dead-end pouch where the small intestine joins the large intestine, is small in pigs and humans and helps water absorption. However, in rabbits, rodents and horses, the caecum is very large and called the '''functional caecum'''. It is here that cellulose is digested by micro-organisms. The '''appendix''', a narrow dead end tube at the end of the caecum, is particularly large in primates but seems to have no digestive function.

==Functional Caecum==
The caecum in the rabbit, rat and guinea pig is greatly enlarged to provide a “fermentation vat” for micro-organisms to break down the cellulose plant cell walls. This is called a '''functional caecum''' (see diagram 11.12). In the horse both the caecum and the colon are enlarged. As in the rumen, the large cellulose molecules are broken down to smaller molecules that can be absorbed. However, the position of the functional caecum after the main areas of digestion and absorption, means it is potentially less effective than the rumen. This means that the small molecules that are produced there can not be absorbed
by the gut but pass out in the faeces. The rabbit and rodents (and foals) solve this problem by eating their own faeces so that they pass through the gut a second time and the products of cellulose digestion can be absorbed in the small intestine. Rabbits produce two kinds of faeces. Softer night-time faeces are eaten directly from the anus and the harder pellets you are probably familiar with, that have passed through the gut twice. 

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Gut of a rabbit.jpg]]

Diagram 11.12 - The gut of a rabbit

==The Gut Of Birds==
Birds’ guts have important differences from mammals’ guts. Most obviously, birds have a '''beak''' instead of teeth. Beaks are much lighter than teeth and are an adaptation for flight. Imagine a bird trying to take off and fly with a whole set of teeth in its head! At the base of the oesophagus birds have a bag-like structure called a '''crop'''. In many birds the crop stores food before it enters the stomach, while in pigeons and doves glands in the crop secretes a special fluid called '''crop-milk''' which parent birds regurgitate to feed their young. The stomach is also modified and consists of two compartments. The first is the true stomach with muscular walls and enzyme secreting glands. The second compartment is the '''gizzard'''. In seed eating birds this has very muscular walls and contains pebbles swallowed by the bird to help grind the food. This is the reason why you must always
supply a caged bird with grit. In birds of prey like the falcon the walls of the gizzard are much thinner and expand to accommodate large meals (see diagram 11.13).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Stomach &amp; small intestine of hen.jpg]]

Diagram 11.13 - The stomach and small intestine of a hen

==Digestion==
During digestion the large food molecules are broken down into smaller molecules by '''enzymes'''. The three most important groups of enzymes secreted into the gut are:
:# '''Amylases''' that split carbohydrates like starch and glycogen into monosaccharides like glucose.
:# '''Proteases''' that split proteins into amino acids.
:# '''Lipases''' that split lipids or fats into fatty acids and glycerol.

Glands produce various secretions which mix with the food as it passes along the gut.

These secretions include:
:# '''Saliva''' secreted into the mouth from several pairs of '''salivary glands''' (see diagram 11.3). Saliva consists mainly of water but contains salts, mucous and salivary amylase. The function of saliva is to lubricate food as it is chewed and swallowed and salivary amylase begins the digestion of starch.
:#  '''Gastric juice''' secreted into the stomach from glands in its walls. Gastric juice contains '''pepsin''' that breaks down protein and hydrochloric acid to produce the acidic conditions under which this enzyme works best. In baby animals rennin to digest milk is also produced in the stomach.
:# '''Bile''' produced by the liver. It is stored in the '''gall bladder''' and secreted into the duodenum via the '''bile duct''' (see diagram 11.14). (Note that the horse, deer, parrot and rat have no gall bladder). Bile is not a digestive enzyme. Its function is to break up large globules of fat into smaller ones so the fat splitting enzymes can gain access the fat molecules.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Liver, gall bladder &amp; pancreas.jpg]]

Diagram 11.14 - The liver, gall bladder and pancreas

==Pancreatic juice==
The '''pancreas''' is a gland located near the beginning of the duodenum (see diagram 11.14). In most animals it is large and easily seen but in rodents and rabbits it lies within the membrane linking the loops of the intestine (the '''mesentery''') and is quite difficult to find. '''Pancreatic juice''' is produced in the pancreas. It flows into the duodenum and contains '''amylase''' for digesting starch, '''lipase''' for digesting fats and '''protease''' for digesting proteins.

==Intestinal juice==
'''Intestinal juice''' is produced by glands in the lining of the small intestine. It contains enzymes for digesting disaccharides and proteins as well as mucus and salts to make the contents of the small intestine more alkaline so the enzymes can work.

==Absorption==
The small molecules produced by digestion are absorbed into the '''villi''' of the wall of the '''small intestine'''. The tiny finger-like projections of the villi increase the surface area for absorption. Glucose and amino acids pass directly through the wall into the blood stream by diffusion or active transport. Fatty acids and glycerol enter vessels of the lymphatic system ('''lacteals''') that run up the centre of each villus.

==The Liver==
The liver is situated in the abdominal cavity adjacent to the diaphragm (see diagrams 2 and 14). It is the largest single organ of the body and has over 100 known functions. Its most important digestive functions are:
:# the production of '''bile''' to help the digestion of fats (described above) and
:# the control of '''blood sugar''' levels

Glucose is absorbed into the capillaries of the villi of the intestine. The blood stream takes it directly to the liver via a blood vessel known as the '''hepatic portal vessel''' or '''vein''' (see diagram 11.15).

The liver converts this glucose into glycogen which it stores. When glucose levels are low the liver can convert the glycogen back into glucose. It releases this back into the blood to keep the level of glucose constant. The hormone '''insulin''', produced by special cells in the '''pancreas''', controls this process.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Control of glucose by the liver.jpg]]

Diagram 11.15 - The control of blood glucose by the liver

Other functions of the liver include:
:3.  making '''vitamin A''',
:4.  making the '''proteins''' that are found in the '''blood plasma''' ('''albumin, globulin''' and '''fibrinogen'''),
:5.  storing '''iron''',
:6.  removing '''toxic substances''' like alcohol and poisons from the blood and converting them to safer substances,
:7.  producing '''heat''' to help maintain the temperature of the body.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Summary of the main functions of the different regions of the gut.jpg]]

Diagram 11.16 - Summary of the main functions of the different regions of the gut

==Summary==
* The '''gut''' breaks down plant and animal materials into nutrients that can be used by animals’ bodies.
* Plant material is more difficult to break down than animal tissue. The gut of '''herbivores''' is therefore longer and more complex than that of '''carnivores'''. Herbivores usually have a compartment (the '''rumen''' or '''functional caecum''') housing micro-organisms to break down the '''cellulose''' wall of plants.
* Chewing by the teeth begins the food processing. There are 4 main types of teeth: '''incisors, canines, premolars''' and '''molars'''. In dogs and cats the premolars and molars are adapted to slice against each other and are called '''carnassial''' teeth.
* '''Saliva''' is secreted in the mouth. It lubricates the food for swallowing and contains an enzyme to break down starch.
* Chewed food is swallowed and passes down the '''oesophagus''' by waves of contraction of the wall called '''peristalsis.''' The food passes to the stomach where it is churned and mixed with acidic '''gastric juice''' that begins the digestion of protein.
* The resulting '''chyme''' passes down the small intestine where enzymes that digest fats, proteins and carbohydrates are secreted. '''Bile''' produced by the liver is also secreted here. It helps in the breakdown of fats. '''Villi''' provide the large surface area necessary for the absorption of the products of digestion.
* In the '''colon''' and '''caecum''' water is absorbed and micro organisms produce some '''vitamin B and K'''. In rabbits, horses and rodents the caecum is enlarged as a '''functional caecum''' and micro-organisms break down cellulose cell walls to simpler carbohydrates. Waste products exit the body via the '''rectum''' and '''anus'''.
* The '''pancreas''' produces '''pancreatic juice''' that contains many of the enzymes secreted into the small intestine.
* In addition to producing bile the liver regulates blood sugar levels by converting glucose absorbed by the villi into glycogen and storing it. The liver also removes toxic substances from the blood, stores iron, makes vitamin A and produces heat.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hello there, I'm &lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;Extreme&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#330066&quot;&gt;circuitz&lt;/font&gt;, and in case you haven't realised, I love &lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;CODING&lt;/font&gt;! I'm also smart. (If you compare me to most people my age) Why use the nick &quot;''Extremecircuitz''?&quot; I have a site by that name. (Not giving the link, I will say it's a ProBoard, my mother won't let me on it now anyway; you'll find out why later) Actually, the name of it is ''xtreme circuitz'', no '''E''' at the start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am currently in 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade, but I know more than some 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders. For example, I found out how to find slope in algebra, and I read ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix'' in two days when I was still only in 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade. My IQ level the last time I took an IQ test was 117, somewhere between 3 and 4 on the scale of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I can currently read, write, and ''think'' (Literally) in [[XHTML]], [[CSS]], and [[JavaScript]]. Remember I told you I have a site? I had one two years before it. (I deleted it though because it in itself was a failure) That site had been a Hogwarts RPG ('''R'''ole-'''P'''lay '''G'''ame) and I had it because I liked Harry Potter. It was the first site I ever made, and at the time I didn't know any code. Eventually I learned the three languages I know today. At the beginning of the summer of '07, I switched from ProBoards to RuneScape, but soon I made a friend on Runescape who had a ProBoard! I still think of it as amazing, and hardly coincidential. I joined my new friend's forum, getting back into JS and CSS (I never forgot html, it's too simple ''to'' forget) and before the middle of summer I made eXtreme Circuitz. I also learned the electronic data languages of binary, Base64, and Hex, respectively. WikiMarkup has been added to my rosetta stone since I joined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I can cook delicous pizza (Better than any so-called fast-food &quot;pizza&quot;), and I also like chess. I won the match that I learned to play chess during, as a matter of fact! I also like Rock 'n Roll and Country. I am learning [[Hebrew]]/[[French]] as of now, switching between the two invariably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I came here as a WikiPedian, and now I go on both projects. I am currently helping take care of the book [[JavaScript]]. Well, that about sums it up!&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Profiling ==

There are a number of profiling libraries available:
* cprof
* eprof
* fprof

Profiling of any kind has a runtime performance penalty - the reason for the different libraries above is their different trade-offs in terms of profiling precision and the performance penalty for using them.

==Objectives==
After completing this section, you should know:
* the parts of the urinary system
* the structure and function of a kidney
* the structure and function of a kidney tubule or nephron
* the processes of filtration, reabsorption, secretion and concentration that convert blood to urine in the kidney tubule
* the function of antidiuretic hormone in producing concentrated urine
* the composition, storage and voiding of normal urine
* abnormal constituents of urine and their significance
* the functions of the kidney in excreting nitrogenous waste, controlling water levels and regulating salt concentrations and acid-base balance
* that birds do not have a bladder

==Homeostasis==
The cells of an animal can only remain healthy if the conditions are just right. The processes that take place in them are upset if the temperature is too high or too low, or if the fluid around or inside them is too acid or alkaline. '''Homeostasis''' is the name given to the processes that help keep the internal conditions constant even when external conditions change. The word means, “staying the same”.

There are a number of organs in the body that play a part in maintaining homeostasis. For example, the skin helps keep the internal temperature of bird and mammals bodies within a narrow range even when the outside temperatures change (see Chapters 5 and 16); the lungs control the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood (see Chapters 8 and 16); the liver and pancreas work together to keep the amount of glucose in the blood within narrow limits (see Chapter 5) and the kidneys regulate the acidity and the concentration of water and salt in the blood (also see Chapter 16). How the kidneys do this will be described later in this chapter.

'''Hormones''' are chemicals that carry messages around the body in the blood and are central to many of the homeostatic processes mentioned above. Their role will be described in more detail in Chapter 16.

==Water In The Body==
Water is essential for living things to survive because all the chemical reactions within a body take place in a solution of water. An animal’s body consists of up to 80% water. The exact proportion depends on the type of animal, its age, sex, health and whether or not it has had sufficient to drink. Generally animals do not survive a loss of more than 15% of their body water.

In vertebrates almost 2/3rd of this water is in the cells ('''intracellular fluid'''). The rest is outside the cells ('''extracellular fluid''') where it is found in the spaces around the cells ('''tissue fluid'''), as well as in the blood and lymph.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Water in the body.jpg]]

Diagram 12.1 - Water in the body

==Maintaining Water Balance==
Animals lose water through their skin and lungs, in the faeces and urine. These losses must be made up by water in food and drink and from the water that is a by-product of chemical reactions. If the animal does not manage to compensate for water loss the dissolved substances in the blood may become so concentrated they become lethal.
To prevent this happening various mechanisms come into play as soon as the concentration of the blood increases. A part of the brain called the '''hypothalamus''' is in charge of these homeostatic processes. The most important is the feeling of thirst that is triggered by an increase in blood concentration. This stimulates an animal to find water and drink it.

The kidneys are also involved in maintaining water balance as various hormones instruct them to produce more concentrated urine and so retain some of the water that would otherwise be lost (see later in this Chapter and Chapter 16).

===Desert Animals===
Coping with water loss is a particular problem for animals that live in dry conditions. Some, like the camel, have developed great tolerance for dehydration. For example, under some conditions, camels can withstand the loss of one third of their body mass as water. They can also survive wide daily changes in temperature. This means they do not have to use large quantities of water in sweat to cool the body by evaporation.

Smaller animals are more able than large ones to avoid extremes of temperature or dry conditions by resting in sheltered more humid situations during the day and being active only at night.

The kangaroo rat is able to survive without access to any drinking water at all because it does not sweat and produces extremely concentrated urine. Water from its food and from chemical processes is sufficient to supply all its requirements.

==Excretion==
Animals need to excrete because they take in substances that are excess to the body’s requirements
and many of the chemical reactions in the body produce waste products. If these substances
were not removed they would poison cells or slow down metabolism. All animals therefore have some means of getting rid of these wastes.

The major waste products in mammals are carbon dioxide that is removed by the lungs, and urea that is produced when excess amino acids (from proteins) are broken down. Urea is filtered from the blood by the kidneys.

==The Kidneys And Urinary System==
The '''kidneys''' in mammals are bean-shaped organs that lie in the abdominal cavity attached to the dorsal wall on either side of the spine (see diagram 12.2). An artery from the dorsal aorta called the '''renal artery''' supplies blood to them and the '''renal vein''' drains them.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Urinary system.jpg]]

Diagram 12.3 - The urinary system

To the naked eye kidneys seem simple enough organs. They are covered by a fibrous coat or capsule
and if cut in half lengthways (longitudinally) two distinct regions can be seen - an inner region or '''medulla''' and the outer '''cortex'''. A cavity within the kidney called the '''pelvis''' collects the urine and carries it to the '''ureter''', which connects with the '''bladder''' where the urine is stored temporarily. Rings of muscle ('''sphincters''') control the release of urine from the bladder and the urine leaves the body through the '''urethra''' (see diagrams 12.3 and 12.4).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Dissected kidney.jpg]]

Diagram 12.4 - The dissected kidney

==Kidney Tubules Or Nephrons==
It is only when you examine kidneys under the microscope that you find that their structure is not simple at all. The cortex and medulla are seen to be composed of masses of tiny tubes. These are called '''kidney tubules''' or '''nephrons''' (see diagrams 12.5 and 12.6). A human kidney consists of over a million of them.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Several kidney tubules or nephrons.jpg]]

Diagram 12.5 - Several kidney tubules or nephrons

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Kidney tubule or nephron.jpg]]

Diagram 12.6 - A kidney tubule or nephron

At one end of each nephron, in the cortex of the kidney, is a cup shaped structure called the ('''Bowman’s''' or '''renal''') '''capsule'''. It surrounds a tuft of capillaries called the '''glomerulus''' that carries high-pressure blood. Together the glomerulus and capsule act as a blood-filtering device (see diagram 12.7). The holes in the filter allow most of the contents of the blood through except the &lt;u&gt;red and white cells&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;large protein molecules&lt;/u&gt;. The fluid flowing from the capsule into the rest of the kidney tubule is therefore very similar to blood plasma and contains many useful substances like water, glucose, salt and amino acids. It also contains waste products like '''urea'''.

===Processes Occurring In The Nephron===
After entering the glomerulus the filtered fluid flows along a coiled part of the tubule (the '''proximal convoluted tubule''') to a looped portion (the '''Loop of Henle''') and then to the '''collecting tube''' via a second length of coiled tube (the '''distal convoluted tubule''') (see diagram 12.6). From the collecting
ducts the urine flows into the '''renal pelvis''' and enters the '''ureter'''.

Note that the glomerulus, capsule and both coiled parts of the tubule are all situated in the cortex of the kidney while the loops of Henle and collecting ducts make up the medulla (see diagram 12.5).

As the fluid flows along the proximal convoluted tubule useful substances like glucose, water, salts, potassium ions, calcium ions and amino acids are '''reabsorbed''' into the blood capillaries that form a network around the tubules. Many of these substances are transported by active transport and energy is required.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Filtration in the glomerulus capsule.jpg]]

Diagram 12.7 - Filtration in the glomerulus and capsule

In a separate process, some substances, particularly potassium, ammonium and hydrogen ions, and drugs like penicillin, are actively '''secreted''' into the distal convoluted tubule.

By the time the fluid has reached the collecting ducts these processes of absorption and secretion have changed the fluid originally filtered into the Bowman’s capsule into urine. The main function of the collecting ducts is then to remove more water from the urine if necessary. These processes are summarised in diagram 12.8.

'''Normal urine''' consists of water, in which waste products such as urea and salts such as sodium chloride are dissolved. Pigments from the breakdown of red blood cells give urine its yellow colour.

===The Production Of Concentrated Urine===
Because of the high pressure of the blood in the glomerulus and the large size of the pores in the glomerulus/capsule-filtering device, an enormous volume of fluid passes into the kidney tubules. If this fluid were left as it is, the animal’s body would be drained dry in 30 minutes. In fact, as the fluid flows down the tubule, over 90% of the water in it is reabsorbed. The main part of this reabsorption takes place in the collecting tubes.

The amount of water removed from the collecting ducts is controlled by a hormone called '''antidiuretic hormone (ADH)''' produced by the '''pituitary gland''', situated at the base of the brain. When the blood becomes more concentrated, as happens when an animal is deprived of water, ADH is secreted and causes more water to be absorbed from the collecting ducts so that concentrated urine is produced. When the animal has drunk plenty of water and the blood is dilute, no ADH is secreted and no or little water is absorbed from the collecting ducts, so dilute urine is produced. In this way the concentration of the blood is controlled precisely.

==Water Balance In Fish And Marine Animals==
===Fresh Water Fish===
Although the skin of fish is more or less waterproof, the gills are very porous. The body fluids of fish that live in fresh water have a higher concentration of dissolved substances than the water in which they swim. In other words the body fluids of fresh water fish are '''hypertonic''' to the water (see chapter 3). Water therefore flows into the body by '''osmosis'''. To stop the body fluids being constantly diluted fresh water fish produce large quantities of dilute urine.

===Marine Fish===
Marine fish like the sharks and dogfish have body fluids that have the same concentration of dissolved
substances as the water ('''isotonic''') have little problem with water balance.
However, marine bony fish like red cod, snapper and sole, have body fluids with a lower concentration
of dissolved substances than seawater (they are '''hypotonic''' to seawater). This means that water tends to flow out of their bodies by osmosis. To make up this fluid loss they drink seawater and get rid of the excess salt by excreting it from the gills.

===Marine Birds===
Marine birds that eat marine fish take in large quantities of salt and some only have access to seawater for drinking. Bird’s kidneys are unable to produce very concentrated urine, so they have developed a salt gland. This excretes a concentrated salt solution into the nose to get rid of the excess salt.

==Diabetes And The Kidney==
There are two types of diabetes. The most common is called sugar diabetes or '''diabetes mellitus''' and is common in cats and dogs especially if they are overweight. It is caused by the pancreas secreting
insufficient '''insulin''', the hormone that controls the amount of glucose in the blood. If insulin secretion is inadequate, the concentration of glucose in the blood increases. Any increase in the glucose in the blood automatically leads to an increase in glucose in the fluid filtered into the kidney tubule. Normally the kidney removes all the glucose filtered into it, but these high concentrations swamp this removal mechanism and urine containing glucose is produced. The main symptoms of this type of diabetes are the production of large amounts of dilute urine containing glucose, and excessive thirst.

The second type of diabetes is called '''diabetes insipidus'''. The name comes from the main symptom,
which is the production of large amounts of very dilute and “tasteless” urine. It occurs when the pituitary gland produces insufficient ADH, the hormone that stimulates water re-absorption from the kidney tubule. When this hormone is lacking, water is not absorbed and large amounts of dilute urine are produced. Because so much water is lost in the urine, animals with this form of diabetes can die if deprived of water for only a day or so.

==Other Functions Of The Kidney==
The excretion of urea from the body and the maintenance of water balance, as described above, are the main functions of the kidney. However, the kidneys have other roles in keeping conditions in the body stable i.e. in maintaining homeostasis. These include:
:* controlling the concentration of salt ions (Na+, K+, Cl-) in the blood by adjusting how much is excreted or retained;
:* maintaining the correct acidity of the blood. Excess acid is constantly being produced by the normal chemical reactions in the body and the kidney eliminates this.

==Normal Urine==
Normal urine consists of water (95%), urea, salts (mostly sodium chloride) and pigments (mostly from bile) that give it its characteristic colour.

==Abnormal Ingredients Of Urine==
If the body is not working properly, small amounts of substances not normally present may be found in the urine or substances normally present may appear in abnormal amounts.
:* The presence of '''glucose''' may indicate diabetes (see above).
:* Urine with red blood cells in it is called '''haematuria''', and may indicate inflammation of the kidney,or urinary tract, cancer or a blow to the kidneys.
:* Sometimes free '''haemoglobin''' is found in the urine. This indicates that the red blood cells in the blood have '''haemolysed''' (the membrane has broken down) and the haemoglobin has passed into the kidney tubules.
:* The presence of '''white blood cells''' in the urine indicates there is an infection in the kidney or urinary tract.
:* '''Protein molecules''' are usually too large to pass into the kidney tubule so no or only small amounts of proteins like '''albumin''' is normally found in urine. Large quantities of albumin indicate that the kidney tubules have been injured or the kidney has become diseased. High blood pressure also pushes proteins from the blood into the tubules.
:* '''Casts''' are tiny cylinders of material that have been shed from the lining of the tubules and flushed out into the urine.
:* '''Mucus''' is not usually found in the urine of healthy animals but is a normal constituent of horses’ urine, giving it a characteristic cloudy appearance. 

Tests can be carried out to identify any abnormal ingredients of urine. These tests are normally done by “'''stix'''”, which are small plastic strips with  absorbent ends impregnated with various chemicals. A colour change occurs in the presence of an abnormal ingredient.

==Excretion In Birds==
Birds’ high body temperature and level of activity means that they need to conserve water. Birds therefore do not have a bladder and instead of excreting urea, which needs to be dissolved in large amounts of water, birds produce uric acid that can be discharged as a thick paste along with the feces. This is the white chalky part of the bird droppings that land on you or your car.

==Summary==
* The excretory system consists of paired '''kidneys''' and associated blood supply. '''Ureters''' transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder and the '''urethra''' with associated sphincter muscles controls the release of urine.
* The kidneys have an important role in maintaining '''homeostasis''' in the body. They excrete the waste product urea, control the concentrations of water and salt in the body fluids, and regulate the acidity of the blood.
* A kidney consists of an outer region or '''cortex,''' inner '''medulla''' and a cavity called the '''pelvis''' that collects the urine and carries it to the ureter.
* The tissue of a kidney is composed of masses of tiny tubes called '''kidney tubules''' or '''nephrons'''. These are the structures that make the urine.
* High-pressure blood is supplied to the nephron via a tuft of capillaries called the '''glomerulus'''. Most of the contents of the blood except the cells and large protein molecules filter from the glomerulus into the ('''Bowmans) capsule.''' This fluid flows down a coiled part of the tubule ('''proximal convoluted tubule''') where useful substances like glucose, amino acids and various ions are reabsorbed. The fluid flows to a looped portion of the tubule called the '''Loop of Henle''' where water is reabsorbed and then to another coiled part of the tubule ('''distal convoluted tubule''') where more reabsorbtion and secretion takes place. Finally the fluid passes down the '''collecting duct''' where water is reabsorbed to form concentrated urine.

==Reproductive System==
In biological terms sexual reproduction involves the union of '''gametes''' - the sperm and the ovum - produced by two parents. Each gamete is formed by '''meiosis''' (see Chapter 3). This means each contains only half the chromosomes of the body cells ('''haploid'''). Fertilization results in the joining of the male and female gametes to form a '''zygote''' which contains the full number of chromosomes ('''diploid'''). The zygote then starts to divide by '''mitosis''' (see Chapter 3) to form a new animal with all its body cells containing chromosomes that are identical to those of the original zygote (see diagram 13.1).

Diagram 13.1 - Sexual reproduction

The offspring formed by sexual reproduction contain genes from both parents and show considerable
variation. For example, kittens in a litter are all different although they (usually) have the same mother and father. In the wild this variation is important because it means that when the environment
changes some individuals may be better adapted to survive than others. These survivors pass their “superior” genes on to their offspring. In this way the characteristics of a group of animals
can gradually change over time to keep pace with the changing environment. This “survival of the fittest” or “'''natural selection'''” is the mechanism behind the theory of '''evolution'''.

==Fertilization==
In most fish and amphibia (frogs and toads) fertilisation of the egg cells takes place outside the body. The female lays the eggs and then the male deposits his sperm on or at least near them.

In reptiles and birds, eggs are fertilized inside the body when the male deposits the sperm inside the '''egg duct''' of the female. The egg is then surrounded by a resistant shell, “laid” by the female and the embryo completes its development inside the egg.

In mammals the sperm are placed in the body of the female and the eggs are fertilized internally. They then develop to quite an advanced stage inside the body of the female. When they are born they are fed on milk excreted from the mammary glands and protected by their parents until they become independent.

==Sexual Reproduction In Mammals==
The reproductive organs of mammals produce the '''gametes''' (sperm and egg cells), help them fertilise
and then support the developing embryo.

==The Male Reproductive System==
The male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes that produce '''sperm''' (or''' spermatozoa'''), ducts that transport the sperm to the penis and glands that add secretions to the sperm to make '''semen''' (see diagram 13.2).

The various parts of the male reproductive system with a summary of their functions are shown in diagram 13.3.

[[Image:Male repro system labelled.jpg]]

Diagram 13.2. The reproductive organs of a male dog



[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Diagram summarising the functions of the male reproductive organs.jpg]]

Diagram 13.3 - Diagram summarising the functions of the male reproductive organs

===The Testes===
Sperm need temperatures between 2 to 10 degrees Centigrade lower and  then the body temperature to develop. This is the reason why the testes are located in a bag of skin called the '''scrotal sacs''' (or '''scrotum''') that hangs below the body and where the evaporation of secretions from special glands can further reduce the temperature. In many animals (including humans) the testes descend into the scrotal sacs at birth but in some animals they do not descend until sexual maturity and in others
they only descend temporarily during the breeding season. A mature animal in which one or both testes have not descended is called a '''cryptorchid''' and is usually infertile.

The problem of keeping sperm at a low enough temperature is even greater in birds that have a higher body temperature than mammals. For this reason bird’s sperm are usually produced at night when the body temperature is lower and the sperm themselves are more resistant to heat.

The testes consist of a mass of coiled tubes (the '''seminiferous''' or''' sperm producing tubules''') in which the sperm are formed by meiosis (see diagram 13.4). Cells lying between the seminiferous tubules produce the male sex hormone '''testosterone'''.

When the sperm are mature they accumulate in the '''collecting ducts''' and then pass to the '''epididymis'''before moving to the '''sperm duct''' or '''vas deferens'''. The two sperm ducts join the '''urethra''' just below the bladder, which passes through the '''penis''' and transports both sperm and urine.

'''Ejaculation''' discharges the semen from the erect penis. It is brought about by the contraction of the epididymis,
vas deferens, prostate gland and urethra.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals The testis &amp; a magnified seminferous tubule.jpg]]

Diagram 13.4 - The testis and a magnified seminiferous tubule

===Semen===
Semen consists of 10% sperm and 90% fluid and as sperm pass down the ducts from testis to penis, (accessory) glands add various secretion...

===Accessory Glands===
Three different glands may be involved in producing the secretions in which sperm are suspended, although the number and type of glands varies from species to species.

'''Seminal vesicles''' are important in rats, bulls, boars and stallions but are absent in cats and dogs. When present they produce secretions that make up much of the volume of the semen, and transport
and provide nutrients for the sperm.

The '''prostate gland''' is important in dogs and humans. It produces an alkaline secretion that neutralizes
the acidity of the male urethra and female vagina.

'''Cowper’s glands''' (bulbourethral glands) have various functions in different species. The secretions may lubricate, flush out urine or form a gelatinous plug that traps the semen in the female reproductive system after copulation and prevents other males of the same species fertilizing an already mated female. Cowper’s glands are absent in bears and aquatic mammals.

===The Penis===
The penis consists of connective tissue with numerous small blood spaces in it. These fill with blood during sexual excitement causing erection.

====Penis Form And Shape====
Dogs, bears, seals, bats and rodents have a special bone in the penis which helps maintain the erection (see diagram 13.2). In some animals (e.g. the bull, ram and boar) the penis has an “S” shaped bend that allows it to fold up when not in use. In many animals the shape of the penis is adapted to match that of the vagina. For example, the boar has a corkscrew shaped penis, there is a pronounced twist in bulls’ and it is forked in marsupials like the opossum. Some have spines, warts or hooks on them to help keep them in the vagina and copulation may be extended to help retain the semen in the female system. Mating can last up to three hours in minks, and dogs may “knot” or “tie” during mating and can not separate until the erection has subsided.

===Sperm===
Sperm are made up of three parts: a '''head''' consisting mainly of the nucleus, a '''midpiece''' containing
many mitochondria to provide the energy and a '''tail''' that provides propulsion (see diagram 13.5).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals A sperm.jpg]]

Diagram 13.5 - A sperm

A single ejaculation may contain 2-3 hundred million sperm but even in normal semen as many as 10% of these sperm may be abnormal and infertile. Some may be dead while others are inactive or deformed with double, giant or small heads or tails that are coiled or absent altogether.

When there are too many abnormal sperm or when the sperm concentration is low, the semen may not be able to fertilize an egg and the animal is infertile. Make sure you don’t confuse infertility with impotence, which is the inability to copulate successfully.

Sperm do not live forever. They have a definite life span that varies from species to species. They survive for between 20 days (guinea pig) to 60 days (bull) in the epididymis but once ejaculated into the female tract they only live from 12 to 48 hours. When semen is used for artificial insemination,
storage under the right conditions can extend the life span of some species.

===Artificial Insemination===
In many species the male can be artificially stimulated to ejaculate and the semen collected. It can then be diluted, stored and used to '''inseminate''' females. For example bull semen can be diluted and stored for up to 3 weeks at room temperature. If mixed with an antifreeze solution and stored in “straws” in liquid nitrogen at minus 79&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C it will keep for much longer. Unfortunately the semen of chickens, stallions and boars can only be stored for up to 2 days.

Dilution of the semen means that one male can be used to fertilise many more females than would occur under natural conditions. There are also advantages in the male and female not having to make physical contact. It means that owners of females do not have to buy expensive males and the possibility of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases is reduced. Routine examination of the semen for sperm concentration, quality and activity allows only the highest quality semen to be used so a high success rate is ensured.

Since the lifespan of sperm in the female tract is so short and ova only survive from 8 to 10 hours the timing of the artificial insemination is critical. Successful conception depends upon detecting the time that the animal is “on heat” and when ovulation occurs.

==The Female Reproductive Organs==
The female reproductive system consists of a pair of '''ovaries''' that produce egg cells or '''ova''' and '''fallopian tubes''' where fertilisation occurs and which carry the fertilised ovum to the '''uterus'''. Growth of the foetus takes place here. The '''cervix''' separates the uterus from the '''vagina''' or birth canal, where the sperm are deposited (see diagram 13.6).

[[Image:Female repro system labelled.JPG]]

Diagram 13.6. - The  reproductive system of a female rabbit


Note that primates like humans have a uterus with a single compartment but in most mammals the uterus is divided into two separate parts or '''horns''' as shown in diagram 13.6.

===The Ovaries===
Ovaries are small oval organs situated in the abdominal cavity just ventral to the kidneys. Most animals
have a pair of ovaries but in birds only the left one is functional to reduce weight (see below).

The ovary consists of an inner region ('''medulla''') and an outer region ('''cortex''') containing egg cells or ova. These are formed in large numbers around the time of birth and start to develop after the animal becomes sexually mature. A cluster of cells called the '''follicle''' surrounds and nourishes each ovum.

===The Ovarian Cycle===
The '''ovarian cycle''' refers to the series of changes in the ovary during which the follicle matures, the ovum is shed and the '''corpus luteum''' develops (see diagram 13.7).

Numerous undeveloped ovarian follicles are present at birth but they start to mature after sexual maturity. In animals that normally have only one baby at a time only one ovum will mature at once but in litter animals several will. The mature follicle consists of outer cells that provide nourishment. Inside this is a fluid-filled space that contains the ovum. 

A mature follicle can be quite large, ranging
from a few millimetres in small mammals to the size of a golf ball in large animals. It bulges out from the surface of the ovary before eventually rupturing to release the ovum into the abdominal cavity. Once the ovum has been shed, a blood clot forms in the empty follicle. This develops into a tissue called the '''corpus luteum''' that produces the hormone '''progesterone''' (see diagram 13.9). If the animal becomes pregnant the corpus luteum persists, but if there is no pregnancy it degenerates
and a new ovarian cycle usually.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Ovarian cycle showing from top left clockwise.jpg]]

Diagram 13.7 - The ovarian cycle showing from the top left clockwise: the maturation of the ovum over time, followed by ovulation and the development of the corpus luteum in the empty follicle

===The Ovum===
When the ovum is shed the nucleus is in the final stages of meiosis (cell division). It is surrounded by few layers of follicle cells and a tough membrane called the '''zona pelluc'''ida (see diagram 13.8).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals An ovum.jpg]]

Diagram 13.8 - An ovum

===The Oestrous Cycle===
The '''oestrous cycle''' is the sequence of hormonal changes that occurs through the '''ovarian cycle'''. These changes influence the behaviour and body changes of the female (see diagram 13.9).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals The oestrous cycle.jpg]]

Diagram 13.9 - The oestrous cycle

The first hormone involved in the oestrous cycle is '''follicle stimulating hormone (F.S.H.),''' secreted by the '''anterior pituitary gland''' (see chapter 16). It stimulates the follicle to develop. As the follicle matures the outer cells begin to secrete the hormone '''oestrogen''' and this stimulates the mammary glands to develop. It also prepares the lining of the uterus to receive a fertilised egg. Ovulation is initiated by a surge of another hormone from the anterior pituitary, '''luteinising hormone (L.H.).''' This hormone also influences the development of the corpus luteum, which produces '''progesterone''',
a hormone that prepares the lining of the uterus for the fertilised ovum and readies the mammary
glands for milk production. If no pregnancy takes place the corpus luteum shrinks and the production of progesterone decreases. This causes FSH to be produced again and a new oestrous cycle begins.

For fertilisation of the ovum by the sperm to occur, the female must be receptive to the male at around the time of ovulation. This is when the hormones turn on the signs of “'''heat'''”, and she is “'''in season'''” or “'''in oestrous'''”. These signs are turned off again at the end of the oestrous cycle.



During the oestrous cycle the lining of the uterus ('''endometrium''') thickens ready for the fertilised ovum to be implanted. If no pregnancy occurs this thickened tissue is absorbed and the next cycle starts. In humans and other higher primates, however, the endometrium is shed as a flow of blood and instead of an oestrous cycle there is a '''menstrual cycle'''.

The length of the oestrous cycle varies from species to species. In rats the cycle only lasts 4-5 days and they are sexually receptive for about 14 hours. Dogs have a cycle that lasts 60-70 days and heat lasts 7-9 days and horses have a 21-day cycle and heat lasts an average of 6 days.

'''Ovulation''' is spontaneous in most animals but in some, e.g. the cat, and the rabbit, ovulation is stimulated by mating. This is called '''induced ovulation'''.

===Signs Of Oestrous Or Heat===
:*When on heat a bitch has a blood stained discharge from the '''vulva''' that changes a little later to a straw coloured one that attracts all the dogs in the neighbourhood.
:* Female cats “call” at night, roll and tread the carpet and are generally restless but will “stand” firm when pressure is placed on the pelvic region (this is the lordosis response).
:* A female rat shows the lordosis response when on heat. It will “mount” other females and be more active than normal.
:* A cow mounts other cows (bulling), bellows, is restless and has a discharge from the vulva.

===Breeding Seasons And Breeding Cycles===
Only a few animals breed throughout the year. This includes the higher primates (humans, gorillas and chimpanzees etc.), pigs, mice and rabbits. These are known as '''continuous breeders'''.

Most other animals restrict reproduction to one or two seasons in the year-'''seasonal breeders''' (see diagram 13.10). There are several reasons for this. It means the young can be born at the time (usually spring) when feed is most abundant and temperatures are favourable. It is also sensible to restrict the breeding season because courtship, mating, gestation and the rearing of young can exhaust the energy resources of an animal as well as make them more vulnerable to predators.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Breeding cycles.jpg]]

Diagram 13.10 - Breeding cycles

The timing of the breeding cycle is often determined by day length. For example the shortening day length in autumn will bring sheep and cows into season so the foetus can gestate through the winter
and be born in spring. In cats the increasing day length after the winter solstice (shortest day) stimulates breeding.
The number of times an animal comes into season during the year varies, as does the number of oestrous cycles during each season. For example a dog usually has 2-3 seasons per year, each usually consisting of just one oestrous cycle. In contrast ewes usually restrict breeding to one season
and can continue to cycle as many as 20 times if they fail to become pregnant.

==Fertilisation and Implantation==

===Fertilisation===
The opening of the fallopian tube lies close to the ovary and after ovulation the ovum is swept into its funnel-like opening and is moved along it by the action of cilia and wave-like contractions of the wall.

'''Copulation''' deposits several hundred million sperm in the vagina. They swim through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes moved along by whip-like movements of their tails and contractions of the uterus. During this journey the sperm undergo their final phase of maturation so they are ready to fertilise the ovum by the time they reach it in the upper fallopian tube. 

High mortality means only a small proportion of those deposited actually reach the ovum. The sperm attach to the outer zona pellucida and enzymes secreted from a gland in the head of the sperm dissolve this membrane so it can enter. Once one sperm has entered, changes in the '''zona pellucida''' prevent further sperm from penetrating. The sperm loses its tail and the two nuclei fuse to form a '''zygote''' with the full set of paired chromosomes restored.

===Development Of The Morula And Blastocyst===

As the fertilised egg travels down the fallopian tube it starts to divide by mitosis. First two cells are formed and then four, eight, sixteen, etc. until there is a solid ball of cells. This is called a '''morula'''. As division continues a hollow ball of cells develops. This is a '''blastocyst''' (see diagram 13.11).

===Implantation===
Implantation involves the blastocyst attaching to, and in some species, completely sinking into the wall of the uterus.

==Pregnancy==
===The Placenta And Foetal Membranes===
As the '''embryo''' increases in size, the '''placenta''', '''umbilical cord''' and '''foetal membranes''' (often known collectively as the '''placenta''') develop to provide it with nutrients and remove waste products (see diagram 13.12). In later stages of development the embryo becomes known as a '''foetus'''. 

The placenta is the organ that attaches the foetus to the wall of the uterus. In it the blood of the foetus and mother flow close to each other but never mix (see diagram 13.13). The closeness of the maternal and foetal blood systems allows diffusion between them. Oxygen and nutrients diffuse from the mother’s blood into that of the foetus and carbon dioxide and excretory products diffuse in the other direction. Most maternal hormones (except adrenaline), antibodies, almost all drugs (including alcohol), lead and DDT also pass across the placenta. However, it protects the foetus from infection with bacteria and most viruses.

Diagram 13.11 - Development and implantation of the embryo

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Foetus and placenta.jpg]]

Diagram 13.12. The foetus and placenta

The foetus is attached to the placenta by the '''umbilical cord'''. It contains arteries that carry blood to the placenta and a vein that returns blood to the foetus.
The developing foetus becomes surrounded by membranes. These enclose the amniotic fluid that protects the foetus from knocks and other trauma (see diagram 13.12).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Maternal and foetal blood flow in the placenta.jpg]]

Diagram 13.13 - Maternal and foetal blood flow in the placenta

===Hormones During Pregnancy===
The corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone and oestrogen during pregnancy. These maintain the lining of the uterus and prepare the mammary glands for milk secretion. Later in the pregnancy the placenta itself takes over the secretion of these hormones.

'''Chorionic gonadotrophin''' is another hormone secreted by the placenta and placental membranes.
It prevents uterine contractions before labour and prepares the mammary glands for lactation. Towards the end of pregnancy the placenta and ovaries secrete '''relaxin''', a hormone that eases the joint between the two parts of the pelvis and helps dilate the cervix ready for birth.

===Pregnancy Testing===
The easiest method of pregnancy detection is ultrasound which is noninvasive and very reliable  Later in gestation pregnancy can be detected by taking x-rays. 

In dogs and cats a blood test can be used to detect the hormone '''relaxin'''.   

In mares and cows palpation of the uterus via the rectum is the classic way to determine pregnancy. It can also be done by detecting the hormones '''progesterone''' or '''equine chorionic gonagotrophin''' ('''eCG''')  in the urine. A new sensitive test measures the amount of the hormone, '''oestrone sulphate''', present in a sample of faeces. The hormone is produced by the foal and placenta, and is only present when there is a living foal.

In most animals, once pregnancy is advanced, there is a window of time during which an experienced veterinarian can determine pregnancy by feeling the abdomen. 

===Gestation Period===
The young of many animals (e.g. pigs, horses and elephants) are born at an advanced state of development, able to stand and even run to escape predators soon after they are born. These animals
have a relatively long gestation period that varies with their size e.g. from 114 days in the pig to 640 days in the elephant.

In contrast, cats, dogs, mice, rabbits and higher primates are relatively immature when born and totally dependent on their parents for survival. Their gestation period is shorter and varies from 25 days in the mouse to 31 days in rabbits and 258 days in the gorilla.

The babies of marsupials are born at an extremely immature stage and migrate to the pouch where they attach to a teat to complete their development. Kangaroo joeys, for example, are born 33 days after conception and opossums after only 8 days.

==Birth==
===Signs Of Imminent Birth===
As the pregnancy continues, the mammary glands enlarge and may secrete a milky substance a few days before birth occurs. The vulva may swell and produce thick mucus and there is sometimes
a visible change in the position of the foetus. Just before birth the mother often becomes restless, lying down and getting up frequently. Many animals seek a secluded place where they may build a nest in which to give birth.

===Labour===
Labour involves waves of uterine contractions that press the foetus against the cervix causing it to dilate. The foetus is then pushed through the cervix and along the vagina before being delivered. In the final stage of labour the placenta or “afterbirth” is expelled.

===Adaptations Of The Foetus To Life Outside The Uterus===
The foetus grows in the watery, protected environment of the uterus where the mother supplies oxygen and nutrients, and waste products pass to her blood circulation for excretion. Once the baby animal is born it must start to breathe for itself, digest food and excrete its own waste. To allow
these functions to occur blood is re-routed to the lungs and the glands associated with the gut start to secrete.
Note that newborn animals can not control their own body temperature. They need to be kept warm by the mother, littermates and insulating nest materials.

==Milk Production==
Cows, manatees and primates have two mammary glands but animals like pigs that give birth to large litters may have as many as 12 pairs. Ducts from the gland lead to a nipple or teat and there may be a sinus where the milk collects before being suckled (see diagram 13.14).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals reproduction Mammary gland.jpg]]

Diagram 13.14 - A mammary gland

The hormones '''oestrogen''' and '''progesterone''' stimulate the mammary glands to develop and '''prolactin'''
promotes the secretion of the milk. '''Oxytocin''' from the pituitary gland releases the milk when the baby suckles. The first milk is called '''colostrum'''. It is a rich in nutrients and contains protective antibodies from the mother.
Milk contains fat, protein and milk sugar as well as vitamins and most minerals although it contains little iron. Its actual composition varies widely from species to species. For example whale’s and seal’s milk has twelve times more fat and four times more protein than cow’s milk. Cow’s milk has far less protein in it than cat’s or dog’s milk. This is why orphan kittens and puppies cannot be fed cow’s milk.

==Reproduction In Birds==
Male birds have testes and sperm ducts and male swans, ducks, geese and ostriches have a penis.
However, most birds make do with a small amount of erectile tissue known as a '''papilla'''.
To reduce weight for flight most female birds only have one ovary - usually the left, which produces extremely yolky eggs. The eggs are fertilised in the upper part of the oviduct (equivalent to the fallopian
tube and uterus of mammals) and as they pass down it '''albumin''' (the white of the egg), the membrane beneath the shell and the shell are laid down over the yolk. Finally the egg is covered in a layer of mucus to help the bird lay it (see diagram 13.15).

Most birds lay their eggs in a nest and the hen sits on them until they hatch. Ducklings and chicks are relatively well developed when they hatch and able to forage for their own food. Most other nestlings need their parents to keep them warm, clean and fed. Young birds grow rapidly and have voracious appetites that may involve the parents making up to 1000 trips a day to supply their need for food.

Diagram 13.15 - Female reproductive organs of a bird

==Summary==
* '''Haploid''' gametes (sperm and ova) are produced by meiosis in the '''gonads''' (testes and ovaries).
* Fertilisation involves the fusing of the gametes to form a diploid '''zygote'''.
* The male reproductive system consists of a pair of '''testes''' that produce sperm (or '''spermatozoa'''), ducts that transport the sperm to the penis and glands that add secretions to the sperm to make semen.
* Sperm are produced in the '''seminiferous tubules''', are stored in the '''epididymis''' and travel via the '''vas deferens''' or '''sperm duct''' to the junction of the bladder and the '''urethra''' where various accessory glands add secretions. The fluid is now called '''semen''' and is ejaculated into the female system down the '''urethra''' that runs down the centre of the penis.
* Sperm consist of a head, a midpiece and a tail.
* '''Infertility''' is the inability of sperm to fertilize an egg while '''impotence''' is the inability to copulate successfully.
* The female reproductive system consists of a pair of '''ovaries''' that produce '''ova''' and '''fallopian tubes''' where fertilisation occurs and which carry the fertilised ovum to the '''uterus'''. Growth of the foetus takes place here. The '''cervix''' separates the uterus from the '''vagina''', the birth canal and where the sperm are deposited.
* The '''ovarian cycle''' refers to the series of changes in the ovary during which the follicle matures, the ovum is shed and the '''corpus luteum''' develops.
* The '''oestrous cycle''' is the sequence of hormonal changes that occurs through the ovarian cycle. It is initiated by the secretion of '''follicle stimulating hormone (F.S.H.),''' by the '''anterior pituitary gland''' which stimulates the '''follicle''' to develop. The follicle secretes '''oestrogen''' which stimulates '''mammary gland'''  development. '''luteinising hormone (L.H.)''' from the anterior pituitary initiates '''ovulation''' and stimulates the '''corpus luteum''' to develop. The corpus luteum produces '''progesterone''' that prepares the lining of the uterus for the fertilised ovum.
* '''Signs of oestrous''' or heat differ. A bitch has a blood stained discharge, female cats and rats are restless and show the lordosis response, while cows mount other cows, bellow and have a discharge from the vulva.
* After fertilisation in the fallopian tube the '''zygote''' divides over and over by mitosis to become a ball of cells called a '''morula'''. Division continues to form a hollow ball of cells called the '''blastocyst'''. This is the stage that '''implants''' in the uterus.
* The '''placenta, umbilical cord''' and '''foetal membranes''' (known as the '''placenta''') protect and provide the developing foetus with nutrients and remove waste products.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Main Idea (Reading Comprehension)'''
This global question is a perennial favorite RC question.  It is important you remember not only what the author is saying but why he is saying.  The author is leading you to a certain point.  All the LSAT passages are well-written (if convoluted) and scholar piece of writing.  Though hidden under the loads of difficult ideas and facts, the main idea itself is pretty evident and unequivocal (otherwise the LSAC will have a hard time defending the answer to 100,000 test takers).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reading Comprehension Global Questions require that you have read the entire passage in order to answer the question.  The question tests your skill in seeing the forest not just the tree.  Often the Global questions are easier because there are much more information to work with.

 &amp; \widehat{U_{i}}=Y_{i}-\widehat{Y_{i}} \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Use of &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\beta_{0}&lt;/math&gt; to denote the Y-intercept is solely discretionary.


&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \widehat{\beta _{2}}=\frac{\sum{(Y_{i}-\bar{Y}})(X_{i}-\bar{X})}{\sum{(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}} \\ 
 &amp; \widehat{\beta _{1}}=\bar{Y}-\widehat{\beta _{2}}\bar{X} \\ 
 &amp; Var(\widehat{\beta _{2}})=\frac{\sigma ^{2}}{\sum{(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}} \\ 
 &amp; Var(\widehat{\beta _{1}})=\frac{\sum{X_{i}^{2}}*\sigma ^{2}}{n*\sum{(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}} \\ 
 &amp; \widehat{\sigma ^{2}}=\frac{\sum{\widehat{U_{i}^{2}}}}{n-2} \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

U and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; have both been used to denote the error term.


&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; S_{2}^{2}=\widehat{Var(\widehat{\beta _{2}})}=\frac{\widehat{\sigma ^{2}}}{\sum{(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}} \\ 
 &amp; S_{1}^{2}=\widehat{Var(\widehat{\beta _{1}})}=\frac{\sum{X_{i}^{2}}*\widehat{\sigma ^{2}}}{n*\sum{(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}}} \\ 
 &amp; S.E.(\widehat{\beta _{2}})=\sqrt{\widehat{Var(\widehat{\beta _{2}})}} \\ 
 &amp; S.E.(\widehat{\beta _{1}})=\sqrt{\widehat{Var(\widehat{\beta _{1}})}} \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote a sample variance,  S.E. standard error.


&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; TSS=\sum{(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}} \\ 
 &amp; ESS=\sum{(\widehat{Y_{i}}-\bar{Y})^{2}} \\ 
 &amp; RSS=\sum{\widehat{U_{i}^{2}}} \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

TSS may also be presented as SST for the Total Sum of Squares, ESS as SSE (error) and RSS as SSR (residuals).
Depending on the text, ESS and RSS may become very confusing, as there is great variety in the terminology used.


&lt;math&gt;R^{2}=\frac{ESS}{TSS}=1-\frac{RSS}{TSS}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\log (Y)}=\widehat{\beta _{1}}+\widehat{\beta _{2}}\log (X)&lt;/math&gt;

|previous=How to Do Procedural Landscape Modeling
}}
I worked with a group to make a small animation for class and I was responsible for the environment modeling.  I really liked the results of the process I used, so I decided to share it with others.  By the end of this tutorial you'll have the know-how to create your own flexible, realistic terrain utilizing multiple textures for different ground types.  This tutorial assumes that you have the very basic understanding of using Blender (how to add/remove a mesh, how to change views, etc...)
I use the following textures in this demo.  Feel free to use them if you don't have something on hand to use.

[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Grass.jpg|100px]]

'''NOTE:''' This is not the actual texture I used in this demo.  I couldn't find the original source for the one I used (though I know it was a public image), so to avoid licensing issues I replaced it with one that I did have licensing info on.  Sorry.



__TOC__
==Creating the Canvas==
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Creating_The_Canvas.jpg|200px|right|The grid that will be used to build our landscape.]]
The &quot;canvas&quot; that we'll use for our terrain is an evenly spaced grid of vertices.  Open a new project, delete the default cube, and add a grid mesh.  Use whatever size you want.  The more vertices you have, the more detailed and realistic your landscape will appear, but don't get crazy with it since we'll apply subsurfacing at the end to smooth it out.  At the same time, you do want enough vertices to prevent sharp edges, and we'll need them in the second tutorial when we cover texture stenciling.  So consider how big you want your landscape and try to find a reasonable balance.
I like to start with 100x100.  The grid will be pretty small, so scale the entire thing up, let's say by a factor of 20.  This grid will be used to build our landscape by pulling hills and mountains out of it.

'''Noob Note:''' If you don´t want to have to delete the default cube every time you open a new file, just delete the cube once so you have the blank window (only lamp and camera left) . Then select ''File'' - ''Save default settings'' or hit ''Ctrl+U''. From now on, each new project you create will start off without the cube.

==Molding the Mountains==
The key to making good mountains is using the proportional edit mode ('''OKEY''') and constantly adjusting the radius of influence.  If you've already gone through the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Mountains_Out_Of_Molehills Mountains Out Of Molehills] tutorial then this section will be familiar.  One major difference is that in this tutorial I recommend rotating the 3D view around so you have a good view of all three axes instead of working in the front or sides view.  Using the proportional editing tool affects multiple vertices, and it helps to see what effect your changes are having as you make them.
* Go ahead and turn on proportional editing, either by pressing '''OKEY''' or clicking on the grey ring on the 3D View header.  You have to be in Edit Mode to select this option. Once proportional editing is enabled, the ring will appear orange and a new drop-down menu will appear next to it with different falloff styles.  Select Smooth if it is not already selected.
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Molding_the_Mountains_01.jpg]]
* Select any random vertex and grab it ('''GKEY''').  You will see a ring around the vertex you are grabbing.  This is the radius of influence, and only vertices inside this ring are affected by the transformation.  If you are doing this in the orthographic view from the front, side, or top, then this will be obvious.  But if you're at a view where you can see all three axes, then it may be less obvious.
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Molding_the_Mountains_02.jpg|200px|right|The first mountain created using proportional editing.]]
* Restrict movement to the z-axis ('''ZKEY''') and translate the vertex upward.  Throughout this entire process you ONLY want to translate along the z-axis.  If you start moving vertices in the x or y directions, things become distorted and you get some nasty creases.  Play around with adjusting the size of the radius of influence ('''Mouse Wheel''') to get steeper or flatter hills.

[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Molding_the_Mountains_03.jpg|200px|right|A nice group of hills]]
* Keep repeating this process with different size radii and different heights until you have a decent mountain range, but leave an area flat.  We'll be using that spot later in the second tutorial.  Don't be afraid to occasionally translate some vertices down instead of up to create depressions in the hills.  Remember, variety is the spice of life.  Very few things in nature are naturally geometric, so mix up your hills and especially make sure they overlap.  How often do you see a nice, smooth hill all by itself in nature?
'''Note:''' You'll notice in my screenshot that I have reduced the size of my grid.  For simplicity's sake, I didn't feel like filling an entire 100x100 grid with mountains since this can take some time.

* Well now, that's looking pretty good!  Now, there's one problem with our hills so far.  They're too smooth!  Let's bumpify them a little.  Change the falloff type from Smooth to Random.
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Molding_the_Mountains_04.jpg]]
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Molding_the_Mountains_05.jpg|200px|right|Rougher hills look more realistic]]
* Select a single vertex and grab it ('''GKEY''').  We're still working on the z-axis only, to restrict your movement with the '''ZKEY'''.  Now when you move the vertex up and down, all vertices in the radius of influence will also move but with a random falloff instead of smoothly.  It only takes a little movement to get the effect we want, so something around 0.5-1.0 is enough.  Mix up moving up and down with different vertices, again to add variety to the scene.
* Once you have your landscape the way you like it, add a subsurf modifier under the Editing tab ('''F9''') and select Catmull-Clark.  This will smooth out your terrain a little so that it's not too rough.  Given the number of vertices you already have, it's not necessary to have a higher render value than 1 unless you just REALLY want it to be smooth, but I don't recommend it.  Land is supposed to be bumpy and rocky, we just don't want sharp edges.

'''Noob note:''' If you're making mountains using Random Falloff and the peaks stick up too much: in Edit mode, select the points in the area around the peak using circle select, then press '''WKEY''' and click 'Smooth' until you're satisfied (or, in the Editing tab ('''F9'''), click the 'Smooth' button).

'''Useful Tip''' Proportional editing can be used on multiple vertices simultaneously.  This is especially useful if you're trying to create a cliff face or a river bed.  Use the box tool ('''BKEY''') to select a group of vertices and then translate them.  Keep in mind that the size of the radius of influence determines how many vertices around '''EACH VERTEX''' will be influenced.  So suppose you have a 5 vertex radius, that means that 5 vertices all the way around your selected region will be influenced.

==Texturing the Terrain==
Alright!  We've got some pretty nice hills now!  But there's still a few problems.  Hills shouldn't be white, and hills shouldn't be SHINY!  Let's dress them up a little, shall we?
* With your landscape selected, go to the Shading Panel ('''F5''') and add a new material.
* Under the Shaders tab, drop the Specular value to 0.
* Go to the Texture tab ('''F6''') and add a new texture.  
* In the Texture Type drop down menu, select Image.
* Two new tabs will appear.  In the Image tab, click Load and load a texture from file.
* In the Map Image tab, increase the Xrepeat and Yrepeat.  Depending on the size of your terrain and the image that you use (please use something that tiles!), these values will vary.  I've used 10 for each in this tutorial.
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Texturing_the_Terrain_02.jpg]]

('''Noob note:''' Render the scene (F12) to see the applied texture)
('''Noob note:''' A quicker way to do this is by using the render preview tool, 3d view window - render preview, View--&gt; Render Preview or press '''SHIFT'''--&gt; '''PKEY''')
('''Noob note:''' you may also select shaded in the Viewport Shading menu next to where you select object mode or edit mode to see your texture on your mountains without rendering, however it does slow your computer down some which could make editing frustrating. So only do this if you want to see what your textures look like, then switch back to solid for more editing.)

* Finally, let's do something about the lighting.  Go to Object Mode ('''TAB''') if you're not already there and select the lamp.  Choose the Shading Panel ('''F5''') and then click the icon that looks like a light bulb to display the Lamp buttons. Change the lamp to a sun and up the energy to 1.5.  You may also need to increase the distance if your terrain is large, or rotate it around if you don't like where it's pointing.  The dashed line coming out of the light is the direction.  Play around with different angles and energy values for the sun to get different times of day in your scene.

And there you have it!  Your landscape is now textured with some nice grass to make it look a little more realistic.  Play around with hill sizes and roughness if you're not satisfied with your landscape, but try not to be too picky.  Nature shouldn't look too sculpted. Remember, you won't notice a change in texture unless you render your image. 

'''NOTE'''  If you went with the suggested 100x100 grid, the rendering process could definitely take some time depending on your system, especially if you have ray tracing and shadows enabled.  To boost the rendering speed, go to the Scene panel ('''F10''') and under Rendering, disable the buttons that say '''Shadow''' and '''Ray'''.  Also note that because we've created some hills, your camera may now be under the terrain.  Switch to the camera view ('''NUM0''') to see what your camera sees and move it if you need to.

Join us next time as we explore how to make the landscape look even better using texture stenciling!  And please, if you have any issues with the tutorial, or feedback (positive or negative), drop it in the discussions.  I'll try to keep an eye on it to see what people have to say. - Moohasha

I'm mainly doing this so the hills look better and more realistic. Reading this will consume more time than doing it. I'm making everything clear for beginners. It will only take about 8 minutes more for your hills to end up like this:

[[Image:Blender hills.jpg]]

# First step to achieve it is to switch from the default lamp to Sun. 
## You do this by clicking on the default and go to the shading tab (F5)
## Click on ''Sun''. 
## Go to ''rotate manipulator mode'' with Ctrl Alt R. 
## Rotate the sun until the dotted line is in your desired position. That is where the main energy will go. It will differ if you want to achieve the different time of day. You can make the distance greater or less with ''dist.''. I kept mine at default 30. 
# Now let's make more realistic, paler sunlight. 
## In the RGB slider, set R for 1, G for 1, and B for .848. 
## Set energy for 1.63. This will all differ for different times of day, so set your east and west in your head, and the later into the day, the further the sun to the west and the more orange. For midday, keep the energy on 1.63 and put the sun right above your hills. I set mine for earlier in the morning.
# Now click on the picture of a globe to change the background. 
# Click on the ''blend'' button for a more realistic looking sky. On the left of the World toolbar, that will be the color of lower down in the sky and the right sliders will be the color of the top of the sky. Naturally, the top should be darker blue than the bottom. 
## It will differ for different times of the day. So you might want something different from this. But I set up mine for the morning using the settings below:
##* The left HoRGB sliders to 0.50, 0.68, and 1. 
##* The right ZeRGB sliders to 0.11, 0.25, and 0.66. 
# Now for the texture. ''This'' won't differ for the times of day, but it will differ for what type of landscape you want. 
## I got the texture from [http://oneodddude.net/FreeTextures.php?action=browse&amp;catid=5 here]. The best textures to use would be either Desert Canyon, Hill Country, Rough Terrain, Class M Planet, or Red Planet. Use Red Planet for a Rocky, Mars-like look. (Note: these textures are no longer available on this URL as of Nov 2010)
## I chose [http://oneodddude.net/FreeTextures.php?action=display&amp;id=10&amp;page=1&amp;sort=id&amp;catid=5 Hill Country]. Click on it, and I know it looks like snot, click on it again, and save the image. 
## Go back to Blender, go to Texture buttons (F6)
## Click add new
## Select ''image'' for the texture type
## Go to the ''image'' toolbar, and upload the texture. Blender will only allow you to upload from the Blender documents, unless if you click on the up and down arrows on the top left of the screen and choose the place where you saved the texture (or picture). 
## After uploading, the X and Y repeats should be smallish, like 6x6, so the changes aren't noticeable. It will look ugly in the preview, but it will look nice after its wrapped. 
# Render, and 1 minute later, voila! Those are nice looking hills! 
# Now boast in front of your friends!

'''Noob Note:''' You need to have your landscape selected if you are in object mode to change the texture, otherwise it will change the texture of the world.

==Reader Contributions 2==
You can have an even better result if you use the texture to &quot;bumpmap&quot; the mountains.
# Press '''F5''' until you are into Material Buttons
# Select the ''Map to'' tab
# Click on ''Nor'' once (the ''Col'' option must stay selected as well)
# Slide the ''Nor'' slider to 5 or more (might differ depending on texture size and repeat options)
# Render with '''F12'''

==Reader Contributions 3==
Alternately from making the hill model manually, you can use a program like [http://www.bundysoft.com/L3DT/downloads/standard.php L3DT]. It uses various algorithms to generate very detailed and realistic terrain heightmaps. It also lets you edit them in a more intuitive way than Blender does. After you have L3DT make your height map, you can export it as a .x file, which you can import into Blender.
'''Noob Note:''' That can be done by going into File-&gt;Import-&gt;DirectX(.x).
And there you have a very realistic landscape mesh with a lot less work.
(Noob Question: I want to use Unity3d game engine to create a game, but i want to use blender to create landscapes. To create massive world landscapes, does anybody have any tips? as Unity limits any mesh to 65000 vertices, which i've already passed with my method without doing half the map.)

-If you are using unity 3d just use it for the terrain. Download the terrain toolbox and just use .raw images. Or simply generate from there and save. 65,000 verts is plenty btw. If you insist on using blender for the terrain then model a high poly terrain fist consisting of around 1 mil+ verts. bake the normal map and ambient occlusion decimate your terrain to around 10k or w/e looks good for the game. Then bam you got 10k terrain that looks like 1mil. But to be honest blender terrain texturing is a pain compared to unity. Anyhow hope that helps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== After Hogwarts ==

The following appeared on Rowling's official site for the month of October 2007:

Wizard of the Month: Harry Potter (1980 - )

The Boy Who Lived, only known survivor of the Avada Kedavra curse and conqueror of Lord Voldemort, also known as Tom Riddle. Harry Potter joined the reshuffled Auror Department under Kingsley Shacklebolt at age 17, rising to become Head of said department in 2007.

The implication is that Harry became an Auror within two months of the death of Voldemort (at least entering the three years training that McGonagall talks about at that point) and was Head of the department within seven years. Hmm.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The primary purpose of proper posture in corps-style marching is to present the performer as a confident, aggressive individual.  This is accomplished by making every element of the body, from the feet to the head, appear as tall and big and strong as possible, and relaxing muscles to eliminate all appearance of tension.

For wind players, posture also serves the secondary purpose of eliminating constrictions in the airstream from the bottom of the lungs to the mouth.  This improves dynamic flexibility, as well as tone quality and the breath support that is needed to maintain it.

All other elements of corps-style marching depend on proper posture to be effective.

== Weight Distribution ==
Proper distribution of the body's weight along the feet is the most fundamental part of maintaining correct posture.  Incorrect weight distribution makes it impossible to maintain upper-body posture while moving (especially at slower tempos) and can create great difficulty in standing still for long periods of time.

With both feet flat on the ground, approximately 70% of the body's weight should be supported by the balls of both feet, and the remaining 30% on the heels.  When done properly, in combination with the rest of the elements described in this chapter, this will cause the entire body to be straight up and down.

Most performers, when standing properly, will actually feel as if they are leaning forwards somewhat.  This is because most people typically lean back slightly when they stand, so that actually standing perfectly vertical is noticeably &quot;more forwards&quot; than they are used to.  Some performers, upon noticing this sensation, will actually force themselves to lean backwards so that they feel like they are standing straight up and down.  Others, knowing that they should feel as if they are leaning forwards, will actually introduce a deliberate forward lean into their posture (usually at the waist, although sometimes at the ankles), causing them to actually ''be'' leaning forwards.  Although both of these tendencies are trivial for an instructor, who can see the performer's entire body, to notice and correct, the performer himself can notice and correct these flaws by paying attention to the distribution of weight on his feet.

Proper weight distribution, in addition to being the most fundamental part of keeping the entire body straight, is also essential for proper fluid movement.  As will be explained later, with every step the performer takes the entire weight of the body must be shifted from one foot to the other.  By putting most of the weight towards the front of his foot, the performer is better able to control his momentum and therefore both the direction and timing of his steps.

== Foot Placement ==
[[Image:Footguide.png|thumbnail|256px|left|A footguide placed between a performer's feet to ensure they are at the correct angle]]When standing still, feet are generally placed either alongside each other, parallel and pointing straight ahead, or with ankles together, toes pointed 45 degrees apart (22.5 degrees on either side of straight ahead).  The first method is known generally as &quot;feet-forward&quot;, while the second is typically referred to as &quot;feet-45&quot;.  Feet-45 is widely considered to be more aesthetically pleasing than feet-forward, and is also a way of paying homage to marching music's military roots, but is considerably more difficult to clean.  While feet-forward is trivial to teach and understand, feet-45 relies on the performer's muscle memory to understand, which requires that it be taught properly in the first place.

To ensure similar angles throughout the ensemble, groups that use feet-45 typically have guides made of wood or heavy cardboard that they can place between the performer's feet to set them at the correct angle.  The performer lines his feet up along both arms of the footguide and memorizes the feeling in his ankles and upper thigh, and then recreates that feeling whenever he is standing with the ensemble.

|previous=Landscape Modeling I: Basic Terrain
}}
This is a continuation of the previous tutorial, [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Landscape_Modeling_I:_Basic_Terrain|Landscape Modeling I: Basic Terrain]].  In this tutorial, we will make our terrain look even better by using some texture stenciling to add multiple textures where we want them in the landscape.  This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of how to use Blender (how to add/remove a mesh, how to change views, etc...)

__TOC__
==Creating the Stencil==
The landscape from the previous example looks pretty good, but the entire thing has the same texture, so it doesn't look very natural.  Let's add some rocks to those hills. If we just add a second texture to our material, it will completely cover the previous one.  What we want is to have the first texture only show in certain places and the second texture cover the rest. In order to do this we'll have to create a stencil, which is like a mask that determines where textures appear on the material.  The stencil is a black and white image, similar to a heightmap, except the intensity of each pixel determines how much of the next texture will appear (black = 0%, white = 100%).  I highly recommend viewing [http://feeblemind.org/blog/index.php?post/2005/02/27/16-didacticiel-usage-des-masques-de-textures-tutorial-using-texture-stencils this] tutorial for a more in depth description of how stencils work.  If you think you have the gist, then continue on here.
We're going to create our own stencil to determine where we want rock in the landscape by &quot;painting&quot; on the object.
'''*IMPORTANT*''' The next few steps will be performing temporary modifications to your scene, so be sure to save your file before you continue so that the changes will not be saved!!  Also, if you have a subsurf modifier on the landscape, remove that at this time as it drastically slows down the following process.
* Select the landscape object and switch from &quot;edit mode&quot; or &quot;object mode&quot; to &quot;'''Vertex''' Paint mode&quot;.  This is found in the Mode drop down menu, on the 3D View header.  This mode lets you paint the object, and thereby change the color value of each vertex.  When in Vertex Paint mode, you'll notice your object change color to a pixelated version of the texture that is applied to it.  This is because with that texture applied, each vertex will be drawn with the colors you see.
'''Noob Note''': Vertex Paint mode is in the drop down menu that contains Object mode and Edit mode. Just select the object while in Object mode, click the drop down menu, and select Vertex Paint mode from the list.

* Switch to the Editing menu ('''F9''') and you'll see a new tab called Paint.  Notice the sliders labeled Opacity and Size.  Opacity determines how much to blend the selected color with the existing colors when you paint.  So 0.2 means that when you click, you'll get 20% of the selected color mixed with whatever is currently there.  Over on the right are different options to combine to colors.  We want to mix, so as we paint the colors will mix together and give us a nice smooth blend.  Size is the size of your cursor while painting, and thus how many vertices are affected.  Keep in mind that does not change as you zoom in and out, so a size of 10 can actually paint more pixels if you're zoomed way out than a size of 30 if you're zoomed way in.
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Creating_the_Stencil_02.jpg]]
* Change the color to black and click the button that says Set VertCol (in 2.48 version, that button is below the color square and named 'SetVCol').  This will change the color of your entire object to black.  You'll notice that the object is not lit in Vertex Paint mode, so when the entire object is black it can be difficult to see where your hills are.  You'll have to move the camera around to see the shapes.
[Another newbie recommends: if you switch to the &quot;object&quot; buttons (f7) and turn on &quot;Wire&quot; under &quot;Draw Extra&quot; in the &quot;Draw&quot; panel/tab you should see a wireframe on top of the vertex colors you are painting, which makes it much easier to see where the hills are. Remember to switch this back off when you have finished painting.]
* Now we're going to paint the places where we want rock to show through.  Change the paint color to white.  It's less likely that grass will grow on steep slopes, so start painting the tops and edges of the steeper hills white by holding down '''LMB''' and dragging your mouse (think MSPaint).  If you didn't heed my earlier advice and still have a subsurf modifier in effect, the painting will be very choppy, so remove that now.
* As you're painting, try to make some spots pure white by going over them again and again, but don't make any one area of white too large as this will make a huge area be all rock, and we're trying to blend two textures.
* This process can just be trial and error getting the landscape painted the way you want.  Once we apply our stencil later you may decide there's too much rock in one area, or not enough in another and go back and change it.  A few things to keep in mind:
** 20% opacity means that most of the original texture (grass, in our case) will show through, so the rock won't be very noticeable if at all.  You'll have to go over the same spots a few times to increase the intensity.
** You don't want a dramatic change from grass to rock, so be sure to blend white areas with black.  That's why we're using the 20% opacity instead of just bumping it up to 100%.
** Make your patches random and spotty.  This will end up creating a more realistic effect once we combine the textures.
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Creating_the_Stencil_03.jpg|right|200px|Painting the stencil onto the landscape]]
* Once you're done you should have something that looks like this.  Notice the mixture of white and black in some places, how it doesn't just go from pure white to pure black as you move down the hills.  This will make a more natural blend and it will cause random rocky areas mixed in when the grass.  Now we need to turn this into our stencil.
* Go to the overhead view ('''NUM7''') and make the projection orthographic if it's not already ('''NUM5''').  
* Zoom in/out ('''Mouse Wheel''' or '''NUM+'''/'''NUM-''') until the plane almost occupies the entire window.
* Move the 3D cursor and any lamps or cameras away so that they're not over the landscape and take a screenshot.
[[Image:Blender3DNobbToPro-Creating_the_Stencil_04.jpg|right|200px|The stencil after its been cut from your screenshot]]
* Open your favorite image editor (I'm a traditionalist, so I still like MSPaint), and cut out the image of landscape.  This is now your stencil.  Save it under your favorite format.
* Re-open the saved version of your landscape to undo the changes we made to create the stencil.


So why did we make our stencil this way?  This allowed us to actually paint on our terrain so that we ensure we get the rock exactly where we want it.  Using this method, you can customize your stencil to any object, as long as it has enough vertices.  For example, if we just had a flat plane made of 4 vertices, this technique would not have worked because we could only paint the corners.  That's why in the previous tutorial I recommended using a high (but not too high) number of vertices in your grid.

==Applying the Stencil==
So now we need to apply the stencil to the landscape to mix our grass and rock textures together.
* Return to either Object Mode or Edit Mode ('''TAB'''), it doesn't matter which.
* Go to the Texture menu ('''F6''') and add two new textures in the material (you should already have the grass texture).
* Make texture 2 (the first new one you added) an image and load your stencil from file.  Do not repeat this in the x or y directions.  We want it to map to the entire object.
* Make texture 3 an image and load your rock texture from file.  This one you do want to repeat, just as you did the grass.
* Now return to the Materials menu and select your stencil texture.  It's a good idea to name your textures, materials, objectives, etc... so that they're easily identifiable.  
* With your stencil texture selected, switch to the tab labeled MapTo.  Deselect Col (which maps the texture to the color), and select Stencil and No RGB.  Stencil will treat this image as a stencil, and No RGB treats it as a black and white image.  If you didn't select this second option your stencil wouldn't work.
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Applying_the_Stencil_01.jpg|Mapping the stencil texture]]
* In the preview tab you should notice your material change so that the grass and rock are now mixed.  If you render, you'll see a much more realistic landscape than the one from the previous tutorial!

'''Noob Info:''' Be sure that for the rock - texture ''col'' is selectet because we want to color the landscape with the rock-texture! Otherwise it doesn´t work. ''Select Rock-Texture -&gt; Map To -&gt; col'' 

[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Applying_the_Stencil_02.jpg|Landscape with grass and rock textures mixed]]

==Adding Snow==
Since you already have some nice mountains, why not add some snow to them? Adding snow is easy. All you have to do is add a fourth texture AFTER all the others. Make this texture the same as your stencil.
* Make sure you're in Shading (F5) &gt; Texture Buttons (F6) &gt; Textures. 
* Click on an empty panel beside Texture Type
* Click on the little box to the left of Add New
* Choose your stencil from the menu (hint: it helps if you name your textures)
* Render and see the results.
If you made your stencil properly, you should have some nice, snowcapped peaks. It's not much, but it's enough for a quick fix. If it isn't even, you probably didn't make your stencil properly (meaning pretty much all white on the peaks, and not much anywhere else). Of course, there are better ways to do this, ways I wouldn't know about; I discovered Blender merely three days before the time of writing. I leave it up to you to see the effect: I only have so much room and bandwidth for pictures!

This effect works by saturating the underlying color with white, depending on the amount of white in your stencil. A light gray will saturate it only a bit, whereas a bright, 100% white will cover it very clearly and efficiently. If you look closely, you'll see that the light gray on the stencil DOES make a difference, but it's not immediately visible and requires lots of fidgeting with the Render Preview and texture options. You might also try fiddling with the Stencil and NoRGB option, although it worked fine for me with both turned off (I use Blender 2.48a)

Some challenges:
* Try to change the color of the snow. Hint: RGB
* I've yet to do this, but try making snow out of a heightmap.

==Multiple Stencils==
Remember in the first tutorial when I said to leave part of the landscape flat, because I'd be using it later?  Well it's time to use it.  I want to eventually use the landscape as the backdrop for a military base, so let's texture the ground around where the base will go to give it a dirt ground and road leading to it.
'''*IMPORTANT*''' Just as before, the next few steps will be performing temporary modifications to your scene, so be sure to save your file before you continue so that the changes will not be saved!!
* Switch to the Vertex Paint mode in the mode menu on the 3D View header.
* Go to an overhead view ('''NUM7''') and make the projection orthographic ('''NUM5''')
* Once again, paint the entire object black by selecting the color black in the Paint tab and clicking on Set VertCol.
* For the next few steps, you may need to '''TAB''' back and forth from Vertex Paint mode to Object mode to make sure you're painting in the correct area.  Make the opacity of the painter 1.0 and the size 10 so that we can work very precisely.
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Multiple_Stencils_01.jpg|right|200px|The stencil for our future base]]
* Paint an area over the flat terrain in the shape of a generic military base, like you see here.
* Reduce the opacity back down to 0.2 and increase the size to 20.
* Paint the road leading away from the base.  We've reduced the opacity and increased the size so that the road will blend more with the landscape around it instead of being more defined like our base.
* Once you have your stencil looking the way you want, take a screen shot and save it.  Then revert back to your previous environment (before you started painting on it).
* Go to the Texture menu ('''F6''') and add two new textures.  
* Load your stencil into the forth texture (the first new one), and the dirt image into the fifth texture.  Once again, remember to set the x and y repeat for the dirt texture.
* In the Materials menu ('''F5''') select your new stencil and go to the MapTo tab.  Deselect Col again, and select Stencil and No RGB.  Notice the new preview.
* Wait a second, where's the dirt path?!?  Here's the problem and the reason I've included this section: stencils are cumulative.  That is, the first stencil defines which portions of ALL successive textures will be drawn, including other stencils!  In order for our new dirt path to show up, we need to make sure it's part of the first stencil.
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Multiple_Stencils_02.jpg|right|200px|Both stencils combined into one]]
* Open your first stencil (the one you used to add rocks to the hills) in your image editor and combine the new stencil with it.  The result should appear somewhat like this.  Be sure that when you combine your dirt stencil with your rock stencil that the dirt stencil remains the same size and in the same place.  That is, you want the two to be perfectly aligned.
* Reload your first stencil on your material, the one we used for the rocks.  Now the preview should look the way we want it to, and if you render you will see your new dirt area on the flat part of the landscape.  You can add even more stencils the same way.  Here is how all of the textures blend together:
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Multiple_Stencils_03.jpg]]

'''NOTE''' I had to replace the grass texture in the above image since I could not find the licensing information for it.  I apologize for the inconsistencies in the diagram that result from this.

Well there you have it!  This is a pretty useful method of texturing complex objects.  Check out our new landscape and how it compares to the previous, boring, single-textured landscape!

Inheritance is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming and Java.  Relational databases have no concept of inheritance, so persisting inheritance in a database can be tricky.  Because relational databases have no concept of inheritance, there is no standard way of implementing inheritance in database, so the hardest part of persisting inheritance is choosing how to represent the inheritance in the database.

JPA defines several inheritance mechanisms, mainly defined though the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Inheritance.html @Inheritance]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or the &lt;code&gt;&lt;inheritance&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.  There are three inheritance strategies defined from the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/InheritanceType.html InheritanceType]&lt;/code&gt; enum, &lt;code&gt;SINGLE_TABLE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TABLE_PER_CLASS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;JOINED&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;i&gt;Single table&lt;/i&gt; inheritance is the default, and &lt;i&gt;table per class&lt;/i&gt; is an &lt;i&gt;optional&lt;/i&gt; feature of the JPA spec, so not all providers may support it.  JPA also defines a mapped superclass concept defined though the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/MappedSuperclass.html @MappedSuperclass]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or the &lt;code&gt;&lt;mapped-superclass&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.  A mapped superclass is not a persistent class, but allow common mappings to be defined for its subclasses.

==Single Table Inheritance==
Single table inheritance is the simplest and typically the best performing and best solution.  In single table inheritance a single table is used to store all of the instances of the entire inheritance hierarchy.  The table will have a column for &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; attribute of &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; class in the hierarchy.  A discriminator column is used to determine which class the particular row belongs to, each class in the hierarchy defines its own unique discriminator value.

===Example single table inheritance table in database ===
PROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;PROJ_TYPE&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;NAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;BUDGET&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;L&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Accounting&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;50000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;S&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Legal&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;null&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


===Example single table inheritance annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@Inheritance
@DiscriminatorColumn(name=&quot;PROJ_TYPE&quot;)
@Table(name=&quot;PROJECT&quot;)
public abstract class Project {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@DiscriminatorValue(&quot;L&quot;)
public class LargeProject extends Project {
  private BigDecimal budget;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@DiscriminatorValue(&quot;S&quot;)
public class SmallProject extends Project {
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example single table inheritance XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Project&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Project&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;PROJECT&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;inheritance/&gt;
    &lt;discriminator-column name=&quot;PROJ_TYPE&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;LargeProject&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.LargeProject&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;discriminator-value&gt;L&lt;/discriminator-value&gt;
    ...
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;SmallProject&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.SmallProject&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;discriminator-value&gt;S&lt;/discriminator-value&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Common Problems ===
==== &lt;i&gt;No class discriminator column&lt;/i&gt; ====
:If you are mapping to an existing database schema, your table may not have a class discriminator column.  Some JPA providers do not require a class discriminator when using a &lt;i&gt;joined&lt;/i&gt; inheritance strategy, so this may be one solution.  Otherwise you need some way to determine the class for a row.  Sometimes the inherited value can be computed from several columns, or there is an discriminator but not a one to one mapping from value to class.  Some JPA providers provide extended support for this.  Another option is to create a database view that manufactures the discriminator column, and then map your hierarchy to this view instead of the table.  In general the best solution is just to add a discriminator column to the table (truth be told, ALTER TABLE is your best friend in ORM).

:: [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support computing the inheritance discriminator through Java code.  This can be done through using a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;ClassDescriptor&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;InheritancePolicy&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;setClassExtractor()&lt;/code&gt; method.

::[[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]] : This can be accomplished through using the Hibernate &lt;code&gt;@DiscriminatorFormula&lt;/code&gt; annotation.  This allows database specific SQL or functions to be used to compute the discriminator value.

==== &lt;i&gt;Non nullable attributes&lt;/i&gt; ====
:Subclasses cannot define attributes as not allowing null, as the other subclasses must insert null into those columns.  A workaround to this issue is instead of defining a not null constraint on the column, define a table constraint that check the discriminator value and the not nullable value.  In general the best solution is to just live without the constraint (odds are you have enough constraints in your life to deal with as it is).

==Joined, Multiple Table Inheritance==
Joined inheritance is the most logical inheritance solution because it mirrors the object model in the data model.  In joined inheritance a table is defined for &lt;i&gt;each&lt;/i&gt; class in the inheritance hierarchy to store &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; the local attributes of that class.  Each table in the hierarchy must also store the object's id (primary key), which is &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; defined in the root class.  All classes in the hierarchy must share the same id attribute.  A discriminator column is used to determine which class the particular row belongs to, each class in the hierarchy defines its own unique discriminator value.

Some JPA providers support joined inheritance with or without a discriminator column, some required the discriminator column, and some do not support the discriminator column.  So joined inheritance does not seem to be fully standardized yet.

:[[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]]: A discriminator column on joined inheritance is not supported.[https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/ANN-140]

===Example joined inheritance tables in database ===
PROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;PROJ_TYPE&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;NAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;L&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Accounting&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;S&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Legal&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

SMALLPROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

LARGEPROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;BUDGET&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;50000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

===Example joined inheritance annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.JOINED)
@DiscriminatorColumn(name=&quot;PROJ_TYPE&quot;)
@Table(name=&quot;PROJECT&quot;)
public abstract class Project {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@DiscriminatorValue(&quot;L&quot;)
@Table(name=&quot;LARGEPROJECT&quot;)
public class LargeProject extends Project {
  private BigDecimal budget;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@DiscriminatorValue(&quot;S&quot;)
@Table(name=&quot;SMALLPROJECT&quot;)
public class SmallProject extends Project {
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example joined inheritance XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Project&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Project&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;PROJECT&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;inheritance strategy=&quot;JOINED&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;discriminator-column name=&quot;PROJ_TYPE&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;LargeProject&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.LargeProject&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;LARGEPROJECT&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;discriminator-value&gt;L&lt;/discriminator-value&gt;
    ...
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;SmallProject&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.SmallProject&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;SMALLPROJECT&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;discriminator-value&gt;S&lt;/discriminator-value&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Common Problems ===
==== &lt;i&gt;Poor query performance&lt;/i&gt; ====
:The main disadvantage to the joined model is that to query any class join queries are required.  Querying the root or branch classes is even more difficult as either multiple queries are required, or outer joins or unions are required.  One solution is to use single table inheritance instead, this is good if the classes have a lot in common, but if it is a big hierarchy and the subclasses have little in common this may not be desirable.  Another solution is to remove the inheritance and instead use a &lt;code&gt;MappedSuperclass&lt;/code&gt;, but this means that you can no longer query or have relationships to the class.

:The poorest performing queries will be those to the root or branch classes.  Avoiding queries and relationships to the root and branch classes will help to alleviate this burden.  If you must query the root or branch classes there are two methods that JPA providers use, one is to outer join all of the subclass tables, the second is to first query the root table, then query only the required subclass table directly.  The first method has the advantage of only requiring one query, the second has the advantage of avoiding outer joins which typically have poor performance in databases.  You may wish to experiment with each to determine  which mechanism is more efficient in your application and see if your JPA provider supports that mechanism.  Typically the multiple query mechanism is more efficient, but this generally depends on the speed of your database connection.

:: [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support both querying mechanisms.  The multiple query mechanism is used by default.  Outer joins can be used instead through using a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;ClassDescriptor&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;InheritancePolicy&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;setShouldOuterJoinSubclasses()&lt;/code&gt; method.

==== &lt;i&gt;Do not have/want a table for every subclass&lt;/i&gt; ====
:Most inheritance hierarchies do not fit with either the &lt;i&gt;joined&lt;/i&gt; or the &lt;i&gt;single table&lt;/i&gt; inheritance strategy.  Typically the desired strategy is somewhere in between, having joined tables in some subclasses and not in others.  Unfortunately JPA does not directly support this.  One workaround is to map your inheritance hierarchy as single table, but them add the additional tables in the subclasses, either through defining a &lt;code&gt;Table&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;SecondaryTable&lt;/code&gt; in each subclass as required.  Depending on your JPA provider, this may work (don't forget to sacrifice the chicken).  If it does not work, then you may need to use a JPA provider specific solution if one exists for your provider, otherwise live within the constraints of having either a single table or one per subclass.  You could also change your inheritance hierarchy so it matches your data model, so if the subclass does not have a table, then collapse its class into its superclass.

==== &lt;i&gt;No class discriminator column&lt;/i&gt; ====
:If you are mapping to an existing database schema, your table may not have a class discriminator column.  Some JPA providers do not require a class discriminator when using a &lt;i&gt;joined&lt;/i&gt; inheritance strategy, so this may be one solution.  Otherwise you need some way to determine the class for a row.  Sometimes the inherited value can be computed from several columns, or there is an discriminator but not a one to one mapping from value to class.

::[[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]] : This can be accomplished through using the Hibernate &lt;code&gt;@DiscriminatorFormula&lt;/code&gt; annotation.  This allows database specific SQL or functions to be used to compute the discriminator value.

==Table Per Class Inheritance==
Table per class inheritance allows inheritance to be used in the object model, when it does not exist in the data model.  In table per class inheritance a table is defined for &lt;i&gt;each&lt;/i&gt; concrete class in the inheritance hierarchy to store &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the attributes of that class and &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of its superclasses.  Be cautious using this strategy as it is optional in the JPA spec, and querying root or branch classes can be very difficult and inefficient.

===Example table per class inheritance tables in database ===
SMALLPROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;NAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Legal&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

LARGEPROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;NAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;BUDGET&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Accounting&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;50000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

===Example table per class inheritance annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
public abstract class Project {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@Table(name=&quot;LARGEPROJECT&quot;)
public class LargeProject extends Project {
  private BigDecimal budget;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@Table(name=&quot;SMALLPROJECT&quot;)
public class SmallProject extends Project {
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example table per class inheritance XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Project&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Project&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;inheritance strategy=&quot;TABLE_PER_CLASS&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;LargeProject&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.LargeProject&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;LARGEPROJECT&quot;/&gt;
    ...
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;SmallProject&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.SmallProject&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;SMALLPROJECT&quot;/&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Common Problems ===
==== &lt;i&gt;Poor query performance&lt;/i&gt; ====
:The main disadvantage to the table per class model is queries or relationships to the root or branch classes become expensive.  Querying the root or branch classes require multiple queries, or unions.  One solution is to use single table inheritance instead, this is good if the classes have a lot in common, but if it is a big hierarchy and the subclasses have little in common this may not be desirable.  Another solution is to remove the table per class inheritance and instead use a &lt;code&gt;MappedSuperclass&lt;/code&gt;, but this means that you can no longer query or have relationships to the class.

==== &lt;i&gt;Issues with ordering and joins&lt;/i&gt; ====
:Because table per class inheritance requires multiple queries, or unions, you cannot join to, fetch join, or traverse them in queries.  Also when ordering is used the results will be ordered by class, then by the ordering.  These limitations depend on your JPA provider, some JPA provider may have other limitations, or not support table per class at all as it is optional in the JPA spec.

==Mapped Superclasses==
Mapped superclass inheritance allows inheritance to be used in the object model, when it does not exist in the data model.  It is similar to table per class inheritance, but does not allow querying, persisting, or relationships to the superclass.  Its main purpose is to allow mappings information to be inherited by its subclasses.  The subclasses are responsible for defining the table, id and other information, and can modify any of the inherited mappings.  A common usage of a mapped superclass is to define a common &lt;code&gt;PersistentObject&lt;/code&gt; for your application to define common behavior and mappings such as the id and version.  A mapped superclass normally should be an abstract class.  A mapped superclass is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; but is instead defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/MappedSuperclass.html @MappedSuperclass]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or the &lt;code&gt;&lt;mapped-superclass&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.

===Example mapped superclass tables in database ===
SMALLPROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;NAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Legal&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

LARGEPROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;PROJECT_NAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;BUDGET&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Accounting&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;50000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

===Example mapped superclass annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@MappedSuperclass
public abstract class Project {
  @Id
  private long id;
  @Column(name=&quot;NAME&quot;)
  private String name;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@Table(name=&quot;LARGEPROJECT&quot;)
@AttributeOverride(name=&quot;name&quot;, column=@Column(name=&quot;PROJECT_NAME&quot;))
public class LargeProject extends Project {
  private BigDecimal budget;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@Table(&quot;SMALLPROJECT&quot;)
public class SmallProject extends Project {
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example mapped superclass XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;mapped-superclass class=&quot;org.acme.Project&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;NAME&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;mapped-superclass/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;LargeProject&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.LargeProject&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;LARGEPROJECT&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;attribute-override&gt;
        &lt;column name=&quot;NAME&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/attribute-override&gt;
    ...
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;SmallProject&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.SmallProject&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;SMALLPROJECT&quot;/&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Common Problems ===
==== &lt;i&gt;Cannot query, persist, or have relationships&lt;/i&gt; ====
:The main disadvantage of mapped superclasses is that they cannot be queried or persisted.  You also cannot have a relationship to a mapped superclass.  If you require any of these then you must use another inheritance model, such as table per class, which is virtually identical to a mapped superclass except it (may) not have these limitations.  Another alternative is to change your model such that your classes do not have relationships to the superclass, such as changing the relationship to a subclass, or removing the relationship and instead querying for its value by querying each possible subclass and collecting the results in Java.

==== &lt;i&gt;Subclass does not want to inherit mappings&lt;/i&gt; ====
:Sometimes you have a subclass that needs to be mapped differently than its parent, or is similar to its' parent but does not have one of the fields, or uses it very differently.  Unfortunately it is very difficult not to inherit everything from your parent in JPA, you can override a mapping, but you cannot remove one, or change the type of mapping, or the target class.  If you define your mappings as properties (get methods), or through XML, you may be able to attempt to override or mark the inherited mapping as &lt;code&gt;Transient&lt;/code&gt;, this may work depending on your JPA provider (don't forget to sacrifice a chicken).

:Another solution is to actually fix your inheritance in your object model.  If you inherit &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; but don't want to inherit it, then remove it from &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt;, if the other subclasses need it, either add it to each, or create a &lt;code&gt;FooBar&lt;/code&gt; subclass of &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; that has the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; and have the other subclasses extend this.

:Some JPA providers may provide ways to be less stringent on inheritance.

:: [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Allow a subclass remove a mapping, redefine a mapping, or be entirely independent of its superclass.  This can be done through using a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and removing the &lt;code&gt;ClassDescriptor&lt;/code&gt;'s mapping, or adding a mapping with the same attribute name, or removing the &lt;code&gt;InheritancePolicy&lt;/code&gt;.

Something about me? I am graduate student of tropical and subtropical agriculture at the University of Life Sciences in Prague with a specialization on crop production. Originally coming from Wikipedia, which I started to modify in 2005. I’ve been mainly working on Czech Wikipedia and very rarely also on English and Spanish versions. From fall 2006 I am a member of wikiversity community.

Here on English Wikibooks I wanna create a text book of [[Special Crops|special crops]] and [[pomology]] (already on cs working on a textbook of [[b:cs:Explantátové kultury|Plant Tissue Culture]]) which can be used by students (crop science, pomology, botany, phytochemistry, pharmacology, etc.), as a data source on Wikiversity (see courses of pomology) or can help people in developing countries to get a free information. These tree areas forms my bit tree - tree subjects which are not in focus of my specialization, by which Ill be examinated from.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Proposed}}

This outline is designed to replace the current [[Artificial Intelligence]] book. That book may not need to be deleted, but it will need to be updated and reorganized. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:49, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

== The Plan ==

The current [[Artificial Intelligence]] book is to sprawling and ambitious to make a good book. I propose we break it down into a series of sub books with a &quot;portal&quot; or subject page to keep track of them all. Some such books already exist, such as [[Expert Systems]] and [[Artificial Neural Networks]]. Additional books need to be created (eventually) to cover topics about propositional calculus, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms. These might be on the back-burner for a long time.

== Books ==

=== [[Artificial Intelligence]] ===

;Note:This book is going to cover a short, high-level overview of the field of artificial intellegence, it's history, it's purview, and it's current state.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although commands may slightly vary from one marching ensemble to the next, the commands are generally the same or are normally recognizable to those familiar with commands. There are standing, moving, and turning commands.

==Standing Commands==
===To the Ready===
This command is meant to tell the group of marchers that they are about to be given commands, such as being called to attention. The person giving this command will say something along the lines of &quot;Band, To the Ready&quot; after which there should be silence and each marcher should prepare themselves for the commands which will follow soon after.
===Parade Rest===
Parade Rest is the stance in which the group of marchers stands with feet apart, hands at their sides, and heads usually toward the ground. This command is used just before calling the ensemble to attention or, alternatively, to call the ensemble out of attention. Usually, the individual giving commands will say &quot;Band, Pa-rade Rest!&quot; to give this command. 
===Attention===
Attention is used to bring a group of marchers out of parade rest. This is a sharp movement and, when done correctly, is an eye-grabber for the audience. To call a group to attention, the person giving commands will usually say &quot;Band, A-Ten Hut!&quot; and as the marchers go into their attention stance 
                             1   2 3   4
(feet  together,head up, good posture) they will respond &quot;Hut!&quot;

===Horns Up/Down===
 Command are given when the band is about to perform as in instruments mouthpiece are ready on the mouth. Usually given command is Horns-Up/Horns-Down during parade time. Command is excluded in a formation or ensemble as the Concert Master will be showing signals.

===Right/Left Face===

==Moving Commands==
===Mark Time===
===Forward March===
===Backward March===
===Halt===
==Turning Commands==
===Right/Left Flank/Slide===
===To the Rear===

==Objectives==
After completing this section, you should know:
* the role of the nervous system in coordinating an animal’s response to the environment
* that the nervous system gathers, sorts and stores information and initiates movement
* the basic structure and function of a neuron
* the structure and function of a synapse and neurotransmitter chemicals
* the nervous pathway known as a reflex with examples
* that training can develop conditioned reflexes in animals
* that the nervous system can be divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems
* that the brain is surrounded by membranes called meninges
* the basic parts of the brain and the function of the cerebral hemispheres, hypothalamus, pituitary, cerebellum and medulla oblongata
* the structure and function of the spinal cord
* that the peripheral nervous system consists of cranial and spinal nerves and the autonomic nervous system
* that the autonomic nervous system consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic parts with different functions

==Coordination==
Animals must be able to sense and respond to the environment in which they live if they are to survive. They need to be able to sense the temperature of their surroundings, for example, so they can avoid the hot sun. They must also be able to identify food and escape predators.

The various systems and organs in the body must also be linked so they work together. For example,
once a predator has identified suitable prey it has to catch it. This involves coordinating the contraction of the muscle so the predator can run, there must then be an increased blood supply to the muscles to provide them with oxygen and nutrients. At the same time the respiration rate must increase to supply the oxygen and remove the carbon dioxide produced as a result of this increased
activity. Once the prey has been caught and eaten, the digestive system must be activated to digest it.

The adjustment of an animal’s response to changes in the environment and the complex linking of the various processes in the body that this response involves are called '''co-ordination'''.
Two systems are involved in co-ordination in animals. These are the '''nervous''' and '''endocrine systems'''. The first operates via electrical impulses along nerve fibres and the second by releasing special chemicals or hormones into the bloodstream from glands.

==Functions of the Nervous System==
The nervous system has three basic functions:
:1. '''Sensory function''' - to sense changes (known as stimuli) both outside and within the body. For example the eyes sense changes in light and the ear responds to sound waves. Inside the body,  stretch receptors in the stomach indicate when it is full and chemical receptors in the blood vessels monitor the acidity of the blood.

:2. '''Integrative function''' - processing the information received from the sense organs. The impulses from these organs are analysed and stored as memory. The many different impulses from different sources are sorted, synchronised and co-ordinated and the appropriate response initiated. The power to integrate, remember and apply experience gives higher animals much of their superiority.

:3. '''Motor function''' - The third function is the response to the stimuli that causes muscles to contract or glands to secrete.

All nervous tissue is made up of nerve cells or '''neurons.''' These transmit high-speed signals called '''nerve impulses'''. Nerve impulses can be thought of as being similar to an electric current.

==The Neuron==
Neurons are cells that have been adapted to carry nerve impulses. A typical neuron has a '''cell body''' containing a nucleus, one or more branching filaments called '''dendrites''' which conduct nerve impulses towards the cell body and one long fibre, an '''axon''',  that carries the impulses away from it. Many axons have a sheath of fatty material called '''myelin''' surrounding them. This speeds up the rate at which the nerve impulses travel along the nerve (see diagram 14.1).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Motor neuron.jpg]]

Diagram 14.1 - A motor neuron

The cell body of neurons is usually located in the brain or spinal cord while the axon extends the whole distance to the organ that it supplies. The neuron carrying impulses from the spinal cord to the hind leg or tail of a horse, for example, can be several feet long. A '''nerve''' is a bundle of axons.

A '''sensory neuron''' is a nerve cell that transmits impulses from a sense receptor such as those in the eye or ear to the brain or spinal cord. A '''motor neuron''' is a nerve cell that transmits impulses from the brain or spinal cord to a muscle or gland. A '''relay neuron''' connects sensory and motor neurons and is found in the brain or spinal cord (see diagrams 14.1 and 14.2).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Relation btw sensory, relay &amp; motor neurons.jpg]]

Diagram 14.2 - The relationship between sensory, relay and motor neurons

===Connections Between Neurons===
The connection between adjacent neurons is called a '''synapse'''. The two nerve cells do not actually touch here for there is a microscopic space between them. The electrical impulse in the neurone before the synapse stimulates the production of chemicals called '''neurotransmitters''' (such as '''acetylcholine'''), which are secreted into the gap.

The neurotransmitter chemicals diffuse across the gap and when they contact the membrane of the next nerve cell they stimulate a new nervous impulse (see diagram 14.3). After the impulse has passed the chemical is destroyed and the synapse is ready to receive the next nerve impulse.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Magnification of a synapse.jpg]]

Diagram 14.3 - A nerve and magnification of a synapse

==Reflexes==
A '''reflex''' is a rapid automatic response to a stimulus. When you accidentally touch a hot object and automatically jerk your hand away, this is a reflex action. It happens without you having to think about it. Animals automatically blink when an object approaches the eye and cats twist their bodies
in the air when falling so they land on their paws. (Please don’t test this one at home with your pet cat!).

Swallowing, sneezing, and the constriction of the pupil of the eye in bright light are also all reflex actions.

The path taken by the nerve impulses in a reflex is called a '''reflex arc'''. Most reflex arcs involve only three neurons (see diagram 14.4). The '''stimulus''' (a pin in the paw) stimulates the pain receptors of the skin, which initiate an impulse in a sensory neuron. This travels to the spinal cord where it passes, by means of a synapse, to a connecting neuron called the relay neuron situated in the spinal cord. The relay neuron in turn makes a synapse with one or more motor neurons that transmit the impulse to the muscles of the limb causing them to contract and remove the paw from the sharp object. Reflexes do not require involvement of the brain although you are aware of what is happening and can, in some instances, prevent them happening. Animals are born with their reflexes. You can think of them as being wired in.

===Conditioned Reflexes===
In most reflexes the stimulus and response are related. For example the presence of food in the mouth causes the salivary glands to release saliva. However, it is possible to train animals (and humans) to respond to different and often quite irrelevant stimuli. This is called a '''conditioned reflex'''. 

A Russian biologist called Pavlov carried out the classic experiment to demonstrate such a reflex when he conditioned dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell ringing.
Almost every pet owner can identify reflexes they have conditioned in their animals. Perhaps you have trained your cat to associate food with the opening of the fridge door or accustomed your dog to the routines you go through before taking them for a walk.

==Parts of the Nervous System==
When we describe the nervous system of vertebrates we usually divide it into two parts (see diagram
14.5).
:1. The '''central nervous system''' ('''CNS''') which consists of the brain and spinal cord.
:2. The '''peripheral nervous system''' ('''PNS''') which consists of the nerves that connect to the brain and spinal cord (cranial and spinal nerves) as well as the '''autonomic''' (or involuntary) nervous system.

===The Central Nervous System===
The '''central nervous system'''  consists of the brain and spinal cord. It acts as a kind of ‘telephone exchange’ where a vast number of cross connections are made.

When you look at the brain or spinal cord some regions appear creamy white ('''white matter''') and others appear grey ('''grey matter'''). White matter consists of masses of nerve axons and the grey matter consists of the nerve cells. In the brain the grey matter is on the outside and in the spinal cord it is on the inside (see diagram 14.2).

====The Brain====
The major part of the brain lies protected within the sturdy “box” of skull called the '''cranium'''. Surrounding the fragile brain tissue (and spinal cord) are protective membranes called the '''meninges''' (see diagram 14.6), and a crystal-clear fluid called '''cerebrospinal fluid''', which protects and nourishes the brain tissue. This fluid also fills four cavities or '''ventricles''' that lie within the brain.

Brain tissue is extremely active and, even when an animal is resting, it uses up to 20% of the oxygen taken into the body by the lungs. The '''carotid artery''', a branch off the dorsal aorta, supplies it with the oxygen and nutrients it requires. Brain damage occurs if brain tissue is deprived of oxygen for only 4-8 minutes.

The brain consists of three major regions:
:1. the '''fore brain''' which includes the '''cerebral hemispheres''', '''hypothalamus''' and '''pituitary gland''';
:2. the '''hind brain''' or '''brain stem''', contains the '''medulla oblongata''' and '''pons''' and
:3. the '''cerebellum''' or “little brain” (see diagram 14.6).

=====Mapping the brain=====
In humans and some animals the functions of the different regions of the cerebral cortex have been mapped (see diagram 14.7). 

Diagram 14.7 - The functions of the regions of the human cerebral cortex

=====The Forebrain=====
The '''cerebral hemispheres''' are the masses of brain tissue that sit on the top of the brain. The surface is folded into ridges and furrows called '''sulci''' (singular sulcus). They make this part of the brain look rather like a very large walnut kernel. The two hemispheres are separated by a deep groove although they are connected internally by a thick bundle of nerve fibres. The outer layer of each hemisphere is called the '''cerebral cortex''' and this is where the main functions of the cerebral hemispheres are carried out.

The cerebral cortex is large and convoluted in mammals compared to other vertebrates and largest
of all in humans because this is where the so-called “higher centres” concerned with memory, learning, reasoning and intelligence are situated.

Nerves from the eyes, ears, nose and skin bring sensory impulses to the cortex where they are interpreted. Appropriate voluntary movements are initiated here in the light of the memories of past events.

Different regions of the cortex are responsible for particular sensory and motor functions, e.g. vision, hearing, taste, smell, or moving the fore-limbs, hind-limbs or tail. For example, when a dog sniffs a scent, sensory impulses from the organ of smell in the nose pass via the olfactory (smelling) nerve to the olfactory centres of the cerebral hemispheres where the impulses are interpreted and co-ordinated.

In humans and some animals the functions of the different regions of the cerebral cortex have been mapped (see diagram 14.8).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Functions of the regions of the cerebral cortex.jpg]]

Diagram 14.8 - The functions of the regions of the cerebral cortex

The '''hypothalamus''' is situated at the base of the brain and is connected by a “stalk” to the '''pituitary gland''', the “master” hormone-producing gland (see chapter 16). The hypothalamus can be thought of as the bridge between the nervous and endocrine (hormone producing) systems. It produces some of the hormones
that are released from the pituitary gland and controls the release of others from it.

It is also an important centre for controlling the internal environment of the animal and therefore maintaining homeostasis. For example, it helps regulate the movement of food through the gut and the temperature, blood pressure and concentration of the blood. It is also responsible
for the feeling of being hungry or thirsty and it controls sleep patterns and sex drive.

=====The Hindbrain=====
The '''medulla oblongata''' is at the base of the brain and is a continuation of the spinal cord. It carries all signals between the spinal cord and the brain and contains centres that control vital body functions like the basic rhythm of breathing, the rate of the heartbeat and the activities of the gut. The medulla oblongata also co-ordinates swallowing, vomiting, coughing and sneezing.

=====The Cerebellum=====
The '''cerebellum''' (little brain) looks rather like a smaller version of the cerebral hemispheres attached to the back of the brain. It receives impulses from the organ of balance (vestibular organ) in the inner ear and from stretch receptors in the muscles and tendons. By co-ordinating these it regulates muscle contraction during walking and running and helps maintain the posture and balance of the animal. When the cerebellum malfunctions it causes a tremor and uncoordinated movement.

====The Spinal Cord====
The spinal cord is a cable of nerve tissue that passes down the channel in the vertebrae from the hindbrain to the end of the tail. It becomes progressively smaller as paired '''spinal nerves''' pass out of the cord to parts of the body. Protective membranes or meninges cover the cord and these enclose cerebral spinal fluid (see diagram 14.9).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals The spinal cord.jpg]]

Diagram 14.9 - The spinal cord

If you cut across the spinal cord you can see that it consists of white matter on the outside and grey matter in the shape of an H or butterfly on the inside.

===The Peripheral Nervous System===
The '''peripheral nervous system''' consists of nerves that are connected to the brain ('''cranial nerves'''), and nerves that are connected to the spinal cord ('''spinal nerves'''). The '''autonomic nervous
system''' is also part of the peripheral nervous system.

====Cranial Nerves====
There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves that come from the brain. Each passes through a hole in the cranium (brain case). The most important of these are the olfactory, optic, acoustic and vagus nerves.

The '''olfactory nerves''' - (smell) carry impulses from the olfactory organ of the nose to the brain.

The '''optic nerves''' - (sight) carry impulses from the retina of the eye to the brain.

The '''auditory (acoustic) nerves''' - (hearing) carry impulses from the cochlear of the inner ear to the brain.

The '''vagus nerve''' - controls the muscles that bring about swallowing. It also controls the muscles of the heart, airways, lungs, stomach and intestines (see diagram 14.5).

====Spinal Nerves====
'''Spinal nerves''' connect the spinal cord to sense organs, muscles and glands in the body. Pairs of spinal nerves leave the spinal cord and emerge between each pair of adjacent vertebrae (see diagram
14.9).

The '''sciatic nerve''' is the largest spinal nerve in the body (see diagram 14.5). It leaves the spinal cord as several nerves that join to form a flat band of nervous tissue. It passes down the thigh towards the hind leg where it gives off branches to the various muscles of this limb.

====The Autonomic Nervous System====
The '''autonomic nervous system''' controls internal body functions that are not under conscious control. For example when a prey animal is chased by a predator the autonomic nervous system automatically increases the rate of breathing and the heartbeat. It dilates the blood vessels that carry blood to the muscles, releases glucose from the liver, and makes other adjustments to provide
for the sudden increase in activity. When the animal has escaped and is safe once again the nervous system slows down all these processes and resumes all the normal body activities like the digestion of food.

The nerves of the autonomic nervous system originate in the spinal cord and pass out between the vertebrae to serve the various organs (see diagram 14.10).There are two main parts to the autonomic nervous system -- the '''sympathetic system''' and the '''parasympathetic system'''. 

The '''sympathetic system''' stimulates the “flight, fright, fight” response that allows an animal to face up to an attacker or make a rapid departure. It increases the heart and respiratory rates, as well as the amount of blood flowing to the skeletal muscles while blood flow to less critical regions like the gut and skin is reduced. It also causes the pupils of the eyes to dilate. Note that the effects of the sympathetic system are similar to the effects of the hormone adrenaline (see Chapter 16).

The '''parasympathetic system''' does the opposite to the sympathetic system. It maintains the normal
functions of the relaxed body. These are sometimes known as the “housekeeping” functions. It promotes effective digestion, stimulates defaecation and urination and maintains a regular heartbeat
and rate of breathing.

==Summary==
* The '''neuron''' is the basic unit of the nervous system. It consists of a '''cell body''' with a nucleus, filaments known as '''dendrites''' and a long fibre known as the '''axon''' often surrounded by a '''myelin sheath'''. 
* A '''nerve''' is a bundle of axons. 
* '''Grey matter''' in the brain and spinal cord consists mainly of brain  cells while '''white matte'''r consists of masses of axons.
*'''Nerve Impulses''' travel along axons. 
* Adjacent neurons connect with each other at '''synapses'''.
* '''Reflexes''' are automatic responses to stimuli. The path taken by nerve impulses involved in reflexes is a '''reflex arc'''. Most reflex arcs involve 3 neurons - a '''sensory neuron''', a '''relay neuron''' and a '''motor neuron'''. A stimulus, a pin in the paw for example, initiates an impulse in the sensory neuron that passes via a synapse to the relay neuron situated in the spinal cord and then via another synapse to the motor neurone. This transmits the impulse to the muscle causing it to contract and remove the paw from the pin.
* The nervous system is divided into 2 parts: the '''central nervous system''', consisting of the brain and spinal cord and the '''peripheral nervous system''' consisting of nerves connected to the brain and spinal cord. The '''autonomic nervous system''' is considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system.
* The brain consists of three major regions: 1. the '''fore brain''' which includes the '''cerebral hemispheres''' (or '''cerebrum'''), '''hypothalamus''' and '''pituitary gland'''; 2. the '''hindbrain''' or '''brain stem''' containing the '''medulla oblongata''' and 3. the '''cerebellum'''.
* Protective membranes known as the '''meninges''' surround the brain and spinal cord.
* There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that include the optic, olfactory, acoustic and '''vagus''' nerves.
* The '''spinal cord''' is a cable of nerve tissue surrounded by meninges passing from the brain to the end of the tail. '''Spinal nerves''' emerge by a '''ventral''' and '''dorsal root''' between each vertebra and connect the spinal cord with organs and muscles.
* The '''autonomic nervous system''' controls internal body functions not under conscious control. It is divided into 2 parts with 2 different functions: the '''sympathetic nervous system''' that is involved in the flight and fight response including increased heart rate, bronchial dilation, dilation of the pupil and decreased gut activity. The '''parasympathetic nervous system''' is associated with decreased heart rate, pupil constriction and increased gut activity.

==Objectives==

After completing this section, you should know:
* that the general senses of touch, pressure, pain etc. are situated in the dermis of the skin and in the body
* that the special senses include those of smell, taste, sight, hearing, and balance
*the main structures of the eye and their functions
* the route taken by light through the eye to the retina
* the role of the rods and cones in the retina
* the advantages of binocular vision
* the main structures of the ear and their functions
* the route taken by sound waves through the ear to the cochlea
* the role of the vestibular organ (semicircular canals and otolith organ) in maintaining balance and posture

==The Sense Organs==
Sense organs allow animals to sense changes in the environment around them and in their bodies so that they can respond appropriately. They enable animals to avoid hostile environments, sense the presence of predators and find food.

Animals can sense a wide range of stimuli that includes, touch, pressure, pain, temperature, chemicals, light, sound, movement and position of the body. Some animals can sense electric and magnetic fields. All sense organs respond to stimuli by producing nerve impulses that travel to the brain via a sensory nerve. The impulses are then processed and interpreted in the brain as pain, sight, sound, taste etc.

The senses are often divided into two groups:
:1. The '''general senses''' of touch, pressure, pain and temperature that are distributed fairly evenly through the skin. Some are found in muscles and within joints.

:2. The '''special senses''' which include the senses of smell, taste, sight, hearing and balance. The special sense organs may be quite complex in structure.

==Touch And Pressure==
Within the dermis of the skin are numerous modified nerve endings that are sensitive to touch and pressure. The roots of hairs may also be well supplied with sensory receptors that inform the animal
that it is in contact with an object (see diagram 15.1). Whiskers are specially modified hairs.

==Pain==
Receptors that sense pain are found in almost every tissue of the body.
They tell the animal that tissues are dangerously hot, cold, compressed or stretched or that there is not enough blood flowing in them. The animal may then be able to respond and protect itself from further damage

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals General senses in skin.jpg]]

Diagram 15.1 - The general senses in the skin

==Temperature==
Nerve endings in the skin respond to hot and cold stimuli (See diagram 15.1).

==Awareness Of Limb Position==
There are sense organs in the muscles, tendons and joints that send continuous impulses to the brain that tell it where each limb is. This information allows the animal to place its limbs accurately and know their exact position without having to watch them.

==Smell==
Animals use the sense of smell to locate food, mark territory, identify their own offspring and the presence and sexual condition of a potential mate. The organ of smell ('''olfactory organ''') is located in the nose and responds to chemicals in the air. It consists of modified nerve cells that have several
tiny hairs on the surface. These emerge from the epithelium on the roof of the nose cavity into the mucus that lines it. As the animal breathes, chemicals in the air dissolve in the mucus. When the sense cell responds to a particular molecule, it fires an impulse that travels along the '''olfactory nerve''' to the brain where it is interpreted as an odour (see diagram 15.2).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Olfactory organ the sense of smell.jpg]]

Diagram 15.2 - The olfactory organ - the sense of smell

The olfactory sense in humans is rudimentary compared to that of many animals. Carnivores that hunt have a very highly developed sensitivity to scents. For example a polar bear can smell out a dead seal 20 km away and a bloodhound can distinguish between the trails of different people although it may sometimes be confused by the criss-crossing trail of identical twins.

Snakes and lizards detect odours by means of '''Jacobson’s organ'''. This is situated on the roof of the mouth and consists of pits containing sensory cells. When snakes flick out their forked tongues they are smelling the air by carrying the molecules in it to the Jacobson’s organ.

==Taste==
The sense of taste allows animals to detect and identify dissolved chemicals. In reptiles, birds, and mammals the taste receptors ('''taste buds''') are found mainly to the upper surface of the tongue. They consist of pits containing sensory cells arranged rather like the segments of an orange (see diagram 15.3). Each receptor cell has a tiny “hair” that projects into the saliva to sense the chemicals

Diagram 15.3. Taste buds on the tongue

The sense of taste is quite restricted. Humans can only distinguish four different tastes (sweet, sour, bitter and salt) and what we normally think of as taste is mainly the sense of smell. Food is quite tasteless when the nose is blocked and cats often refuse to eat when this happens.

==Sight==
The eyes are the organs of sight. They consist of spherical '''eyeballs''' situated in deep depressions in the skull called the '''orbits'''. They are attached to the wall of the orbit by six muscles, which move the eyeball. Upper and lower '''eyelids''' cover the eyes during sleep and protect them from foreign objects or too much light, and spread the tears over their surface.

The '''nictitating membrane''' or '''haw'''is a transparent sheet that moves sideways across the eye from the inner corner, cleansing and moistening the cornea without shutting out the light. It is found in birds, crocodiles, frogs and fish as well as marsupials like the kangaroo. It is rare in mammals but can be seen in cats and dogs by gently opening the eye when it is asleep.  '''Eyelashes''' also protect the eyes from the sun and foreign objects.

===Structure of the Eye===
Lining the eyelids and covering the front of the eyeball is a thin epithelium called the '''conjunctiva'''. Conjunctivitis is inflammation of this membrane. '''Tear glands''' that open just under the top eyelid secrete a salty solution that keeps the exposed part of the eye moist, washes away dust and contains
an enzyme that destroys bacteria.

The wall of the eyeball is composed of three layers (see diagram 15.4). From the outside these are the '''sclera''', the '''choroid''' and the '''retina'''.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Structure of the eye.jpg]]

Diagram 15.4 - The structure of the eye

The '''sclera''' is a tough fibrous layer that protects the eyeball and gives it rigidity. At the front of the eye the sclera is visible as the “'''white'''” of the eye, which is modified as the transparent '''cornea''' through which the light rays have to pass to enter the eye. The cornea helps focus light that enters the eye.

The '''choroid''' lies beneath the sclera. It contains a network of blood vessels that supply the eye with oxygen and nutrients. Its inner surface is highly pigmented and absorbs stray light rays. In nocturnal
animals like the cat and possum this highly pigmented layer reflects light as a means of conserving
light. This is what makes them shine when caught in car headlights.

At the front of the eye the choroid becomes the '''iris'''. This is the coloured part of the eye that controls
the amount of light entering the '''pupil''' of the eye. In dim light the pupil is wide open so as much light as possible enters while in bright light the pupils contract to protect the retina from damage
by excess light.

The '''pupil''' in most animals is circular but in many nocturnal animals it is a slit that can close completely.
This helps protect the extra-sensitive light sensing tissues of animals like the cat and possum
from bright sunlight.

The inner layer lining the inside of the eye is the '''retina'''. This contains the light sensing cells called '''rods''' and '''cones''' (see diagram 15.5).

The '''rod cells''' are long and fat and are sensitive to dim light but cannot detect colour. They contain large amounts of a pigment that changes when exposed to light. This pigment comes from vitamin A found in carrots etc. A deficiency of this vitamin causes night blindness. So your mother was right when she told you to eat your carrots as they would help you see in the dark!

The '''cone cells''' provide colour vision and allow animals to see details. Most are found in the centre
of the retina and they are most densely concentrated in a small area called the '''fovea'''. This is the area of sharpest vision, where the words you are reading at this moment are focussed on your retina.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals A rod and cone from the retina.jpg]]

Diagram 15.5 - A rod and cone from the retina

The nerve fibres from the cells of the retina join and leave the eye via the '''optic nerve'''. There are no rods or cones here and it is a '''blind spot'''. The optic nerve passes through the back of the orbit and enters the brain.

The '''lens''' is situated just behind the pupil and the iris. It is a crystalline structure with no blood vessels
and is held in position by a ligament. This is attached to a muscle, which changes the shape of the lens so both near and distant objects can be focussed by the eye. This ability to change the focus of the lens is called '''accommodation'''. In many mammals the muscles that bring about accommodation
are poorly developed, Rats, cows and dogs, for example, are thought to be unable to focus clearly on near objects.

In old age and certain diseases the lens may become cloudy resulting in blurred vision. This is called a '''cataract'''.
Within the eyeball are two cavities, the '''anterior and posterior chambers''', separated by the lens. They contain fluids the '''aqueous and vitreous humours'''respectively, that maintain the shape of the eyeball and help press the retina firmly against the choroid so clear images are seen.

===How The Eye Sees===
Eyes work quite like a camera. Light rays from an object enter the eye and are focused on the retina (the “film”) at the back of the eye. The cornea, the lens and the fluid within the eye all help to focus the light. They do this by bending the light rays so that light from the object falls on the retina. This bending of light is called '''refraction'''. The light stimulates the light sensitive cells of the retina and nerve impulses are produced that pass down the optic nerve to the brain (see diagram 15.6).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals How light travels from the object to the retina of the eye.jpg]]

Diagram 15.6 - How the light travels from the object to the retina of the eye

===Colour Vision In Animals===
As mentioned before, the retina has &lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt; different kinds of cells that are stimulated by light - ''''''rods'''''' and ''''''cones''''''. In humans and higher primates like baboons and gorillas the rods function in dim light and do not perceive colour, while the cones are stimulated by bright light and perceive details and colour.

Other mammals have very few cones in their retinas and it is believed that they see no or only a limited range of colour. It is, of course, difficult to find out exactly what animals do see. It is thought that deer, rats, and rabbits and nocturnal animals like the cat are colour-blind, and dogs probably see green and blue. Some fish and most birds seem to have better colour vision than humans and they use colour, often very vivid ones, for recognizing each other as well as for courtship and protection.

===Binocular Vision===
Animals like cats that hunt have eyes placed on the front of the head in such a way that both eyes see the same wide area but from slightly different angles (see diagram 15.7). This is called binocular'''
vision'''. Its main advantage is that it enables the animals to estimate the distance to the prey so they can chase it and pounce accurately.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Well developed binocular vision.jpg]]

Diagram 15.7 - Well developed binocular vision in predator animals like the cat

In contrast plant-eating prey animals like the rabbit and deer need to have a wide panoramic view so they can see predators approaching. They therefore have eyes placed on the side of the head, each with its own field of vision (see diagram 15.8). They have only a very small area of binocular vision in front of the head but are extremely sensitive to movement.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Panaoramic monocular vision.jpg]]

==Hearing==
Animals use the sense of hearing for many different purposes. It is used to sense danger and enemies,
to detect prey, to identify prospective mates and to communicate within social groups. Some animals (e.g. most bats and dolphins) use sound to “see” by echolocation. By sending out a cry and interpreting the echo, they sense obstacles or potential prey.

===Structure of the Ear===
Most of the ear, the organ of hearing, is hidden from view within the boney skull. It consists of three main regions: the '''outer ear, the middle ear''' and the '''inner ear''' (see diagram 15.9).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals The ear.jpg]]

Diagram 15.9 - The ear

The '''outer ear''' consists of an '''ear canal''' leading inwards to a thin membrane known as the '''eardrum'''or '''tympanic membrane''' that stretches across the canal. Many animals have an external ear flap or '''pinna''' to collect and funnel
the sound into the ear canal. The pinnae (plural of pinna) usually face forwards on the head but many animals can swivel them towards the source of the sound.

In dogs the ear canal is long and bent and often traps wax or provides an ideal habitat for mites, yeast and bacteria.

The '''middle ear''' consists of a cavity in the skull that is connected to the '''pharynx''' (throat) by a long narrow tube called the '''Eustachian tube'''. This links the middle ear to the outside air so that the air pressure on both sides of the eardrum can be kept the same. Everyone knows the uncomfortable feeling (and affected hearing) that occurs when you drive down a steep hill and the unequal air pressures on the two sides of the eardrum cause it to distort. The discomfort is relieved when you swallow because the Eustachian tubes open and the pressure on either side equalises.

Within the cavity of the middle ear are three of the smallest bones in the body, the '''auditory ossicles'''. They are known as the hammer,
the anvil and the stirrup because of their resemblance to the shape of these objects. These tiny bones articulate (move against) each other and transfer the vibrations of the eardrum to the membrane
covering the opening to the inner ear.

The '''inner ear''' is a complicated series of fluid-filled tubes imbedded in the bone of the skull. It consists of two main parts. These are the '''cochlea''' where sound waves are converted to nerve impulses and the '''vestibular organ''' that is associated with the sense of balance and has no role in hearing (see later).

The '''cochlea''' looks rather like a coiled up snail shell. Within it there are specialised cells with fine hairs on their surface that respond to the movement of the fluid within the cochlea by producing nervous impulses that travel to the brain along the '''auditory nerve'''.

===How The Ear Hears===
Sound waves can be thought of as vibrations in the air. They are collected by the ear pinna and pass down the ear canal where they cause the eardrum to vibrate. (An interesting fact is that when you are listening to someone speaking your eardrum vibrates at exactly the same rate as the vocal cords of the person speaking to you).

The vibration of the eardrum sets the three tiny bones in the middle ear moving against each other so that the vibration is transferred to the membrane covering the opening to the inner ear. As well as transferring the vibration, the tiny ear bones also amplify it. The three tiny bones are called the stirrup, anvil, and hammer. They were called such of their form. In the human ear this amplification is about 20 times while in desert-dwelling animals like the kangaroo rat it is 100 times. This acute hearing warns them of the approach of predators like owls and snakes, even in the dark.

The vibration causes waves in the fluid in the inner ear that pass down the cochlea. These waves stimulate the tiny hair cells to produce nerve impulses that travel via the auditory nerve to the cerebral
cortex of the brain where they are interpreted as sound.

To summarise: The route sound waves take as they pass through the ear is:
'''External ear | tympanic membrane | ear ossicles | inner ear |cochlear | hair cells'''

The hair cells generate a nerve impulse that travels down the auditory nerve to the brain.

Remember that sound waves do not pass along the Eustachian tube. Its function is to equalise the air pressure on either side of the tympanic membrane.

==Balance==
The '''vestibular organ''' of the inner ear helps an animal maintain its posture and keep balanced by monitoring the movement and position of the head. It consists of two structures - the '''semicircular canals''' and the '''otolith organs'''.

The '''semicircular canals''' (see diagram 15.10) respond to movement of the body. They tell an animal whether it is moving up or down, left or right. They consist of three canals set in three different
planes at right angles to each other so that movement in any direction can be registered. The canals contain fluid and sense cells with fine hairs that project into the fluid. When the head moves the fluid swirls in the canals and stimulates the hair cells. These send nerve impulses along the '''vestibular nerve''' to the '''cerebellum'''. 

Note that the semicircular canals register acceleration and deceleration as well as changes in direction but do not respond to movement that is at a constant speed.

The '''otolith organs''' are sometimes known as gravity receptors. They tell you if your head is tilted or if you are standing on your head. They consist of bulges at the base of the semi circular canals that contain hair cells that are covered by a mass of jelly containing tiny pieces of chalk called '''otoliths''' (see diagram 15.10). When the head is tilted, or moved suddenly, the otoliths pull on the hair cells, which produce a nerve impulse. This travels down the '''vestibular nerve''' to the '''cerebellum'''. By coordinating the nerve impulses from the semicircular canals and otolith organs the cerebellum helps the animal keep its balance.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Olith organs.jpg]]

Diagram 15.10 - Otolith Organs

==Summary==
* Receptors for touch, pressure, pain and temperature are found in the skin. Receptors in the muscles, tendons and joints inform the brain of limb position.
* The '''olfactory organ''' in the nose responds to chemicals in the air i.e. smell.
* '''Taste buds''' on the tongue respond to a limited range of chemicals dissolved in saliva.
* The eyes are the organs of sight. Spherical '''eyeballs''' situated in orbits in the skull have walls composed of 3 layers.
* The tough outer '''sclera''' protects and holds the shape of the eyeball. At the front it becomes visible as the white of the eye and the transparent '''cornea''' that allows light to enter the eye.
* The middle layer is the '''choroid'''. It most animals it absorbs stray light rays but in nocturnal animal it is reflective to conserve light. At the front of the eye it becomes the '''iris''' with muscles to control the size of the '''pupil''' and hence the amount of light entering the eye.
* The inner layer is the '''retina''' containing the light receptor cells: the '''rods''' for black and white vision in dim light and the '''cones''' for colour and detailed vision. Nerve impulses generated by these cells leave the eye for the brain via the '''optic nerve'''.
* The '''lens''' (with the cornea) helps focus the light rays on the retina. Muscles alter the shape of the lens to allow near and far objects to be focussed.
* '''Aqueous humour''' fills the space immediately behind the cornea and keeps it in shape and '''vitreous humour''', a transparent jelly-like substance, fills the space behind the lens allowing light rays to pass through to the retina.
* The ear is the organ of hearing and balance.
* The external '''pinna''' helps funnel sound waves into the ear and locate the direction of the sound. The sound waves travel down the external '''ear canal''' to the '''eardrum''' or '''tympanic membrane''' causing it to vibrate. This vibration is transferred to the '''auditory ossicles''' of the middle ear which themselves transfer it to the inner ear. Here receptors in the '''cochlea''' respond by generating nerve impulses that travel to the brain via the '''auditory''' (acoustic) nerve.
* The '''Eustachian tube''' connects the middle ear with the pharynx to equalise air pressure on either side of the tympanic membrane.
* The '''vestibular organ''' of the inner ear is concerned with maintaining balance and posture. It consists of the '''semicircular canals''' and the '''otolith organs'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Searching with Google==
The most commonly used Google service or product is the search engine. To use simply do the following go to [http://www.google.com www.google.com] or a local version of Google e.g. [http://www.google.co.uk www.google.co.uk],type in a search query eg.wikibooks, press enter or click Google Search and wait for your search results page to load.

==Search Results==
After your search results page has loaded you will notice several things. The most important of these is the search results, listed down the page. For each result it shows the URL or Uniform Resource Locator, a snippet of the text of the page with your search terms in bold, a title for the web page

==Search Operators==
*OR Google finds one of two or more search terms e.g. Services OR Products
* &quot;&quot; Google Searches for the exact phrase eg. &quot;Google Services and Products&quot;
* - Searches for things matching other search terms without a certain word e.g. -wikibooks
* link: Shows links to a web page e.g. link:www.wikibooks.org
* related: Shows related pages e.g. related:www.wikibooks.org
*site: only searches within a given website eg.google site:en.wikibooks.org
* intitle: searches within titles of web pages e.g. intitle:wikibooks
* allintitle: like intitle: but restricts results to web pages that have all of the search terms in their title e.g. allintitle:wikibooks
* inurl: searches within the urls of pages e.g. inurl:wikibooks
* allinurl: like inurl: but restricts results to web pages that have all of the search terms in their url e.g. allinurl:wikibooks

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

Also I noticed the ''Google Services And Products'' book you started. I had changed the name, to follow Wikibooks' [[WB:NP|naming conventions]] which you reversed. Pages in a book are suppose to be separated by &quot;/&quot; rather than &quot;:&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:04, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for renaming my pages to follow the naming conventions.

I noticed a large number of subpage creations in the logs. Are you splitting content off onto subpages of this book?

My name is David Mitchell and I'm a Software Engineer for [http://www.lockheedmartin.com/ Lockheed Martin] in Fort Worth, TX.  My group focuses on systems for [[w:Unmanned_aerial_vehicle|unmanned vehicles]], such as mission planning and collision avoidance.

I'm also working on my Masters degree in Computer Science Engineering at the [http://www.uta.edu University of Texas at Arlington] where I have about 2 years left (slow going).  My areas of interest are in [[w:AI|artificial intelligence]], [[w:Robotics|robotics]], and [[w:Computer_graphics|computer graphics]].  Eventually I would like to get a job in the computer game industry, either as a direct employee or doing contract work.

My beautiful wife of four years and I are expecting our first child, a boy, in March.  We've decided on the name Daniel Patrick Mitchell for the little guy.  We almost went with the middle name [[w:Q_%28Star_Trek%29|Q]] in tribute to the omnipotent thorn in Captain Picard's side, but we liked Patrick better.

Given the nature of my work and interests, most of my contributions will likely be computer related, specifically programming and graphics.  I appreciate feedback on everything, so please let me know what you think (good or bad) either in the discussions on my articles or on my talk.

== Redox Reactions (review) ==

Redox (shorthand for reduction/oxidation reaction) describes all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation number (oxidation state) changed.

This can be either a simple redox process such as the oxidation of carbon to yield carbon dioxide, or the reduction of carbon by hydrogen to yield methane (CH4), or it can be a complex process such as the oxidation of sugar in the human body through a series of very complex electron transfer processes.

The term redox comes from the two concepts of reduction and oxidation. It can be explained in simple terms:

{{SideBox|Non-redox reactions, which do not involve changes in formal charge, are known as ''metathesis reactions''.}}

* ''Oxidation'' describes the loss of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion
* ''Reduction'' describes the gain of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion

However, these descriptions (though sufficient for many purposes) are not truly correct. Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number—the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. Thus, oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always cause a change in oxidation number, but there are many reactions which are classed as &quot;redox&quot; even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving covalent bonds).

== Electrochemistry ==

'''Electrochemistry''' is a branch of chemistry that deals with the flow of electricity by chemical reactions. The electrons in a balanced half-reaction show the direct relationship between electricity and the specific redox reaction. Electrochemical reactions are either spontaneous, or nonspontaneous. A spontaneous redox reaction generates a voltage itself. A nonspontaneous redox reaction occurs when an external voltage is applied. The reactions that occur in an electric battery are electrochemical reactions.

{{TextBox|1=
;Three components of an electrochemical reaction:
*A solution where redox reactions may occur (solutions are substances dissolved in liquid, usually water)
*A conductor for electrons to be transferred (such as a metal wire)
*A conductor for ions to be transferred (usually a ''salt bridge'')}}e.g. filter paper dipped in a salt solution.

=== Electrolysis ===
An '''electrolysis''' experiment forces a nonspontaneous chemical reaction to occur. This is achieved when two [[w:Electrode|electrodes]] are submersed in an electrically conductive solution, and the electrical voltage applied to the two electrodes is increased until electrons flow. The electrode receiving the electrons, or where the reduction reactions occur, is called the [[w:Cathode|cathode]]. The electrode which supplies the electrons, or where the oxidation reactions occur, is called the [[w:Anode|anode]]. 

A molten salt is an example of something that may be electrolyzed because salts are composed of ions. When the salt is in its solid state, the ions are not able to freely move. However, when the salt is heated enough until it melts (making it a molten salt), the ions are free to move. This mobility of the ions in the molten salt makes the salt electrically conductive. In the electrolysis of a molten salt, for example melted &lt;math&gt;NaCl&lt;/math&gt;, the cation of the salt (in this case &lt;math&gt;Na^+&lt;/math&gt;) will be reduced at the cathode, and the anion of the salt (in this case &lt;math&gt;Cl^-&lt;/math&gt;) will be oxidized at the anode:
:Cathode reaction: {{chem|Na|+}} + {{chem|e|-}} → {{chem|Na|}}
:Anode reaction: {{chem|2Cl|}} → {{chem|Cl|2}} + 2{{chem|e|-}}

Aqueous solutions of salts can be electrolyzed as well because they are also electrically conductive. In aqueous solutions, there is an additional reaction possible at each the cathode and the anode:
:Cathode: 2{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2{{chem|e|-}} → {{chem|H|2}} + 2{{chem|OH|-}} (reduction of water)
:Anode: 2{{chem|H|2|O}} → 4{{chem|H|+}} + {{chem|O|2}} + 4{{chem|e|-}} (oxidation of water)
With the addition of these two reactions, there are now two possible reactions at each electrode. At the cathode, either the reduction of the cation or the reduction of water will occur. At the anode, either the oxidation of the anion or the oxidation of water will occur. The following rules determine which reaction takes place at each electrode:
*Cathode: If the cation is a very active metal, water will be reduced. Very active metals include {{chem|Li}}, {{chem|Na}}, {{chem|K}}, {{chem|Rb}}, {{chem|Cs}}, {{chem|Ca}}, {{chem|Sr}}, and {{chem|Ba}}. If the cation is an active or inactive metal, the cation will be reduced.
*Anode: If the anion is a polyatomic ion, water will generally be oxidized. Specifically, sulfate, perchlorate, and nitrate ions are not oxidized; water will oxidize instead. Chloride, bromide, and iodide ions will be oxidized. If the anion in one salt is oxidized in an aqueous electrolysis, that same anion will also be oxidized in any other salt.

=== Galvanic Cells ===
The energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is captured using a '''galvanic cell'''. The following parts are necessary to make a galvanic cell:
[[Image:Electrochemical element with salt bridge.png|thumb|The &quot;ammeter&quot; at the top measures the electrical current flowing through the wire.  Electrons are flowing from copper to zinc, making zinc the oxidizing agent.]]
# Two [[w:Half cell|half cells]]
# Two [[w:Electrode|electrodes]]
# One electrically conductive wire
# One [[w:Salt bridge|salt bridge]]
# One device, usually an [[w:Ammeter|ammeter]] or a [[w:Voltmeter|voltmeter]]
A galvanic cell is constructed as shown in the image to the right. The two half-reactions are separated into two half cells. All of the reactants in the oxidation half-reaction are placed in one half cell (the anode), and all the reactants of the reduction half-reaction are placed in the other half cell (the cathode). If the half-reaction contains a metal, the metal serves as the electrode for that half cell. Otherwise, an inert electrode made of platinum, silver, or gold is used. The electrodes are connected with a wire which allows the flow of electrons. The electrons always flow from the anode to the cathode. The half cells are connected by a salt bridge which allows the ions in the solution to move from one half cell to the other, so that the reaction can continue.  Since the overall reaction is spontaneous, the flow of electrons will move spontaneously through the outer circuitry from which the energy can be extirpated. The energy harnessed is useful because it can be used to do work. For example, if an electrical component such as a light bulb is attached to the wire, it will receive power from the flowing electrons.

Consistent results from a galvanic cell are dependent on three variables: pressure, temperature, and concentration. Thus, chemists defined a standard state for galvanic cells. The standard state for the galvanic cell is a pressure of 1.00 [[w:Atmospheric pressure|atmospheric pressure]] (''atm'') for all gases, a temperature of 298 [[w:Kelvin|kelvin]] (''K'') and concentrations of 1.00 [[w:Molarity|molarity]] (''M'') for all soluble compounds, liquids, and solids.

==Voltage==
Voltage is a measure of spontaneity of redox reactions, and it can be measured by a voltmeter. If the voltage of a reaction is positive, the reaction occurs spontaneously, but when negative, it does not occur spontaneously.

To compute the voltage of a redox equation, split the equation into its oxidation component and reduction component. Then, look up the voltages of each component on a [[General Chemistry/Standard Reduction Potentials|standard electrode potential table]]. This table will list the voltage for the reduction equation. The oxidation reaction's voltage is negative of the corresponding reduction equation's voltage. To find the equation's voltage, add the standard voltages for each half reaction.

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

You did a thesis on permutation codes? What was the title? When did you graduate? It's an area where I have a certain research interest myself. As to contributing it, I think it most certainly would be valuable, although the book currently doesnt have enough basic information to support a high-level thesis. If you could maybe help write some of the supporting information too, then we would be in business. I would love to see your thesis too, if you can email me a copy. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:40, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:Wow, this is a nice-looking report. I would definitely recommend you upload that to the book if you are willing and able. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:11, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

::Definitely do it. Feel free to add any pages that you want to add. We can always rearrange things later if we need to. Let me know if you need any help with this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:24, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

Welcome to Wikibooks.
I agree with Whiteknight: [[Wikibooks:Be bold]] and contribute your information now.
It's better to upload your large block of information now, and then later fill in the gaps in basic information leading up to it, rather than try to do it the other way around.
Feel free to ask me for help, although you'll probably get a quicker response asking questions on the [[Wikibooks:bulletin board]]

== LaTeX converter ==

[[User:Hagindaz]] has created a java-based Wiki2LaTeX converter at: [[User:Hagindaz/Wiki2LaTeX]]. I've never tested it myself, and I think it might still be in beta testing. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:39, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

== codes and communication ==

I am still interested in reading your thesis on permutation codes.

Would you be interested in reading and possibly editing the wikibooks [[clock and data recovery]] and [[Data Coding Theory]]?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 00:48, 13 May 2008 (UTC)

I just downloaded your thesis from http://rapidshare.com/files/59765051/honoursproject1.pdf.html .
Thank you for sharing it with me.
I suspect it may be easier to incorporate this text into a wikibook by copying from the original source version (in TeX?) than copying from this PDF version.

Would you be willing to share that original source version with us?

I suspect that you have already figured out that the fancy equations in some books (such as [[Signals and Systems/Fourier Series]]) are stored in TeX to make them easy to edit, as explained in [[Help:Formula]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ASDF ==

ASDF, short for &quot;another system definition facility&quot; simplifies the management of lisp systems.  A system is analogous to a package or module from other programming language, and includes one or more files that are compiled and loaded to provide library objects and functions.  Using ASDF, the lisp programmer can:

* compile all files included in a system.
* specify other asdf packages as dependencies.
* load all of the files needed for a system.

ASDF has features in common with Ant for java, distutils for python, and cpan for perl.  An additional package [[/ASDF-INSTALL/]] can be used to download and install asdf asdf systems.  Many lisp libraries are now distributed as ADSF systems, and ASDF is bundled with Allegro Common Lisp, SBCL, ECL, and OpenMCL.

=== Sections ===

* [[/Installing ASDF/]]: for lisp implementations that do not include it.
* [[/Configuring ASDF/]]: specifying the asdf respository.
* [[/Using ASDF/]]: loading, compiling, and recompiling asdf systems.
* [[/Definition Files/]]: creating your own systems.
* [[/ASDF-INSTALL/]]: downloading and installing packages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Engine Thermostat''' controls how much coolant flows throw the engine.  It should be replaced if the engine is consistently cold (if the thermostat is stuck open) or if the car is getting too hot or over heating (if the thermostat is stuck closed).  Its a good idea to replace the thermostat at the same time your changing the coolant, because the coolant must be drained to do this.

==Tools/Parts needed==
* Oil pan
* A new engine thermostat
* A new engine thermostat seal (optional)
* Socket wrench set
* A Phillips-head screw driver
* A set of large pipe pliers (optional)

==Procedure==
# To start remove the engine coolant by removing the plastic Phillips-head screw from under the radiator, letting the coolant fall into the oil pan
# Now we have to make some room to work, remove the alarm horn and move it aside.  
# Lower the belt adjustment bolt that is sticking put vertically next to the engine thermostat until it is out of the way.
# Loosen the bracket with the Phillips-head screw driver and pull it off.  If you are having trouble getting it off use a set of large pipe pliers to twist if off (being careful not to damage it).
# Now remove the three bolts holding engine thermostat with your Socket wrench and pull it away.
# Push the new one in to place with the seal on it and tighten the bolts.
# Reattach the hose and tighten with the Phillips-head screw driver.
# Rise the pulley adjustment bolt all the way and reattach the alarm horn
# Put the coolant back in the engine and your done.

Many lisp systems encoding SBCL, Allegro, OpenMCL and ECL are bundled with asdf.  To test this, try entering the following into a lisp interpreter:

&lt;pre&gt;(require 'asdf)&lt;/pre&gt;

If this succeeds, ASDF is installed and ready to go.

===Downloading ASDF===

If you have cvs installed, you can download asdf with the following commands. Press enter when prompted for a password.

&lt;pre&gt;cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cclan.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cclan login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cclan.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cclan co -P asdf&lt;/pre&gt;

Alternatively, you can just download asdf.lisp from http://cclan.cvs.sourceforge.net/cclan/asdf/

Under Debian Linux and related systems, you can install asdf with:

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install cl-asdf&lt;/pre&gt;

===Loading ASDF===

Save asdf.lisp and associated other files into a location of your choice.  For example my lisp files are in my home directory at &lt;code&gt;/Users/Kirk/lisp&lt;/code&gt;.  If you install ASDF system wide it may be under &lt;code&gt;/user/local/lib&lt;/code&gt;.

Open the startup file for the lisp you are running.  For clisp this will be &lt;code&gt;~/.clisprc.lisp&lt;/code&gt;.  For cmucl try &lt;code&gt;~/.cmucl-init&lt;/code&gt;. Add the following line:

&lt;pre&gt;(load #p&quot;/Path/to/asdf.lisp&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;

Replace &lt;code&gt;/Path/to&lt;/code&gt; with the full path to the asdf.lisp file.

For example, if you've used cl-asdf package on Debian (or Ubuntu) GNU/Linux, the command will look like this:
&lt;pre&gt;(load #p&quot;/usr/share/common-lisp/source/cl-asdf/asdf.lisp&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Configuring ASDF ==

Most frequently, you will add settings for asdf to the configuration file for your lisp system.  For example, sbcl uses &lt;code&gt;~/.sbclrc&lt;/code&gt; while cmucl uses &lt;code&gt;~/.cmucl-init&lt;/code&gt;.  The most important setting is the central registry described below.  Most of the other configuration settings are optional.

=== asdf:*central-registry* ===

The central-registry is a list of file directories that will be searched for system definition (&lt;code&gt;.asd&lt;/code&gt;) files and is the least you need to know about configuring ASDF.  The safest way to modify asdf:*central-registry* is to use pushnew to push a new directory onto the list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;(pushnew &quot;/Path/to/asd/files/&quot; asdf:*central-registry*)&lt;/source&gt;

=== Automatically updating stale fasl files ===

From http://www.cliki.net/asdf

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
;;; If the fasl was stale, try to recompile and load (once). Since only SBCL
;;; has a separate condition for bogus fasls we retry on any old error
;;; on other lisps. Actually, Allegro has a similar condition, but it's 
;;; unexported.  Works nicely for the ACL7 upgrade, though.
;;; CMUCL has an invalid-fasl condition as of 19c.
(defmethod asdf:perform :around ((o asdf:load-op) (c asdf:cl-source-file))
  (handler-case (call-next-method o c)
    (#+sbcl sb-ext:invalid-fasl 
     #+allegro excl::file-incompatible-fasl-error
     #+lispworks conditions:fasl-error
     #+cmu ext:invalid-fasl
     #-(or sbcl allegro lispworks cmu) error ()
     (asdf:perform (make-instance 'asdf:compile-op) c)
     (call-next-method))))
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Alternative to symlinks, search directories recursively ===

The standard way of adding libraries to ASDF involves either:
# Making a symbolic link for the &lt;code&gt;.asd&lt;/code&gt; file in a directory listed in &lt;code&gt;asdf:*central-registry*&lt;/code&gt;  or
# Adding directories to &lt;code&gt;asdf:*central-registry*&lt;/code&gt;.
The following code snippit shows how to recursively search through subdirectories for asdf packages.

From http://www.cliki.net/asdf

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
;; An alternative to the standard sysdef search can be defined.  This                
;; code below can be dropped into your Lisp init files and customized.               
;; It will search for all ASDF systems in subdirectories of the                      
;; specified directories.  That lets you simply &quot;drop-in&quot; new packages               
;; into one of the specified directories, and it will be available for               
;; loading without any further steps.                                                
(in-package #:asdf)
(defvar *subdir-search-registry* '(#p&quot;/my/lisp/libraries/&quot;)
  &quot;List of directories to search subdirectories within.&quot;)
(defvar *subdir-search-wildcard* :wild
  &quot;Value of :wild means search only one level of subdirectories; value of :wild-inferiors means search
 all levels of subdirectories (I don't advise using this in big directories!)&quot;)
(defun sysdef-subdir-search (system)
  (let ((latter-path (make-pathname :name (coerce-name system)
                                    :directory (list :relative
                                                     *subdir-search-wildcard*)
                                    :type &quot;asd&quot;
                                    :version :newest
                                    :case :local)))
    (dolist (d *subdir-search-registry*)
      (let* ((wild-path (merge-pathnames latter-path d))
             (files (directory wild-path)))
        (when files
          (return (first files)))))))
(pushnew 'sysdef-subdir-search *system-definition-search-functions*)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

First I would like to say tinki tara for making this website. I am also a Miskitu student living in Nicaragua. I noticed a few errors in your website. First of all. The word &quot;tiara&quot; refers to young females, for males it is &quot;wahma&quot;. Also you can not say &quot;Jan utla ra sa&quot;. When the word is possesive you have to change the word completely most of the time. In this case if it is first person possesive it changes to &quot;waitla&quot;, second person &quot;wamtla&quot;, third person &quot;watla&quot;. So in this case it would be &quot;Jan watla ra sa.&quot; But if you wanted to say houses in general then you would say &quot;Utla nani ba&quot;.

== Thank You! ==

I just returned from two weeks in Nicaragua where I was helping with the rebuilding of the Miskito village of Betania.  I was very surprised to see a language course online in Miskito.  The little bit I learned helped with the communication barrier and I made some Miskito friends for life!  Thanks again.  Teri H.</text>

== Major Events in the Mid to Late Twentieth Century ==


===  1947 - Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947===

New Zealand gained total independence from Britain, through the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act of 1947. New Zealand today is an independent member of the British Commonwealth.

The British monarch is the constitutional head of state, although plays no part in the running of New Zealand. The Governor General, who is generally a New Zealander, represents the monarch in New Zealand's Parliament.

===  1953 - Tangiwai Rail Disaster===

At 10:21pm on Christmas Eve 1953, a lahar from a nearby volcano knocked out the rail bridge over the Whangaehu River at Tangiwai, just before the Wellington–Auckland night express train was due to cross it. The train plunged into the flooded river at high speed, killing 151 of the 285 passengers on board. At the time it was the eighth biggest rail disaster the world had seen. The whole nation, with a population of just over 2 million were stunned. For his actions in attempting to stop the train by running along the line waving a torch, Arthur Cyril Ellis was awarded the George Medal, New Zealand's highest civilian award.

===  1967 - Introduction of a Decimal Currency===

A decimal currency was introduced to New Zealand, replacing the old system of pounds, shillings and pence.

The first decimal coins were introduced on the 10th of July 1967.

===  1981 - Springboks Rugby Tour===

With the controversial tour of New Zealand by the South African Springboks rugby team, many New Zealanders were unhappy because the South Africans were still involved in apartheid. The tour was approved by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union, and the Government didn't intervene because the Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, had a policy that politics shouldn't interfere with sport. 

The protests against the tour were some of the most violent in New Zealand history. Protesters filled the streets outside stadiums where games were being played, and successfully invaded the pitch at some games, stopping gameplay.

After the tour, the popularity of Rugby Union in New Zealand decreased until the All Blacks won the Rugby World Cup in 1987.

== Objectives ==
After completing this section, you should know:
* The characteristics of endocrine glands and hormones
* The position of the main endocrine glands in the body
* The relationship between the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus
* The main hormones produced by the two parts of the pituitary gland and their effects on the body
* The main hormones produced by the pineal, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal glands, the pancreas, ovary and testis and their effects on the body
* What is meant by homeostasis and feedback control
* The homeostatic mechanisms that allow an animal to control its body temperature, water balance, blood volume and acid/base balance

== The Endocrine System ==
In order to survive, animals must constantly adapt to changes in the environment. The '''nervous''' and '''endocrine systems''' both work together to bring about this adaptation. In general the nervous system responds rapidly to short-term changes by sending electrical impulses along nerves and the endocrine system brings about longer-term adaptations by sending out chemical messengers called hormones into the blood stream.

For example, think about what happens when a male and female cat meet under your bedroom window at night. The initial response of both cats may include spitting, fighting and spine tingling yowling - all brought about by the nervous system. Fear and stress then activates the adrenal glands to secrete the hormone '''adrenaline''' which increases the heart and respiratory rates. If mating occurs, other hormones stimulate the release of ova from the ovary of the female and a range of different hormones maintains pregnancy, delivery of the kittens and lactation.

== Endocrine Glands And Hormones ==
Hormones are chemicals that are secreted by '''endocrine glands'''. Unlike exocrine glands (see chapter 5), endocrine glands have no ducts, but release their secretions directly into the blood system, which carries them throughout the body. However, hormones only affect the specific '''target organs''' that recognize them. For example, although it is carried to virtually every cell in the body, '''follicle stimulating hormone''' (FSH), released from the '''anterior pituitary gland''', only acts on the follicle cells of the ovaries causing them to develop.

A nerve impulse travels rapidly and produces an almost instantaneous response but one that lasts only briefly. In contrast, hormones act more slowly and their effects may be long lasting. Target cells respond to minute quantities of hormones and the concentration in the blood is always extremely low. However, target cells are sensitive to subtle changes in hormone concentration and the endocrine system regulates processes by changing the rate of hormone secretion.

The main endocrine glands in the body are the '''pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid''', and '''adrenal glands''', the '''pancreas, ovaries''' and '''testes'''. Their positions in the body are shown in diagram 16.1.

[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Main endocrine organs of the body.jpg]]

Diagram 16.1 - The main endocrine organs of the body

== The Pituitary Gland And Hypothalamus ==
The '''pituitary gland''' is a pea-sized structure that is attached by a stalk to the underside of the cerebrum of the brain (see diagram 16.2). It is often called the “master” endocrine gland because it controls many of the other endocrine glands in the body. However, we now know that the pituitary
gland is itself controlled by the '''hypothalamus'''. This small but vital region of the brain lies just above the pituitary and provides the link between the nervous and endocrine systems. It controls the '''autonomic nervous system''', produces a range of hormones and regulates the secretion of many others from the pituitary gland (see Chapter 7 for more information on the hypothalamus).

The pituitary gland is divided into two parts with different functions - the '''anterior''' and '''posterior pituitary''' (see diagram 16.3).

[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Position of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus.jpg]]

Diagram 16.2 - The position of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus

[[File:Anterior and posterior pituitary.jpg]]

Diagram 16.3 - The anterior and posterior pituitary

The '''anterior pituitary gland''' secretes hormones that regulate a wide range of activities in the body. These include:
:1. '''Growth hormone''' that stimulates body growth.
:2. '''Prolactin''' that initiates milk production.
:3. '''Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH''') that stimulates the development of the '''follicles''' of the ovaries. These then secrete '''oestrogen''' (see chapter 6).

== The Pineal Gland ==
The '''pineal gland''' is found deep within the brain (see diagram 16.4). It is sometimes known as the ‘third eye” as it responds to light and day length. It produces the hormone '''melatonin''', which influences
the development of sexual maturity and the seasonality of breeding and hibernation.

[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Pineal gland.jpg]]

Diagram 16.4 - The pineal gland

== The Thyroid Gland ==
The '''thyroid gland''' is situated in the neck, just in front of the windpipe or trachea (see diagram 16.5). It produces the hormone '''thyroxine''', which influences the rate of growth and development of young animals. In mature animals it increases the rate of chemical reactions in the body.

Thyroxine consists of 60% '''iodine''' and too little in the diet can cause '''goitre''', an enlargement of the thyroid gland. Many inland soils in New Zealand contain almost no iodine so goitre can be common
in stock when iodine supplements are not given. To add to the problem, chemicals called '''goitrogens'''
that occur naturally in plants like kale that belong to the '''cabbage family''', can also cause goitre even when there is adequate iodine available.

Diagram 16.5 - The thyroid and parathyroid glands

== The Parathyroid Glands ==
The '''parathyroid glands''' are also found in the neck just behind the thyroid glands (see diagram 16.5). They produce the hormone '''parathormone''' that regulates the amount of '''calcium''' in the blood and influences the excretion of '''phosphates''' in the urine.

== The Adrenal Gland ==
The '''adrenal glands''' are situated on the cranial surface of the kidneys (see diagram 16.6). There are two parts to this endocrine gland, an outer '''cortex''' and an inner '''medulla'''.

[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Adrenal glands.jpg]]

Diagram 16.6 - The adrenal glands

The '''adrenal cortex''' produces several hormones. These include:
:1. '''Aldosterone''' that regulates the concentration of '''sodium and potassium''' in the blood by controlling the amounts that are secreted or reabsorbed in the kidney tubules.
:2. '''Cortisone''' and '''hydrocortisone''' (cortisol) that have complex effects on glucose, protein and fat metabolism. In general they increase metabolism. They are also often administered to animals to counteract allergies and for treating arthritic and rheumatic conditions. However, prolonged use should be avoided if possible as they can increase weight and reduce the ability to heal.
:3. '''Male and female sex hormones''' similar to those secreted by the ovaries and testes. 

The hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex also play a part in “'''general adaptation syndrome'''” which occurs in situations of prolonged stress.

The '''adrenal medulla''' secretes '''adrenalin''' (also called '''epinephrine'''). Adrenalin is responsible for the so-called flight fight, fright response that prepares the animal for emergencies. Faced with a perilous situation the animal needs to either fight or make a rapid escape. To do either requires instant energy, particularly in the skeletal muscles. Adrenaline increases the amount of blood reaching them by causing their blood vessels to dilate and the heart to beat faster. An increased rate of breathing increases the amount of oxygen in the blood and glucose is released from the liver to provide the fuel for energy production. Sweating increases to keep the muscles cool and the pupils of the eye dilate so the animal has a wide field of view. Functions like digestion and urine production that are not critical to immediate survival slow down as blood vessels to these parts constrict.

Note that the effects of adrenalin are similar to those of the sympathetic nervous system.

== The Pancreas ==
In most animals the '''pancreas''' is an oblong, pinkish organ that lies in the first bend of the small intestine (see diagram 16.7). In rodents and rabbits, however, it is spread thinly through the mesentery
and is sometimes difficult to see.

[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals The pancreas.jpg]]

Diagram 16.7 - The pancreas

Most of the pancreas acts as an '''exocrine gland''' producing digestive enzymes that are secreted into the small intestine.
The endocrine part of the organ consists of small clusters of cells (called '''Islets of Langerhans''') that secrete the hormone '''insulin'''. This hormone regulates the amount of '''glucose''' in the blood by increasing the rate at which glucose is converted to glycogen in the liver and the movement of glucose
from the blood into cells.

In '''diabetes mellitus''' the pancreas produces insufficient insulin and glucose levels in the blood can increase to a dangerous level. A major symptom of this condition is glucose in the urine.

== The Ovaries ==
The ovaries, located in the lower abdomen, produce two important sex hormones.
:1. The '''follicle cells''', under the influence of '''FSH''' (see the pituitary gland above), produce '''oestrogen''', which stimulates the development of female sexual characteristics - the mammary glands, generally smaller build of female animals etc. It also stimulates the thickening of the lining of the uterus in preparation for pregnancy (see chapter 13).
:2. '''Progesterone''' is produced by the '''corpus luteum''', the endocrine gland that develops in the empty follicle following ovulation (see chapter 13). It promotes the further preparation of the uterine lining for pregnancy and prevents the uterus contracting until the baby is born.

== The Testes ==
Cells around the sperm producing ducts of the testis produce the hormone '''testosterone'''. This stimulates the development of the male reproductive system and the male sexual characteristics - generally larger body of male animals, mane in lions, tusks in boars, etc.

== Summary ==
* '''Hormones''' are chemicals that are released into the blood by '''endocrine glands''' i.e. Glands with no ducts. Hormones act on specific '''target organs''' that recognize them.
* The main endocrine glands in the body are the '''hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid''' and '''adrenal glands,''' the '''pancreas, ovaries''' and '''testes'''.
* The '''hypothalamus''' is situated under the '''cerebrum''' of the brain. It produces or controls many of the hormones released by the pituitary gland lying adjacent to it.
* The '''pituitary gland''' is divided into two parts: the '''anterior pituitary''' and the '''posterior pituitary'''.
* The '''anterior pituitary''' produces:
:* '''Growth hormone''' that stimulates body growth
:* '''Prolactin''' that initiates milk production
:* '''Follicle stimulating hormone''' ('''FSH''') that stimulates the development of '''ova'''
:* '''Luteinising hormone (LH''') that stimulates the development of the '''corpus luteum'''
:* Plus several other hormones
* The '''posterior pituitary''' releases:
:* '''Antidiuretic hormone''' (ADH) that regulates '''water loss''' and raises '''blood pressure'''
:* '''Oxytocin''' that stimulates milk “let down”.
* The '''pineal gland''' in the brain produces '''melatonin''' that influences '''sexual development''' and '''breeding cycles'''.
* The '''thyroid gland''' located in the neck, produces thyroxine, which influences the '''rate of growth''' and '''development''' of young animals. Thyroxine consists of 60% '''iodine'''. Lack of iodine leads to '''goitre'''.
* The '''parathyroid glands''' situated adjacent to the thyroid glands in the neck produce '''parathormone''' that regulates blood '''calcium''' levels and the excretion of '''phosphates'''.
* The '''adrenal gland''' located adjacent to the kidneys is divided into the outer '''cortex''' and the inner '''medulla'''.
* The '''adrenal cortex''' produces:
:* '''Aldosterone''' that regulates the blood concentration of '''sodium and potassium'''
:* '''Cortisone''' and '''hydrocortisone''' that affect '''glucose, protein''' and '''fat''' metabolism
:* Male and female '''sex hormones'''
* The '''adrenal medulla''' produces '''adrenalin''' responsible for the '''flight, fright, fight''' response that prepares animals for emergencies.
* The '''pancreas''' that lies in the first bend of the small intestine produces''' insulin''' that regulates blood '''glucose''' levels.
* The '''ovaries''' are located in the lower abdomen produce 2 important sex hormones:
:* The '''follicle cells''' of the developing ova produce '''oestrogen''', which controls the development of the '''mammary glands''' and prepares the uterus for pregnancy.
:* The '''corpus luteum''' that develops in the empty '''follicle''' after ovulation produces '''progesterone'''. This hormone further prepares the '''uterus''' for pregnancy and maintains the pregnancy.
* The '''testes''' produce '''testosterone''' that stimulates the development of the '''male reproductive system''' and '''sexual characteristics'''.


== Homeostasis and Feedback Control ==

Animals can only survive if the environment within their bodies and their cells is kept constant and independent of the changing conditions in the external environment. As mentioned in module 1.6, the process by which this stability is maintained is called homeostasis. The body achieves this stability by constantly monitoring the internal conditions and if they deviate from the norm initiating processes that bring them back to it. This mechanism is called feedback control. For example, to maintain a constant body temperature the hypothalamus monitors the blood temperature and initiates processes that increase or decrease heat production by the body and loss from the skin so the optimum temperature is always maintained. The processes involved in the control of body temperature, water balance, blood loss and acid/base balance are summarized below. 


== Summary of Homeostatic Mechanisms ==

=== 1.	Temperature control ===

The biochemical and physiological processes in the cell are sensitive to temperature. The optimum body temperature is about 37 C [99 F] for mammals, and about 40 C [104 F] for birds. Biochemical processes in the cells, particularly in muscles and the liver, produce heat. The heat is distributed through the body by the blood and is lost mainly through the skin surface. The production of this heat and its loss through the skin is controlled by the hypothalamus in the brain which acts rather like a thermostat on an electric heater. . 

(a) When the body temperature rises above the optimum, a decrease in temperature is achieved by:

*	Sweating and panting to increase heat loss by evaporation.

*	Expansion of the blood vessels near the skin surface so heat is lost to the air.

*	Reducing muscle exertion to the minimum.

(b) When the body temperature falls below the optimum, an increase in temperature can be achieved by:

*	Moving to a heat source e.g. in the sun, out of the wind. 

*	Increasing muscular activity

*	Shivering

*	Making the hair stand on end by contraction of the hair erector muscles or fluffing of the feathers so there is an insulating layer of air around the body

*	Constricting the blood vessels near the skin surface so heat loss to the air is decreased

=== 2.	Water balance ===

The concentration of the body fluids remains relatively constant irrespective of the diet or the quantity of water taken into the body by the animal. Water is lost from the body by many routes (see module 1.6) but the kidney is the main organ that influences the quantity that is lost. Again it is the hypothalamus that monitors the concentration of the blood and initiates the release of hormones from the posterior pituitary gland. These act on the kidney tubules to influence the amount of water (and sodium ions) absorbed from the fluid flowing along them.

(a) When the body fluids become too concentrated and the osmotic pressure too high, water retention in the kidney tubules can be achieved by:

*	An increased production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland, which causes more water to be reabsorbed from the kidney tubules. 

*	A decreased blood pressure in the glomerulus of the kidney results in less fluid filtering through into the kidney tubules so less urine is produced. 

(b) When the body fluids become too dilute and the osmotic pressure too low, water loss in the urine can be achieved by:

*	A decrease in the secretion of ADH, so less water is reabsorbed from the kidney tubules and more diluted urine is produced. 

*	An increase in the blood pressure in the glomerulus so more fluid filters into the kidney tubule and more urine is produced. 

*	An increase in sweating or panting that also increases the amount of water lost. 

Another hormone, aldosterone, secreted by the cortex of the adrenal gland, also affects water balance indirectly. It does this by increasing the absorption of sodium ions (Na-) from the kidney tubules. This increases water retention since it increases the osmotic pressure of the fluids around the tubules and water therefore flows out of them by osmosis.

=== 3.	Maintenance of blood volume after moderate blood loss ===

Loss of blood or body fluids leads to decreased blood volume and hence decreased blood pressure. The result is that the blood system fails to deliver enough oxygen and nutrients to the cells, which stop functioning properly and may die. Cells of the brain are particularly vulnerable. This condition is known as shock. 

If blood loss is not extreme, various mechanisms come into play to compensate and ensure permanent tissue damage does not occur. These mechanisms include:

*	Increased thirst and drinking increases blood volume.

*	Blood vessels in the skin and kidneys constrict to reduce the total volume of the blood system and hence retain blood pressure. 

*	Heart rate increases. This also increases blood pressure.

*	Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is released by the posterior pituitary gland. This increases water re-absorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney tubules so concentrated urine is produced and water loss is reduced. This helps maintain blood volume. 

*	Loss of fluid causes an increase in osmotic pressure of the blood. Proteins, mainly albumin, released into the blood by the liver further increase the osmotic pressure causing fluid from the tissues to be drawn into the blood by osmosis. This increases blood volume. 

*	Aldosterone, secreted by the adrenal cortex, increases the absorption of sodium ions (Na-) and water from the kidney tubules. This increases urine concentration and helps retain blood volume. 

If blood or fluid loss is extreme and the blood volume falls by more than 15-25%, the above mechanisms are unable to compensate and the condition of the animal progressively deteriorates. The animal will die unless a vet administers fluid or blood.

=== 4.	Acid/ base balance ===

Biochemical reactions within the body are very sensitive to even small changes in acidity or alkalinity (i.e. pH) and any departure from the narrow limits disrupts the functioning of the cells. It is therefore important that the blood contains balanced quantities of acids and bases. 

The normal pH of blood is in the range 7.35 to 7.45 and there are a number of mechanisms that operate to maintain the pH in this range. Breathing is one of these mechanisms.

Much of the carbon dioxide produced by respiration in cells is carried in the blood as carbonic acid. As the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood increases the blood becomes more acidic and the pH decreases. This is called acidosis and when severe can cause coma and death. On the other hand, alkalosis (blood that is too alkaline) causes over stimulation of the nervous system and when severe can lead to convulsions and death. 

(a) When vigorous activity generating large quantities of carbon dioxide causes the blood to becomes too acidic it can be counteracted in two ways:

*	By the rapid removal of carbon dioxide from the blood by deep, panting breaths

	By the secretion of hydrogen ions (H+) into the urine by the kidney tubules. 

(b) When over breathing or hyperventilation results in low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and the blood is too alkaline, various mechanisms come into play to bring the pH back to within the normal range. These include:

*	A slower rate of breathing
*	A reduction in the amount of hydrogen ions (H+) secreted into the urine. 

=== SUMMARY ===

Homeostasis is the maintenance of constant conditions within a cell or animal’s body despite changes in the external environment. 

Thebody temperature of mammals and birds is maintained at an optimum level by a variety of heat regulation mechanisms. These include: 
*	Seeking out warm areas,
*	Adjusting activity levels, 
blood vessesl on the body surface, 
*	Contraction of the erector muscles so hairs and feathers stand up to form an insulating layer, 
*	Shivering, 
*	Sweating and panting in dogs. 

Animals maintain water balance by: 
*	adjusting level of antidiuretic hormone(ADH) 
*	adjusting level of aldosterone, 
*	adjusting blood flow to the kidneys 
*	adjusting the amount of water lost through sweating or panting. 

Animals maintain blood volume after moderate blood loss by:
*	Drinking, 
*	Constriction of blood vessels in the skin and kidneys, 
*	increasing heart rate, 
*	secretion of antidiuretic hormone 
*	secretion of aldosterone 
*	drawing fluid from the tissues into the blood by increasing the osmotic pressure of the blood.

Animals maintain the acid/base balance or pH of the blood by:
*	Adjusting the rate of breathing and hence the amount of CO2 removed from the blood. 
*	Adjusting the secretion of hydrogen ionsinto the urine.

==1. Explain and demonstrate the main points of good hiking practice, such as pacing, speed, resting, and etiquette. ==
Because hiking is a recreational experience, hikers expect it to be pleasant. Sometimes hikers can interfere with each other's enjoyment, or that of other users of the land, but they can minimize this interference by following good etiquette. For example:

* When two groups of hikers meet on a steep trail, there may be contention for use of the trail. To avoid conflict, a custom has developed in some areas whereby the group moving uphill has the right-of-way. In other situations, the larger of the two groups will usually yield to the smaller.
* Being forced to hike much faster or slower than one's natural pace can be annoying, and difficult to maintain consistently. More seriously, walking unnaturally fast dramatically increases fatigue and exhaustion, and may cause injury. If a group splits between fast and slow hikers, the slow hikers may be left behind or become lost. A common custom is to encourage the slowest hiker to hike in the lead and have everyone match that speed. Another custom is to have an experienced hiker sweep up the rear, to ensure that everyone in the group is safe and nobody straggles.
* Hikers often enjoy the silence and solitude of their surroundings. Loud sounds, such as shouting or loud conversation, disrupt this enjoyment. Some hikers purposely avoid loud sounds, out of deference to other hikers. Staying quiet will also increase the likelihood of encountering wildlife. (This is a hazard if dangerous animals are present; see &quot;Personal safety hazards&quot;.)
* Hikers sometimes trespass onto private property from public land or rights of way (easements). Such trespass can alienate the property owners and (in countries where rights of way are not protected by law) close down hiking rights-of-way. To maximize hiking opportunities for everyone, most hikers will either stay on public land and easements, or solicit permission from property owners. Staying on well-marked trails avoids the possibility of trespass.
* Tree branches or other vegetation often hang low across trails. A passing hiker may cause a tree branch to snap back in the face of a hiker behind. While it is courteous to warn following hikers if a branch is likely to snap back, it is every hiker's responsibility to allow enough space between himself and the hiker ahead to avoid the hazard.
* When two groups of hikers meet, it is considered a common courtesy to exchange greetings (either verbal or physical (e.g. smiles and friendly nods)). To pass another group without such acknowledgement is seen as rude.

==2. Explain the importance and method of proper foot care with regard to cleanliness, care of nails, socks, shoe selection, and first aid of tender or blistered feet. ==
===Proper Footwear===
The most important aspect of proper foot care for hiking is to have proper footwear.  It is a good idea to wear two pairs of socks on a hike: a thin pair next to your skin, and a thick, padded pair over the thin pair.  This arrangement will cause the socks to rub against one another instead of rubbing against your feet causing a blister.  When shopping for hiking boots or shoes, wear the type of socks you intend to wear when you hike.  You will likely need to buy hiking shoes or boots that are a little larger than your normal shoe size to accommodate the extra thickness of socks.

Hiking shoes should have good ankle support and should lace up tightly.  Look for good tread on the soles and sturdy construction.  You should wear new shoes for a couple of days of regular use before pressing them into service on a hike - this will break them in.  New shoes are another common cause of blistering.

===Dry Feet===
Bring extra socks with you on a hike so that you can change them if they get wet.  Hiking in wet feet will soften the skin and lead to blisters.  It can also lead to fungus growth and immersion foot.  Immersion foot occurs when feet are cold and damp while wearing constricting footwear. Unlike frostbite, immersion foot does not require freezing temperatures and can occur in temperatures up to 60° Fahrenheit (about 16° Celsius). Immersion foot can occur with as little as twelve hours' exposure. Affected feet become numb and then turn red or blue. As the condition worsens, they may swell. Advanced immersion foot often involves blisters and open sores, which lead to fungal infections; this is sometimes called jungle rot. If left untreated, immersion foot usually results in gangrene, which can require amputation. If immersion foot is treated properly, complete recovery is normal, though it is marked by severe short-term pain when feeling is returning. Like other cold injuries, immersion foot leaves sufferers more susceptible to it in the future.

Immersion foot is easily prevented by keeping the feet warm and dry, and changing socks frequently when the feet cannot be kept dry.

===Nail Care===
Before you set out on a hike, check that your toenails are properly trimmed.  They should be trimmed straight across, such that they do not hang over the edge of the toe. Cutting them too short or in a curved shape can cause them to become ingrown.  Ingrown toenails tend to cut into the toe at the edges of the nail, leading to infection and extreme discomfort.  

Leaving your toenails too long can make them susceptible to breaking off, and that can force you to have to cut them too short - again leading to an ingrown nail.  Also, long toenails will wear holes in socks more quickly than properly trimmed nails.

===Blisters===
Blisters on the feet and toes are caused by something repeatedly rubbing on them, such as a sock or an ill-fitting shoe.  As soon as you detect soreness, you should stop and examine the foot.  Reddened skin is the first sign that a blister may be forming.  Covering the affected area with an adhesive bandage or even a small strip of duct tape will help prevent a blister from forming.  If possible, cover the area with a donut-shaped moleskin before covering with a bandage.  This will help alleviate pressure on the area.

If the blister has already formed, ''do not puncture it.''  Leave the skin covering the blister as intact as possible, as it provides a sterile environment underneath.  If the blister is on a weight-bearing surface on the bottom of the foot and you ''must'' puncture it, use a sterile needle, and make as few punctures as possible - just enough to drain the liquid.  Do not peel any skin off the blister.  You can sterilize a needle or a pin by passing it through a flame.

Wash the affected area as well as you can using purified water or a sterile wipe.  Again, cover the blister with a donut-shaped moleskin, apply some antibiotic ointment, and cover with a bandage.

==3. Make a list of proper clothing to be worn on a hike in both hot and cool weather. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Camping/Clothing}}

==4. Make a list of needed gear for a long day hike in the wilderness and a short coun­try hike. ==
For either hike, you should bring the following:
* Water bottle
* Water purification equipment
* First aid kit 
* Blister kit may be part of the first aid kit):
** Mole skin 
** Bandages
** Needle or pin
** Lighter
** Antibiotic ointment
** Antiseptic wipes
* Extra socks
* Extra shoe/boot laces
* Flashlight (torch)
* Compass
* Map of the area
* Guide book about the trail you are using
* Day pack (a small backpack)
* Hiking shoes or boots
* Knife
* Rope
* Trail mix
* Insect repellant

For a long day hike you will also need to plan on a meal or two.  Select foods that are low-weight  (you will have to carry it remember), high calorie, and easy to prepare (or require no preparation).  If your food requires preparation, be sure to bring whatever you need to prepare it (such as a backpacking stove, a mess kit, and eating utensils).

Carry your trail mix where it is easily available for snacking as you walk.

==5. List five safety and courtesy rules to be used in wilderness trail hiking and road hiking. ==
# Respect both public and private property
# Do not trespass.
# Dispose of trash properly.  If no disposal facilities are available, pack out what you pack in.
# Do not destroy the flora or fauna.
# Have a good sense of humor.
# Help others with their necessities.
# Do not play games that can hurt others.
# Follow and obey the leaders.
# Finish what you start.

==6. Explain the importance of drinking water and list three signs of contaminated water. ==
[[Image:Giardia lamblia SEM 8698 lores.jpg|thumb|Giardia lamblia, an intestinal parasite]]

For good health and to avoid injury, it is important to stay hydrated.  This is accomplished by drinking lots of water while hiking.  Signs of dehydration include infrequent urination, strong-smelling urine, dark yellow urine, headaches, irritability, and lack of perspiration.  You need to drink ''before'' you feel thirsty.

It is a good idea to bring a water filter or purification tablets with you on a hike so that you can refill your water containers at every opportunity.  Note that water becomes more scarce as you go higher into the mountains, so if you are climbing a mountain trail, stock up on water whenever you see it.  

Make sure you know how to use your filter and make sure it works ''before'' setting out on a trip.  You do not want to discover that your filter is defective at a time when your health (and possibly your life) depends on its proper operation.

It is especially important to purify any water you collect on the trail before drinking it.  Bacterial contamination cannot be reliably detected without lab equipment, so it is better to be safe than sorry.  Purifying clean water will not hurt you.  Even water that looks clean could be rife with harmful bacteria.  Giardia is a very common parasite that will cause sickness in humans.  Diarrhea and intestinal cramps are very real possibilities for those who do not heed these warnings.

Signs that water is contaminated include the following:
#'''Nothing living in the water:''' If you cannot find any signs of life in the water, it is very likely to be unfit for drinking.  If plants and animals cannot live in the water, it may contain poisonous chemicals.
#'''Oil film on surface:''' Runoff from roadways can deposit petroleum-based oil in the water.  If you see a rainbow slick on the surface, this is a sign of pollution.
#'''Foul Odor:''' Foul smelling water is sure to be foul tasting as well, but the damage caused by drinking it may well extend beyond the taste buds.

==7. Explain the importance of proper eating while hiking. ==
Food is the body's fuel, and hiking is an activity that burns fuel like a Hummer.  Hiking doubles your caloric burn rate, so you must compensate for this by doubling your caloric intake.  

The most important nutrient for the hiker is water.  The absolute minimum is two liters per day.  It is far better to drink one liter per hour, especially if it is hot, or if the hiking is strenuous.

The remainder of the diet should be made up of 60% carbohydrates, 10-15% proteins, and 25-30% fats.  For extended, long-distance hikes, it is important to be sure you get sufficient quantities of vitamins and minerals too.

==8. Describe proper clothing and foot gear for cold and hot wet weather hiking. ==
===Cold, Wet Weather===
Keeping dry is not only important for comfort - in cold weather it is also essential to safety.  Bring an extra set of clothing with you so that if you do get wet, you'll have something to change into.  To stay dry, wear a water-proof outer layer.  It is also essential to dress in layers and to vent your clothing to avoid sweating.  Perspiration will soak your clothing just as quickly as precipitation.

Footwear should be as waterproof as possible and provide warmth.  To avoid blisters, footwear also needs to be snug.  Many hikers prefer mukluks for cold-weather hiking.

===Hot, Wet Weather===
As with cold, wet weather, you should bring an extra set of dry clothing for hot weather.  Bring a poncho, or other waterproof outer layer to keep yourself dry.  Waterproof hiking boots will help maintain dry feet.

==9. Submit a written plan for a 10-mile (16.1 km) hike which includes: map route, clothing list, equipment list, and water and/or food. ==
This is an excellent activity for an AY Companion class, as they are required to plan a 10-mile (or half-day) hike.  Pathfinders can work together or individually on this activity.  Equipment should include the '''''Ten Essentials:'''''

# Map
# Compass (optionally supplemented with a GPS receiver)
# Sunglasses and sunscreen
# Extra food and water
# Extra clothes
# Headlamp/flashlight
# First aid kit
# Fire starter 
# Matches 
# Knife

A 10-mile hike should include one meal, and it should provide about 2000 calories.  The meal can consist of the &quot;main&quot; portion which is eaten as a meal, as well as &quot;trail food&quot; which is eaten while walking.  GORP ('''G'''ood '''O'''ld '''R'''aisins and '''P'''eanuts) is the classic hiking snack.

The description of the route can be simple, but it should be detailed enough so that others can retrace your steps.  Leave the plan with someone who is not going with you in case there is an emergency and you are unable to return when planned.  This information is essential to a rescue team should the services of one become necessary.

==10. Use a topographical map and/or a road map in planning and doing one of the hikes in Requirement 11.==
A topographic map shows the contours of the land.  These tell the map reader where hills are, and how steep they are.  They also show where you can expect to find water (which you ''will'' filter before drinking, right?) or interesting scenery (such as water falls and overlooks).  A good topographical map will also show roads and trails - essential information for planning a hike!  Many of the topographical maps made for hikers will also indicate distances between trail intersections for easy distance calculations (just add them up).

More details for reading a topographic map can be found in the answers to the [[../Orienteering|Orienteering]] honor.

==11. Have the following hiking record: ==
===a. One five-mile (8 km) rural or town hike ===
A 5-mile hike can be done either in the morning or in the afternoon.  It is an excellent Sabbath afternoon activity.  One way to do this is to plan to hike around the neighborhood  after church.  If you schedule it to coincide with a church potluck you won't have to worry about feeding the troops.  You will want to plan the route ahead of time though, and be sure it is at least five miles.
===b. One five-mile ( 8 km) hike on a wilderness trail ===
Again, a five mile hike can be done in half a day, either in the morning or in the afternoon.  However, unless your church is located near a wilderness trail, this will involve some travel to reach the trailhead.  Your Pathfinders may be able to eat a sack lunch in the car either on the way there, or on the way back.
===c. Two 10-mile (16.1 km) day hikes on different routes ===
A 10-mile hike will generally take all day, so plan to set out early in the morning and return in the evening.  Everyone should bring a lunch.
===d. One 15-mile (24.2 km) hike on a wilderness trail ===
Fifteen miles is a long hike, and should not be attempted in a single day except by people in excellent physical condition.  If you can, plan an overnight hike, going at least 7.5 miles into the wilderness, and then hiking back out the next day.  Note that this will meet a major requirement for the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Backpacking|Backpacking]] and  [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Pioneering|Pioneering]] honors.

===e. Within a month of each hike, write a short report, giving dates, routes cov­ered, weather, and any interesting things you saw. ===

This hiking record can be incorporated into the regular Pathfinder program so that any Pathfinder who has fully participated in club events will meet this requirement in a two-year period.  Plan a 5-mile hike every fall - alternating every year between rural/town hikes and wilderness trail hikes.  Have your Companion class plan a 10-mile hike each Spring.  The 15-mile hike can be done every other year, perhaps during the summer.  Plan an evaluation session during the meeting after each hike, and have each Pathfinder turn in the report.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm a bit curious how Colin Creevey got into hogwarts when &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; students are supposed to give a blood status, And he can't be half-blood, Cuz' he was attacked in harry's second year, Eh? [[User:ChazzJr|ChazzJr]] 04:21, 3 October 2007 (UTC)
:Things are a bit confusing with the Creevey brothers. Colin, who would be 6th year in DH, and Dennis, who would be 4th year, are brothers; the fact that there are two of them from the same family seems to indicate that there is wizard blood in their background. I'll have to check. I don't actually think that the Basilisk cares about Blood status. Sure, Colin was attacked, and Justin Finch-Fletchley, who was Muggle-born, and Hermione. But so was Penelope Clearwater, who very likely was at least half-blood, and Harry himself is half-blood as well and the Basilisk certainly attacked him. And when Colin was attacked, he was found by teachers and taken to the Hospital Wing by teachers, so it may be less common knowledge that Creevey was attacked... or at least, it might not seem as immediate. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:49, 3 October 2007 (UTC)
::Note the write-up on Colin's character page: Colin sneaked back in with the DA, he did not actually attend Hogwarts that year. JKR has said that he was Muggle-born, or at least could not prove Blood status. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:43, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

== Reason for Harry's death ==

Does not this analysis miss the vital reason for Harry to go to his death, whcih must be a real death- that he himself is a Horcrux?[[Special:Contributions/85.210.137.136|85.210.137.136]] ([[User talk:85.210.137.136|discuss]]) 13:32, 17 March 2012 (UTC)
:Yes, but... we cover that more thoroughly elsewhere and don't need to rehash it here. Perhaps we should touch on it in teh GP section, though... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:05, 5 July 2012 (UTC)</text>

== What are SMEs? ==

SMEs are usually enterprises that employ no more than 250 employees.  The technical definition varies from country to country in the Asia-Pacific region but is usually based on employment, assets, or a combination of the two.  Some countries have different definitions for SMEs in the manufacturing and services sector and may exempt firms from specialized industries or firms that have shareholdings by parent companies.  Figure 1 illustrates the range of SME definitions in the Asia-Pacific region.

== Why are SMEs important? ==

''The only way to reduce poverty in a sustainable way is to promote economic growth, through wealth and employment creation.  In developing countries, SMEs are the major source of income, a breeding ground for entrepreneurs and a provider of employment.''
UNIDO, WSIS Report, February 2003

SMEs are important because on average, they comprise over 95 percent of the economy.  Figure 2 illustrates the importance of SMEs to the national economy in a sample of countries from the Asia - Pacific region.  The contributions of SMEs to employment and the countries' gross domestic product (GDP) are by no means trivial.  As of July 2006, close to 140 million SMEs in 130 countries employed 65 percent of the total labour force.[2]

Moreover, SMEs are the driver of economic growth and innovation. Figure 3 describes both
reinforcing dynamics. The total number of SMEs in the economy depends on the rate of SME
creation and rate of SME destruction. Profitable market opportunities increase the rate of SME
creation. This increases the total number of SMEs in the country, which increases job creation
and income per capita.As people become wealthier,they will increase their consumption,which
in turn will open up new market opportunities that will entice the creation of more SMEs.
Contrary to multinational corporations, the growth of SMEs directly benefits the country
because most SMEs are domestic firms.This reinforcing dynamic generates economic growth.

The reinforcing loop of innovation also drives economic growth. As the number of SMEs
increases, their knowledge of their product and industry increases. Their knowledge allows
them to innovate on the product or process, which helps them form a competitive advantage
to generate more profits.Again,market opportunity as captured by the profitability of SMEs will
encourage more people to establish their own SMEs to capture the opportunity.

In addition, the development of SMEs can also help to achieve other development goals. SMEs
can either provide goods and services in areas critical to development, such as health and
education, or provide a source of income to disadvantaged people. For example, efforts to
develop women entrepreneurs help increase gender equality by providing women with a
source of income.

==How Has the Knowledge-Based Economy Impacted SMEs?==

''For countries in the vanguard of the world economy, the balance between knowledge and resources has shifted so far towards the former that knowledge has become perhaps the most important factor determining the standard of living – more than land, than tools, than labour. Today’s most technologically advanced economies are truly knowledge-based.''&lt;br&gt;

World Development Report, 1999&lt;br&gt;

Countries in the world are moving from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy in
which economic growth is dependent on a country’s ability to create, accumulate and
disseminate knowledge. Computers and the Internet catalyzed the growth of the knowledge
economy by enabling people to codify knowledge into a digital form easily transmitted to
anywhere around the world. People who have access to this new wave of ICT – broadly defined
as technology that can be used for transmitting and/or processing information – are part of an
information society connected to a virtual network that constantly creates and disseminates
new information. ICT has sped up the pace of globalization and increased the complexity of
business practices because firms not only need to be familiar with their local context but also
with global developments. Thus, to compete in the knowledge economy, countries need a
strong ICT-literate skills base that can innovate and adapt quickly to change. More value is
placed on the knowledge worker than ever before. Knowledge, change and globalization are
the driving forces of the new economy.

The knowledge economy has impacted SMEs both positively and negatively. On the positive
side, because the knowledge economy relies heavily on ICT, it has led to the rapid growth of ICT
sectors.Many countries such as India, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan have created enabling environments to ensure that SMEs are well positioned to capture these emerging business
opportunities. India, for example, offered relief from import duties for IT hardware, tax
deductions for income earned from software exports, and tax holidays, and developed
infrastructure in Software Technology Parks.4 India’s thriving ICT sector has in turn propelled the country’s economic growth.SMEs outside the ICT sector have also benefited by adopting ICT in
their own operations, enabling them to communicate quickly, increase productivity, develop
new business opportunities, and connect to global networks.
Conversely, the reliance on ICT in the knowledge economy means that those SMEs who have
not yet adopted ICT will have trouble surviving.For example, 60 percent of Intel’s material orders are now done electronically.5 With e-procurement becoming mainstream in developed
countries, SMEs that do not have that capability will not be chosen as business partners.
Additionally, SMEs that have not adapted to the faster pace and increasing complexity of the
way businesses are conducted will lose out to the increasing competition brought about by
globalization.

! colspan=1 | Box 1: B2B Marketplace Opens New Buying and Selling Opportunities
Alibaba.com6
|-
|Alibaba.com is the largest online marketplace for both international and domestic
business-to-business (B2B) exchanges in China. In August 2005, Yahoo! paid USD 1
billion for 40 percent of Alibaba’s ownership stake. Alibaba International caters to SMEs
interested in international trade. It has one million registered SMEs from over 200
countries and territories with more than 300,000 visitors per day. It was ranked by Alexa,
which conducts independent web traffic ratings of websites around the world, as the
world’s most popular site in the categories of Import-Export and International
Business and Trade. Alibaba also has a B2B portal for domestic businesses
(http://www.china.Alibaba.com).With over 6 million registered users that are verified by
a third-party credit agency, it is the largest online SME community in China. Members
pay an annual subscription fee that entitles them to post offers on the website.SMEs do
not need sophisticated ICT tools to join the community; only Internet access, email, and
basic use of web browsers are required. SMEs have a strong incentive to have the basic
ICT capacity to join the network because it offers them a wealth of buying and selling
opportunities.
Alibaba overcame the online payment security problem by creating AliPay
(http://www.Alipay.com), a proprietary fraud prevention system that allows any
individual or business with an email address and credit card to make transactions online.
AliPay partners with leading banks in China including China Merchants Bank, China
Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China.

==How do SMEs use ICT?==

SME usage of ICT ranges from basic technology such as radio and fixed lines to more advanced
technology such as email, e-commerce, and information processing systems (see Figure 4).
Using advanced ICT to improve business processes falls into the category of e-business.7
However, not all SMEs need to use ICT to the same degree of complexity. The first ICT tool that
most SMEs adopt is having basic communications with a fixed line or mobile phone, whichever
is more economical or most convenient for their business.This allows the SME to communicate with its suppliers and customers without having to pay a personal visit. After acquiring basic
communication capabilities, the next ICT upgrade is usually a PC with basic software. Even
without Internet connectivity, SMEs can use PCs for basic word processing, accounting,
and other business practices. With the Internet, SMEs are able to use more advanced
communications capabilities such as email, file sharing, creating websites, and e-commerce.
This may be sufficient for most SMEs, especially those in service industries such as tourism.
SMEs in manufacturing may adopt more complex IT tools such as ERP software or inventory
management software. SMEs may adopt the tools progressively or jump immediately to
advanced ICT capabilities.

! colspan=1 | '''Box 2: Mobile Phone Use Transforms Business'''
|-
|The use of mobile phones has helped many entrepreneurs reduce costs and improve
business processes. In many developing countries, farmers now use mobile phones to
find best prices for their produce. In a recent study by Harvard University, Professor
Robert Jenson found that the use of mobile phones reduced waste by 4.7–6 percent and
reduced price dispersion by 63–86 percent in the sardines market in Kerala.8 Some South
Africans and Kenyans have actually tied mobile phones around the necks of elephants
to track them in the jungles. According to Professor Wouter van Hoven of the University
of Pretoria’s Center for Wildlife Management, using mobile phones can reduce the cost
of tracking wildlife by 60 percent.9

==What Types of Advanced ICT Products are SMEs Starting to Use?==

Like any firm, an SME decides which type of ICT products to adopt based on the concrete
benefits they can bring to its core business, the ICT capacity of its employees, and the financial resources available. Most people are familiar with basic ICT such as fixed phone lines, mobile phones, fax, computers, and basic document processing software – like Microsoft Office. Advanced communication technology, however, is more complex. Advanced communication technology relies primarily on the Internet and the intranet, whichallow people within the firm to share files with each other over the same network. Having Internet connectivity enables firms to do faster research, set up websites, conduct e-commerce, and set up video conferences. One of the most revolutionizing developments in advanced communication technology is Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).VoIP includes all types of voice communication transmitted through the Internet, whether it is between computer and computer or in hybrid form between computer and regular phone. It competes directly with traditional fixed line and mobile phone operators.Users only pay for their dial-up, broadband, or wireless Internet connection. iSuppli, a market-research firm, estimates the number of VoIP residential users worldwide will reach 197 million by 2010.10

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=1 | '''Box 3: Skype Revolutionizes Communication Technology'''
|-
|Skype (http://www.skype.com) is one of the most popularly used VoIP programmes.
It allows users to talk for free over the Internet after downloading a simple free
programme onto their computers. Skype also offers additional services for a low price.
To connect with parties who use ordinary phones, Skype offers at a lower price ‘Skype In’,
which allows people to call a Skype user with a regular phone, and ‘Skype Out’, which
allows a Skype user to call a regular phone (starting from USD 0.02 per minute). Skype’s
growth has been astounding. In less than three years, it has attracted over 54 million
worldwide subscribers, of which about 30 percent – primarily SMEs – use Skype for
business purposes.11 eBay acquired Skype for USD 2.6 billion in cash and shares in
September 2005.

Most complex of all is advanced IT. It is often very expensive, sophisticated and takes more time to implement by a firm. SMEs can sign up for one or all available services. In order to reduce costs, some firms opt to outsource this component or use an application service provider (ASP) that provides functional software capabilities over the Internet. Figure 5 lists the major types of products.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=2 | '''Figure 5:Major Products of Advanced Information Technology'''
|-
|'''Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)'''
ERP offers a single repository for information on all business functions – human resources,
manufacturing, inventory, marketing, sales, accounting, and tax. It allows all levels of a
business to obtain real-time management information for their area of responsibility.
|-
|'''Customer Relationship Management (CRM)'''
CRM software integrates people and technology to maximize external relationships.
Functionality includes: sales contact management, activity history, order entry, customer
service and support, field service, lead generation, data mining, etc.
|-
|'''Supply Chain Management (SCM)'''
SCM software helps streamline the procurement of raw materials and delivering of finished
products. It helps to decrease error rates, delays, and to increase efficiency. e-Procurement is
often a part of SCM.
|-
|'''Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)'''
EAI integrates different types of ERP and other software systems through a common problem
in order to synchronize the processing, storing, and transmitting of information.
|-
|'''Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing (RPM)'''
Over the next 20 years, RPM will have a profound effect upon the global manufacturing
technology. RPM can reduce the new product design phase from 90 days to just three days.
It is still an infant industry based upon newly invented technologies, but it is apparent that
RPM will dramatically reduce the cost and time required to convert a new product design to
a practical manufacturing process.
|-
|'''Knowledge Management (KM)'''
KM systems help a firm to better organize and share the knowledge of its employees. They
help the firm take better advantage of its human resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Optimizations ==
Optimization can be regarded as a directed effort to increase the performance of something, an important concept in engineering, in particular, the case of Software engineering that we are covering. We will deal with specific computational tasks and best practices to reduce resources utilizations, not only of system resources but also of programmers and users, all based in optimal solutions evolved from the empirical validating of hypothesis and logical steps.

All optimization steps taken should have as a goal the reduction of requirements and the promotion of the program objectives. Any claims can only be substantiated by [[#Profiling|profiling]] the given problem and the applied solution. '''Without profiling any optimization is moot'''.

Optimization is often a topic of discussion among programmers and not all conclusions may be consensual, since they are very closely related to the goals, the programmer experience, and dependent of specific setups. The level of optimization will mostly depend directly from actions and decisions the programmer makes. Those can be simple things, from basic coding practices to the selection of the tools one choses to use to create the program.  Even selecting the right compiler will have an impact.  A good optimizing compiler permits the programmer to define his aspirations for the optimized outcome; how good the compiler is at optimizing depends on the level of satisfaction the programmer gets from the resulting compilation. 

=== Code ===
One of the safest ways of optimization is to reduce complexity, ease organization and structure and at the same time evading code bloat. This requires the capacity to plan without losing track of future needs, in fact it is a compromise the programmer makes between a multitude of factors. 

Code optimization techniques, fall into the categories of:
* High Level Optimization
** Algorithmic Optimization (Mathematical Analysis)
** Simplification

* Low Level Optimization
** Loop Unrolling
** Strength Reduction
** Duff's Device
** Clean Loops

==== KISS ====
The &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot; ([[w::KISS principle|KISS]]) principle, calls for giving simplicity a high priority in development. It is very similar to a maxim from Albert Einstein's that states, &quot;everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.&quot;, the difficulty for many adopters have is to determine what level of simplicity should be maintained. In any case, analysis of basic and simpler system is always easier, removing complexity will also open the door for code reutilization and a more generic approach to tasks and problems.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.&quot;|caption=—Martin Golding}}

==== Code cleanup ====
Most of the benefits of a code cleanup should be evident to the experienced programmer, they become a second nature due to the adoption of good programming style guidelines. But as in any human activity, errors will occur and exceptions made, so, in this section we will try to remember the small changes that can have an impact on the optimization of your code. 

;'''the use of virtual member functions'''
Remember the cost on performance of virtual members functions (covered when introducing the [[C++ Programming/Classes#virtual|virtual keyword]]). At the time optimization becomes an issue most project design change regarding optimization will not be possible, but artifacts may remain to be cleaned up. Guaranteeing that no superfluous use of virtual (like in the leaf nodes of your class/structure inheritance trees), will permit other optimizations to occur (i.e.: compiler [[#auto inline|optimized inline]]).

==== The right data in the right container ====
One of the top bottleneck on today's systems is dealing with memory [[w:Cache|caches]], be it [[w:CPU cache|CPU cache]] or the physical memory resources, even if [[w:Paging|paging]] problems are becoming increasingly rare. Since the data (and the load level) a program will handle is highly predictable at the design level, the better optimizations still fall to the programmer.

One should store the appropriate data structure in the appropriate container, prefer storing pointers to objects rather than the objects themselves, use &quot;smart&quot; pointers (see the Boost library) and don't attempt to store auto_ptr&lt;&gt; in STL containers, it is not allowed by the Standard, but some implementations are known to incorrectly allow it.

Avoid removing and inserting elements in the middle of a container, doing it at the end of the container has less overhead. Use STL containers when the number of objects is unknown; use static array or buffer when it is known. This requires the 
understanding of not only each container, but its O(x) guarantees.

Take as an example the STL containers on the issue of using (&lt;code&gt;myContainer.empty()&lt;/code&gt;) versus (&lt;code&gt;myContainer.size() == 0&lt;/code&gt;), it is important to understand that depending on the container type or its implementation, the size member function might have to count the number of objects before comparing it to zero. This is very common with list type containers. 

While the STL attempts to provides optimal solutions to general cases, if performance does not match your requirements think about writing your own optimal solution for your case, maybe a custom container (probably based on vector) that does not call individual object destructors and uses custom allocators that avoid the delete time overhead. 

Using pre-allocation of memory can provide some speed gains and be as simple remember to use the STL vector&lt;T&gt;::reserve() if permitted.  Optimize the use system's memory and the target hardware.  In today's systems, with virtual memory, threads and multiple-cores (each with its own cache) where I/O operations on the main memory and the amount of time spent moving it around, can slow things down.  This can become a performance bottleneck.  Instead opt for array-based data structures (cache-coherent data structures), like the STL vector, because data is stored contiguously in memory, over pointer-linked data structures as in linked lists. This will avoid &quot;death by swapping&quot;, as the program needs to access highly fragmented data, and will even help the memory pre-fetch that most modern processors do today.

Whenever possible avoid returning containers by value, pass containers by reference.

==== Consider security costs ====
Security always has a cost, even in programming. For any algorithm, adding checks, will result in increase the number of steps it takes to finish. As languages get more complex and abstract, understanding all the finer details (and remember them) increases the time needed to obtain the required experience. Sadly most of the steps taken by some of the implementors of the C++ language lack visibility to the programmer and since they are outside of the standard language, aren't often learned. Remember to familiarized yourself with any extensions or particularities of the C++ implementation you are using.

As a language that puts the power of decision into the programmer's hands, C++ provides several instances where the a similar result can be archived by similar but distinct means. Understanding the sometimes subtle differences is important. For instance, when deciding the needed requirements in [[C++ Programming/STL#vector|accessing members of a std::vector]], you can chose [], at() and the an iterator, all have similar results but with distinct performance costs and security considerations.

==== Code reutilization ====
Optimization is also reflected on the effectiveness of a code. If you can use an already existing code base/framework that a considerable number of programmers have access to, you can expect it to be less buggy and optimized to solve your particular need.

Some of these code repositories are available to programmers as libraries. Be careful to consider dependencies and check how implementation is done: if used without considerations this can also lead to code bloat and increased memory footprint, as well as decrease the portability of the code. We will take a close look at them in the [[../Compiler/Linker/Libraries|Libraries Section]] of the book.

To increase code reutilization you will probably fragment the code in smaller sections, files or code, remember to equate that more files and overall complexity also increases compile time.

==== Function and algorithmic optimizations ====
When creating a function or a algorithm to address a specific problem sometimes we are dealing with mathematical structures that are specifically indicated to be optimized by established methods of mathematical minimization, this falls into the specific field of [[Engineering Analysis/Optimization|Engineering analysis for optimization]].

{{TODO|Extend with small examples}}

===== Use of {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} =====
As seen before when examining the {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} keyword, it allows the definition of an inline type of function, that works similarly to [[X86 Disassembly/Code Optimization#Loop_Unwinding|loop unwinding]] for increasing code performance. A non-inline function requires a call instruction, several instructions to create a stack frame, and then several more instructions to destroy the stack frame and return from the function. By copying the body of the function instead of making a call, the size of the machine code increases, but the execution time ''decreases''. 

In addition to using the {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} keyword to declare an inline function, optimizing compilers may decide to make other functions inline as well (see [[C++ Programming/Optimization#Compiler optimizations|Compiler optimizations]] section).

==== ASM ====
If portability is not a problem and you are proficient with assembler you can use it to optimize computational bottlenecks, even looking at the output of a disassembler will often help looking for ways to improve it. Using ASM in your code brings to the table some other problems (maintainability for instance) so use it at a last resort in you optimization process, and if you use it be sure to document what you have done well.

The [[x86 Disassembly]] Wikibook provides some [[x86 Disassembly/Optimization Examples|optimization examples]] using x86 ASM code.

{{NOTE|If using the gcc compiler, the -S option will output the compilation generated assembly.}}

=== Reduction of compile time ===
Some projects may take a long time to compile. To reduce the time it takes to finish compiling the first step is to check if you have the any Hardware deficiencies. You may be low in resources like memory or just have a slow CPU, even having your HD with a high level of fragmentation can increase compile time.

On the other side, problems may not be due to hardware limitations but in the tools you use, check if you are using the right tools for the job at hand, see if you have the latest version, or if do, if that is what is causing trouble, some incompatibilities may result from updates. In compilers new is always better, but you should check first what has changed and if it serves your purposes.

Experience tells that most likely if you are suffering from slow compile times, the program you are trying to compile was probably poorly designed, check the structure of object dependencies, the includes and take some the time to structure your own code to minimize re-compilation after changes if the compile time justifies it.

Use pre-compiled headers and external header guards this will reduce the work done by the compiler.

=== Compiler optimizations ===
[[w:Compiler optimization|Compiler optimization]] is the process of tuning, mostly automatically, the output of a compiler in an attempt to improve the operations the programmer has requested, so to minimize or maximize some attribute of an compiled program '''while ensuring the result is identical'''. By rilling in the compiler optimization programmers can write more intuitive code, and still have them execute in a reasonably fast way, for instance skipping the use of [[C++ Programming/Operators Table|pre-increment/decrement operators]].

Generally speaking, optimizations are not, and can not be, defined on the C++ standard. The standard sets rules and best practices that dictate a normalization of inputs and outputs. The C++ standard itself permits some latitude on how compilers perform their task since some sections are marked as implementation dependent but generally a base line is established, even so some vendors/implementors do creep in some singular characteristic apparently for security and optimization benefits.

One notion that is good to keep in mind is that there is not a perfect C++ compiler, but most recent compilers will do several simple optimizations by default, that attempt to abstract and take advantage of existing deeper hardware optimizations or specific characteristics of the target platform, most of these optimizations are almost always welcomed but it is up to the programmer still to have and idea of what is going on and if indeed they are beneficial. As a result it is highly recommended to examine your compiler documentation on how it operates and what optimizations are under the programmer's control, just because a compiler can make some optimization in theory does not mean that it will or even that it will result in an optimization.   

The most common compiler optimizations options available to the programmer fall into three categories:
*'''Speed'''; improving the runtime performance of the generated object code. This is the most common optimization
*'''Space'''; reducing the size of the generated object code
*'''Safety'''; reducing the possibility of data structures becoming corrupted (for example, ensuring that an illegal array element is not written to)

Unfortunately, many &quot;speed&quot; optimizations make the code larger, and many &quot;space&quot; optimizations make the code slower -- this is known as the [[w:space-time tradeoff|space-time tradeoff]].

==== auto-{{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} ====
Auto-inlining is similar to implicit inline. Inlining can be an optimization, or a pessimization depending on the code and optimization options selected.

==== Making use of extended instructions sets ====
{{TODO|[[w:3DNow!|3DNow!]], [[w:MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], etc...}}

==== GPU ====
{{TODO|Add missing information}}

=== Run time ===
As we have seen before runtime is the duration of a program execution, from beginning to termination. This is were all resources needed to run the compiled code are allocated and hopefully released, this is the final objective of any program to be executed, as such it should be the target for ultimate optimizations.   

=== Memory footprint ===
In the past computer memory has been expensive and technologically limited in size, and scarce resource for programmers.  Large amounts of ingenuity was spent in implement complex programs and process huge amounts of data using as little as possible of this resource.  Today, modern systems contain enough memory for most usages but capacity demands and expectations have increased as well; as such, techniques to minimize memory usage may still be essential and in fact operational performance has gained a new momentum with the increasing importance of mobile computing.

Measuring the memory usage of a program is difficult and time consuming, and the more complex the program is the harder it becomes to get good metrics. One other side of the problem is that there are no standard benchmarks (not all memory use is equal) or practices to deal with the problem beyond the most basic and generic considerations.  

{{NOTE|Take in consideration that performing memory tests in a debug compile will not, in most circumstances, produce any valid insight on memory use, at best it can provide you an indication of the expected ceiling for memory use in the tested functions.}}

;Remember to use &lt;code&gt;swap()&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; (or deque).
When attempting to reduce reduce (or zero) the size of a vector or deque using the &lt;code&gt;swap()&lt;/code&gt;, on a standard container of that type, will guarantee that the memory is released and no overhead buffer for growth is used. It will also avoid the fallacy of using &lt;code&gt;erase()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;reserve()&lt;/code&gt; that will not reduce the memory footprint. 

==== Lazy initialization ====
It is always needed to maintain the balance between the performance of the system and the resource consumption. 
Lazy instantiation is one memory conservation mechanism, by which the object initialization is deferred until it is required.

Look at the following example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt; 

class Wheel {
        int speed;
    public:
        int getSpeed(){
            return speed;
        }
        void setSpeed(int speed){
            this-&gt;speed = speed;
        }
};

class Car{
    private:
        Wheel wheel;
    public:
        int getCarSpeed(){
            return wheel.getSpeed();
        }
        char const* getName(){
            return &quot;My Car is a Super fast car&quot;;
        }
};

int main(){
    Car myCar;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; myCar.getName() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Instantiation of class Car by default instantiates the class Wheel. The purpose of the whole class is to just print the name of the car.  Since the instance wheel doesn't serve any purpose, initializing it is a complete resource waste.

It is better to defer the instantiation of the un-required class until it is needed. Modify the above class Car as follows:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Car{
    private:
        Wheel *wheel;
    public:
        Car() {
            wheel=NULL; // a better place would be in the class constructor initialization list
        }
        ~Car() {
            delete wheel;
        }
        int getCarSpeed(){
            if (wheel == NULL) {
                wheel = new Wheel(); 
            }
            return wheel-&gt;getSpeed();
        }
        char const* getName(){
            return &quot;My Car is a Super fast car&quot;;
        }
};
&lt;/source&gt;
Now the Wheel will be instantiated only when the member function getCarSpeed() is called.

=== Parallelization ===
As seen when examining [[C++ Programming/Threading|threads]], they can be a &quot;simple&quot; form of taking advantage of hardware resources and optimize the speed performance of a program. When dealing with thread you should remember that it has a cost in complexity, memory and if done wrong when synchronization is required it can even reduce the speed performance, if the design permits it is best to allow threads to run as unencumbered as possible.

=== I/O reads and writes ===

=== Profiling ===
Profiling is a form of [[w:dynamic program analysis|dynamic program analysis]] (as opposed to [[w:static code analysis|static code analysis]]), consists in the study of program's behavior using information gathered as the program executes. its purpose is usually to determine which sections of a program to optimize. Mostly by determining which parts of a program are taking most of the execution time, causing bottleneck on accessing resources or the level of access to those resources.

Global clock execution time should be the bottom line when comparing applications performance. Select your algorithms by examining the asymptotic order of executions, as in a parallel setup they will continue to give the best performance. In the case you find an hotspot that can not be parallelized, even after examining higher levels on the call stack, then you should attempt to find a slower but parallelizable algorithm.

[edit] == '''STAFFING K-12 SCHOOL DISTRICTS for the FUTURE''' ==

A highly competitive, global marketplace of the future requires students to possess not only 21st century skills such as collaboration and problem solving, but also the ability to use technology imaginatively, practically, and efficiently. Technology Directors (TD) need to be committed to creating academic learning spaces within their schools that can change readily to meet and accept the needs of students preparing for careers and college. In order for TD to create technologically sound academic learning spaces, the TD must have expert technology staff on board.

Skilled individuals are needed to design, oversee, set up, run and support technology. Advertisement for suitably qualified individuals with specialized skills is bound to attract several candidates that meet the criteria. However, not all applicants will be a good match for the position. It means that someone has to sort through several resume and quickly filter out non-matching applicants.It is no doubt an expensive process in terms of cost and time. A director of technology will have to plan carefully, allocate a budget, set a time frame, and liaise with administration. Creating job description, providing office space, determining salary and benefits are critical parts of the process that cannot be overlooked.

Whether you are starting out with a small staff that assists with prioritized technology problems or with a highly developed staff trained to tackle the most complex situations, the TD will eventually be required to hire technical people.

[edit] == '''Retention of the Best Tech Staff''' ==

Once the best people are hired and in place, the next biggest challenge for any TD rests in the retention of the technology staff. Retaining good employees is an important process in any type of employment, whether the setting is academia or industry.  Retaining employees takes a balance of benefits and compensation. Human Resources (HR) is responsible for the earliest negotiation of the employment package, but the TD is responsible for day-to-day efforts that give employees reasons for staying. The TD must develop a plan for retention of technology staff that includes preventive measures to ensure employee satisfaction. 

A few recommendations for keeping tech staff happy are: 

•	Give staff challenging work assignments. Staff should be encouraged to be creative by implementing new and more efficient ways of performing their duties.

•	Give staff a sense of connection with the department’s mission. In addition to their usual duties, staff should be involved with the internal decision process of the department such as the goal-setting process.

•	Give staff the opportunity to learn new skills, reskilling ensures that the staff’s skills remain current. Since technology professionals know they will need ongoing training to keep up with the fast changing tech field, offering potential employees the opportunity to update skills through professional development is a good incentive. Retraining also leads to advancement opportunities and increases in pay, both good motivators for new and existing employees.

•	Give staff a competitive salary that is inline with the current marketplace wages. Take initiatives from the high tech industry and offer innovative compensation and benefit packages.
 
•	Give staff professional-looking working conditions.

•	Give staff opportunities for career advancement within the school district. Have annual reviews that include effective appraisal, evaluation, and performance goal setting.

•	Keep regular meetings to track morale.

•	Give staff an organizational culture that adds fun in the work life. A positive work environment that provides the opportunity for team building.

•	Give staff the opportunity to network and learn from others in their field by attending conferences and trade shows.

The benefits of working in the academic environment, as opposed to the high-tech industry, are points to be exploited by the TD in retention of good employees.

•	Fewer work hours – employees can enjoy a normal working day.

•	Less pressure than meeting the demands of high-tech jobs.

•	A more casual work environment  - suits are not necessary.

•	A job stability that is not as volatile as the high-tech industry.

•	A more flexible work environment - in addition to vacations, other forms of compensation could be special time-off and flexible time schedules.

[edit] == '''The Work Environment''' ==

Although the actual renovation and construction work will be directed through the Facilities Department, the TD will certainly be involved in the space planning process of the technology department. The typical school district is traditionally comprised of buildings spread out over a designated area that serve the academic needs of the children who live within its boundaries. Administration buildings, high schools, and numerous middle and elementary schools are the usual assembly of buildings. Technology departments can be found in all these buildings and the TD needs to assess the needs of each school to determine how many technology staff to provide.
After the TD establishes the number of personnel she/he will manage, the space requirements for each person must be determined. If the TD is taking over an existing department, an assessment of space usage should still be done. The TD should conduct interviews to determine the staffs space requirements. While some jobs such as secretarial and administration positions require a standard work area, a computer workshop demands special considerations. Interviewing each technology support (TS) staff will provide the answers to questions such as:
  
•	How much work surface does each TS staff person need to work on hardware that is brought into the shop? 

•	How much storage space is needed for the hardware awaiting repairs and awaiting pickup or delivery?

•	Will the TS staff need office space as well as shop space? 

•	What kind of equipment does the TS staff need to perform their duties?

The answers to these questions should provide the TD with enough information to begin planning the space requirements for the technology department’s computer workshop.  In addition to space requirements, the TD must also know what kind of work surface is appropriate for the efficient functioning of each job. The computer workshop will need workbenches for the TS staff to perform the repairs. A typical workbench should have all the essential equipment that the technology support staff will need each day, plenty of storage space for tools and work surface space for making repairs. The workbench will need a power supply with grounded electrical outlets and multiple LAN connections for testing equipment. It will also need an antistatic mat covering the top of the work surface. 

Other important questions to be answered are:
 
•	Should the department be responsible for integrating technology into the curriculum or will the need be filled by a separate department? 

•	Will the technology department also provide training to staff and faculty or will another department be responsible for technology training?

If the TD is also responsible for instructional technology, then the space requirements to accommodate these functions and activities will change the size and type of the area. Collaborative work spaces for two will be necessary in order to provide one-on-one training and small seminar spaces for groups. 




[edit] Section 2

     * '''REFERENCES and RESOURCES''' *

-----------------
I am revising the section:
Things to consider
* Consider whether you need part-time technology coordinators to maintain equipment or to provide support for teachers in classroom.&lt;br&gt;
* Do you need tech coordinators to support tech-based resources (software, video programs, online databases, internet use)&lt;br&gt;
* Your budget may dictate what you get.  A low budget may only provide part time aides which may supply less than adequate support.&lt;br&gt;

I will cover most of these general ideas elsewhere in the chapter

If you need anything, dont be 'fraid to ask! [[User:ChazzJr|ChazzJr]]

Just to let everybody know why ive stoped(d), i have NOT. i'm just working on [[Chronicles of Narnia|this.]] [[User:ChazzJr|ChazzJr]] 

hi! im back from my hiatus from muggles guide, just to let people know.
hi! [[User:ChazzJr|ChazzJr]] 

== Snidgets and Streelers and Tebos, oh yeah! ==

Well, actually, maybe not... Anyway, I've put them into the Table of Contents and the Magic section, and have set up frameworks for all of them. Maybe you could do some of the filling in? Thank you. Here are the links, in case you need them: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tebo|Tebo]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Winged horse|Winged horse]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Streeler|Streeler]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Snidget|Snidget]]. If you don't get to them, I will, but it will be some time away, as I'm doing characters now, and I'm only up to the Ls (Lee Jordan). [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:45, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

== Magical Creatures in need of write-up ==

Okay - I've done frameworks for all the creatures you had put in as of this evening and fixed a few of the frameworks up as well. (A lot had the old relative link &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;{{../../Magic}}&quot; instead of the new absolute link &quot;{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; which would break when we tried to make a print version of the book.) I've also changed the frameworks page so that if you pull an entry off the frameworks list, it should be fine.

The pages that are just framework / stubs are: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bundimun|Bundimun]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Chizpurfle|Chizpurfle]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Clabbert|Clabbert]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crup|Crup]] (which is spelled with a C, not a K, in OotP -- I was confused because Grubbly-Plank talks about Knarls in the same sentence), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dugbog|Dugbog]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Erkling|Erkling]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fire Crab|Fire Crab]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Glumbumble|Glumbumble]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Graphorn|Graphorn]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Griffin|Griffin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippocampus|Hippocampus]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horklump|Horklump]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Jarvey|Jarvey]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Jobberknoll|Jobberknoll]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Kappa|Kappa]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Lobalug|Lobalug]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mackled Malaclaw|Mackled Malaclaw]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Moke|Moke]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mooncalf|Mooncalf]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Quintaped|Quintaped]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ramora|Ramora]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Re'em|Re'em]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Runespoor|Runespoor]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Shrake|Shrake]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Snidget|Snidget]] (you might want to refer also to ''Quidditch Through the Ages'' for that one), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Streeler|Streeler]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tebo|Tebo]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Winged horse|Winged horse]].

Happy editing! [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:37, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

:Just for the sake of completeness: here are the next few that we've added: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Nogtail|Nogtail]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Nudu|Nudu]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occamy|Occamy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pogrebin|Pogrebin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Porlock|Porlock]]. I guess I'm thinking that as you add content to the pages, you can mark them here so you don't lose track... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:52, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

::And just as a reminder: We can't simply copy descriptions from Fantastic Beasts... that is called violation of copyright and is rather frowned upon, as it is illegal. We have to rewrite the descriptions in our own words. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:25, 21 April 2008 (UTC)

==The Vandal==

Hi ChazzJr.  I'm not sure weather that Vandal's actions should warrant a total ban or not.  I generally leave the length of ban to the admins to decide.  Might be worth asking Webaware who did the ban.  Cheers --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 18:55, 30 March 2008 (UTC)

== Voldy ==

Was a bit of a pain, Voldemort's role in DH came to over 36,000 characters. Hope I hit all the high points. Do look at it and see if there were any I missed... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:56, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

== Fire Crabs ==

Actually, the bit that Rita wrote did mention fire crabs in passing; I went back to original sources and checked. Last time I put that back, I included page number in our copy in the history. check the edit history for the reference. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:37, 12 December 2008 (UTC)

== re: max doeys ==

Probably better to be a little less confrontational with the vandals at least at first. Normally what we do is put in the code &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:test}}~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; which makes the &quot;please help improve WB&quot; box that is there now... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:25, 16 December 2008 (UTC)
:he also seems to have given up after his last few changes got backed out. Haven't seen him around in a while. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:23, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

==Applegrunt Potion ==

Thanks for the info. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:33, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

== Narnia ==

Not a problem. Things have been kind of hectic here, so I haven't had time to do more than just get the landing page and its templates up; I'll get the section headings and frameworks up pretty quickly, I hope. I'll let you know when we're ready for real content. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:35, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
:I think there's enough there that you can add content now. Frameworks are [[Chronicles of Narnia/Frameworks|here]]... let me know if you run into trouble. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:52, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
::Goofed on the character framework, but it's fixed now. Fixed it for Edmund as well. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:10, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

= Objectives =

A reference for all of the keywords and statements used in Active Server Pages.  Items are grouped by function and contain a short description and example of their usage.

= Content =

This contains a quick reference of all of the language elements in Active Server Pages.

== Array Functions ==

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Statement
! Purpose
|-
| '''Array'''
| This function creates an instance of an array.  The arguments to this function are the elements you want to see the array with.  It is possible to have no arguments at all.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;aOption = Array(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Erase'''
| Subroutine which clears all of the elements of the array.  If the elements are numeric values, then they will all be set to zero.  If the elements are strings then they will all be made empty.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Erase(aYear)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Filter'''
| Selectively include or exclude elements from an array.  The optional third argument is a boolean which indicates whether items are included.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Filter(aArray, &quot;remove&quot;, False)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Join'''
| Build a string by joining all of the elements in the array.  A &quot;glue string&quot; is inserted between each element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;sCSV = Join(aArray, &quot;,&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''LBound'''
| Return the lower bound of an array meaning the smallest possible array index that may be used for the array.  All arrays in ASP start with the index '''0''', so you shouldn't need to use this.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;nStart = LBound(aArray)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''ReDim'''
| Use this to re-dimension (or resize an array) after it has already been declared.  If the '''Preserve''' keyword is used, existing elements will not be destroyed in the process.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;ReDim Preserve aField(nCount + 10)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Split'''
| Takes a string argument and creates an array by &quot;splitting&quot; the string into multiple elements.  Strings are split based on a &quot;delimitter&quot; which is passed as the second argument.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;aName = Split(&quot;joe,bill,john&quot;, &quot;,&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''UBound'''
| Return the upper bound of the array meaning the last possible array index.  This is often used to get the size of an array (which in turn can be used in For...Next loops to iterate over the elements)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;nLast = UBound(aArray)&lt;/source&gt;
|}

== Variable and Procedure Declarations ==
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Statement
! Purpose
|-
| '''Const'''
| Used to declare a constant value (a value that will never change over the course of the program)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Const PI = 3.1415926&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Dim'''
| Used to declare a variable in your program.  Variables can be declared as &quot;global&quot; meaning available to the entire script or as local variables (inside a procedure)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Dim I, J, K&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Function'''
| Used to declare a function in your script.  A function is a procedure that should return a value but this is not enforced in Active Server Pages.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 Function YearsOld(dBirthDate)
 	YearsOld = DateDiff(&quot;y&quot;, dBirthDate, Now())
 End Function
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Sub'''
| Used to declare a subroutine in your script.  A subroutine cannot return a value to the caller.  You don't have to declare a function or subroutine before calling it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 Sub HelloWorld(sName)
 	Response.Write &quot;Hello &quot; &amp; sName
 End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

== Control Flow Statements ==

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Statement
! Purpose
|-
| '''Call'''
| Invoke a procedure (either a subroutine or a function).  If used to invoke a function, the return value cannot be assigned (leave the '''Call''' keyword off if you want to do something with the return value)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 Call SayHello(&quot;Bill Gates&quot;)
 ' alternative way to call a subroutine (notice no parentheses necessary)
 SayHello &quot;Bill Gates&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Eval'''
| Evaluate Active Server Pages code that is built dynamically.  In other words, if you build a string (at runtime) containing ASP code, you can execute that code using '''Eval'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;fArea = Eval(&quot;3.14159 * fRadius * fRadius&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Execute'''
| Execute an ASP script programatically.  Allows you to execute an ASP page during runtime.  Most normal methods of doing this (like using a server-side include) will process the script regardless of whether it is used or not.  With '''Execute''', you can conditionally process ASP scripts.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 if (nThemeNo = 1) then
   Execute(&quot;/theme/fantasy/header.asp&quot;)
 Else
   Execute(&quot;/theme/modern/header.asp&quot;)
 End If
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Exit'''
| Used to break execution out of a function, subroutine, or many of the looping constructs.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 Exit Function
 Exit Sub
 Exit For
 Exit Do
 Exit While
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Select Case'''
| This allows you to create a multi-branched conditional construct similar to a sequence of '''If Then ... Else If ... Else If ... Else ... End If'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 Select Case nDayOfWeek
   Case vbSunday : Response.Write &quot;Day of Rest&quot;
   Case vbSaturday : Response.Write &quot;Shopping Day&quot;
   Case vbMonday : 
   Case vbThursday : Response.Write &quot;Dance Class&quot;
   Case Else : Response.Write &quot;Work is Fun!&quot;
 End Select
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

== Loop Statements ==

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Statement
! Purpose
|-
| '''Do Loop'''
| There are two different variations of the do loop.  '''Do While''' repeats a block of statements while a condition is ''true'' and '''Do Until''' repeats while a condition is ''false''.  You can exit out of a '''Do ... Loop''' statement by using the '''Exit Do''' statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
Do While I &lt; 0
  I = I + 1
Loop
Do Until rs.EOF
  rs.MoveNext
Loop
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''For Each'''
| When working with a collection, you can use this function to iterate over each item.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
For Each sKey In oHash.Keys
Next
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''For Next'''
| Iterate over a sequence of numbers with a known start and end value and an optional increment value.  You can force execution to break out of a '''For ... Next''' loop by using the '''Exit For''' statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
For I = 1 To 10
  Response.Write &quot; I = &quot; &amp; I
Next
For I = 10 To 1 Step -1
  Response.Write &quot; I = &quot; &amp; I
Next
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''While Loop'''
| Repeat a block of statements while a condition is true.  You can force execution to break out of a '''While''' loop by using the '''Exit While''' statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
While I &lt; 10
  Response.Write &quot;I = &quot; &amp; I &amp; &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;
  I = I + 1
  If I = 6 Then Exit While
Wend
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

== Math Functions ==

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Statement
! Purpose
|-
| '''Abs'''
| Calculate the absolute value of an expression (makes a negative result into a positive one)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Abs(y)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Atn'''
| Trigonometry function to calculate the arc-tangent of a value

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Atn(y)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Cos'''
| Trigonometry function to calculate the cosine of a value

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Cos(y)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Exp'''
| Calculates the value of the expression e ^ y where e is a constant representing the base of the natural logarithm (otherwise known as napier's constant). 

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Exp(y)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Fix'''
| Converts a number to an integer. Negative numbers are rounded up (instead of down which is how '''Int''' works).  So a number like -5.99235 would result in a value of -5.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Fix(-5.66663)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Int'''
| Converts a numeric value into an integer value.  It effectively does the same thing as the &quot;Floor&quot; function in that it truncates any fractional part of the number (not performing any rounding).

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Int(y)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Log'''
| Calculate the natural logarithm of a number.  This is often expressed in mathematics as ln(y)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Log(y)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Mod'''
| Calculate the modulus (or remainder) between two numbers.  This is a boolean operator just like '''+''' or '''/'''.  The result of 10 Mod 3 is 1, because 3 goes into 10 at most 3 times with 1 left over (3 * 3 = 9 and 10 - 9 = 1)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;nRem = 10 Mod 3&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Randomize'''
| Seed the random number generator.  Doesn't return a value but prepares the script to produce truly random numbers via the '''Rnd''' function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Randomize&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Rnd'''
| A function which returns a random number that is greater than or equal to zero and less than 1.  You shoud always call '''Randomize''' before calling this function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Int(Rnd() * 100)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Round'''
| A function which rounds a number to the closest integer.  So if the fractional part of the number is &lt; 0.5, the number will be rounded down, otherwise the number will be rounded up.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Round(3.5)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Sgn'''
| Performs the sign function which returns only three possible values.  '''-1''' if the argument is a negative number, '''1''' if the number is positive, or '''0''' if the argument is exactly zero.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Sgn(-245.444)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Sin'''
| Trigonetry function which returns the ''sine'' function.  The argument is the angle of degrees in radians.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Sin(90)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Sqr'''
| Calculates the square root of a number.  The argument must be a positive number greater than or equal to zero.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Sqr(16)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Tan'''
| Trigonometry function to calculate the tangent of a value.  The argument is the angle of degrees in radians.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;x = Tan(1.331)&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;nAsciiH = AscW(&quot;Hello&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Chr'''
| Builds a single string (character) based on the ASCII code argument.  This is how you can build a string containing non-printable characters.  ASP contains many built-in constants which also serve this purpose (such as '''vbCr''', '''vbLf''' and even '''vbCrLf''').

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;sStr = &quot;Hello World!&quot; &amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''FormatCurrency'''
| Formats a numeric value as currency according to the locale settings.  The optional second argument indicates the number of places after the decimal point.  In the United States, the default is two.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;sFirst = LTrim(&quot;   Will&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Mid'''
| Get a subtring from a string.  The first argument is the base string to extract the substring from.  The second argument indicates the character index to start from.  The last argument indicates the number of characters to extract.  You may omit the last argument to retrieve all characters up to the end of the string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 sMiddle = Mid(sFullname, nMidStart, nMidEnd - nMidStart + 1)
 sLast = Mid(sFullName, nLastStart)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;sClean = RTrim(&quot;  Hi!  &quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Space'''
| Build a string with a repeated number of spaces.  When displayed as HTML, the browser will compress all whitespace unless the text is preformatted (in a '''&amp;lt;PRE&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/PRE&amp;gt;''' block) or the content is delivered in plain text.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Response.Write Space(30 - Len(sFirst)) &amp; sFirst&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''StrComp'''
| Compare two strings to see if they are equal or not.  You may perform a binary (case sensitive) comparison (the default) or you can do a textual (case insensitive) comparison by passing the optional third parameter as '''vbTextCompare'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;if (StrComp(sFirst1, sFirst2, vbTextCompare)) Then Response.Write &quot;EQUAL!&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''String'''
| Creates a string by repeating a specified character a certain number of times.  The first argument is the number of repetitions and the second argument is the string (character) to repeat.

 sDblLine = String(80, &quot;=&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''StrReverse'''
| Take a string and reverse the order of the characters.  In other words, given a string like &quot;012345789&quot;, this function would return &quot;9876543210&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;sReverse = StrReverse(&quot;0123456789&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Trim'''
| Trim any whitespace that exists on either the right or left side of the string.  So if you give the function an argument of &quot;  Hi!  &quot;, it would return the value &quot;Hi!&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;sClean = Trim(&quot;  Hi!  &quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''UCase'''
| Convert all alphabetic characters in a string to uppercase.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;sUsername = UCase(&quot;WaCkYcAsEuSeR&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;

== Data Type Conversions ==

Every variable in ASP is a variant (meaning the language is not strongly typed), so when we talk about type conversions, we're talking about the subtype of a variant value.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Statement
! Purpose
|-
| '''CBool'''
| Convert a variable into a boolean type (which can only hold ''true'' or ''false'')

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;bDone = CBool(&quot;true&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''CByte'''
| Convert a variable into a byte type (integer from 0 to 255)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;bByte = CByte(&quot;127&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''CCur'''
| Convert a variable into a currency type.  This is just like a decimal number in that extra care is taken to ensure that nothing is lost in rounding).

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;fMoney = CCur(Request.Form(&quot;LoanAmount&quot;))&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''CDate'''
| Convert a variable into a datetime value.  The expression may be a ''date'', a ''time'', or a ''datetime'' expression.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;dBirthday = CDate(Request.Form(&quot;BirthDay&quot;))&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''CDbl'''
| Convert a variable into a double type which is a double precision floating point number.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;dVal = CDbl(&quot;23.3452e+04&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''CInt'''
| Convert a variable into an integer type.  An integer is a 2-byte signed value that is restricted to values between -32,768 to 32,767.  Note that CInt() performs &quot;Banker's Rounding&quot; -- it does not truncate the fractional portion.  Use Int() to truncate variables to integers.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;nIntVal = CInt(Request.Form(&quot;SATScore&quot;))&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''CLng'''
| Convert a variable into a long integer type.  A long integer is a 4-byte signed value that is restricted to values between -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.  Note that CLng() performs &quot;Banker's Rounding&quot; -- it does not truncate the fractional portion.

|-
| '''CSng'''
| Convert a variable into a floating point number (basically a ''float'') which is also known as a single precision floating point number.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;fTemp = CSng(Request.Form(&quot;Temperature&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''CStr'''
| Convert a variable into a string value.  This is often necessary when comparing two values where one is a different type.

|-
| '''Hex'''
| Convert an integer number to hexadecimal equivalent.  Hexadecimal is a &quot;base 16&quot; number with digits ranging from '''0''' to '''9''' and '''A''' to '''F'''.  Hexagonal numbers are restricted to four-byte values so that converting a value of '''-1''' results in the value '''FFFF'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;sEnc = Hex(Asc(&quot;%&quot;))&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Oct'''
| Convert an integer number to its octal equivalent.  An octal number is a &quot;base 8&quot; number meaning the digits range from '''0''' to '''7'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;sOct = Oct(123)&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 Set oRE = New RegExp
 oRE.Pattern = &quot;\w+&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Private'''
| This is an access modifier which may appear before a member variable, method, or properety.  Any entity marked private may only be accessed within the class definition itself.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Private String sName&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Public'''
| This access modifer makes an entity public.  So a public variable can be accessed using the &quot;dot notation&quot; from the instance of a class.  Likewise for methods and properties.  Note that '''Public''' is the default access modifier and you don't have to include an access modifier on all entities.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Public Function Abbreviation&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Property Get'''
| The '''Property Get''' statement allows you to declare a read-only property to your class.  This is similar to a function in that it returns a value.  If you try to do assignment using this property (oMonth.Days = 31), the parser will throw an exception.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Property Get Days&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Property Let'''
| Use this property definition to define an assignor method.  This allows you to assign a value to a class property.  How the assignor method is implemented is up to you, but it usually modifies one of the member variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Property Let Name&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Property Set'''
| If you need to define a property which assigns the value of an object, you should define a '''Property Set''' method.  To define a property which retrieves an object value, you can simply use '''Property Get'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 Property Set RegularExp
 
 Set oRE = New RegExp
 Set oMonth.RegularExp = oRE
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Set'''
| Assign an instance of an object to a variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Set oRE = New RegExp&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''TypeName'''
| Use this function to retrieve the type of an object as a string.  When used with a regular variable, it returns the subtype (&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Double&quot;, &quot;Integer&quot;, &quot;String&quot;, &quot;Boolean&quot;, etc.)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 ' another built-in object - Dictionary COM+ object
 Set oHash = Server.CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.Dictionary&quot;)
 ' this will return the string &quot;Dictionary&quot;
 Response.Write &quot;Hash Type = &quot; &amp; TypeName(oHash)
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''With'''
| The '''With''' statement will save you some typing and allow you to access one instance of an object repeatedly by using a notation like '''.Write''' for the ''Response'' object.  So instead of repeatedly typing '''Response.Write''', you could do:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 With Response
   .Write x
   .Write &quot; x &quot;
   .Write y
   .Write &quot; = &quot;
   .Write z
 End With
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

== Comments ==

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Statement
! Purpose
|-
| '
| A line comment  which commenting out all text up to the end of the line (or the end of the script block whichever comes first)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;' This procedure does something&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Rem'''
| Old style of making comments in visual basic.  I believe this is only part of the language for backwards compatibility.  It does the same thing as a single quote (') meaning that it does a line comment (commenting out all text up to the end of the line)

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Rem This procedure does something&lt;/source&gt;
|}

== Error Handling ==

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Statement
! Purpose
|-
| '''On Error'''
| The '''On Error''' statement is used to trap errors thus preventing the throwing of an exception.  '''On Error''' must be terminated with an '''On Error Goto 0''' to stop error trapping.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
' trap all division error (overflow or divide-by-zero)
On Error Resume Next
f = x / y
If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0 Then
   sError = Err.Number &amp; &quot; - &quot; &amp; Err.Description
End If
On Error Goto 0
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

== Built-in Literals ==

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Statement
! Purpose
|-
| '''Empty'''
| The default value of a variable before it has been assigned a value.  You never explicitly assign this value to a variable but you can test for its existence using '''IsEmpty'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;IsEmpty(sFullname)&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''False'''
| Boolean value with a negative connotation.  Similar to &quot;No&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;bIsCool = false&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Nothing'''
| A special value that an object variable can be set to.  Used to clear an object variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;Set oFile = nothing&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''Null'''
| A null value is used to indicate that a variable holds no valid data.  Primarily used when accessing the value of database fields.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;If IsNull(rs.Fields(&quot;firstname&quot;).Value) Then ...&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| '''True'''
| Boolean value with a positive (or affirmative) connotation.  Similar to &quot;Yes&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;bIsFun = true&lt;/source&gt;
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most important element is Christianity is Jesus. Christians believe that Jesus is the fully divine, yet fully human representative of God on earth.  He came to Earth roughly 2000 years ago to live, minister, die, and then resurrect from the dead. (John 3:16)  &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.&quot;  Through this transaction of accepting Jesus' life, death and resurrection, a person can exchange his/her sins, iniquity, and damnation for righteousness, hope and eternal life. This is the basic foundation of Christianity.

Jesus then instructs Christians, through the teachings to his disciples, how to love God and how to love others.

== Cave of the Mounds ==
The most beautiful cave in Wisconsin and the upper Midwest, Cave of the Mounds lies just off U.S. Highways 18/151 in Blue Mounds, WI. The United States Department of the Interior and the National Park Service designated Cave of the Mounds a National Natural Landmark because the site possesses &quot;exceptional value as an illustration of the nation’s natural heritage and contributes to a better understanding of man’s environment&quot;. Curious tourists and budding cave enthusiasts have been enjoying an introduction to caving in the midwest for years while visiting Cave of the Mounds. 

Commonly referred to as the &quot;jewel box&quot; of America’s major caves for the variety and delicacy of its formations, Cave of the Mounds is recognized by the Chicago Academy of Sciences as &quot;the significant cave of the upper Midwest&quot;.

[[File:Cave of the Mounds South Cavern.jpg|left|thumb|Cave of the Mounds]]

A guided tour of the Cave takes you past a varied collection of colorful stalactites, stalagmites, columns and other formations. The main cavern began forming over a million years ago as acidic water dissolved the limestone bedrock far below the surface. As Cave of the Mounds staff like to point out, geologic time is mind-boggling. It is difficult to imagine the time it took for the large caverns to be dissolved within rock that is itself believed to be over 400 million years old!

A lower meandering portion of the Cave was formed by the rushing water of an underground stream. The contrast between the chemical and mechanical processes of cave formation is one of the geologic lessons illustrated on The Cave Tour.

People who come to the Cave of the Mounds in the summer appreciate the constant 50-degree temperature. They also enjoy the park-like grounds, with picnic areas, walking trails and rock gardens. Winter visitors can take advantage of the Cave’s comparative warmth. The Cave is open in the winter on weekends, and during the week by advance reservation.

'''History of the Cave:'''
Cave of the Mounds takes its name from the Blue Mounds, two large hills which have long been Wisconsin landmark features. The West Mound, at 1716 feet, is the highest point in Southern Wisconsin; the East Mound reaches 1489 feet. Cave of the Mounds lies under the southern slope of the East Mound.

This area was settled by Ebenezer Brigham, a successful lead miner who became Dane County’s first permanent white settler in 1828. The West Mound is now a Wisconsin state park; part of the East Mound still belongs to the Brigham family. Brigham County Park lies along the wooded northern edge of this East Mound. Both parks afford magnificent vistas of southern Wisconsin.

Cave of the Mounds was accidentally discovered on August 4, 1939. Workers, who were removing high quality limestone from a quarry on the Brigham Farm, blasted into the Cave. The blast tore the face off the quarry and revealed a great underground cavern. All quarrying stopped and never resumed. The dynamite blast revealed a limestone cave more than twenty feet high opening into other rooms and galleries, all containing numerous mineral formations.

The excitement of the discovery brought so many curiosity seekers that the Cave had to be closed in order to preserve it. Soon, lights and wooden walkways were installed. And, in May 1940, Cave of the Mounds was opened to visitors. Millions of visitors later, the Cave’s wooden walkways were replaced with concrete; a large stone building replaced the original entry building; and theatrical lighting has been installed to dramatize the colors and shapes within the Cave. Picnic areas, walking trails, rock gardens, gift shops and a visitor center have all since been developed. 

In 1988, Cave of the Mounds was designated a National Natural Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior and the National Park Service. In receiving this honor, Cave of the Mounds was recognized as &quot;a site which possesses exceptional value as an illustration of the nation’s natural heritage and contributes to a better understanding of man’s environment.&quot;

Limestone, a sedimentary rock produced from hardened marine sediments and shells comprises the cave. This rock was formed during the Ordovician period, over 400 million years ago.  During this time Wisconsin was submerged under warm shallow seas.  Massive amounts of shell life lived in this sea and over many years numerous layers of calcium carbonate were laid down and slowly compacted into present day limestone.  The sea retreated and erosion began to deteriorate these layers of limestone.  Today’s exposed rock of the cave is a special kind of limestone named galena dolomite which contains over 20% magnesium. 

Cave of the Mounds began to form 1 to 2 million years ago when it was still submerged in the sea.  It was in the upper layers of the water that are often acidic due to the added carbon dioxide from run off.  This carbon dioxide mixes with the water and forms a weak carbonic acid.  This acid dissolved the limestone creating cavities within it.  It was along a large crack, known today as the lifeline of the caves, that the Cave of the Mounds was created.   Acidic water seeped into this crack and dissolved the rock. 

As stream levels lowered due to the erosional action of the flowing water so did the water table.  Once the water table was below the level of the cave it was filled with air allowing for new developments within the cave.  Water percolating through the soil carried calcium carbonate down into the cave.  Once the water enters the cave the calcium carbonate is precipitated in the form of calcite.   Every droplet of water leaves calcite crystals on the surfaces of the cave.  These crystals stick to floor, walls, ceiling and one another.  Formations such as stalactites and stalagmites, along with sheets of flowstone on the walls are formed from these accumulated crystals.  These formations known as speleotherms grow at a slow rate which is determined by the amount of calcium carbonate present and the rate at which the water flows.  One cubic inch of speleotherm can take anywhere from 50 to 150 years to develop.  

Stalactites hang down from the ceiling of the cave and begin as hollow circles. They first begin to grow when calcite crystals gather around a hanging water droplet. Each new water droplet leaves another ring and successive droplets gather until a thin hollow tube hangs from the ceiling.  If the original tube is plugged it will develop into a cone.

These speleotherms come in many shapes and colors.  The colors can be attributed to the various minerals in the dripping water.   Blues and grays are created by manganese oxides while reds and browns are left by iron oxides.  Cave raft or lily pads are one of the many forms that speleotherms take.  They are formed when water in the bottom of the cave floats a light plate of calcite until it becomes too heavy and sinks. Multiple plates form on top of one another until they form a raft.  Water may drop onto the pad until it forms a stalagmite which causes it to resemble a lily pad.  Helectites are another unusual form of speleotherm, growing sideways and down, seeming to defy gravity.   Also present are minute cave pearls, known as oolites.  These pearls form when grains of sand, at the bottom of pools, supply catalysts for deposition of calcite.

Multiple searches to find links between tunnels of the Cave of the Mounds and other nearby caves have been attempted.  However, as of late, no such effort has been a success.  Cavers do continue to search in the hope of finding more.

== Copper Falls ==
Copper Falls located four miles north of Mellen, WI is part of the Bad River, which originates in east central Ashland County and meanders northward until it empties into Lake Superior.  Copper Falls is a 29 foot drop.   This first drop of the Bad River flows through high canyon walls for approximately 2 miles.  
	
Many millions of years ago there were mountains in northern Wisconsin composed of granite and greenstone.  Over many years these mountains were weathered down into a rolling, rock plain.  In the area around Lake Superior this rock plain was downwarped and eventually covered by a shallow sea.  The surrounding rivers and streams carried sediments into the sea where they created a thick layer of sea bottom sediments.  Water from deep within the earth seeped outward and upward into these sediments.  These waters carried with them large amounts of iron ore, which is why this area is filled with this valuable ore today.  
	
The area in which Lake Superior now rests was once the site of volcanic activity.  Out of deep fissures flowed thousands of cubic miles of lava.  This lava spread creating thick layers, up to 60,000 feet deep in some areas.  So much lava spewed from under the earth’s crust that it began to sag under its own weight creating the Lake Superior basin.  
	
Surrounding rivers deposited sand and mud into the settling basin.  Over time the sediments hardened to form sandstones, conglomerates and shales.  The Lake Superior basin continued to slip downward causing these layers of rock and the surrounding lava rock to slant downward.  Some of these layers broke apart while others slid on top of one another, this accounts for the present arrangement of rock layers standing on edge. 
	
[[Image:copperfalls.jpg|right|thumb|Copper Falls]]

Over the past 200 million years the Bad River has cut a course through these rock layers.  It continued to cut its course until it was interrupted approximately one million years ago.  It is during this time that the Wisconsin Glaciations occurred.  Glaciers brought loads of sediment down from Canada and as they melted they dropped granite boulders and other debris.  A layer of sand, mud, and rock was deposited over this area.  The thick red clays that can be seen in surrounding areas were also left behind by the retreating glaciers.  
	
The Bad River begins its course over black lava where Copper Falls is located then continues onward until it links with Tyler’s Fork at Brownstone Falls.  The Bad River flows from this point over red lava in which it has carved a deep gorge.  It then cuts into the conglomerate rocks of Devil’s Gate until it makes its way through a thin strip of black shale.  The river then encounters thick layers of shale and sandstone, after which it makes a 180 degree turn through red clays to cut back through the shale and sandstone.

== Devil's Lake ==
Devil’s Lake ranges from 40 to 50 feet deep and is fed by two small creeks.   It does not have any outward draining bodies of water so its water losses are entirely made up from evaporation and little ground water flow toward the north.  It sits approximately 500 feet below the western bluff of Devils’ Gorge and sits on top of 380 feet of sediment, making the bedrock relief in this area at least 850 feet.  The lake is located three miles south of Baraboo in the southern half of the Baraboo Range.  This range can be found in south central Wisconsin and formed over 1.6 billion years ago.   It is one of the oldest rock outcrops in North America.  This range of hills is approximately 30 miles long and 10 miles wide and surrounds an oblong depression known as the Baraboo Valley. 	

[[Image:devil'slake.jpg|thumb|left|Devil's Lake ]]

The ancient hills are formed from a ridge of metamorphic rock known as the Baraboo Quartzite.  Over a mile thick, this quartzite has been formed from grains of sand that were deposited here as they flowed out of rivers into shallow seas which covered Wisconsin at this time.  The sand particles were first compacted into sand stone and then under immense pressure and heat the sandstone became quartzite. 
The quartzite and underlying layers of rock are in their current arrangement because they have been formed into a syncline.  Each end of this syncline forms a limb of the basin.  The southern limb dips more gently which exposes more of the quartzite at the surface.  The eastern edges of the syncline are rigidly joined and in the west they curve smoothly together as they descend inward toward the center of the basin.
Weathered rock debris known as talus shroud the edges of Devil’s Gorge.  The spacing of the fractures within the quartzite determines the size and shape of this rock debris.  Commonly, they range in size from 4 to 5 feet long and normally are purple but appear grey in color because of the lichen that grows on their surface.  They sit at a 20 degree angle.   This is known as the angle of repose and is created by the pull of gravity and the rocks resistance to that pull because of its angular shape.  
On the surface of the quartzite are ripples that were left by the water that once covered Wisconsin.  The eastern Bluff of Devil’s lake presents four layers of quartzite.  Each layer’s ripples are in a different direction, representing the winds and currents on each day the layers were laid down.
	
Rocks younger than the Baraboo Quartzite, fewer than 600 million years old, do not have ripples on them.  This is because bacteria were the only form of life present when the Baraboo quartzite was in its sand form.  After the development of large more complex organisms ripple marks were stirred up and washed away by the movement of these organisms.  
	
After the shallow seas withdrew the Baraboo range was pushed upward by converging continents into a ridge.  In the center of this ridge was a depression that was eventually filled with softer rocks.  This area was then dry for centuries.  As time passed the softer rock was eroded away leaving gorges in the center of the Baraboo Range.  Parfrey’s Glen is an example of one of these gorges.  The rock formation there is a combination of Cambrian sandstone and quartzite so was easily washed away by flowing water.
	
Eventually water invaded this area again.  Sand was deposited in the gorges and eventually on top of the hills.  The entire range was eventually buried under sandy and limey deposits.  Once again the seas retreated and an ancient river flowed through the area.  This river removed the sand and exposed the quartzite and reopened the Lower Narrows Gap and the Devil’s Lake Gap, which were partially cut when the Baraboo valley and the gorges were being formed.
	
Approximately 15,000 years ago a sheet of ice known today as the Wisconsin Glacier flowed over the Baraboo Range.  The glacier flowed over only the eastern half of the range as can bee seen by the terminal moraine (rocks and gravel deposited by the glacier when it became stagnant and melted at its end) that marks the glaciers outermost boundary.  To the west of this moraine is Wisconsin’s driftless area, an area that had been left unglaciated throughout the ice age. The ancient river that flowed through this area was then rerouted when the glacier plugged either end of the Devil’s Lake gap.  Devil’s Lake is situated between these two plugs; it is a deserted valley of the ancient river. 
	
Had the Wisconsin Glacier not flowed through the Baraboo range Devil’s Lake would most likely not exist and the ancient river would still flow through this region.

== VanHise Rock ==
Located in Rock Springs, Sauk County, WI along state hwy 136, Van Hise Rock was named for the preeminent geologist of the 19th century Charles Richard VanHise.  VanHise used this piece of rock to show the major structural features of metamorphic Precambrian rock and also to demonstrate the kinds of changes that occur in rocks through mountain building periods.  He used this monolith to develop his groundbreaking conclusions of structural metamorphic geology.  
[[Image:vanhiserock.jpg|thumb|right|VanHise Rock]]	

This remnant continues to serve as a hands on learning device for professional geologists and students.  The rock was recognized as a national historical landmark in 1999 with a formal dedication and roadside plaque. 
	
Van Hise Rock is a 14 foot high and 6 foot wide erosional remnant, composed of pink quartzite and phyllitic quartzite, showing cross bedding and ripple marks which indicate the top of the original bedding.  It was initially part of the Baraboo Range, a 700 to 800 feet high portion of an ancient mountain range which at its height may have towered between 1000 and 1600 feet above the plain below.  
	
The range is east west trending and composed of weather resistant Precambrian quartzite, a metamorphic rock.  One billion, seven hundred million years old, the Baraboo range is 1500 meters thick and crops out in a doubly plunging syncline in south central Wisconsin.  It is one of several similarly exposed outcrops in the northern portion of the Midwest United States.  Two general depositional environments are present within the Baraboo range.  The first is a lower layer of braided stream complex with pebble conglomerate at its base.  The second is a top layer of tidal influence.  This range represents one of the oldest tidally influenced rock formations on earth. 
	
The history of the Baraboo ranges formation is as follows:  Over a billion years ago Wisconsin was covered by shallow seas.  Rivers and streams that surrounded these ancient seas deposited sediments of sand into the seas.  Over time the deposited sand layers formed sandstone, then after much time and pressure the sandstone was converted into quartzite.  
	
Approximately 1.6 billion years ago during the Middle Proterozoic episodes of mountain building were taking place south of the Baraboo Range.  This provided force to fold and metamorphose the quartzite.  The quartzite was pushed upwards and a depression was left between the northern and southern halves of the feature.  This depression was filled with softer sediments until the seas withdrew.
	
There was a long period of drier climate in which the softer sediments were eroded away, forming the Baraboo Valley.  New seas covered the area and sediments were deposited all around the area covering the Baraboo range with sand and lime.  The seas then retreated for the final time and an ancient river, that would one day become the Wisconsin River, washed away the sediments, once again exposing the quartzite range.  
	 
Fifteen thousand years ago ice from the Wisconsin Glacier flowed over the range covering the eastern half, consequentially smoothing its surface creating the glassy shine that can be seen today.  A terminal moraine was left at the outer most edge of the glacier, where the ice had become stagnant and as it melted sediment was dropped out.  This line of deposited sediment rerouted the Wisconsin River allowing it to flow along today’s current path.

== Kettle Moraine ==
Kettle Moraine, often referred to as the Kettle Range or Kettle Interlobate Moraine, runs from Kewaunee County south into Walworth County.  Many prominent glacial features can be easily seen in the Northern Kettle Moraine State Forest which extends from Glenbeulah in Sheboygan County southwest then south 20 miles to County Highway H approximately 3 miles south of Kewaskum in Washington County. 
 
Created when the Lake Michigan and Green Bay Lobes collided causing the deposition of sediments the Kettle Moraine exhibits classic examples of glacial geography.  The Green Bay Lobe from the west created the bay of Green Bay.   Lake Winnebago and the Horicon Marsh and the Lake Michigan lobe from the east formed Lake Michigan.  

[[Image:drummlin.jpg|thumb|left| A drumlin in eastern Wisconsin]]

Northern Kettle Interlobate Moraine reaches its maximum elevation of 1,311 feet at the base of Parnell tower and has a general relief of 100 – 200 feet.  Major lowlands can be found between 950 and 1000 feet occupied by Long Lake and the east branch of the Milwaukee River. 

The most obvious features of this moraine, the ones for which it has been named, are the many kettles which dot its surface.  Ranging in size from oversized lakes and enclosed valleys to miniature ponds, these depressions were left by buried ice that eventually melted.  Greenbush Kettle, located 2 miles south of Greenbush along Kettle Moraine Drive is a favorite example of these depressions.  It is one of the deepest and most symmetrical kettles that can be easily seen from the road.  Depending upon the season Greenbush Kettle may be filled with or void of water as is the case with many of the kettles scattered over the moraine. 
There are many other classic examples of glacial landforms which may be found on the Kettle Interlobate Moraine.  Parnell Esker is an example of one of these landforms.  An esker is a winding ridge that has been formed from glacial drift that was deposited into a tunnel within the glacier.  When the ice melted away the esker was left behind.  The cores of eskers are filled with poorly sorted sand and gravel, this core is surrounded by a crust of well rounded and sorted sands and gravels.  Often eskers are mined for this sand and gravel as is the case for a portion of Parnell Esker.  Located near the town of Dundee, this esker is between 5 and 35 feet tall and runs northeast to southwest for approximately four miles.

[[Image:kame.jpg|thumb|right| A kame in Kettle Moraine]]

Scattered throughout portions of Kettle Moraine are two different types of glacially formed hills.  The type most identifiable are drumlins.  These hills are smooth and elongated, composed of glacial drift.  Often drumlins can be found in swarms or large groupings of multiple drumlins.  From an aerial view drumlins are shaped like a tear drop with a rounded end and a tapered end, which points in the direction of glacial advance.  Drumlins can only be found behind the end moraines of the glaciers that created them.  The other type of hill is a kame.  Kames are mounded hills of glacial drift that are formed when the drift flows into a hole in the ice.  When the ice recedes the conically shaped mound is left behind.

== Niagara Escarpment ==
The Niagara Escarpment is a ridge that runs across North America from southeast Wisconsin north through the Door Peninsula to the Manitoulin Islands of Ontario in northern Lake Huron, south across the Bruce Peninsula, and then east around the southwest end of Lake Ontario. 
	
During the Ordovician era, 445 million years ago, North America was located in the tropical zone and much of the present land surface was covered by the Michigan Sea.  Layers of sediments accumulated at the bottom of this sea.  Some sediment flowed in from rivers as sand and clay, while others were deposits of calcium carbonate from the skeletal remains of sea organisms.  Through processes of heat, pressure, and chemical reactions these sediments became stone.  The calcium carbonate became limestone, and when magnesium was present it mixed to become dolostone.  Layers of sediment were deposited over what was to become the Niagara Escarpment for 25 million years, from the Ordovician era (445 million years ago) to the lower Silurian era (420 million years ago).  The rock layers of the escarpment and to its west are mostly Silurian dolostone while the layers to the east of and below it are mostly Ordovician limestone.
	
[[Image:niagaraescarpment.jpg|thumb|left|Forest Covered Niagara Escarpment]]

Multiple layers of sediment were laid down throughout the historical formations and disappearances of the Michigan Sea.  However, after the Silurian ear, layers of dolostone and limestone were no longer formed.  Approximately 250 million years ago a long period of erosion began when the Michigan Sea vanished for the final time. 
	
The formation of the Niagara Escarpment can be accredited to two factors, the first being that layers of soft rock underlie layers of harder rock and the second that these layers are not horizontal, instead they are slightly inclined.  The weaker layers of limestone, shale and sandstone weathered rapidly relative to the overlying layer of Silurian dolostone.  As the erosion undercut the top layer pieces broke off due to their unsupported weight.  This resulted in the retreat of the escarpment to the west and the increase in its height.  
	
The erosion process is increased with the presence of water.  Niagara Falls is a clear example of this occurrence.  The Niagara River is constantly cutting into the escarpment, at a rate of approximately one meter per year.  Today, between the Falls and Queenstown there are high cliff walls on either side.  In the last 10 thousand years the falls have moved over 11 kilometers away from Lake Ontario. 
	
The most recent ice age and its associated glacial activity have also made an impact on the escarpment.  The Wisconsin ice age, lasting from 23 thousand to 10 thousand years ago covered Canada and the northern United States with a layer of ice 2 to 3 kilometers thick.  The flowing glaciers of North America carried and subsequentially dropped sediments of all sizes over there extent.  In areas where the glaciers melted and dropped their sediment load the Niagara Escarpment is not visible, instead, only sharp slopes can be viewed.  
	
When the Wisconsin ice age ended and the final glaciers melted, lakes and rivers were left behind.  These rivers cut valleys out of the escarpment which is why it no longer pursues a strait line but crisscrosses over its range. 
	
Within Wisconsin the escarpment is often referred to as the ledge, a site for many natural points of interest:  crevasses, caves, rock falls and many other rock formations.  Massive fissures and crevasses were created by the glacial ice that flowed over Wisconsin.  It is a poor site for farming due to the thin layer of soil at its surface and the fallen rocks at its base.  This is why most of the escarpment is wooded.  Also, water is often present at the base.  Dolomite, although it is hard, can become fractured allowing water to seep through.  This water is filtered through the ground until it reaches an impermeable layer of shale.  The water is then forced up through springs which feed streams, marshes and lakes.

===The Ledge===

	In Wisconsin, the Niagara Escarpment is called “The Ledge” that extends about 250 miles through the eastern part of the state in a Northeastern or Southwestern direction.  The Ledge stretches from Waukesha county up through Dodge, Fond du Lac, Calumet, Brown, and  Door county. From a few outcrops in Waukesha county then re-emerging from glacial sediment in Dodge county to steep rock ledges in High Cliff State park in Calumet county and to its highest exposures in Wisconsin rising above the west side bay of Green Bay on the Door county peninsula.[1]

[[Image:High_Cliff_State_Park_The_Ledge_Cliff.JPG|left|thumb|The Ledge]]

	During the last ice-age the Ledge help shaped what is now the Bay of  Green Bay, the western shore of Lake Michigan, and Lake Winnebago.  The Ledge’s ability to resist erosion from repeated glacial advance and retreats is how rock cliffs have become exposed from Door county and the Northeastern shores of Lake Winnebago. Hard limestone called Niagara dolomite is what the Ledge consists of and has been around for 400 million years.[2] Once ancient seas receded thousands of years ago the edges of the dolomite became exposed to weathering giving the Ledge cliff like faces. Under the dolomite is soft shale that has a fast erosion rate and eventually breaks off and leaves a new cliff edge each time. Another process that helped shape the Ledge is ice. Glacial ice that was miles thick leveled the cliff in some areas while leaving crevasses and large fissures else where. These giant glaciers shaved down and smoothed out what was once a higher and more jagged series of cliffs and left behind crevasses and caves we see today.



	Today much of the Ledge is covered by woods and agricultural lands. During the last glaciation, the Wisconsin glacier deposited finer sediments that overlaid much of the Ledge which covered the once cliff like landscape. As mentioned earlier, the Ledge is exposed in the Calumet county, Green Bay area, and the somewhat famous Door County areas. High Cliff State park in Calumet county is one great place to see beautiful rock faces, cliffs, crevasses, and rock flats that did not get covered by glacial tills. These rock flats are large, some being the size of a few football fields of solid rock with a small tree or plant growing from pits and cracks in the rock that filled in over time. From High Cliff State park the Ledge continues to the Green Bay area. Here the Ledge only can be seen as a large ridge covered by forest and urban area flowing to the northeast into Door county. Along the western side of Door county is the bay of Green Bay which is has rock cliffs overhanging the water. These cliffs are constantly reshaping. Under the hard dolomite cliffs we see above the water is softer sand stone and shale and with the water constantly eroding this material away, the weight of the dolomite causes chunks to crack off and fall into the water. While this a relatively slow process, the shorelines of Green Bay and Lake Michigan are constantly changing. [4]

==The Baraboo Range==

	The Baraboo Ranges are a series of large hills located in south-central Wisconsin that span approximately 30 miles long and 10 miles wide and is one of the oldest rock outcrops in North America.[1]  While the mass majority of Wisconsin was formed by glaciations, the ranges formed volcanically and is composed of metamorphic rock. Over a hundred million years ago heat and pressure caused sedimentary rocks to harden to what is now quartzite. Over the past 350 million years the great strength of the quartzite has survived forces of erosion, weathering, rivers, and the greatest force, glaciers.[2]

[[Image:Baraboo Hills 5.JPG|thumb|right|The Baraboo Hills]]

	The Baraboo ranges are representations of a syncline that is on the edge of the drift less Western Uplands and the heavily glaciated Eastern Uplands. Precambrian Baraboo quartzite which is about 4,000 feet thick, is a red, metamorphosed quartz sandstone. Baraboo quartzite form from grains of sand that was deposited by outlet rivers which flowed from small seas that covered the surrounding area over a billion years ago. These sand deposits first compacted into sand stone and then from extreme pressures and heat, sand stone formed into quartzite.
 
	Between 1650 and 1450 million years ago, rocks in this area folded and one large down fold, also called a syncline is where the Baraboo range developed. Metamorphosed rock, sandstones converting to quartzite and shales to slate occurred during the folding.[1] As the seas in the area drained the Baraboo range was forced upward by the converging continents to form the ridge we see today. After the seas dried up the area remained dry for hundreds of years and as time went on, softer exposed sand stones eroded away leaving the stronger, weather resisting quartzite.[1] Some of the Baraboo quartzite has a redish color to it which comes from mats of iron eating bacteria that lived on the rock. This bacteria is why the quartzite has its redish color, as this bacteria died off the iron that was once absorbed by the bacteria was released onto the rocks which eventually stained them. 



	The Baraboo range is mostly covered by forest but a few areas like devils lake have exposed cliffs and rock faces. These hills are easy to pick out when looking at the surrounding topography. While some areas near by have slight hilly topography to it, when approaching the Baraboo area it hard to mistake the range as just another hill on the landscape. Larger and higher the Baraboo Hills are one of the highest formations compared to its surrounding landscape at approximately 500 feet.[1]

==Rib Mountain==

	About 1.5 to 2 billion years ago Rib Mountain began its formation. Although the mountain resembles a volcano, however it did form from a volcanoes millions of years ago. The area was heavily dominated by sand and from intense heat the sand violently fused together making quartzite. The sands fused together from an intrusive igneous rock called Syenite. 2 billion years ago syenite formed when magma was injected into the landscape from cracks beneath the ground solidifying the rock. A slow cooling process allowed the rock crystals to form intrusive coarse-grained igneous rock. After the syenite hardened to what is now quartzite, the surrounding landscape which is made up of primarily sands and silts began to erode away some 1.5 billion years ago. The erosion process that helped erode the landscape in this area was heavily dominated by glaciation. The Green Bay, Chippewa and Wisconsin Valley lobes both did not quite reach the Rib Mountain area however, the melt water did. Rib Mountain withstood 300 million years of erosion that removed layers of sedimentary rock from the surrounding landscape.[2] While Rib Mountain is not an actual volcano, it sits near the center of the roots of volcanoes that were around during the Wolf River age. Wolf river igneous eruptions created a line of a few volcanoes in the Rib Mountain area about 1,450 million years ago.[3] These volcanoes are the main source for the heat and syenite mentioned earlier that formed the hard quartzite

	Today the mountain stands 1924 feet above sea level at its peak and the ridge runs some four miles long.[2] While Rib Mountain is the fourth tallest peak in the state of Wisconsin, it stands as the tallest hill in the state at more that 700 feet above the surrounding plain.[1] At one point in history Rib Mountain was said to be the highest point in Wisconsin, later Timm’s Hill became the highest point which is located to the north of Rib Mountain.

[[Image:Rib Mountain 1.JPG|thumb|left|Rib Mountain towers above Wausau, WI]]

	 Rib Mountain State Park is a good place to see quartzite outcrops. Atop in the State park there are large quartzite formations and one marks the highest point of the mountain. Most of the quartzite are huge pieces with a little bit of fracturing however, there are a few locations in the park that show an abundance of fracturing. This is odd because quartzite is a vary hard and weather resistant rock so this is said to be a mystery. Another interesting feature found in the state park is small boulder fields. These fields would typically be formed by rocks falling off higher locations on the mountain but the existing outcrops are not high or steep enough to create rock falls to bust apart the quartzite into these small boulder fields.

==Roche-A-Cri==

	What was once a rock island in Glacial Lake Wisconsin that covered much of the central part of the state is now a flat-topped, cliff sided, Roche-A-Cri Mound. 15,000 years ago after Glacial Lake Wisconsin had disappeared, this island composed of Cambrian sandstone still stood. The mesa was a outlier that survived the retreating Magnesian Escarpment and was named by early French explorers. “Roche-A-Cri” which some refer to as “rock with crevices,” but the name actually translates to  “crying or shrieking rock.” It is said it get this name because of its tall vegetated make up that whistles in the wind above the flat surrounding landscape.[1] The crevice in which the structure displays can be seen from a ways off in which wave erosion helped shape Roche-A-Cri. Weather today is continuing to help shape the rock as sandstone slowly breaks apart on the outer surface. The sandstone is then blown away but growth of vegetation slows weathering dramatically. The base of the mound was deposited over 500 million years ago by rivers that flowed through what was once a sandy Cambrian plain. Since then multiple glaciations washed away the surrounding sandy till leaving the mesa standing about 300 feet above what is now the flat Central Sands plain. Roche-A-Cri stands about 1185 feet about sea level and is likely the steepest hill in Wisconsin.[3]

	Although glaciation eroded much of the surrounding landscape, it was the glacial melt water that did the work not actual glaciers. The area around Roche -A-Cri is known as the driftless area, which means no glaciers covered this area at any point in time. With the mound being made of Cambrian sandstone it is thought that if glaciers would have made it to this driftless area Roch-A-Cri and other similar mounds in the area would have been leveled. While the Cambrian sandstone was strong enough to withstand the forces of water from Glacial Lake Wisconsin, it would not have been strong enough to stand up to the force of thick glaciers. The Glaciation that took place to the east of the driftless area figured to have leveled hundreds of outlying mesas, buttes and thousands of smaller pinnacles like Roche-A-Cri

[[Image:Roche A Cri 2.JPG|thumb|right|Roche A Cri]]

	Roche-A-Cri can be seen from a few miles away when approaching on local road way. The relatively flat topography allows this mound to be seen from a distance however, when you are near the mound older forest growth that surrounds the state park somewhat shields the view of the immense hill. Either entering the park at its main entrance or at the winter season parking areas are the ways to get close up views of the flat rock faces of  Roche-A-Cri.[1]

==Arnott Moraine==

	End moraines which some also call terminal moraines are ridges formed by the accumulation of glacial debris at the end or terminus of the glacier. The Arnott moraine is the oldest moraine in the Holy Hill formation. Between 300,000 and  30,000 years ago the Laurentide Ice Sheet and more specifically the Green Bay lobe changed most of the Eastern side of Wisconsin. At its furthest advance known as the Keene Member also called the Arnott moraine. This moraine is likely to have been around before the last advancement of the Green Bay lobe because the sediments found on the Arnott moraine are much older than sediments found on the near by Almond and Hancock moraines. Arnott moraine is likely from Illinoain to pre-late Wisconsinan glaciation but no geologists seem to know exactly when.
  
	The moraine is made up of brown to reddish sandy till carbonates that reach several meters below the surface. As the pre-late Wisconsin glacaiation moved westward it picked up sediments known as granite clasts from the Wolf River Batholiths. These are boulder size rocks made up felsic, granite, quartz, or diorite that was once cooled deep in the Earths crust. These boulders are scattered across  the rather subtle sloping landscape of the Arnott moraine. 

[[Image:Arnott Moraine 1.JPG|thumb|left|Arnott Moraine]]

	The moraine is only a slight rise in topography and one would not likely know they are on this moraine unless some told them or has knowledge of geologic landscapes. Weather and erosion are key reasons as to why this moraine has a such a gentle slope. It has endured hundreds more years of exposure to the elements compared to similar moraines near by and in other parts of  Wisconsin. The Arnott moraine is essentially one of the only exposures of the pre-late Wisconsin glaciation in the state. As the Green Bay lobe moved westward to the central part of the state it covered most of the older pre-late Wisconsin sediments except for the Arnott moraine and a few areas in the south central part of the state.[3]

Thank you, DarkLama. It is so refreshing to see that you are adding the welcome message manually ... It would not be the same if a bot did it. Thank you very much. You made me feel special. --[[User:Kushal one|Kushal one]] 02:20, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

:Your welcome. Wikibooks doesn't actually have any bots welcoming people yet, even though its been suggested. The fact that it wouldn't be the same has actually been one of the reasons for opposing its use. There are just some dedicated Wikibookians who take the time to try to welcome everyone. I usually find the people from time to time who were overlooked for whatever reason and try to fill in the cracks.

:You may be interested in reading our [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians|Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] guide, since your familiar with Wikipedia in order to learn some of the differences. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:36, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">SwisTrack is component-based, i.e. processing an image is a matter of calling a series of (well-configured) components in a certain order. If you have an application which requires special image processing, you are welcome to write your own component. Writing a component for SwisTrack has many advantages over writing your own program:

* You can use existing components for all task that are not special to your application. Even if you need to implement a very special algorithm, you can most probably use camera components to acquire images.
* SwisTrack provides you with a GUI which allows you to easily visualize the result (and even intermediate steps) of your processing.
* SwisTrack allows you measure the performance of your algorithm, by measuring how much time was consumed by your component and allowing you to set lap times.
* Last but not least, you can easily share your components with other SwisTrack users.


== Before Implementing a Component ==

Before implementing a component, think about the individual steps of your algorithm. If you can split your image processing algorithm into different parts, some of the tasks might already by implemented by existing components. Sometimes it makes sense to split your algorithm into two or more components. This can ease the configuration and provide a better insight into the structure of the algorithm. For a first implementation, however, the simplest approach is to start with a single component. This page therefore sticks to the implementation of one component.

=== Core Data Structures ===

Data is passed between components using the SwisTrackCore class. It has data structures to hold tracks, particles and images. Each component in the pipeline updates these data structures directly, usually by resetting the pointer to use the one in its own class instance.

Tracks are stored in two data structures: SwisTrackCore::mDataStructureTracks and SwisTrackCore::mDataStructureParticles. mDataStructureTracks stores a window of the last 50 points of the track, for drawing and computing. mDataStructureParticles is the output from the blob finder, and stores the particles for the current frame, along with their track association, and their location in the real world.

== Creating a New Component ==

We describe here how to proceed to create a new component called &quot;MyFavoriteAlgorithm&quot;. Of course, you are free to choose another name for your component (and we even suggest to do so). We will proceed in three steps to create the new component: Creating and registering a new component class, implementing the algorithm, and creating a configuration file.

=== 1. Creating and Registering a New Component Class ===
# Make a copy of the files &lt;i&gt;code/core/ComponentTemplate.cpp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;code/core/ComponentTemplate.h&lt;/i&gt;. Give your new files the name &lt;i&gt;ComponentMyFavoriteAlgorithm.cpp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ComponentMyFavoriteAlgorithm.h&lt;/i&gt;. (Note that if an existing component does something similar to what you want to implement, you may also copy that existing component instead of copying the more general template component.)
# Open these two files and replace &quot;Template&quot; (case-sensitive) by &quot;MyFavoriteAlgorithm&quot;.
# Make sure you also change the component name that is initialized in the constructor.
# Open the file ''SwisTrackCore.cpp'' and add your component to the include files, i.e.
&lt;pre&gt;#include &quot;ComponentMyFavoriteAlgorithm.h&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
and to the list of available components in the constructor:
&lt;pre&gt;mAvailableComponents.push_back(new ComponentMyFavoriteAlgorithm(this));&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, generate an XML file in the &quot;components&quot; directory where the SwisTrack GUI resides that describes your component and its parameters. Use the components that are already there as a template.

If you compile and run SwisTrack now, you should be able to add your new component to processing pipeline.

=== 2. Implementing the Algorithm ===

# Constructor: data structure relations.

# Implement the OnStart() method.
# Implement the OnReloadConfiguration() method.
# Implement the OnStep() method.
# Implement the OnStepCleanup() method.
# Implement the OnStop() method.


=== 3. Creating a Configuration file ===

# Copy the file &lt;i&gt;SwisTrackEnvironment/Components/Template.xml&lt;/i&gt; and name your new file &lt;i&gt;MyNewComponent.xml&lt;/i&gt;.
# Open this file in a text editor (preferable XML-capable) and replace the title, description and URL of the component.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This category, though ''often'' empty, is still used.  In the Pathfinder organization, new honors are introduced annually.  The requirements are released before the insignia is available.  At Wikibooks, we add those honors to [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] and begin adding answers to it as soon as the requirements are released.  However, the insignia may not be available immediately - sometimes it is not available for a year or even more.  When this happens, the {{tl|AY patch unavailable}} template is added to the honor which adds the honor to this category.  When the insignia eventually becomes available, the {{tl|AY patch unavailable}} template is removed from the honor and this may be empty again for a while.  For this reason, the category should not be deleted or nominated for deletion.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:41, 4 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

Essence of '''''Murtlap''''' Tentacles is shown to be a powerfully healing and soothing solution.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] serves a detention with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], he is required to write lines with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Torture Quill|a quill which creates a wound on the back of his hand]]. After a week and a half of this, he is in considerable pain. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] gives him a bowl of Essence of Murtlap Tentacles, which he finds extremely soothing.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]] falls afoul of Professor Umbridge and is similarly abused, Harry recommends Murtlap to him; Lee, then, evidently suggests the same cure to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] when they are suffering self-inflicted boils in a rather private place.

It is in ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' by &quot;Newt Scamander&quot; that we learn that the Murtlap is a rat-like creature with a growth on its back that resembles a sea anemone.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort's]] followers are called '''''Death Eaters'''''. Given Voldemort's fascination with death and immortality, it is likely that he chose this name, rather than it being one they created for themselves. They were apparently calling themselves this by the time they and Voldemort, who was still known as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], graduated from Hogwarts.

== Event Details ==

We first hear the term '''Death Eaters''' in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] asks what the meaning is of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] floating in the sky, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Weasley Family|the Weasleys]] explain that it is the mark of Voldemort, used by the Death Eaters to show places where they have been and have worked their evil.

The term is then used frequently through the rest of that book, for instance when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] tells Harry, Hermione, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff]] was a Death Eater, or that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] had been suspected but never brought to trial. The book ends with the duel in the cemetery, which starts with Voldemort summoning his Death Eaters to announce his return.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 25|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], there is a mass escape of Death Eaters from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban prison]] after the prison guards, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], defect and join Voldemort. Harry perceives the actions of some of these Death Eaters by way of the connection between his mind and Voldemort's, but it is only at the end of the story that we see what the Death Eaters are up to, when Harry and his friends are trapped in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Department of Mysteries]] by twelve Death Eaters.

As Voldemort's return is now accepted by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], the actions of the Death Eaters become somewhat more open. However, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], we do not see much of them, though we see that the Ministry is actively promoting possibly-useful defensive tactics, and some characters, notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], have gone into hiding for their own protection. Protection at Hogwarts is also heightened because of the threat. However, the only open activity by Death Eaters, apart from action by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], who Harry alone suspects is a Death Eater, appears at the end of the story, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|the Battle of the Lightning-Struck Tower]]. There, Death Eaters invade the school, and act to support Draco in his mission, which is apparently to kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. Eventually, when he fails in his mission, it is taken over by Severus Snape, who thus declares himself to be firmly on the side of the Dark Lord.

In the first few chapters of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the Ministry falls completely to Voldemort, and the activities of the Death Eaters move completely into the open.

Voldemort makes a very clear distinction between the full Death Eater and the collaborator. The members of the group who are allowed to call themselves Death Eaters are marked with a tattoo of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|the Dark Mark]] on their left forearm. Touching this mark allows the person touching it to send a message to all others bearing the mark, but in the process evidently pains all bearers of the mark. This is a form of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protean Charm|Protean Charm]].

It is also well worth noting that there is a continual battle for status within the ranks of the Death Eaters. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we see Voldemort assigning places for his Death Eaters to sit. Pride of place is accorded to Snape, who is seated at Voldemort's right hand. The Malfoy family, in disgrace for having failed multiple times, is seated at the foot of the table.

Known Death Eaters include:

*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Avery|Avery]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, he was sentenced to imprisonment in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], but escaped when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] left the prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power. He apparently decided that Voldemort's ideas were too evil for him, and tried to leave the group. Rumour is that Voldemort killed him personally.&lt;!-- While our understanding of his actions increases in the seventh book, that is rather a spoiler and should be left out of this write-up. --&gt;
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, she was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, but escaped when the Dementors left the prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, he was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, but escaped when the Dementors left the prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crabbe, Sr.|Crabbe, Sr.]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was apparently tried but not convicted, and returned to Voldemort's service at his return
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] may not have been formally a Death Eater, but did take part in an attempt to find where Voldemort had gone after his first rise to power. He was sentenced to Azkaban, escaped, and subsequently was instrumental in allowing Voldemort to return
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Antonin Dolohov]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, but escaped when the Dementors left the prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gibbon|Gibbon]], a Death eater in Voldemort's second rise to power, died in the Battle of the Lightning-Struck Tower.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Goyle, Sr.|Goyle, Sr.]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was apparently tried but not convicted, and returned to Voldemort's service at his return
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], though not one of the true Death Eaters (distinguished by the tattoo of the Dark Mark on the left forearm), was all the same a member of Voldemort's forces, though apparently working for loot rather than &quot;glory&quot;. He does claim to be a Death Eater at one point, but not in front of Voldemort or any of the true Death Eaters.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Jugson|Jugson]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, but escaped when the Dementors left the prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, but had his sentence commuted when he revealed the names of other Death Eaters then unknown to the Ministry.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, but escaped when the Dementors left the prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan Lestrange]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, and may have died in prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus Lestrange]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, but escaped when the Dementors left the prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walden Macnair|Walden Macnair]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was apparently tried but not convicted, and returned to Voldemort's service at his return
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], apparently made a Death Eater in Voldemort's second rise to power.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was apparently tried but not convicted, and returned to Voldemort's service at his return
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]], possibly a tattooed Death Eater, but definitely in the group because her husband and son were part of it. It is unknown whether she had been part of the Death Eaters organization in Voldemort's first rise to power.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mulciber|Mulciber]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, and apparently died there.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nott|Nott]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, but escaped when the Dementors left the prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, he was involved in the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]], and the imprisonment of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Going into hiding, he was later instrumental in the return of Voldemort to power.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augustus Rookwood|Augustus Rookwood]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban, but escaped when the Dementors left the prison.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Evan Rosier|Evan Rosier]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, his fate is not mentioned in the books.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|Thorfinn Rowle]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's second rise to power, his previous history is unknown
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Selwyn|Selwyn]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's second rise to power, his previous history is unknown
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], not actually a Death Eater, but boasts in a pub of being close enough to the Dark Lord to know some of his secrets in the early days of Voldemort's second rise to power. Sentenced to Azkaban, and later escapes. When we see him, he is working with the Death Eaters under the effects of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]].
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, was either tried and released, or did not come to trial, based on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] testimony that he had turned in place and was now working against Voldemort. His loyalties remain uncertain throughout much of Voldemort's second rise to power.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], not actually a Death Eater, but working for the Death Eaters under the effects of the Imperius curse.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's second rise to power, his previous history is unknown
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilkes|Wilkes]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's first rise to power, killed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]] before Voldemort fell
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]], a Death Eater in Voldemort's second rise to power, his previous history is unknown

== Notable Consequences ==

The reappearance of the Death Eaters in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', after thirteen years of quiescence, causes a certain amount of panic at the Ministry and in the populace. This panic is fueled additionally by stories appearing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']], written by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]. Rita is a popular muck-raking journalist, whose scurrilous stories are calculated to improve the circulation of the paper.

The ever-increasing presence of Death Eaters in the Wizarding world does cause an increase in tension, and an increase in the number of refugees, either leaving England or going into hiding within the country.

== Analysis ==

There is some question as to exactly when the name &quot;Death Eaters&quot; first came into use. There is a suggestion that the name was in use before Tom Riddle had even left school; it is certain that he was already using the name &quot;Lord Voldemort&quot; at that time, as the diary [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], created when Riddle was a sixth-year student, already uses that name for himself / itself. However, in Dumbledore's memory of Tom's request to become a teacher of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], Dumbledore says that he is aware that Tom's followers are now calling themselves Death Eaters, which implies that the name is new at that time. We are told that this memory was recorded ten years after the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]], which in turn occurred some time after Tom Riddle had graduated from Hogwarts.

The name of the group surely reflects Voldemort's obsession with, and fear of, death. The name that Voldemort has chosen for himself, based on the French &quot;''vol de mort''&quot;, &quot;flies or runs from death&quot;, is another indication of this obsessive fear. The name of his followers, the Death Eaters, seems cut from the same fabric. It is most likely that Voldemort has chosen this name for his followers himself. The same is likely true for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]], set up by Dumbledore, whose familiar is a Phoenix, to oppose Voldemort.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm thinking of building one of these tear drops - but probably not until next year...but I just bought a trailer (a redtrailer.com one) and I kind of thought I could design the teardrop to come off the trailer at will, so I could use the trailer and/or the teardrop.  I think using threaded inserts would work - I'd have to get under to take it apart - but it's probably possible, do you think?

great book by the way, I'd like to help when I start mine.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, we study measure spaces and measures.

==Measure Spaces==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a σ-ring.

We call the pair &lt;math&gt;\left\langle X,\mathcal{M}\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; a '''measure space'''. Members of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''measurable sets'''. 

A positive real valued function &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''measure''' if and only if,

(i)&lt;math&gt;\mu (\varnothing)=0&lt;/math&gt; and

(i)&quot;Countable additivity&quot;: &lt;math&gt;\mu\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_i\in\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint sets.

we call the triplet &lt;math&gt;\left\langle X,\mathcal{M},\mu\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; a '''measurable space'''

A '''probability measure''' is a measure with total measure one (i.e., &amp;mu;(''X'')=1); a probability space is a measure space with a probability measure.

==Properties==
Several further properties can be derived from the definition of a countably additive measure.

===Monotonicity===
&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is monotonic: If &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; are measurable sets with &lt;math&gt;E_1\subseteq E_2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mu(E_1) \leq \mu(E_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Measures of infinite unions of measurable sets===
&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is subadditive: If &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_3&lt;/math&gt;, ... is a countable sequence of sets in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, not necessarily disjoint, then

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\left( \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty E_i\right) \le \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is continuous from below: If &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_3&lt;/math&gt;, ... are measurable sets and &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;E_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n'', then the union of the sets &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is measurable, and

:&lt;math&gt; \mu\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty E_i\right) = \lim_{i\to\infty} \mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Measures of infinite intersections of measurable sets===
&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is continuous from above: If &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_3&lt;/math&gt;, ... are measurable sets and &lt;math&gt;E_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n'', then the intersection of the sets &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is measurable; furthermore, if at least one of the &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; has finite measure, then 

:&lt;math&gt; \mu\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty E_i\right) = \lim_{i\to\infty} \mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

This property is false without the assumption that at least one of the &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; has finite measure.  For instance, for each ''n'' &amp;isin; '''N''', let

:&lt;math&gt; E_n = [n, \infty) \subseteq \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;

which all have infinite measure, but the intersection is empty.

==Examples==

==Counting Measure==

Start with a set Ω and consider the sigma algebra X on Ω consisting of all subsets of Ω. Define a measure μ on this sigma algebra by setting μ(A) = |A| if A is a finite subset of Ω and μ(A) = ∞ if A is an infinite subset of Ω, where |A| denotes the cardinality of set A. Then (Ω, X, μ) is a measure space. μ is called the counting measure.

==Lebesgue Measure==
For ''any'' subset ''B'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, we can define an outer measure &lt;math&gt; \lambda^* &lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda^*(B) = \inf \{\operatorname{vol}(M) : M \supseteq B \}&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt; M \ &lt;/math&gt; is a countable union of products of intervals . 

Here, vol(''M'') is sum of the product of the lengths of the involved intervals. We then define the set ''A'' to be Lebesgue measurable if 

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda^*(B) = \lambda^*(A \cap B) + \lambda^*(B - A) &lt;/math&gt;

for all sets ''B''. These Lebesgue measurable sets form a σ-algebra, and the Lebesgue measure is defined by λ(''A'') = λ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'') for any Lebesgue measurable set ''A''.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

== Polynomial Design ==

A powerful tool for the design of controller and compensator systems is '''polynomial design'''. Polynomial design typically consists of two separate stages: 

#Determine the desired response of the system
#Adjust your system to match the desired response.

We do this by creating polynomials, such as the transform-domain transfer functions, and equating coefficients to find the necessary values. The goal in all this is to be able to arbitrarily place all the poles in our system at any locations in the transform domain that we desire. In other words, we want to arbitrarily modify the response of our system to match any desired response. The requirements in this chapter are that the system be fully controllable and observable. If either of these conditions are not satisfied, the techniques in this method cannot be directly implemented.

Through this method it is assumed that the plant is given and is not alterable. To adjust the response of the system, a controller unit needs to be designed that helps the system meet the specifications. Because the controller is being custom designed, the response of the controller can be determined arbitrarily (within physical limits, of course).

== Polynomial Representation ==

Let's say that we have a plant, ''G(s)'', and a controller, ''C(s)''. Both the controller and the plant are proper systems, composed of monic numerator and denominator polynomials. The plant, ''G(s)'' has an order of ''n'', is given, and cannot be altered. The task is to design the controller ''C(s)'' of order ''m'':

:&lt;math&gt;G(s) = \frac{b(s)}{a(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \frac{B(s)}{A(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Our composite system, ''H(s)'' will have a transfer function of:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = C(s)G(s) = \frac{B(s)b(s)}{A(s)a(s) + B(s)b(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Our characteristic equation then is:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_H(s) = A(s)a(s) + B(s)b(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Our plant is given so we know ''a(s)'' and ''b(s)'', but ''A(s)'' and ''B(s)'' are configurable as part of our controller. To determine values for these, we must select a desired response, that is the response that our system ''should have''. We call our desired response ''D(s)''. We can configure our controller to have our system match the desired response by solving the '''Diophantine equation''':

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = A(s)a(s) + B(s)b(s)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Diophantine Equation ===

The Diophantine equation becomes a system of linear equations in terms of the unknown coefficients of the ''A(s)'' and ''B(s)'' polynomials. There are situations where the Diophantine equation will produce a unique result, but there are also situations where the results will be non-unique.

We multiply polynomials, and then combine powers of ''s'':

:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = (A_0a_0 + B_0b_0) +&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;(A_0a_1 + A_1a_0 + B_0b_1 + B_1b_0)s +&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\cdots + (A_ma_n B_mb_n)s^{m + n}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can equate the coefficients of ''D(s)'' and our resultant system of equations is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
a_0 &amp; b_0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
a_1 &amp; b_1 &amp; a_0 &amp; b_0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
a_n &amp; b_n &amp; a_{n-1} &amp; b_{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_0 &amp; b_0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; a_n &amp; b_n &amp; \cdots &amp; a_1 &amp; b_1 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_n &amp; b_n \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}A_0 \\ B_0 \\ A_1 \\ B_1 \\ \vdots \\ A_m \\ B_m \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}D_0 \\ D_1 \\ \vdots \\ D_{n + m}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This matrix can be a large one, but the pattern is simple: new coefficients are shifted in from the left, and old coefficients are shifted off to the right on each row.

=== Conditions for Uniqueness ===

The diophantine matrix, which we will call ''S'', has dimensions of ''(n + m + 1) &amp;times; (2m + 2)''. The solution to this equation is unique if the diophantine matrix is square, and therefore is invertable. If the matrix has more columns then rows, the solution will be non-unique. If the matrix has more rows then columns, the poles of the composite system cannot be arbitrarily placed.

The condition for uniqueness can be satisfied if ''m = n - 1''. The order of the controller must be one less than the order of the plant. If the order of the controller is higher, the solution will be non-unique. If the order of the controller is lower, not all the poles can be arbitrarily assigned.

=== Example: Second Order System ===

{{TextBox|1=We are given a system ''G(s)'', and are told that we need to design a tracking system with a desired system response ''D(s)''. ''G(s)'' and ''D(s)'' are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;G(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 - 1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D(s) = (s + 2)^3 = s^3 + 6s^2 + 12s + 8&lt;/math&gt;

Our plant has order ''n = 2'', which means the controller must have an order ''m = 1'' for a unique solution. Also, our desired response is an order ''n + m = 3''. Our controller resembles a PID controller form:

:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \frac{B_0 + B_1s}{A_0 + A_1s}&lt;/math&gt;

Constructing the Diophantine equation gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}A_0 \\ B_0 \\ A_1 \\ B_1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}8 \\ 12 \\ 6 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The bottom two rows give us:

:&lt;math&gt;A_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = 6&lt;/math&gt;

And the top two rows give us:

:&lt;math&gt;B_0 = 14&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B_1 = 13&lt;/math&gt;

And our final controller becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \frac{14 + 13s}{6 + s}&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Example: Helicopter Control ===

{{SideBox|1=The following section of this page is excerpted with permission from [http://wikis.controltheorypro.com/index.php?title=Pole_Placement ControlTheoryPro.com].}}

Pole placement is the most straightforward means of controller design. Here are the steps to designing a system using pole placement techniques:
#The design starts with an assumption of what form the controller must take in order to control the given plant.
#From that assumption a symbolic characteristic equation is formed.
#At this point the desired closed-loop poles must be determined.
#Typically, specifications designate overshoot, rise time, etc.  This leads to the formation of a [http://wikis.controltheorypro.com/index.php?title=Second_Order_Systems 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order equation].  Most of the time the final characteristic equation will have more than 2 poles.  So additional desired poles must be determined.
#Once the closed loop poles are decided a desired characteristic equation is formed.
#The coefficients for each power of ''s'' are equated from the symbolic characteristic equation to the desired.
#Algebra is used to determine the controller coefficients necessary to achieve the desired closed-loop poles with the assumed controller form.

Typically, an integrator is used to drive the steady-state error towards 0. This implies that the final characteristic equation will have at least 1 more pole than the uncontrolled system started with.

The following pole placement examples show you how to decide on the desired closed-loop poles, determine the &quot;extra&quot; closed-loop poles, and create a generic and [http://wikis.controltheorypro.com/index.php?title=PID_Control PID controller] to achieve those desired closed-loop poles.

{{TextBox|1=

Let's assume a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order system of with the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s)=K\frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s+\omega_n^2} \mbox{ for } 0 \le \zeta \le 1&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the system gain
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; is the system's natural frequency
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the system's damping ratio.

Also, we assume a compensator of form

{{eqn|1}}
:&lt;math&gt;K\left(s\right)=\frac{\left(B_{0}+B_{1}s\right)}{A_{0}+A_{1}s}&lt;/math&gt;

is adequate to control the plant. The resulting characteristic equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=\left(s^2+2\zeta\omega_ns+\omega_n^2\right)\left(A_0+A_1s\right) + \left(B_0+B_1s\right)\omega_n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be reduced to:

{{eqn|2a}}
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=A_1s^3+\left(2A_1\zeta\omega_n+A_0\right)s^2+\left(A1\omega_n^2+2A_0\zeta\omega_n+B_1\omega_n^2\right)s+\omega_n^2\left(A_0+B_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In matrix form this is:

{{eqn|2b}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}p_0\\p_1\\p_2\\p_3\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\omega_n^2 &amp; \omega_n^2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 2\zeta\omega_n &amp; 0 &amp; \omega_n^2 &amp; \omega_n^2 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\zeta\omega_n &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}A_0\\B_0\\A_1\\B_1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point we must decide what closed loop poles we would like.  In order to do this we need to consider system overshoot and settling time (or time to peak).  The equations for each are

:&lt;math&gt;M_p=e^{\left(\frac{-\pi\zeta}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_s=\frac{4.6}{\zeta\omega_n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_p=\frac{\pi}{\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;M_p&lt;/math&gt; is overshoot,
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_s&lt;/math&gt; is settling time, and
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_p&lt;/math&gt; is time to peak.

Using the Overshoot equation we find that a common value, &lt;math&gt;\zeta=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, provides an overshoot of only 4.3%.  Examination of the Time to Peak equation lets you know that a value of &lt;math&gt;\omega_n=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; provides a peak time of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; seconds.  However, a little over 3 seconds is probably too slow.  Let's shoot for 0.5 seconds instead.  This requires 

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_n=\sqrt{2}\frac{\pi}{0.5}&lt;/math&gt;.

Recap
*&lt;math&gt;\zeta=\zeta_{desired}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\omega_{n}=\omega_{desired}=\sqrt{2}\frac{\pi}{0.5}=8.8858&lt;/math&gt;

However, this leaves us with only 2 roots (poles) in our desired characteristic equation.  Since we want the above parameters to dominate the closed loop system dynamics we choose a 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; pole that is well above the desired natural frequency.

{{eqn|3}}
:&lt;math&gt;\left(s+a\right)\left(s^2+2\zeta_{desired}\omega_{desired}s+\omega_{desired}^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;a=10\omega_{desired}&lt;/math&gt; is our 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; pole.

This 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; pole is a high frequency pole that allows the desired poles to the dominate the closed-loop system response while allowing the desired characteristic equation to have the correct number of poles.

Our desired characteristic equation, Eqn. 3, can be reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{desired}\left(s\right)=s^3+\left(2\zeta_{desired}\omega_{desired}+a\right)s^2+\left(\omega_{desired}^2+2\zeta_{desired}\omega_{desired}a\right)s+a\omega_{desired}^2&lt;/math&gt;

This results in

:&lt;math&gt;p_3=1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_2=2\zeta_{desired}\omega_{desired}+a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_1=\omega_{desired}^2+2\zeta_{desired}\omega_{desired}a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_0=a\omega_{desired}^2&lt;/math&gt;

From here we go back to our characteristic equation (Eqn. '''2a''' or '''2b''') to determine

:&lt;math&gt;A_1=1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_0=2\zeta_{desired}\omega_{desired}+a-2\zeta\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_0=\frac{\left(a\omega_{desired}^2-A_0\omega_n^2\right)}{\omega_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_1=\frac{\omega_{desired}^2+2\zeta_{desired}\omega_{desired}a-2\zeta\omega_nA_0-A_1\omega_n^2}{\omega_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Caveats ==

There are a number of problems that can arise from this method.

=== Insufficient Order ===

If ''K(s)'' has a polynomial degree ''m'', and ''G(s)'' has a polynomial degree ''n'', then our composite system ''H(s)'' will have a total degree of ''m + n''. If our controller does not have a high enough order, we will not be able to arbitrarily assign every pole in our system. From state space, we know that poles that cannot be arbitrarily assigned are called uncontrollable. The addition of a controller of insufficient order can make one or more poles in our system uncontrollable.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|fixed}} keyword is used to prevent the garbage collector from relocating a variable. You may only use this in an ''unsafe'' context.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;

fixed (int *c = &amp;shape.color) {
  *c = Color.White; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you are using C# 2.0 or greater, the {{C sharp|fixed}} may also be used to declare a fixed-size array. This is useful when creating code that works with a [[:w:Component Object Model|COM]] project or [[:w:Dynamic-link library|DLL]].

Your array must be composed of one of the primitive types: {{C sharp|bool}}, {{C sharp|byte}}, {{C sharp|char}}, {{C sharp|double}}, {{C sharp|float}}, {{C sharp|int}}, {{C sharp|long}}, {{C sharp|sbyte}}, {{C sharp|short}}, {{C sharp|ulong}}, or {{C sharp|ushort}}.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
protected fixed int monthDays[12];
&lt;/source&gt;

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|explicit}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== General ===

When values are cast implicitally, the runtime does not need any casting in code by the developer in order for the value to be converted to its new type.

Here is an example, where the developer is casting &lt;i&gt;explicitly&lt;/i&gt;:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
// Example of explicit casting.
float fNumber = 100.00f;
int iNumber = (int) fNumber;
&lt;/source&gt;

The developer has told the runtime, &quot;I know what I'm doing, force this conversion.&quot;

Implicit casting means that runtime doesn't need any prompting in order to do the conversion. Here is an example of this.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
// Example of implicit casting.
byte bNumber = 10;
int iNumber = bNumber;
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Keyword ===

Notice that no casting was necessary by the developer. What is special about implicit, is that the context that the type is converted to is totally lossless i.e. converting to this type loses no information, so it can be converted back without worry.

The {{C sharp|explicit}} keyword is used to create type conversion operators that can only be used by specifying an explicit type cast.

This construct is useful to help software developers write more readable code. Having an explicit cast name makes it clear that a conversion is taking place.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
class Something 
{
  public static explicit operator Something(string s)
  {
     // Convert the string to Something
  }
}

string x = &quot;hello&quot;;

// Implicit conversion (string to Something) generates a compile time error
Something s = x;

// This statement is correct (explicit type name conversion)
Something s = (Something) x;
&lt;/source&gt;

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|unchecked}} keyword prevents overflow-checking when doing integer arithmetics. It may be used as an ''operator'' on a single expression or as a statement on a whole block of code.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
int x, y, z;
x = 1222111000;
y = 1222111000;

// used as an operator
z = unchecked(x*y);

// used as a statement
unchecked {
  z = x*y;
  x = z*z;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|volatile}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|volatile}} keyword is used to declare a variable that may change its value over time due to modification by an outside process, the system hardware, or another concurrently running thread.

You should use this modifier in your member variable declaration to ensure that whenver the value is read, you are always getting the most recent (up-to-date) value of the variable.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
class MyClass
{
  public volatile long systemclock;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{C sharp/Keywords}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This keyword has been part of the C# programming language since .NET Framework 1.1 (Visual Studio 2003).

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|unsafe}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|unsafe}} keyword may be used to modify a procedure or define a block of code which uses unsafe code.  Code is unsafe if it uses the &quot;address of&quot; ({{C sharp|&amp;}}) or pointer operator ({{C sharp|*}}).

In order for the compiler to compile code containing this keyword, you must use the {{C sharp|unsafe}} option when using the Microsoft C-Sharp Compiler.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
// example of unsafe to modify a procedure
class MyClass {
  unsafe static void(string *msg) {
    Console.WriteLine(*msg)
  }
}

// example of unsafe to modify a code block
string s = &quot;hello&quot;;
unsafe {
  char *cp = &amp;s[2];
  *cp = 'a';
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the provided '''shortpath.dll''' and '''uigetpath.dll''' don't work it's probably because they were compiled against a previous version of Matlab.  But the source code is included so you can re-compile with your current version of Matlab, first setup mex, at the Matlab prompt type:
    &gt;&gt; mex &lt;font color='#a020f0'&gt;-setup&lt;/font&gt;
and Matlab will say
    Please choose your compiler for building external interface (MEX) files: 
 
    Would you like mex to locate installed compilers [y]/n? 
so choose 'y'
Matlab then lists the available compilers:
    Select a compiler: 
    [1] Lcc-win32 C 2.4.1 in C:\PROGRA~1\MATLAB\R2007a\sys\lcc 
    [2] Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003
    [0] None
    Compiler: 
'''Note:''' I have Visual Studio 2003 installed, that's why I have 2 options. If you have Borland installed you would also see it listed above.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The compiler used with MinGW and Cygwin (gcc) isn't listed, because it's not registered in Windows the same way that Matlab, Visual Studio etc. are.  This is the very reason for using Gnumex to setup options for gcc. Choose [1] to use the compiler provided with Matlab.

Now change directories into '''c:\gnumex\src''' and compile the .c files:

    mex &lt;font color='#a020f0'&gt;shortpath.c -output shortpath.dll&lt;/font&gt;
    mex &lt;font color='#a020f0'&gt;uigetpath.c -output uigetpath.dll&lt;/font&gt;

You might get an error like this when compiling uigetpath.c:

 c:\docume~1\beau\locals~1\temp\mex_c58982ee-6281-4e1f-e2ac-723987a01052\uigetpath.obj .text: undefined reference to '_SHGetMalloc@4' 
 c:\docume~1\beau\locals~1\temp\mex_c58982ee-6281-4e1f-e2ac-723987a01052\uigetpath.obj .text: undefined reference to '_SHBrowseForFolder@4' 
 c:\docume~1\beau\locals~1\temp\mex_c58982ee-6281-4e1f-e2ac-723987a01052\uigetpath.obj .text: undefined reference to '_SHGetPathFromIDList@8' 
 
   C:\PROGRA~1\MATLAB\R2007A\BIN\MEX.PL: Error: Link of 'uigetpath.dll' failed. 
 
 &lt;font color='#ff0000'&gt;??? Error using ==&gt; mex at 206
 Unable to complete successfully.&lt;/font&gt;

But luckily uigetpath.dll is not crucial to the function of Gnumex.  I believe it's only used when a &quot;Browse&quot; button is pushed, to present the user with a browseable folder tree.  To avoid using it, just type paths into the text boxes in Gnumex.  This error does not occur when I use the Visual Studio compiler most likely because its mexopts.bat file is setup to properly link to Microsoft libraries for the _SH functions listed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now that you have a working shortpath.dll (and possibly uigetpath.dll) copy it/them to the root Gnumex folder (c:\gnumex).

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Introduction'''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The source code for the SPM mex files references a few header files - and their respective compiled libraries - that typically exist in Unix/Linux distributions but not in Windows. To overcome this limitation a Linux environment called Cygwin can be installed on a Windows machine and the mex file compilation can be done within that environment.  Compiling mex files within Cygwin alone would require that the Cygwin DLL be distributed with the mex files in order for them to work. Because the Cygwin DLL contains MANY compiled Unix routines it is overkill.  To avoid using the Cygwin DLL, the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) package can be used instead to provide the minimal Unix functionality that the SPM mex files require.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The follwing is what I finally arrived at (after some trial and error and online research) as a working setup to compile the mex files for SPM2 for use with Matlab R2007a on Windows XP...
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Step 1:''' Setup Gnumex
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Matlab's mex command is actually a batch file (in unix it's a shell script) that calls a perl script that runs the selected compiler to build appropriate mex files. When mex is run it consults mexopts.bat to find the chosen compiler and command line options for it. Normally mexopts.bat is generated by Matlab when you run ''''mex -setup'''' and choose a compiler from the list of those installed. Gnumex takes on this task instead and generates a proper mexopts.bat so that the mex command calls the compiler in Cygwin or MinGW (the compiler is actually gcc).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are using Matlab R2007a or later you will have to edit gnumex.m to accommodate your version. Assuming that Gnumex is installed in '''c:\gnumex''' and you've added that to the Matlab path, run '''edit gnumex.m''' from the Matlab prompt.  Starting on line 619 of gnumex.m there is an &lt;font color='#0000ff'&gt;if/elseif&lt;/font&gt; block that checks a variable '''mlv''' (obtained from Matlab's '''version''' command) this check only reaches up to version 7, we need to add a block to process 7.4.  At line 648 replace &lt;font color='#0000ff'&gt;end&lt;/font&gt; with:
  &lt;font color='#0000ff'&gt;else&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color='#228b22'&gt; % matlab R2007&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    mexdefs = {};&lt;br&gt;
    engdefs = {};&lt;br&gt;
    fmexdefs = {};&lt;br&gt;
    fengdefs = {};&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;font color='#0000ff'&gt;end&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now you can run '''gnumex''' from the Matlab prompt and setup the options as you see below:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:gnumex_setup.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The above options assume that you've installed Gnumex to '''c:\gnumex''' and MinGW to '''c:\mingw'''.
Now hit the '''Make opts''' button. Gnumex itself uses 2 mex files '''shortpath.dll''' and '''getpath.dll''' to be exact, so if you receive an error like this:
    &lt;font color='#ff0000'&gt;??? Undefined function or method 'shortpath' for input arguments of type 'char'.
    Error in ==&gt; gnumex at 567&lt;br&gt;
          s = shortpath(s);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Error in ==&gt; gnumex at 591&lt;br&gt;
      pps = gnumex('parsepaths', pstruct);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    ??? Error using ==&gt; gnumex('makeopt')&lt;br&gt;
    Undefined function or method 'shortpath' for input arguments of type 'char'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    ??? Error while evaluating uicontrol Callback&lt;/font&gt;

You may have to [[SPM/Compile the gnumex mex files]] so that they will work with your version of Matlab BEFORE you can use gnumex itself.

Again, if you are using Matlab R2007a or later you will now have to edit the mexopts.bat file that Gnumex generated in order to make it work with you version of Matlab. By default the file is located in:
    C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\MathWorks\MATLAB\R2007a
Add the following lines to mexopts.bat directly under the ''''Added libraries for linking'''' section replacing the existing '''set GM_ADD_LIBS''' line:
    set ML=C:\PROGRA~1\MATLAB\R2007a\extern\lib\win32\micros~1
    set GM_ADD_LIBS=%ML%\libmx.lib %ML%\libmex.lib %ML%\libeng.lib %ML%\libmat.lib
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Step 2:''' Edit the Makefile
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Makefile that's included With the SPM2 source code needs a couple of additional options so that the compiler will know where to search for header files and library files when compiling/linking. On about line 60 you should see something like:
    make all SUF=dll     CC=&quot;gcc -mno-cygwin -O3 -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer ...
Within the double quotes of the CC= statement there may be a number of options like:
    -I/some/path or -L/some/path
it is probably safe to remove these defaults and insert the following:
 -DMINGWPIDT -I./ -I/cygdrive/c/mingw/include -L/cygdrive/c/mingw/lib -L/cygdrive/c/progra~1/matlab/r2007a/extern/lib/win32/micros~1
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Step 3:''' Edit win32mmap.h
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Open up the header file win32mmap.h in c:\spm2.  On line 23 or so you should see:
    &lt;font color='#0000ff'&gt;typedef int&lt;/font&gt; pid_t;
but for our compilation we will use a pid_t definition from MinGW, so wrap this line in an &lt;font color='#0000ff'&gt;#ifndef&lt;/font&gt; statement:
    &lt;font color='#0000ff'&gt;#ifndef&lt;/font&gt; MINGWPIDT
    &lt;font color='#0000ff'&gt;typedef int&lt;/font&gt; pid_t;
    &lt;font color='#0000ff'&gt;#endif&lt;/font&gt;
this will tell the compiler not to use pid_t from SPM's provided file if MINGWPIDT is defined (which it is, because of the -DMINGWPIDT option added to the Makefile).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Step 4:''' Compile
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Startup Cygwin and change directories to the SPM2 folder. Cygwin has a Unix like filesystem structure but maintains a list of drive-letter folders in /cygdrive so if you installed SPM2 in '''c:\spm2''' then:
    &lt;font color='#008000'&gt;&lt;b&gt;user@localhost&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color='#808000'&gt;&lt;b&gt;~&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;font color='#787878&gt;$ cd /cygdrive/c/spm2&lt;/font&gt;

    &lt;font color='#008000'&gt;user@localhost&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color='#808000'&gt;/cygdrive/c/spm2&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;font color='#787878&gt;$ make windows&lt;/font&gt;
If you need to recompile it's best that you 'clean' the build environment, that is, delete temporary and intermediate files left behind by the last call to 'make'. You can do so with:
    &lt;font color='#008000'&gt;user@localhost&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color='#808000'&gt;/cygdrive/c/spm2&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;font color='#787878&gt;$ rm *.o; rm *.a; rm *.dll&lt;/font&gt;
Hopefully all went well and you didn't get any errors, you should now have a working set of dll files for SPM2.

'''SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS'''

Start with a blank approx 210mm by 70mm

Make a marking stick (template) for your design

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Image:S%26ptemplate.JPG

BLANK

1.	Turn to round

2.	Mark the division between top and bottom with template

3.	Part in ~ 50% of the way

4.	Cut a spigot on top and bottom for re-mounting

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Image:S%26pblank02.JPG

5.	Divide the work on the bandsaw or with a handsaw

UPPER HALF

6.	Mount the top section first

7.	Square off the end and then round the blank to approx 55mm

8.	Mark the top point (nearest the headstock) with the template and part in

9.	Drill in with 1&amp;1/8th inch forstner bit to no more than 5mm of top 

10.	Now open the hole with a parting tool by approximately 6mm width (or half the dimension 
of the wall and 10mm deep. Gauge and set the depth with the depth gauge. 
NB. If the join is deeper the total height of the work is correspondingly smaller

11.	Part off, leaving a ‘nub’ for the tailstock on re-mount of the whole

BOTTOM HALF

12.	Square the end and round the blank to approx 55mm

13.	Drill in with forstner bit to within 10mm of the base

14.	Mark the base of the tenon with the depth gauge (refer step 10) 1-2mm shorter so that the join is seemless

15.	Part in and form the tenon carefully so the top is a comfortable jam fit. NB. Don't force a tight fit as the top will split

JOIN THE WORK

16.	With the components together, bring up the tailstock and round the entire work to finished dimension of 50mm

17.	Sand through grades to 400

18.	Mark the details with template

19.	Check the bottom dimension against the paired unit before parting in

20.	Cut the beads and round the top

21.	Sand the details to 400

22.	Remove the tailstock and carefully finish the top with the skew chisel

23.	Using the index wheel, mark the top with Awl for Salt or Pepper
Salt:	Center ~ 2.5mm
		Stops 8, 16, 24 ~ 2.5mm
	Pepper:	Center ~ 2.5mm
		Stops, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 – 1.5mm

FINISH THE BASE

24.	Mount the base on a custom mandrel and drill through with 5/8th inch forstner bit, or one that suits the plug you are using.

25.	Dish the base as necessary to suit the plug

== New Zealand Prime Ministers at the Start of the Twenty First Century (1999-2008) ==
===Helen Clark===

[[Image:Helen Clark 2.jpg|thumb|right|Prime Minister Helen Clark]]

Helen Clark (born on the 26th of February 1950) was the Prime Minister of New Zealand at the turn of the Twenty First Century, entering the role after the 1999 elections and serving until Labour's defeat in the 2008 elections.

Clark was the second female Prime Minister of New Zealand, serving three terms as Prime Minister, and being the leader of the Labour Party from 1993.

Clark's Government brought in significant changes to New Zealand's welfare system, most notably the Working for Families package. Her Government also changed the industrial-relations law, and raised the minimum wage six times. Other changes included the abolition of interest on student loans (after the 2005 election), and the introduction of 14 weeks paid parental leave. Helen Clark's Government also supported some highly controversial laws such as legal provision for civil-unions. Laws such as these somewhat shook the faith that the New Zealand public had in the Government.

Under the Helen Clark Government, New Zealand maintained a nuclear-free policy, thought to be at the cost of a free trade agreement with the United States of America. Clark and the Labour Party also refused to assist the United States in the Iraq invasion.

In March 2003, referring to the U.S. led coalition's actions in the Iraq War, Clark told the newspaper Sunday Star Times; 
&quot;I don't think that September 11 under a Gore presidency would have had this consequence for Iraq.&quot; 
She subsequently sent a letter to Washington apologising for any offence that her comment may have caused.

[[Image:John_Key_2013_(edit).jpg|thumb|right|Prime Minister John Key]]


===John Key===
John Key (born on the 9th of August 1961) was elected as the 38th Prime Minister of New Zealand on the 8th of November 2008, as the leader of the National Government.

National formed a coalition with the ACT party, Maori Party and United Future to make up the  Government. The Labour Party (led by Phil Goff), the Green Party and the Progressives made the new Opposition.

John Key was the first male Prime Minister of New Zealand in more than a decade, succeeding Jenny Shipley (1997-1999) and Helen Clark (1999-2008).

==Politics in the Twentieth Century==
'''Political Parties and Key Policies of the Twentieth Century'''

At the turn of the century, the Liberals, New Zealand's first modern political party, were in power as the Government. The Liberals created a 'family farm' economy, by subdividing large estates and buying more Maori land in the North Island. New Zealand gained strong economic ties with Britain, exporting farm produce and other goods. Under Liberal, New Zealand started to form its own identity, and due to this, New Zealand declined to join the Australian Federation of 1901.

The Liberals were defeated in the 1912 election by the Reform Party, and never fully recovered. William Massey, the leader of the Reform Party, had promised state leaseholders they could freehold their land, which proved to be a good promise in winning the election. Under the Reform Party, New Zealand entered World War I, aiding Britain.

New Zealand had prosperous years at the end of the 1920s, and so was hit hard by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Conservative coalition government failed to get New Zealand out of the Depression, which led to the rise of the Labour Party in 1935.

Under Labour, New Zealand's economy slowly recovered. The Reserve Bank was taken over by the state in 1936, spending on public works increased, and the State Housing Programme began. The Social Security Act 1938 increased the state of welfare dramatically.

With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the New Zealand Government again chose to support Britain with troops. New Zealand also chose to fight in Korea in the early 1950s.

In 1945, Peter Fraser played a significant role in the conference that set up the United Nations, but the Labour Government was losing support. In 1949, the National Party became the Government of New Zealand. In the 1960s, the National Government sent troops to Vietnam to keep on side with the United States, despite protests, but this didn't hinder New Zealand's support of the National Party, and National ruled New Zealand until 1984 with only two exceptions.

New Zealand's culture remained based on Britain's through the 1960s, and the economy was still mainly made up of exporting farm produce to Britain. However, when Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973, New Zealand no longer had an assured market for farm products.

After the second oil shock of 1978, the National Government tried to fix the problem with new industrial and energy initiatives and farm subsidies. The economy faltered in the 1980s when the fall of oil prices made these schemes unsound. Inflation and unemployment went up as a result.

The National Government of 1990-99 passed the controversial Employment Contracts Act which opened up the labour market, but diminished the power of trade unions.

In 1996, a new voting system was introduced, Mixed Member Proportional Representation, which allowed minority or coalition Governments to become the norm, but the National and Labour parties still remained dominant.

'''''Summerby''''' is Seeker for the Hufflepuff Quidditch team in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s fifth year.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

It is mentioned that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], then Seeker for Gryffindor, had caught the Snitch from right under Seeker Summerby's nose. She says it was luck; he had a cold and didn't see the Snitch because he was about to sneeze.

==Making a more user-friendly Main Page ==

As a newcomer, I find the Main Page not very helpful. It's not easy to see what Wikibooks has to offer, and were it not for my preconceptions from Wikipedia, I wouldn't know what to do with it.

One of the things not easy to find is what completed books there are, and how much assumed knowledge each book has. I'll try, if I may (I don't wish to over-impose myself as a newcomer and hope my comments are taken as being constructive), to make an initial mock-up of what the Main Page could look like to encourage further comment, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:53, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

:I'll be the first to admit that the Main Page needs some work.  The aspect that really needs to get some work is the list of Wikibooks that appear underneath the voting page links, and a decision regarding what to do with Wikijunior.  Perhaps Wikijunior needs to simply be moved to its own Bookshelf, and listed with the rest of the bookshelves.  I added Wikijunior to the navigation sidebar, so I don't think it is so necessary to have as prominent of a link on the main page that it has.

:We also need to completely rework the whole bookshelf issue as well.  This list of Wikibooks is growing and perhaps just a list of bookshelves, or a list of prominent Wikibooks that are of similar quality to the Book of the Month winners.  If we want to simply suggest that Book of the Month winners alone can be on the front page, I would be supportive of that idea.  The list of newly created Wikibooks is a good idea, and I don't want to get rid of the list of books on each of the Bookshelves, like we have it currently.  Just that this information needs to move to another page besides the main page, with a very large link from the Main page to this new Bookshelves page.

:Most of the elements of this main page need to be kept in some form or another, but we can do a better job than we have so far.  Suggestions have come from other Wikibooks projects (in other languages), and perhaps we need to listen this time?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:32, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

The first page you see before creating an account should let you know that you need to create a new one even if you have other wiki accounts (eg wikipedia) [[User:Mccready|Mccready]] 13:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

:While this is a good suggestion, some people use the fact that you are clueful enough to create a user page for your account as a sign of a veteran user and somebody who therefore deserves respect.  The term that has been thrown around on Wikipedia is &quot;Red-shirt&quot; users and &quot;Blue-shirt&quot; users, refering to the color of the link when a user signs their name.  Some others add extra value when you have a customized user signature, but I consider that to be utter nonsense myself.

:The issue of multiple accounts is going to be addressed real soon, with the lead developer of the MediaWiki software, Brian Vibber, who has a working common account system that is somewhat shortly going to be adopted for all Wikimedia projects.  How much the user data is going to be tied together from one project to another is going to be interesting to see, especially considering that some users have multiple account names across various Wikimedia projects, and I believe that sysops are going to need a little more access to user accounting systems to get this system working properly.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:48, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

IMO it would be a good idea to have a main page specificly for readers with link to the current front page. The idea is that a person should be able to start reading without knowing a thing about wikibooks. I think of a small introduction followed by a organised portion of completed books, follow by the less completed books in seperated sections. just my 2 cents  --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 14:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)



I don't like the logo very much, it is so different from the wikiversity, ir the wikipedia ones, which are so much more dynamic--[[User:Afa86|Afa86]] 03:00, 5 November 2006 (UTC)--[[User:Afa86|Afa86]] 03:00, 5 November 2006 (UTC)



I think that maybe you should consider making the main page less like Wikipedia and a little easier to navigate the bookshelves.  The ideas are great, but the books themselves are difficult to navigate, and so you really have to know how to use one of the other Wiki sites in order to navigate, which can make it quite difficult for the new user to understand.  Just a thought.


I love present layout, thanks to all.

== main page organization ==


[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:21, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
I have completed a list of umbrellas on my user talk page.
It may be missing a few items, but more or less all i did was
crunch what you have allready. (check out the history.)
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:21, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

anyways, just two cents...
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 03:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

: I think books should be organised according to number of books, not theoretical divisions. Currently we have great advantage of books related to computer science, and as result we have three bookshelves connected to computers. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:24, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

I guess this is more organization by topic vs. organization by necessity.  Our bookshelves were originally developed by a similar method to simply decide what some major topics we would be working on, then try to stuff books into them.  The problem is that some of our bookshelves have grown considerably and needed a breakup, which is why there are five seperate computer bookshelves, and some new bookshelves that have grown from the Miscellaneous bookshelf as several books that were organized along the same theme have been grouped together and thrown onto their own seperate bookshelf.

Frankly, we need some help in providing some more realistic methods of searching for content on Wikibooks, and I would encourage you to help participate with our [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]], which was established to help with the classification of the various Wikibooks along several different methods including doing Library of Congress cataloging and using the Dewey Decimal System as well.  As these are original works, there isn't a clear catalog number that has been assigned to any of these Wikibooks (so far) and the art of classifying information, Ontology, is something that we are lacking currently with Wikibooks.  If you have an idea about this, please join the discussion on the Card Catalog Office, or add a note on [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff Lounge]].  Reworking this main page is something that has been discussed there several times and we can use all of the reasonable ideas that we can come up with.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:51, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 00:58, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
This is the main point that i think needs to be made. Pragmatic
concerns are real concerns, and it is somewhat silly to have a half
empty book shelf on one end of the library, and an overstuffed one
on the other end. However, Ontology should take reasonable precedence, or you end up with groupthink out of the apparent (and subliminal) sense of how things are being slotted. If person x wants to write a book about topic y, they may reject the idea of doing it here only because the organizational schema doesn't seem to include
them; there is no &quot;slot.&quot; Other concerns, at this point, are even beyond this; the lack of an apparent ontology might even make user
x wonder why they would bother associating themselves with such a slipshod organization. If it is meaningfully necessary to have 25 bookshelves under computers, then list on the main page only those
books nearly or fully complete, create a new page, and have the other bookshelves there. (For instance.) Something else to consider is that there ought to be simple criteria stated in front of the bookshelf so that users can determine whether or not their book idea
would go on that shelf. The best umbrellas are the largest umbrellas.
The best organizational schema take advantage of the largest possible
umbrellas and then use smaller umbrellas as the need arises.
I'll post this also at the lounge, i hope that this isn't forking
the conversation.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 00:58, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
change that, I will play with organizing this page on my user talk page.[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 01:00, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

== Links ==

I need links to see the whole book, like I dont want to see individual pages or chapters, I want the whole books.  Then I dont need to download like 50 chapters all at different links.  I'd like to see links to view the entire book on one page in the future.

: Ok, we are working on in. There's a project [[Help:Print versions]] aiming to add such version to every book. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:04, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

===functional main page ===

What about heading the main page with a functional table of books that are ready to read? Readers can then go straight to the book they desire. ie:

{|border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: honeydew; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; width:100%; &quot;

PDFs for Trigonometry and High School Extensions etc. would be needed.
Unfortunately I am no artist so the colour scheme and layout could be improved. Perhaps authors can make the production of print versions a priority?

Readers, who are interested in less complete books, and contributors can then be given a more complex set of instructions further down the page. (I have also posted this at &quot;staff lounge&quot;).  '''This would be a temporary fix with some other method being used once 30 or so substantial books have been completed'''. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:44, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

==more proposals for highlighting good stuff==

I think the inclusion of the highlighted books section at the top of the main page is a big step in the right direction. I still think there is a need for a lot more motion in that direction, however. The basic principle I'd like to suggest is that the material closest to the top of the page should be the material that is most likely to be useful to ''readers''. Almost none of the New Wikibooks box is useful to readers, since these are books that don't have a significant amount of useful material yet. The Wikijunior books also don't deserve to be so high up, IMO; if the books are of particularly high quality, they can be listed in the Highlighted Books banner, and in fact a couple of them are. I think the most important improvement that could be made, however, would be to break up the Active Bookshelves listing so that books with a significant amount of useful content (say 50%+ development stage) are listed first, and the rest are listed later. Check out [[Weight Loss]] for an example of the kind of garbage that is mixed in with the good stuff. My guess is that a lot of the reasons the main page is designed the way it is have to do with the feeling that wikibooks needs to attract writers. However, I think the current state of the page is accomplishing the opposite -- potential writers are likely to look at the main page and get the impression that wikibooks is a failure, and that it's therefore not something they want to contribute to.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 22:02, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

:The point of listing Wikijunior prominently was mainly to collect support for what was arguably a totally brand new Wikimedia sister project, and the fact that $10,000 USD of cold, hard cash went into the coffers of the Wikimedia Foundation to help pay for getting this project off the ground.  Supposedly this was money that was to be spent as seed money for hard copy (dead-tree) versions of this content, but I think the money has already been spent on the server farm.  The people who got the grant money have not been talking to the people doing the work on Wikijunior content.  As the money has already been spent, and no new grant money has come in, the need for such a prominent place on the front page is more in the past.  Besides, I added the link on the navigation sidebar, which is plenty of advertising for Wikijunior anyway.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:05, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

::I totally aggree, the material near the top of the main page should be whatever is most useful to the site visitors, especially new ones. And it is much better to have a few, good links, than many, useless links. We should work to bring people to the places where they will find useful content with as little problem as possible. We should de-emphasize new books. By the way, IMHO, Wiki Jr should remain on Wikibooks, because they are books. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 20:32, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

:This is a monthly chore that has to be done by ''somebody'', and I'm glad that you took up the challenge and got it done.  Thanks!  I did it last month, and is one way to demonstrate that this project is far from dead.  The Wikijunior new book of the Quarter is a bit trickier as I didn't know how to introduce a quarterly template onto a page.  The monthly ones seem to be a bit easier to make (as are daily features).  Who does this should be a little better organized, but I've seen the red links only go for about a half day before they get fixed on the main page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:26, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

== Specific Suggestions to Improve the Main Page ==

* Reduce New Wikibooks section to just a link
* Include links to the 15-35 most complete books, in a section that might replace the highlighted books section
* Include a link to a page with just &quot;good&quot; books, instead of &quot;all&quot; books
* Replace the browse section by a link to a new page called &quot;find a book&quot;
* Include link to a page of downloadable PDFs

Update the wikibooks logo to make it look more sexy and web 2.0ish.

===Comment on New Wikibooks List===

While I would agree that most of the old Main Page needed to go, this is one aspect I think does add value and serves a purpose on the front page.  From the vantage point of being an administrator, I use it as a gague to see what sorts of new content people are coming up with and I've been able to spot problem Wikibooks in advance, or at least try to deal with the issue before it becomes a flame war.

From the viewpoint of a new (or even veteran) Wikibookian, this gives you a place to advertise a new Wikibook as a general call for support.  This has even proven useful in some situations and has given some Wikibooks the initial &quot;shot in the arm&quot; to become something more than a mere stub.  As they are only listed there for just two weeks at the most, and the list has generally stayed comparatively small, I also fail to see why it needs to be removed.  A mere link to another page wouldn't serve this function and I will predict that it will become a dead and useless page (the new Wikibook page) unless that content is left on the main page.  It also keeps the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] from getting cluttered with new book announcements.

All in all, though, I think this is a good direction that has happened, and a reasonable cleanup.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:22, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

::If you think we should leave it, I'm willing to be flexible about it, what do you think if we include it a little bit below some other information in one of those two big colored boxes? And do you know how to clean up the spacing and stuff there? I have been working on it on my free time here from work today but at the moment it looks kinda funny and I have not been able to get it cleaned up... Thanks! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 01:34, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Why not reduce this page to Semi Protection? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 22:31, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

: The main page need to be protected from vandals - and getting a new user is easy enough - only this week we had [[Bar Ilan Troll 1]] to [[Bar Ilan Troll 8]] to deal with. On then other hande: Most of the main page consists of templates and not all of those are fully protected. Still - If you plan an overhaul and have good ideas for it I would consider reducing protection for a short while. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:17, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

== looks good ==

DRAT! just lost a whole reply!

okay, starting over. 

*I think that the new page looks awesome. I think that the search/browse function is right where it needs to be, and that the component problem mentioned can't be helped. Theres two types of Users here, the Community user and the Info User.

*I'd like to see a lot more umbrellas. For instance, &quot;Religion&quot; deserves its own umbrella.  I think that there ought to be an imaginary line between Text Books and other types of books, and thatthe two shouldn't be shelved under the same umbrella. The stated mission of Wikibooks is &quot;Open Source Textbooks.&quot; That doesn't mean that we have to disinclude other types of books in the library, but I
think a section of the library, for main page purposes below the rest of the umbrellas, ought to be reserved for POV/fiction. I have a couple of examples i will try to link to.

*The first is &quot;Universalist Religion.&quot; Great premise, Great Idea,
dastardly and ignorant implementation by an Author ignorant actually of their subject. Don't Delete the book, its a fine book.
Move the book to a bookshelf entitled &quot;Religion, POV.&quot; A bookshelf at the very bottom of the organizational chart. If the Author could be coerced to finish the book via a discussion process, that would be great. Short of that, It is too eccentric an organization for others to jump into. I would love to be the guy to walk him through it. Serious POV problems.
[[Developing A Universal Religion]]


*There is a place for Factual Texts regarding religion. However,
Religion is inhernatly POV. As we descend away from Fact and into
POV, I think Religion propper ought to be right on that imaginary
line, below the POV demarker, and perhaps a second Religion shelf
below the rest of the POV would be nice for Serious POV like the example above. (A Textbook covering, by way of example, the factual
axioms of a given religion, or, reporting regarding a given religions
publications, for instance, would go in the first category. Books discussing, making an argument, apologists materials, and so forth
go in the second category.)



&lt;pov+&gt;God for the Third Millennium &gt;&gt;God for the third millenium is out of place here. and probably Religion POV not Religion propper.&lt;&lt;

-Religion-Ayyavazhi-Christianity-The Gospel of John-Islam-Islam Way of Life  - Christian Theology-

(Religion, not +POV)Topical Bible Study Reference Tool - &gt;Is does this belong here, or in &quot;education&quot;?
Constructivist Theories in Education

-Religions And Their Source - Developing A Universal Religion -


*&quot;Aspergers Survival Guide.&quot; I have Aspergers, AND the equal of a Doctorate in Psychology. This book is full of POV and cognicentrism, as well as magical thinking. A TEXTBOOK it is not. A very valuable window into Aspergers, It IS. Keep the book, but put it under that imaginary line of POV, on a different shelf than standard psychology,
as in &quot;Psychology; POV.&quot;
[[A survival guide for people on the autistic spectrum]]

*Harrypotterville &quot;School of Magic&quot; again, I have tons of info from Comparative World Religions, including Shamanism and Wicca, which i could unload on this hapless ignorant Author. This book isn't factual, and never tried to be. It has no place being listed as a &quot;School&quot; with the rest of them, it direly needs assorted POV disclaimers. However, as a &quot;POV; Fiction&quot; book, it is a great little
adventure, and I'd like to see it finished.
[[School of Magic:Magic in the Prehistory]]
(As a side note, where this book tries to be factual it is full
of serious errors. For instance, Chaldea is not the first place 
where Magic was practiced.)
(more on serious factual errors.)

[[Talk:School of Magic:About the Magic]]

* I hope that you see where I am going with this. &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; Doesn't really fit, unless it is also disclaimed, because by ontological deduction, the miscellaneous slot we have is for miscellaneous FACTUAL materials. We don't need to disinclude POV from
Wikibooks, in my opinion. We do need to propperly label and shelve it
so that people know what they are getting into. I'm thinking of starting a new club over at wikipedia. It would be the MPOV club. The
job of this club would be to infuse Wikipedia articles with as much POV as is reasonable, rather than editing out and neutering articles
of all POV. The use of appropriate disclaimers, and a sense of how much depth to go into is important here. The Psychonaut Article in Wikipedia is a great example. Here, MPOV really just wants to see a list of the different types of psychonauts, linking to the different
religions. Not a lot of material, but enough to show that Psychonaut is a trans-denominational term, and enough to link it appropriately to the pov slots that are RELEVANT. In Wikipedia, finding an article laced with POV is grounds for drasticlly reworking or deleting an article. That is a necessary function of what Wikipedia is. Here, I don't think that needs to be the case. Instead we can just label and shelve it accordingly.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonaut

*Back to my original point. I'd like to see about twice or three times as many main page bookshelf areas. (listed on the main page.)The POV issue is just one of the issues that justifies this. (And the easiest example for me to illustrate. A Whole new set of issues arises with things like Wikijunior.)
-----------
&quot;'''Natural Sciences'''&quot;Computer Science – Engineering – Health science – Mathematics – Natural Science — The Free High School Science Texts: Physics
---------
Okay, this is a perfect example of umbrella crunch. Computer Science
isn't a natural science, its a technological science. Computer Science should probably get its own area on the main page, as should
Health Sciences, Mathematics, and so forth.
------------
Social Sciences
Business – Economics – Humanities – Languages – Law – Social science — Chinese (Mandarin)   — Consciousness Studies  – Japanese
------------
Again, Business+Economics belong together, but not under the same
umbrella as Linguistics, Psychology, and Sociology, All of which deserve their own main page umbrella.
------------
Miscellaneous
Education – How-to – Study Guides – Misc. — Cookbook   – How To Build A Computer   – Lucid Dreaming
----------------
Education deserves its own area, or, might fit under Psychology. &quot;How Toos&quot; are big enough that they deserve their own area. Lucid Dreaming should probably be double listed over in Psychology also. How to build a computer is a How TO- but it is more importantly a Computer Science Topic, and thus should shelve primarilly over there, and secondarilly under &quot;how too&quot;.
---------------  
Special Groups
Wikiversity – Wikijunior — Wikijunior Big Cats  – Wikijunior Solar System  –
--------------
I think Wikiversity and Wikijunior should both each get their own
area on the page also.

=== departments ===

It seems you missed the new level of structure: departments - or is it what you have called umbrellas? I have introduced departments to reflect the way most larger libraries and bookstores are organized:
---------
i didn't miss it, I am just suggesting more diversity. Umbrella is
a synonym here for umbrella. Umbrella actually is a generic term, and departments is one way of implementing the concept of umbrellas.
[[User:209.129.49.65|209.129.49.65]] 01:03, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 01:04, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
ps lol [[THINKSTARSHIP/Departments]]
---------------

In most bookstores the various shelves are organized in departments. Also some books of each department are placed on special display (I have decided for the book of the month winnners).

I allow a shelve to be shared between departments - currently this is used for computer games and computer science.

We could of corse have more departments - however a new department would need at least two shelves (better three) and probably one book of the month winnter to be complete. And each shelve should have at least 10 books - real books - not &quot;suggested books&quot; and better more.

For example you suggest [[Education bookshelf]] to for an department - but [[Education bookshelf]] has only 14 books. Think of it like this: You enter a large bookstore go to the escalator. At the escalator there will be a sign telling you on which floor you find which department. Could you imagine a department with 1 shelve and 14 book to be mentioned here?
----------------
obviously, the reason why an experienced wikibookian should implement this and not me is that i have no clue how much finished
versus partially finished materials you have here. Not to put the effort down, but the entire place is sort of in that state of chaos
that is proof of genius working hand in hand with eccentricity.
I'm not sure, but, this could mean that for the time being the situation should be left alone. Eventually more bookshelves will have
to be added.

There are two other departments at minimum you can't do without.
one is POV/Etcetera (POV/Politics, POV/Sociology, POV/Psychology, Alternative Sciences, Parapsychology and POV/Religion.) And 
Fiction/Etcetera (Fiction/Fantasy, Fiction Science Fiction,...)

Also, there are some other issues i brought up which you haven't adressed. They may be better at the staff lounge, etc.

== The Bookshelves ==

I didn't want to spread this around too much, so i put it here rather than all over the place, but the bookshelves need organizing.
The names, order, and concepts of the Bookshelves are all great. But many of the books are out of place. Sometimes by only a line or two, sometimes they are just in the wrong place period.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]]

== General Project Announcements ==

From time to time there is a request to have a special unique project announcement on the front page.  This would be for things that have a significant impact, such as the vote for Wikiversity on Meta, or a major policy change that needs the attention of many users.  One that is being discussed right now is the possibility of a &quot;Book of the Year&quot; award for the &quot;best of Wikibooks&quot; and a call to vote.

My question is more where would everybody think the most appropriate place to put announcements of this nature, especially if you think that perhaps a note on the Staff Lounge would be inappropriate.  I have been able to attract some people to a major voting discussion by posting a notice on the front page, especially if it isn't buried somewhere else.  The current organization of the main page doesn't seem to offer a natural place to put an annoucement of this nature.

As an example of where announcements like this are put with another Wikimedia project, see [[meta:|the main page of Meta]], and especially the &quot;Goings-on&quot; section.  Meta is more unique that there are always some sort of pressing issue that is being debated and discussed there.  I don't see that as so big of a deal here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:18, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

My opinion is that it goes about right here. But then again, I wouldn't have wikijunionr on this side, I'd have it on the other side. There are two things happening on the main page, the first is the community portal functions and the second is the macro for the bookshelves. Obviously, the community functions list becomes extraneous quickly, and the most relevant things are the sub macros
which help to navigate other than just the Shelves. Links to the

It makes navigation diffcult without pagination.

I don't usually find myself reading a book, especially a children's book, but thumbing through an index to find what I want and going there.  Usually I read cover-to-cover, in a linear sequence.

:I think this is more of if you want it, make it happen.  Many things of this nature have been added to Wikimedia projects simply because somebody felt a need to get it to work and jumped in to do it.  Any little thing like this is an appreciated addition to most of Wikibooks, but simply takes time to get it put together.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:05, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

I would like to write a book on improvised munitions, not because of any political beliefs, but because I believe it's obscure and complex knowledge.

Nobody answers in staff lounge. Geez, i'm really gonna have to help pull this place together. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Abnerian|Abnerian]] ([[User talk:Abnerian|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abnerian|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

: Wikibooks has a lot fewer active editors than WP, so responses generally take longer. Right now, a book on improvised munitions might be controversial for a number of different reasons. If you can document that a class on the subject exists, that would certainly make the book's acceptance easier. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:31, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

:I wouldn't get hung up over if there is a class taught on the subject, but I would ask if you are simply going to copy something from Palidin Press or if this is going to be a serious book about munitions in general?  I think a more through book about explosives including the history of explosives and how even (I guess you could call them non-improvised) commercial munitions are made.  BTW, I think you could find a class on this topic taught at the Ranger School at Ft. Lewis (Washington State), and perhaps at military academies.  Just don't try to write a Wikibook like this for shock value that has lame content, but because you really are an expert (ex-military or law enforcement) and want to write this book as a safty guide or as a genuine source of information.

::I would like to point out that the reason why this link was removed was explicitly because jumping to a random chapter/module in Wikibooks would give you some information that was completely out of context.  Indeed having a &quot;random book&quot; might be a better idea, but there are some technical issues to sort out here in order for that to occur.  Of most critical importance, the MediaWiki software (that runs Wikibooks and Wikipedia, as well as the other Wikimedia websites) does not support a &quot;jump to random book&quot; code to perform this task.  You could add this as a Bugzilla request for some future &quot;feature request&quot;, but I would be blunt and suggest that many within the Wikibooks community would not find this to be a very high priority over other features that would be of significantly higher value to improve Wikibooks.
::Of course, if you want to get into hacking MediaWiki source code and add such a feature into the code database, you are certainly welcome to dig in and make such changes.  That is not a trivial thing to accomplish, and the volunteer software developers are working on other much more pressing matters at the moment.  It would also be important to define what, exactly, is defined as a &quot;book&quot;, and wheither you want to include book stubs into that mix.  With &quot;standardized&quot; naming conventions now on Wikibooks, this is a little easier than in the past, but there are still some unconventional pages that would need to be described on a technical basis to implement this feature.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:05, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:The Wikimedia Foundation regularly advertise for donations.  Wikimedia projects like Wikibooks are not-for-profit and they rely on donations to continue operating.  The money goes towards support, computer servers and general maintenence of Wiki projects.  But I agree it would be more useful if they indicated exactly where the money would go.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 21:08, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

:Ditto to what Xania said.  The Wikimedia Foundation is in the middle of a semi-annual (it has been six months or so since the last one) fund raising drive.  The annual budget for the Wikimedia Foundation, which pays for the servers and computer equipment, as well as offering legal protection covering the projects and a legal basis for supporting these websites, is rapidly growing if only to support the huge crush of people who use these websites.  Bandwidth costs alone are quickly approaching six figures for an annual budget, and the quantity of equipment used for Wikimedia projects doubles about every 18 months or so with the current growth of users.
:All of this costs a considerable amount of money, although I would like to point out that the WMF is IMHO one of the better run non-profit organizations (at least fiscally speaking) that I have ever had to deal with.  I can say with a high degree of confidence that 80%-90% of all money donated to the WMF is going to be used for operational costs directly related to running this website.  The rest is very incidental, although unfortunate due to a number of individuals who try to milk money out of whatever places seem to have any sort of money at all, as the WMF currently is fielding a dozen or so lawsuits of dubious value, but need to be responded to even so.  
:There are from what I understand two paid staff members who run the &quot;office&quot;, and some additional money is also used to help pay travel costs for members of the board of trustees (who are all volunteers at the moment).  As this is a project which is truly international in scope, that is hardly a trivial expense for these volunteers who are of modest means themselves.

:From my viewpoint, these will return shortly, so there is no point to &quot;filling the hole&quot; at the moment.  It might be nice to put in a small box that explains why these common features are missing, and point to perhaps COTM and BOTM votes of the past, with a note that they will resume &quot;soon&quot;.

== Level of Completion ==

I would like to see the level of completion of a book/chapter/section. This would save time browsing incomplete books and section.

== Java Applets ==

What would it take to have the Wiki Foundation accept Java Applets in the wikibooks?  This would give the wiki books a true chance to shine above a typical text books by having interactive learning media.  For example, an applet could be created that would show students how to solve equations, and provide instant feedback if they are making the right manipulations on the equation.  This would be considerably more difficult using just java script.  Or a 2d physics kinematics simulator could show students how gravity, force vectors, friction and other elements of classical physics works in a simulated hands on environment.  Even if the wiki books were allowed to have the Java Applets only as an experimental feature (like MathML is) it would be a step in the right direction.  Any thoughts? [[User:68.74.185.94|68.74.185.94]] 17:12, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

:I would like to point out that a huge reason for no Java applets on Wikibooks is mainly security, particularly when all of the content here is editable by almost anybody.  If there is a security hole in Java (and there are several), it will be exploited by a vandal and wreck havoc on people who come to this project, even inadvertantly.  I hope that Javascript applets would be permitted eventually, but even that has been restricted and stripped from any web pages that are produced on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:38, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

:I believe some of the &quot;completed books&quot; information can be incorporated into the current page, but that version looks much too simple and unappealing to me.

::The new main page seems to have been produced for contributors rather than readers. But Wikibooks' goal is to provide books to be read and studied.  Commercial sites that provide books concentrate on the books for readers. Here are some examples of commercial ebook sites:

::http://www.ebooks.com/

::http://www.free-ebooks.net/

::http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page

::http://www.ebookimpressions.com/

::These sites may have close relationships with authors, publishers and hand held PC makers but they scarcely mention this on their main pages.  They stick to their main objective which is the provision of books to read.

::If [[Wikibooks:Nearly_complete]] is too simple and unappealing it could be improved by having images of the front covers for books and short descriptions (like the commercial sites).

:I would like to say that I disagree with this premise.  Wikibooks is not necessarily for the readers (although that would be a good thing to keep in mind when designing this page), as there are many methods of content delivery once we have some high quality books.  Instead, this website is really for the authors who are creating the content, and to help search for what content already exists so we don't have duplicated efforts when people are more willing to collaborate on existing projects.  The other e-book websites listed above are mainly for post-production distribution, and don't really relate here to Wikibooks.

:Perhaps the best comparable website is:  http://www.pgdp.net/c/ (Distributed Proofreaders)

:One of the interesting things about this particular website is that they openly encourage gaming the stats in various ways, as long as the quality of what you do contribute remains high.  And the number of active participants clearly is more than what Wikibooks has at the moment by at least an order of magnitude, even though the two projects are nearly the same age.

:What we really need to do here on this page is to make it appealing to new people to come and join our project, and show where they can perhaps add their new ideas.  The latest revisions seem to lack that appeal, which is one of the reasons I pushed for a replacement of the &quot;Book of the Month&quot; display that we had earlier.  It needs to be content focused, rather than policy focused if there needs to be some sort of serious change.

:I admit that the days are long gone that all significant Wikibooks can be listed on the main page without causing clutter ([[Wikibooks:All Books]] used to be on this page), but we still ought to remember why we are here:  to help collaboratively write textbooks and other useful book-like material.

:Or to paraphrase and significantly borrow a quote from a famous motion picture:  If we write the books, the readers will come.  We need to make as much of Wikibook as author-friendly as we can, even if it means sacrificing some of the ease of use for a reader.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

::Nonetheless, integrating the [[Wikibooks:Nearly complete]] page into the [[Main Page]] or at least taking what is on [[Main Page/test]] and integrating it will be best. The content of the page should at least span a larger space than the interwiki links on the left of the page. I'd like to see all of [[Wikibooks:Nearly complete]] present.

:::I've been very timid in regards to changes on the main page lately.  The culling effort has been largely one of reducing the items on the page, although I fail to see what the real harm was with what was displayed just a month ago.  There has certainly been a push and pull of what could be on here, so I'm not trying to complain too loudly about the most recent changes.
:::The only real difference from the test page to what is currently displayed right now on the &quot;live&quot; page is the &quot;Selected Books&quot; section.  This could be rolled into the effort I have done with the featured Wikibooks, and we could even have the selection go into a rotation with multiple books listed on the main page.  We don't have to have just one book at a time.
:::I havn't been too happy about the very arbitrary nature that some of the &quot;selected&quot; or &quot;good&quot; Wikibooks have been determined, even though those who have been editing the main page have done a good job of making the decisions for good and bad Wikibooks.  It just seems like a ripe target for an edit war if you have some strong opinions and a couple of admins don't agree with that opinion.  I tried to come up with an alternative approach with [[WB:FbN]], where those with strong opinions would have an outlet that can be kept under control, and flame wars can be isolated from the content itself.  There certainly have been some juicy wars on the [[WB:VfD]] pages, but once concensus has been reached most people go along with the decision gracefully.  I hope to keep this civil, but there are people with huge egos here on Wikibooks (myself included), and we need to somehow find a way to keep that in check.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

without knowing where to refer, i place my request here. croatian wikibooks rose well above 100 so i am asking to refresh that information in templates referring to the size of wikibooks. thanks. [[User:West Brom 4ever|West Brom 4ever]] 23:15, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

== Featured book icons... ==

Aesthetically it may look more pleasing to remove the icons and just put the text and other links above the description. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 08:45, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

:I would disagree, i think the images in general help to make the advertisements more pleasing. I will say, however, that some of the books don't lend themselves well to suck thumbnails, and for those few books the thumbs really do look awkward.  I dont think removing the images will be a general improvement, but i am open to being proven wrong. If you want to throw together a new template to showcase your ideas, we can compare the two side-by-side and decide as a community which one is better. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:09, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

== lyrics / songtext book ==

Is a book about lyrics/songtexts a valuable thing for the wikipedians? Does it have a great change of people are willing to expand it? My idea was to start with a wiki lyric book. I could not find any. [[User:Kassie|Kassie]] 18:51, 9 May 2007 (UTC)
: First of all, Wikibooks is not for books, but for textbooks (education-oriented). Secondly, most of lyrics are copyrighted. These, which are not, are suitable for [[s:|Wikisource]]. And BTW, I don't feel a wikipedian, rather a wikibookian. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:11, 9 May 2007 (UTC)
:: As Derbeth said, unfortunately most current popular songs are copyrighted and as Wikimedia is based in the USA this means that copyright laws must be respected. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:26, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

:::As a caveat, it would be possible to write an &quot;annotated text&quot; about a song. Also, if used in limited (extremely limited) quantities, song lyrics could be published under a &quot;fair use&quot; license for academic analysis. 
:::Now, if the lyrics you are talking about are not copyrighted (that is that they are over 100 years old) you can post them directly to wikisource. Or, if they aren't copyrighted, you can post them to wikibooks as part of an annotated text without having to invoke fair use, and without having to limit the quantity of lyrics you use.
:::Besides these exceptions, it is generally not a good idea to have a lyrics book here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 21:10, 9 May 2007 (UTC)
:::: I never thought about legal issues. Thanks for all the replies.
:::: @Whiteknight, please explain why you think lyrics ain't such good idea? [[User:Kassie|Kassie]] 21:35, 14 May 2007 (UTC)
:::::I only discourage it because wikibooks is for &quot;textbooks&quot;, not any type of random non-fiction book. There arent many classes in this world that study song lyrics, at least not lyrics for modern songs (famous musicals and operas are a different story, of course). If you wanted to use song lyrics here, you would have an uphill battle to prove the book was academic. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 22:02, 14 May 2007 (UTC)
:::::: I see your point. [[User:Kassie|Kassie]] 19:46, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== Children's books ==

wikibook is messed up. there is no section for children's book. where is it? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:67.80.57.214|67.80.57.214]] ([[User talk:67.80.57.214|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/67.80.57.214|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

*:I would say that although Wikijunior is the &quot;children's book center&quot; for Wikibooks, it would be nice to restore the section about Wikijunior somehow to the front page again.  I realize that there are several Wikijunior books in the featured book rotation, but the previous &quot;advertsement&quot; of Wikijunior did help with bringing fresh ideas and new users into the development of Wikijunior content.  The current design of this page has significantly de-emphasized Wikijunior, although this Wikibooks sub-project does have a side-bar link.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:35, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

::On the front page I think we should show 5 featured books (can include cookbook and junior books), 1 featured Wikijunior book and 1 cookbook recipe.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:41, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

:: This kind of goes back to what I've tried to suggest before. Having one book from each department. I agree with having 5 featured books and including cookbook and wikijunior books as part of that. I think there should be in each rotation exactly:

::* 1 book from the Natural and Social Science departments
::* 1 book from the Computing department
::* 1 book from the Humanities and Arts department
::* 1 book from the Cookbook
::* 1 book from Wikijunior

:: in order to give variety, show all that Wikibooks has to offer, and bring fresh ideas and new users into the development of all types of books. I disagree with emphasizing only Wikijunior, one specific project, or one part of Wikibooks. Wikijunior in addition to being linked to from the sidebar is also linked to from the main page under Special Groups. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:16, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

== Wikitextbooks ==

Why is it wiki books instead of wiki textbooks?  I got this completely confused with [[wikisource]] for awhile.  [[User:Mathiastck|Mathiastck]] 15:16, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

:It is a good question, although there isn't as much confusion over the names as you might think. In general, &quot;wikibooks&quot; is much more catchy and easy to remember then &quot;wikitextbooks&quot; or &quot;wiki textbooks&quot; or even &quot;wikimedia textbooks&quot; or any other variant. If i had been around when they named it, i might have suggested &quot;wikitext&quot; or something like that, although even &quot;wikitext&quot; comes with a certain amount of ambiguity as well. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:10, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

== Economics is a Social Science ==

“Economics” should not be lumped in with “Business”. Economics is a theoretical and empirical science that examines production, exchange, and decision making in human society, whereas Business is an applied art that sometimes makes use of Economic reasoning. Essentially, Economics is to Business as Physics is to Photography. Many schools, such as MIT (http://web.mit.edu/shass/dspc/) list Economics as a “Social Science”.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Nav}}[[Category:User:Whiteknight/Count Ticker]]

== Counter Ticker ==

The counter ticker is used to reduce load on the toolserver. By hosting the data here, especially in a form that is more conducive to book-like organization, it will reduce the need for people to load the data from the toolserver.

== About the Results ==

The Wikicharts hit count results are sampled to 1% of all hits. This is to prevent an overload of the server. The reported hit count, therefore, will be computed by taking the number of sampled hits and multiplying by 100. Notice that there is a '''bug''' in the way the results are computed. The total number of hits ''since the edit counter was first started in November 2007'' is divided by the current day of the month. I am currently working on ways to account for this bug in my aggregator, and a bug report has been filed with Wikicharts. 

All results are aggregated ''per-book'', not per-page. This means that the page counts on the wikicharts page list are added to the book count in a running tally. Book pages which do not appear on the Wikicharts list cannot be included in these totals. Because of the way page hits are sampled, it is hoped that the errors in this procedure will average out over time.

Starting in January 2008, on the last day of the month all the raw counts are replaced with subtracted per-day counts. In this way, the archives always show accurate data (and I dont need to change my algorithm to try and find the daily counts immediately). 

=== Thresholding ===

Only books that have higher then average hits will be displayed in the list. Since the page hit list can be approximated by a [[w:Poisson Distribution]], the majority of all books will be below this average. The '''threshold''' value is the computed hit average. Only books above this threshold will be displayed. The number of books with hits above this threshold will be displayed as '''Books listed'''. At the moment, i've implemented a hard cap at 50 books to be listed (more then that are truncated, regardless of the threshold).

The total hit count is a sum of the top 500 per-page hit counts, and is not a sum of the posted per-book counts. 

=== Report Format ===

The [[../Script|Script]] that updates the ticker is under active development, and the format of the page count results will be subject to change over time. Let me know on the scripts page about any features that I should add.

The reports are formatted using [[User:Whiteknight/HitsTotal]], [[User:Whiteknight/Hits]] and [[User:Whiteknight/Hits2]] templates. These templates will change over time.

=== Known Issues ===

no known issues at this time.

== Google Analytics ==

With the hit counter active, the google analytics test is no longer necessary for this purpose. Google page hit results will no longer be used with Wikibooks, but I will still maintain the account for future uses. I have disabled the google.js script, and any user who has installed it into their profiles can safely remove it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Nav}}[[Category:User:Whiteknight/Count Ticker]]

== Script ==

This is a planning page for my script that reads the hit counter and posts results.

=== Data ===

;Month: The month of the entry
;Total Hits: The total number of page hits counted by wikicharts since the counter was activated on October 5th 2007. Notice that these numbers are not accurate prior to January 3rd, 2008.
;Threshold: the threshold necessary for a book to appear on this list. This is computed statistically.
;Books Listed: The number of books above the threshold. Capped at 50.
;Posted: The time of day posted, EST.

Books are listed by the total number of page hits. The top 10 books are bolded. Per-book page hit data are proportional but inaccurate before January 3rd 2008. Page hits are counted continuously from October 5 2007. To get per-day hit counts, subtract the page hits from the number for the previous day. At the moment, this subtraction is not performed manually.

== Current Status ==

Script is up and running, regular updates. Script is set to automatically update the ticker every night at 9pm EST.

== Components ==

There are a number of different components that i'm working on right now.

=== Templates ===

I use various templates with the counter ticker. more details about them to come.

=== Uploader ===

This script is written in perl. It queries the hit counter every day at 9PM EST and posts the results onto wikibooks.

=== Graphs ===

I'm working on a custom javascript to graph the daily page hit counts. I've just about removed all the kinks. To install my graph tool (which has many uses besides just keeping track of page counts), add this line to your [[Special:MyPage/monobook.js|personal javascript]] file:

 import_script('User:Whiteknight/graph.js');

Once you do, you should be able to see a graph here:

{{User:Whiteknight/Graph|100, 30, 20, 70, 50, 90}}

This is tested to ''not work'' in IE6 and IE7. IE does not support the &amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt; tag, which is required for this to work. Works in Safari and FF2. I may try to come up with an alternate method for use in IE, but I make no promises about this.

== To Do ==

*Possibly use subst on templates.
*Possibly allow other counts to be graphed, possibly by searching archives.
*Set hard limit for number of records to post, such as 50.</text>

Refer to previous discussion [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Chat#Don't know what this is but|here]]. Problems: [[WB:NPOV]] and possibly [[WB:COPY]] if it is a previously published work.

* {{Vd}} This is biased, without sources and yet more religous nonsense.  Also what's with the new 'delete', 'keep' icons?  We only started using the old ones a few months ago. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:48, 15 September 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' - I agree that concerns about being a copyvio are justified... and a Google search found at least one significant source of the material.  This isn't so much NPOV but rather original research problems, where there is no basis to rewrite the material and perhaps even a work of fiction.  One of many reasons why fiction is not used on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:38, 15 September 2007 (UTC)

== Overview ==

'''''Evan Rosier''''' was one of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] that were part of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s organization. We believe that his father, only called Rosier, was also a member of the Death Eaters.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] were visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] in his cave hide-out outside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts|Hogwarts]], Sirius mentioned that one Rosier had been one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]'s friends, and he had been killed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]] the year before Voldemort fell.

When Harry is looking at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], one of the three scenes he witnesses is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] revealing names of Death Eaters in hopes that he will get his own sentence reduced. The first name he gives is that of Evan Rosier, and he is most disappointed that it is already known to the Ministry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following paragraph will describe the responsibilities of a Front Desk Receptionist. It is imperative that student workers and staff alike realize that students,staff, alumni and employers are our internal/external customers. With that in mind, professionalism is an absolute must. A smile brightens the day and is more accomodating, a frown will scare the customers away. The Front Desk Receptionist duties are as follows:

1. Provide excellent customer service skills, greet and direct that person(s)to the appropriate personnel.
2. Distribute mail and packages to the appropriate CMC staff member.
3. Inform and direct students to the Student Sign-In Kiosk for such services as Job Search, albeit Full/Time or Part/Time, Resume and Cover Letter Help or for Scheduled Appointments with various CMC staff members.
4. Open and Close the office. Ensure that everything is locked securely and properly.
5. Shutdown &amp; logoff all computers, forward the phones and turn off printer.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

At the final [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] is killed in battle.

== Event Details ==

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] returns to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], who is escorting him from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|the Hog's Head]] to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], assumes that he is there to liberate Hogwarts from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], and uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protean Charm|charmed Galleons]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] had created to recall [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. Presumably, a member of Dumbledore's Army who either was in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], or whose parents were Order members, passed the word, because members of the Order start to appear through the tunnel from the Hog's Head as well. One of the Order members who we see arrive is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]].

After Harry has returned from Ravenclaw Tower, he finds that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and Hermione have left the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], saying something about a bathroom. As the whole school has now been summoned to the Great Hall, Harry heads there to see if he can find them. There, he hears [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] sending non-combatant students home. Once only students who are of age are left, Order members at head table start assigning specific areas of defence. Lupin will head up the group that is defending the grounds.

Several times during the battle, Harry looks to the grounds to see if he can see Lupin, but is never successful.

After Harry witnesses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Severus' Death|death]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] offers a cease-fire so that Harry can surrender to him and prevent any more loss of life. Harry, returning to the school, looks into the Great Hall and sees Lupin, and his wife [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], lying among the dead.

After experiencing Snape's memories, Harry chooses to meet Voldemort, and his fate, in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Finding his way there blocked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], and being unable to summon a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], Harry uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] had left him, and summons the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|Shades]] of Lupin, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|his godfather Sirius]], and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|father]]. He asks if it had hurt to die, and Sirius says that it had not. Lupin adds that &quot;he will want it to be quick&quot;, meaning Voldemort.

The shades protect Harry from the Dementors as he walks through the Forest. Reaching the clearing where Voldemort waits, Harry drops the Resurrection Stone, and the shades vanish.

While we are not told this in the book, the author has stated in an interview that Lupin was killed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Antonin Dolohov]].

== Notable Consequences ==

Lupin's death once again reminds Harry that his is not the only life that is being affected by Voldemort's reign of power. This reaffirms his decision to do whatever he needs to do to eliminate Voldemort.

Lupin's and Tonks' deaths have left their infant son an orphan. Harry must be deeply affected by this, being an orphan himself, and as godfather having no little responsibility for Lupin's child.

Harry is able to summon Lupin's shade by use of the Resurrection Stone, and learns that Sirius felt little pain from his death; Lupin's silence on the matter seems to reassure Harry that he had also not felt much pain. This somewhat abates Harry's fear at the prospect of dying at Voldemort's hand.

== Analysis ==

Lupin has been a father figure to Harry, and we can see that Harry is deeply dismayed by his death. The reader is equally dismayed, as it seems that Lupin's death is unnecessary. We are at the very end of the story, the final battle is raging, so many of Harry's friends and heroes have already died... could not Lupin have been spared? We can't, of course, know the answer, but we can speculate. It is necessary to the story that Harry should now voluntarily confront Voldemort and his own death, and he needs support to do that, support which Lupin, alive, could provide. However, at the same time, Harry must face Voldemort alone; the author cannot have Harry's self-sacrifice diluted by the presence of Lupin, a character Harry cares deeply about, and the likely nucleus of a pitched battle as soon as any Death Eater saw him. Were Lupin still alive, it would be difficult for the author to avoid having Harry look to him for the support he needs, and if Harry did seek that support, it would be impossible for the author to prevent Lupin attempting to accompany Harry in to the Forbidden Forest. Dead, but temporarily returned by means of the Resurrection Stone, Lupin, Sirius, James, and Lily can provide the support Harry needs, without either triggering the battle the physical presence of any of them would cause, or requiring that Harry concern himself about their fates as he meets his own doom.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

As godfather to the now-orphaned Teddy Lupin, we can guess that Harry now feels that he has significant responsibility in his upbringing. We never do learn exactly what role Harry plays in Teddy's life, but we believe that it is not insignificant, as in the Epilogue, Harry's children refer to him as &quot;''our'' Teddy.&quot; As Teddy had been left in the care of Tonks' mother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]], it is a safe guess that it was Andromeda who did most of the rearing of the young Teddy, with a fair amount of help from Harry and his family.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

At the great [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] is killed in battle. Tonks was meant to be at home with her newborn son Teddy but came to assist her husband [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] who was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Remus' Death|also killed in battle]].

== Event Details ==

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] returns to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], who is escorting him from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|the Hog's Head]], has assumed that he is there to liberate Hogwarts from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], and uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protean Charm|charmed Galleons]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] had created, to recall [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. Presumably, a member of Dumbledore's Army who either was in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], or whose parents were Order members, passed the word, because members of the Order start to appear through the tunnel from the Hog's Head as well. One of the Order members who we see arrive is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]].

After Harry has returned from Ravenclaw Tower, he finds that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and Hermione have left the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], saying something about a bathroom. As the whole school has now been summoned to the Great Hall, Harry heads there to see if he can find them. There, he hears [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] sending non-combatant students home. Once only students who are of age are left, Order members at head table start assigning specific areas of defence. Lupin will head up the group that is defending the grounds.

Returning to the Room of Requirement in search of the final [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], Harry is accosted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], who demands to know where Lupin is. Asked about their son Teddy, Tonks says she has left him with her mother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]]. Harry tells Tonks that Lupin is defending the grounds, and Tonks runs off to find him.

After Harry witnesses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Severus' Death|death]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] offers a cease-fire so that Harry can surrender to him and prevent any more loss of life. Harry, returning to the school, looks into the Great Hall and sees Lupin and Tonks lying among the dead.

While this is not mentioned in the book, the author has mentioned in an interview since its publication that Tonks was killed by her aunt [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]].

== Notable Consequences ==

Tonks' death once again reminds Harry that his is not the only life that is being affected by Voldemort's reign of power. This reaffirms his decision to do whatever he needs to do to eliminate Voldemort.

Lupin's and Tonks' deaths have left their infant son Teddy an orphan. Harry must be deeply affected by this, being an orphan himself, and as godfather having no little responsibility for Tonks' and Lupin's child.

== Analysis ==

As was mentioned in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Remus' Death|the death of Remus Lupin]], painful as it is, the death of Lupin is somewhat necessary to the plot. Given that, however, could not Tonks have been spared? Again, we are unlikely to find an answer; however, we can speculate. Any such speculation must be fueled, in large part, by observation of the characters of Remus and Tonks, as portrayed by the author. One thing that is very obvious to the observer is the fierceness of the love Tonks holds for Remus. She has repeatedly fought to keep him, and is now fighting alongside him. It seems very likely to us that if Tonks saw Remus' death, or found him dead, that would impel her into a berserk attack on the surrounding Death Eaters, caring nothing for her own survival if she could take some of them with her, which would greatly increase the likeliness of her own death. 

That being said, it would not be thematically possible for one of the two to survive without the other; Tonks without Remus, or Remus without Tonks, would be a woefully incomplete half-couple, always around to remind Harry of what he had (in his own estimation) caused. We are at the end of the series; it is necessary to tie up all the loose ends, so to speak, and given that Lupin cannot remain, Tonks cannot be left to drag upon Harry's memory. Her death, painful as it is, allows Harry to move on after the death of Lupin, and allows the book and the series to come to a satisfactory close.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 23|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], the free [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|elf]], was mortally wounded while rescuing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and his allies from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]].

== Event Details ==

Captured by a group of Snatchers led by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]], and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblin]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] are taken to Malfoy Manor. There, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] sees that the Trio are carrying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]], and for some reason stops [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] from summoning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Keeping Hermione upstairs for questioning, Bellatrix has the others sent to a locked room in the cellar, where they encounter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] who are also being held prisoner there. Though the new arrivals are tied up, Luna has found a nail with which she is able to cut their bonds.

Bellatrix tortures Hermione to try to determine where they had found the Sword of Gryffindor. Desperate at hearing Hermione's cries of pain from above, Harry is nervously fidgeting with the fragment of the magic mirror [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] had given him years before, and sees a sky-blue eye looking out of it at him. Harry pleads for help from the owner of the eye, and shortly Dobby [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|apparates]] into the cell. Harry bids Dobby take Dean, Ollivander, and Luna to safety at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]]. From upstairs where she is now torturing Griphook, Bellatrix hears the noise of Dobby Disapparating, and sends [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] to investigate. Harry and Ron ambush Pettigrew but are unable to defeat him. Harry reminds Pettigrew of his life debt to Harry, which makes him hesitate; his own magical silver hand detects this and strangles him to death. 

Attempting to rescue Hermione and Griphook, Harry and Ron are forced to surrender when a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmed]] Bellatrix threatens Hermione with a silver knife. Dobby announces his return by causing a chandelier to fall on Bellatrix. Harry seizes the wands [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] is holding, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] Fenrir. Ron collects Hermione and Disapparates to Shell Cottage, while Harry similarly collects Griphook. As Harry Disapparates, Bellatrix throws her knife at him. Harry, not knowing where he is heading, is relieved to find, in the midst of his Disapparition, that he can feel Dobby alongside. Arriving at Shell Cottage, Harry discovers that Dobby has been fatally wounded by Bellatrix' thrown knife. Dobby dies moments later, his final words being &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.

Harry is deeply grieved and decides to dig Dobby's grave by hand without using magic. Ron and Dean join Harry and labor with him.  They place Dobby's body in the grave and give him socks, shoes and a hat. Standing over the grave, Luna thanks Dobby for rescuing them and the others follow. Harry fills in the grave and carves: &quot;HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF&quot; on a flat rock he places on the burial mound.

== Notable Consequences ==

Dobby's courage and eventual sacrifice saves the lives of seven people including the Trio.

Dobby’s death is an emotional turning point for Harry. While digging the grave, Harry finds that his grief distances his perceptions of Voldemort's thoughts, and decreases the pain in his scar. From this point on Harry is able to manage and exploit his connection with Voldemort in a way that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] lessons and other attempts have failed to do. His ability to grieve and love is focused, and his emotions are, at last, under his control.

While it is not directly associated with Dobby's death, Bellatrix' response to finding the Sword of Gryffindor in their possession is what leads Harry to believe that there is something of great value to Voldemort in Bellatrix' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] vault. The Trio had previously overheard Griphook reporting to another group that while it was believed that the Sword had been moved to a deep vault at Gringotts, all the Goblins involved in handling it had known at once it was a fake. Harry guesses that the still-undetected fake had been put in Bellatrix's family vault, and that there was something else in there, precious to Voldemort, that would be at risk if the Sword had been removed. Harry further guesses that the precious object is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcruxes|Horcrux]], likely [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff]]'s cup.

The goblin, Griphook, notices Harry reverently digging Dobby's grave and thereafter considers Harry an uncommon wizard who respects non-humans.  This facilitates the trio's plan to steal the Hufflepuff Cup Horcrux from Gringotts.

Though they have lost their own wands, in the battle Harry captures wands belonging to Pettigrew, Bellatrix, and Draco. This will quite likely prove important later.

== Analysis ==

While Dobby's death seems unnecessary and perhaps cruel, it is necessary for two plot points, mentioned above. Until now, Harry has been unable to block sendings that are coming from Voldemort, and it is only because of the immediacy of his grief that he is able to dampen the images that are making their way from Voldemort's mind to his own. Additionally, it is necessary to make a significant impact on Griphook in order to gain his alliance. This latter point is worth some additional inspection. 

Over the past several chapters, Harry, Ron, and Hermione have been trying to determine the sorts of locations that would be likely for Voldemort to have hidden his remaining Horcruxes. Harry, from his lessons with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], knows that Voldemort will select locations that represent links to his magical ancestry, and the supposed status springing from that. One such location, obviously, is Hogwarts, a place that Harry and Voldemort both see as having been almost home-like in their welcoming of wizards rejected by Muggle society. (Ron, having a real home and family to return to, does not see Hogwarts as being home-like, and so discounts this possibility.) Bellatrix' obvious fear at the prospect of having Voldemort discover something has been taken from her Gringotts vault leads Harry to believe that Voldemort has hit on the deep vaults at Gringotts, traditionally used only by the most ancient Wizarding families, as being fit to house a Horcrux, and Bellatrix' vault has been selected for that honour. But how to get in there? The Gringotts goblins take great pride in the security of their vaults. About the only way that such an incursion could have any hope of succeeding is if a disaffected ex-employee of Gringotts can help them gain entrance. The author has carefully made one such turn up, but he, like the rest of his race, does not hold &quot;wand-bearers&quot; in any particular esteem. Somehow, Griphook must be convinced to throw in with the Trio, and Dobby alive is simply not going to be enough influence to do that; the slavish obeisance house-elves pay to humans is well-known enough that it is not going to impress Griphook. It is only the respect that Harry shows to Dobby by digging Dobby's grave that convinces Griphook to grudgingly lend his assistance.

While Griphook, as mentioned, must be won to alliance, it is necessary to the story also that he be a reluctant ally. His price for assistance is the Sword of Gryffindor, which is apparently necessary for the destruction of Horcruxes. Griphook's departure with the Sword leaves Harry with more puzzles that he must answer before the final Horcruxes can be eliminated.

It is also mentioned above that Harry captures three wands. We will find out that the nature of their capture is important, and also whose wands they are.

The first wand belonged to Peter Pettigrew. Ron had forcefully removed that from Peter in their struggle in the cellar. At Bellatrix' order, he had dropped that wand and Draco had collected it. Harry then wrests it away from Draco and throws it to Ron, who is then able to use it. We will find out shortly that a wand will transfer its allegiance if it is forcefully removed from its bearer. Because Ron dropped it, it does not surrender its allegiance to Draco who collects it, nor to Harry who takes it from Draco, an unrelated party as far as the wand is concerned. the wand becomes Ron's on his capturing it, and remains so.

The second wand belonged to Bellatrix and ended up in Hermione's hands. It was forcefully removed from Bellatrix' hand by Ron, and so owes allegiance to Ron through the same path as Pettigrew's wand. Hermione is never able to get this wand to work correctly for her, but it does serve as identification for her entrance into Gringotts.

The final wand, Draco's, is wrenched out of Draco's hand by Harry and so shifts its allegiance to him. This will become important when Harry must duel with Voldemort in the final chapters of this book. Voldemort is carrying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]], which had been forcibly removed from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] hand by Draco, and so had transferred its allegiance to Draco. This wand apparently recognizes Draco's wand, which has allied itself with Harry. Because of this chain of allegiance, the Elder Wand will not harm Harry, and never works correctly for Voldemort.

Dobby's bravery and sacrifice is a significant part of the author's theme of tolerance and collaboration. Throughout the series, Harry's quest to defeat Voldemort is only possible because of help from good people, including House Elves, Goblins, and later [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]], and many others. During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], victory over Voldemort and his evil is assured when all species join together for the common good. We have seen before that Dobby is loyal to Harry not because of a magical enslavement but rather their mutual friendship and regard. Dobby is a free elf and chooses to risk his life in order to save the lives of Harry and his allies. Harry, representing the enlightenment of wizards, recognizes the debt he owes Dobby and his fellows. We can see that wizards must learn to respect elves, goblins, centaurs and other non-human beings in the magical world; Harry demonstrates this respect, but it is likely that it will be many years before the general Wizarding population acts similarly.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

At the great [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] is killed in a final duel against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]].

== Event Details ==

After killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] announces that the battle will be stopped for one hour, to give [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] time to surrender to him in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], and says that if Harry comes to him, everyone at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] will be spared. Harry, having learned from Snape's memories that the only way to destroy the soul fragment that he bears within him is for Voldemort to kill him, enters the Forest and seeks Voldemort, only stopping on the way to tell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] that Voldemort's snake must be killed in order to finally defeat Voldemort. Finding Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, Harry announces his presence and Voldemort [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] him.

Harry finds himself in a strange place, apparently a cleaner version of King's Cross Station, where he meets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|the shade]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. They talk, and Dumbledore explains some of the events of the past seven years to Harry. Dumbledore explains, in particular, that the soul shard that was attached to Harry has now been destroyed, and that Harry now has the choice: if he wishes, he can go back, and complete the destruction of Voldemort, or he can go to the platforms, where he will likely find a train that will take him Onwards. Harry elects to return.

Finding himself back in his own body, Harry feigns death, and hears Voldemort also regaining consciousness. Voldemort orders [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] to check Harry and see if he is dead. Narcissa quite clearly sees that Harry is alive, but she quietly asks if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|her son Draco]] is still alive in Hogwarts. Harry says Draco is still alive, and Narcissa, apparently aware that it is the only way she can get into Hogwarts without a battle to rejoin her son, tells Voldemort that Harry is dead. Voldemort forces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] to carry Harry's apparently lifeless body back to Hogwarts, where he taunts the defenders with the death of their champion. When he forces the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] onto Neville's head and sets it afire, Neville produces the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]] from the hat and cuts off [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini's]] head.

Battle is now rejoined, with the defenders of Hogwarts being reinforced by the parents of the students who had been evacuated earlier and the denizens of the Forbidden Forest. Harry, under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], works his way into the Great Hall, where he watches as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] is defeated by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]]. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protego|Shields]] Molly from Voldemort's retaliatory strike, then reveals himself. Harry and Voldemort now circle, preparing to duel; Harry, calling his opponent by his real name, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], offers him the chance to live by repenting of his murders. Voldemort dismisses this out of hand, and casts the Killing Curse at Harry as Harry casts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|the Disarmament jinx]] at Voldemort. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] flies from Voldemort's hand and is caught by Harry, as Voldemort's curse rebounds upon him, killing him.

== Notable Consequences ==

The final death of Voldemort spells an end to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] and their depredations both on the Wizarding and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] population. With Voldemort finally gone, the Wizarding world can now embark on a path leading to prosperity, rather than having to be constantly on guard against pieces of itself.

With the Elder Wand in his possession, Harry has control over possibly the most powerful wand in the Wizarding world. Knowing that owning this wand will also make him a target, he uses it to mend his own wand (which was destroyed by Hermione unintentionally at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]]) and places it back in Dumbledore's tomb, in the belief that at his own eventual death, the wand will lose the major part of its power.

== Analysis ==

One interesting point, one that the shade of Dumbledore also comments on, is the place that Harry finds himself in after his encounter in the Forbidden Forest. It is quite clearly modeling itself to Harry's wishes, and has taken the shape of Kings Cross Station. It is noted in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform 9 3/4]] that Kings Cross has come to mark something of a transition for Harry, it being the threshold of the Wizarding World. Given this, what could be more appropriate than, in the transition between life and death, his mental imagery should revert to Kings Cross? Harry himself does not seem to understand Dumbledore's amusement at Harry's unconscious choice of venue, but we readers certainly do.

The series closes, as it must, with the destruction of the villain, most appropriately at his own hand. Yes, Harry had the strength to kill him, but offered him a chance to recover; right up until his very last, fatal spell, Voldemort was given the choice of continuing towards his own destruction, or of recanting and repenting. Offered this choice, Voldemort chose the doomed fight. The parallel with many religious belief structures is unmistakeable, and will not be belabored here. 

One key fact is that Harry did not actually kill Voldemort. He was dueling with Voldemort at the time, and he was in a way responsible, but it was the spell that Voldemort cast that actually killed him. While Harry does make free use of the other [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]], he never uses the Killing Curse. Harry's hands remain unbloodied and his soul remains intact.

One thing that is touched on also is that by allowing Voldemort to kill him, Harry is protecting the fighters at Hogwarts. Voldemort has said that Hogwarts will be spared if Harry comes to him, and so in a manner similar to Harry being protected by his mother's sacrifice, Harry's sacrifice protects the occupants of Hogwarts. Despite the fact that Harry does not actually die, it seems that magic does not require that. It is because of this sacrifice that Voldemort's spells seem largely ineffective on the population of Hogwarts following the episode in the Forbidden Forest.

Despite our understanding, following the events in the Forbidden Forest, that Harry may not be vulnerable to Voldemort, we are as yet unsure of the fates of anyone else, or of the school. Despite our confidence that Harry will prevail, suspense is still retained, and even heightened, as we launch into the final battle. So many of Harry's friends have already died or been injured; will Ginny, seen fighting Bellatrix, survive? Will Molly Weasley prevail? Will the school be able to open again? It is to the author's credit that she is able to bring satisfactory closure to the many tangled threads of the plot, even as the tangles multiply in the final battles.

With the defeat of Voldemort, our story comes to its effective end. There are only a very few issues remaining to be addressed.

One of the remaining issues, of course, is the Deathly Hallows, introduced in this book; an extremely powerful set of magical artifacts. One of them is Voldemort's wand.

By defeating Voldemort, Harry has completely gained mastery of his wand, the Elder Wand. Though he has what may be the strongest wand in the Wizarding world, Harry recognizes that not only does this wand carry great power, it also represents great danger. According to legend, the first bearer of the wand was killed on the night that his ownership of the wand became known, and the wand was stolen from him; this marked the beginning of a trail of murders that has followed the wand through history. Harry is aware that, though legend says the wand cannot be defeated in a duel, there are many other risks that it cannot protect against. Unlike [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], who covets the wand simply for its power, and is apparently largely uncaring of the associated danger, Harry recognizes that as long as the wand exists, there will be people willing to kill for its power. Harry can clearly see that this wand is too powerful to be allowed to remain in the world. While he owns it, he only casts one spell with it, to repair his own wand; he then places it back in Dumbledore's tomb, in the expectation that, with his own unchallenged death in the future, the wand will lose its power.

Of the remaining Hallows, Harry chooses to retain one, the Invisibility Cloak, passing it on to his own children in turn as has been done for generations. The other, the Resurrection Stone, Harry deliberately loses in the Forbidden Forest, knowing that the ability to call people back from death will ultimately destroy anyone with that power.

It should be noted that with the destruction of the soul fragment within Harry, there is no longer any psychic link between Harry and Voldemort. If, by some mischance, Voldemort had secreted an additional Horcrux, Harry's scar would no longer give Harry any warning of his presence or return. Whether this leaves the door open for a sequel, we have no way of knowing.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] is killed near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Number 4 Privet Drive]] on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomstick]] while assisting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]].

== Event Details ==

Knowing that the protection afforded [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] by his living with his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] will end on his seventeenth birthday, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] decides to move him to the protection of one of the Order's safe houses. Believing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] thoroughly infiltrated, they let the Ministry prepare to move Harry on his birthday, but secretly plan to move him themselves a few days earlier. The Ministry, in the name of protecting Harry, is monitoring the area around the house for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo transport]], use of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkeys]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]]; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] believes these are simply ways of determining if someone is coming to get Harry and where they take him. As a result, Harry will be traveling by flying; the group who will be helping him escape arrive on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomstick]], and one by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]'s flying motorcycle. In order to make it more likely that Harry will escape, they plan to have multiple simulacra of Harry, each with a protector, each flying to a separate safe-house. The real Harry will be traveling with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] on Sirius' flying motorcycle. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] is one of six Order members to be disguised as Harry by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]], and will ride with Moody.

As they leave the house, they are attacked by multiple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], and by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Harry and Hagrid fly off in their own direction, pursued by a squad of Death Eaters, and do not see any of the action that takes place.

We later hear from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] that, though clearly confused by the multiplicity of Harrys and protectors, Voldemort had quickly decided to concentrate on the Harry who was escorted by the strongest protector. That protector was Moody. Mundungus, becoming aware that he had been targeted by Voldemort, Disapparated from the back of Moody's broom. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]] that had been aimed at Mundungus instead hit Moody. Though Bill later went out to try and recover Moody's body, he was unable to find it.

== Notable Consequences ==

More than almost anything else that has happened so far, Moody's death makes Harry realize that not only is he at risk, but so is anyone around him. It is quite possibly because of Moody's death (and to a presumably lesser extent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George]]'s injury, received in the same mission) that Harry decides that he must leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]]. He is dissuaded from this course of action by the others involved in the escape, who indicate that they have worked hard and put themselves at risk to extract him from danger, and would not be happy to see him march off into danger from the place of safety where they have brought him.

The fact that Moody's body cannot be found will leave all involved without the necessary sense of closure that being able to bury him would provide. This will later lead Harry into a rash act.

Moody's death also indicates that even the best [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] may be powerless against Voldemort. We are already aware of Harry's disappointment at not being taught spells that can defeat Voldemort, from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|the previous book]]; Harry had expected those spells to be part of the private lessons he was getting from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. Moody's death serves to remind us that any spells available to Aurors would likely be ineffective against Voldemort.

== Analysis ==

As mentioned in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Death|the death of Dumbledore]], Harry cannot be the hero of the story if there is another, greater hero standing behind to support him. While we don't really know at this point if Moody could be that strong, we can see that Moody has become the leader of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] since [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s death. While our contact with the true Alastor Moody is brief enough that we are unable to form any real opinion of his magical strength, he does seem to have great strength of character. There is a very real chance that, in relatively short order, he could learn the nature of Harry's mission, and in so doing, likely doom it to failure. Because of this, Moody must at least vanish, at worst die, before he can spend much time in Harry's company. Even if Harry is able to keep the secret of his mission from Moody, it is likely that Harry would end up leaning on Moody, as Ron almost ends up leaning on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] a few chapters further into the book.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The comment is made in the Analysis section that if Moody had known of Harry's mission, he would have doomed it to failure. This is not immediately apparent to the reader, but on contemplation it becomes obvious. 

By the time Moody dies, we already know that in some manner, the inner councils of the Order of the Phoenix are at least in part being passed to Voldemort. We know that the Ministry has heard that Harry will be moved on his birthday, and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] is aware that the Order will be moving him before that date. Snape's information is correct, as it turns out, and the Death Eaters are prepared on the day that Harry actually is transported. While the Death Eaters do not know the subterfuge of the multiple Harrys, Harry himself, and we, must assume that Snape is getting correct information somehow, and that a secret shared with the Order is now likely to reach Voldemort.

However, even if we assume that the information does not reach Voldemort directly, having the Order helping out is far too risky. Harry's sole means of success is to find the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], get them out of where they are hidden, and destroy them before Voldemort notices. While Harry never clearly enunciates this to himself, this is clearly the sort of mission that requires stealth and small raiding parties. If the Order were to suddenly concentrate on Horcrux hunting, Voldemort would be certain to find out, and would take steps to protect the ones that remained.

Granted, this does not explain Harry's vehement refusal to accept Lupin's help when Lupin arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] a few days after the Trio arrive there. Lupin expresses a desire to join them, apparently being willing to sever ties with the Order of the Phoenix for the duration of the mission, which would appear to defuse that particular point of friction. However, it is Lupin's apparent willingness to abandon his wife ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]]) and their unborn child that inspires Harry's anger and refusal to accept Lupin's help. It is at this point that we perceive Ron as being willing to lean on Lupin, given the chance; after Lupin's furious departure, Ron rebukes Harry for chasing him away.

In the Analysis section, it is also mentioned that Moody's body not being recovered will lead Harry into a rash action. That action occurs when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic|infiltration of the Ministry of Magic]] later in this book. Harry, finding Moody's magical eye attached to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge's]] door, wrenches it off the door and carries it away with him. This is clearly a bad idea, as it shows that there are intruders in the Ministry. However, Harry feels a need to achieve some sort of closure by appropriately interring whatever part of Moody he can find; and the only part that has come to light is his magical eye.

One other point that should be mentioned is that, while Moody's death does imply that anyone near Harry is at risk, Harry does not make the next step in this analysis yet. It is only much later in the story that Harry concludes more accurately that anyone who stands up against Voldemort is at grave personal risk, and the people around him are those who choose to stand against Voldemort. It is because of the incomplete analysis that Harry is largely unwilling to lead up the defence forces at Hogwarts in the final battle; he still fears being the lightning rod, by his presence attracting Voldemort to them. He finally determines that Hogwarts and its occupants are at risk whether or not he is there, and chooses to remain, acting as a rallying point.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

At the great [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred Weasley]] is killed in battle as a large section of castle wall falls upon him.

== Event Details ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has given the occupants and defenders of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]] until midnight to surrender [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to him. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], meanwhile, has summoned the members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] to Hogwarts to help Harry in the mission that has brought him to Hogwarts. Members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]] also arrive. At one point, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] are all in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], as Mrs. Weasley is forbidding Ginny from taking any part in the battle. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] suddenly enters the room, and finding his entire family present, announces that he has been a fool, and asks to be taken back into the family. Mrs. Weasley immediately accepts him back with open arms, and the other Weasleys do likewise.

While Harry is retrieving and destroying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], the battle is fully joined, and Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] emerge into a hallway where jinxes are flying as defenders battle [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] who are already within the school. Percy, among the defenders, jinxes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], and says Thicknesse can consider that his resignation. Fred, battling alongside him, says he thinks that's the first time he's ever heard Percy crack a joke. At that moment, a curse strikes the wall from outside, and the wall collapses, filling the hall with dust and killing Fred. Percy is distraught, throwing himself over Fred's body; Ron helps him take Fred's body to an alcove out of the way. Percy then spots [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augustus Rookwood|Rookwood]], a Death Eater and one-time [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] employee, and takes off in pursuit.

== Notable Consequences ==

Fred's death solidifies Percy's resolve to fight the Death Eaters. Percy has worked for the Ministry, and against his parents' belief systems, for so long that he almost certainly finds it hard to suddenly change sides. With Fred's death, caused directly by Death Eaters associated with the Ministry, the battle becomes more personal for Percy. It is his sighting of Rookwood, an escaped Death Eater and traitor to the Ministry, that points this up particularly; Percy has to be convinced to leave Fred's body, but goes charging off after Rookwood on sight. Despite Percy's half-joking &quot;resignation&quot;, he has been loyal to the Ministry for so long that he will likely continue so, and Rookwood, a convicted Death Eater who personifies what has gone wrong with the Ministry, and who likely is using the Ministry to shield himself, is the most likely type of person to enrage Percy and move him away from our heroes.

Additionally, Fred's death hastens Percy's full return to the Weasley family, as they together mourn Fred's passing. 

== Analysis ==

Percy's return to the Weasley family fold is necessary for various thematic reasons, the principal one being that in what is at least initially a children's book, we simply cannot have brother using lethal force against brother. Percy can estrange himself from the other Weasleys, he can return gifts unopened, avoid his father or refuse to acknowledge his existence, leave the family home, and close his apartment door in his mother's face, but he cannot be seen to aim a wand at any Weasley family member with intent to kill or injure. Friction within a family is normal, and can reach the sort of extent that we see here in extreme cases, but having it advance to the point of physical violence would require that Percy become fully a Death Eater, and he cannot be a fundamentally evil character without tainting the rest of his family. Given the resulting choice, between having Percy sit out the battle dithering in his apartment, or admitting his folly and returning fully to his family, the author's decision to allow Percy to return seems by far the better alternative, as it allows us to see Percy's admission of his weakness.

Over the course of the series, the Weasley family have suffered some rather amazing near misses. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], Harry saves Ginny from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] where the &quot;memory of Tom Riddle&quot; is draining her life force to return to life himself. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 21|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Harry sees Arthur Weasley being attacked by a snake and reports it, in time to save Arthur's life. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 18|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Harry saves Ron, who has been poisoned, with a handy [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bezoar|Bezoar]]. And earlier in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], George had lost an ear to a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]] curse cast by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]. Combine this with the forms taken by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]] takes when Molly Weasley is attempting to nullify it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], and one might conclude that the death of a member of the Weasley family had not been foreshadowed, but rather belaboured. It is part of the skill involved in the series, however, that we do not see that foreshadowing until Fred actually dies. It is true that the loss of George's ear in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Escape from Privet Drive|Escape from Privet Drive]] has been perceived by at least some readers as foreshadowing of another, larger loss for George.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The behavior of the Twins in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] has prompted interesting speculation in some readers as well. In placing their bet with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], the Twins seem supremely confident in their bet that Ireland will win but the Bulgarian Seeker, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]], will catch the Snitch, despite Bagman's apparent belief that such an outcome would be unlikely. As it turns out, the Twins have called it precisely. At least one commenter has suggested that this may mean that the two of them may have managed to solve, in part, the mystery of Time, and have been able to retrieve information about the outcome of the match from the future. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-Turner]] clearly shows that some aspects of time are better understood in the Wizarding world than by Muggles. Additionally, over the course of this and the succeeding book, we learn that Fred and George are magical innovators of rare ingenuity and skill, even in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione's]] opinion. Given these two facts, it is at least somewhat possible that there is some technique that the Twins have pioneered to look into the future, though perhaps dimly. It has been suggested that Bill or Charlie Weasley might have availed himself of a Time-Turner, as Hermione did, to achieve his high marks; if this is the case, the Twins may well have had a chance to examine the device and learn enough of its workings to replicate at least some of its functionality. The commenter has suggested that this technique may require both twins to perform the charm, and so Fred's death prevents the technique from ever being used again; but also, has suggested that this would make it possible for Fred to be returned to a future story by extracting him from the rubble by means of time travel before he was actually crushed. If there are future stories, it would be of interest to note whether George keeps his ears concealed, perhaps to hide the fact that there are now actually two Georges, one with two sound ears.

name=Herbology|
type=Course|
features=Plants and other flora|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Herbology''''' is the study of magical plants and how to take care of, utilize and/or combat them. Herbology lessons are shown in each of the first six books.

The subject is depicted as closely related to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]], due to the nature of the plants, many of which are cultivated for extracting useful ingredients. Throughout the series, Herbology is taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Pomona Sprout]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Herbology is a core subject; it is one of the seven academic subjects taught in the first year. Harry, who chooses to pursue a career as an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]], takes Herbology at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-level]].

Being located in greenhouses on the grounds, trips to and from Herbology lessons are written to depict the weather at the time (for example, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', chapter 14]]). There are at least three greenhouses described in the books, holding a variety of magical plants of varying degrees of lethality, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mandrake|mandrakes]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bubotuber|bubotubers]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Snargaluff|Snargaluff]]s (which are valued for their pods).

Herbology is also, initially, the only subject in which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] excels. Neville will later show aptitude for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]].

== Analysis ==

As mentioned, Herbology and Potions are reasonably closely related. We see one interaction between Professor Sprout and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], where they are discussing the properties of a plant that Slughorn needs for his first-year Potions class. We have to assume there are similar, though possibly not as cordial, interactions earlier between Professor Sprout and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]].

Like Charms, Herbology is a practical class, with lots of noise and activity going on. As a result, it is a class where Harry, Ron, and Hermione can discuss their plans. It is likely for this reason that we see as much of Herbology as we do, and also possibly why all three of the Trio are able to continue Herbology studies at NEWT level.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Herbology seems to the uninitiated to be a relatively straightforward and harmless branch of magic, but we are somewhat disabused of that notion by the appearance of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Venomous Tentacula|Venomous Tentacula]], first mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. Professor Sprout's offhanded treatment of the plant in that episode is misleading; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 32|much later]], we see a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] being reeled in by Tentacula. Many plants are only handled with protective gear, and in the climactic battle at Hogwarts we see many magical plants being used as weapons.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Epilogue|Epilogue]], it is revealed that Neville has become the Professor of Herbology at Hogwarts.

name=Charms|
type=Course|
features=Spell-casting|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Charms''''' is a course that teaches how to cast the class of spells known as Charms. These are spells that alter an object without changing its essential nature. Given a teapot, the spell that makes it tapdance across the desk would be a charm, the spell that turns it into a tortoise would not. This is a core subject, required of all Hogwarts students until at least their fifth year. While the course is offered to sixth and seventh year students, admission is limited to those who have shown better than average abilities in Charms based on their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L. grades]].

The Trio take Charms from their first to their sixth years at Hogwarts.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Charms class is taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]. Spells taught in this class include [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wingardium Leviosa|Wingardium Leviosa]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summoning]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Banishing Charm|Banishing]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Aguamenti|Aguamenti]], and turning vinegar into wine. Because it is a lab class, with much wand work and people saying spells, it is often a nearly ideal place for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to have more or less private conversations.

A number of significant events happen in and around Charms class. The first spell that any of the Trio learn properly, and apparently the first one actually cast in their school career, is the Wingardium Leviosa charm cast by Hermione. Her apparent self-satisfaction at being the first in the class to master this charm causes Ron to comment to Harry about that being the reason she has no friends. Hermione overhears this, and bolts to the girls' washroom to cry. Ron and Harry rescuing Hermione from the mountain troll that evening results in the creation of the Trio.

Charms class, as mentioned, is a lab class for much of the series, and as such provides many opportunities for conversation among the Trio, plus a certain amount of slapstick humour (Ron's vinegar explodes when he tries to turn it into wine, for instance, in the sixth book). The main purpose of Hogwarts, of course, is lessons, though as the main conflict of the story is extracurricular much of the action will take place outside the classrooms. The reader may come to anticipate those sections of the book that occur in class, partly for the insight into the difficulty of learning magic, and partly for the associated humour.

It appears that some witches, notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|Mrs. Longbottom]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville's grandmother]], consider Charms to be a &quot;soft option&quot;, an easy course even at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|N.E.W.T. level]]. Against this, of course, we have to weigh the difficulty Harry seems to have with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summoning]] charm, and the fact that Professor Flitwick wants to discuss Harry's near-perfect use of that charm in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task of the Triwizard Tournament]] in Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|fourth year]]. Clearly this charm is much more involved than simply pointing your wand and saying &quot;Accio!&quot; Additionally, we find that the redoubtable Mrs. Longbottom apparently did quite poorly on her Charms O.W.L., and we can imagine there to be a certain bias in her views.

== Analysis ==

The definition of Charms, according to the author, is &quot;those spells which do not change the intrinsic character of the object on which the spell is cast&quot;. As mentioned in the Overview, the spell which causes the teapot to tapdance across the desk is a Charm because it is still a teapot, albeit one with legs, feet (with the equivalent of tap shoes), and the propensity to emulate Fred Astaire. This can be expanded easily to include spells such as Aguamenti, which causes the caster's wand to send out a stream of water, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Lumos|Lumos]], which causes the wand to emit light. In both these cases, the object modified is the caster's wand, which remains a wand, just one that also behaves like a garden hose or a flashlight. The definitions are, however, somewhat loose; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] class, we see that Ron and Harry are having troubles with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Silencio|silencing spell]], and the reader may note that a silenced toad or a silenced raven remains a toad or a raven.

== Overview ==

'''''Care of Magical Creatures''''' is a course at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] that exposes students to various magical creatures, teaching characteristics and useful attributes. This subject is offered as an elective, taught in years three, four, and five; those with sufficiently high O.W.L. marks in the course can then go on to N.E.W.T.-level study in years 6 and 7. The Trio take this course from third to fifth year.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

As a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 1|birthday present]] at the beginning of Harry's third year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] sends [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] a book, ''The Monster Book of Monsters'', which threatens to attack Harry when he unwraps it. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 4|He finds]] that it is the set book (textbook) for his Care of Magical Creatures course.

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 5|the Arrival Feast]] that year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] announces that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]] will be retiring to &quot;spend more time with his remaining limbs&quot;, and that the new teacher for Care of Magical Creatures will be Rubeus Hagrid.

Hagrid starts off by teaching about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippogriff|Hippogriffs]], but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] insults the one he is talking to and is savaged. Draco's playing up his wounds results in Hagrid losing much of his confidence, and teaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flobberworm|Flobberworms]] for the entire Autumn term.

Over the course of the following three years, Hagrid, or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] in his absence, teach Harry's class about a number of creatures ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knarl|Knarls]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Niffler|Nifflers]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Salamander|Salamanders]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bowtruckle|Bowtruckles]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]], for instance) and some not so common (coursework for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|the entire fourth year]] concerns [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skrewt|Blast-Ended Skrewts]], a creature we have not seen before or since).

None of the Trio choose to take Care of Magical Creatures at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT level]], despite having apparently sufficiently good [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL marks]], so we have no information about what creatures students in sixth and seventh year would be exposed to.

== Analysis ==

Examination of &quot;Newt Scamander&quot;'s book, ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'', shows that there are a large number of creatures in the magical world that we do not know of. Many of them have useful characteristics as well. It only takes a moment of reflection to realize that students in a school of magic must receive some education about these creatures, as they form such a vital part of daily magical life. Of course, modern urban schools no longer teach courses in animal husbandry, but such courses are still available and still required in more rural Muggle schools, and we can see that the Wizarding lifestyle is, to a large extent, more centered on small villages and rural settings than on residence in the larger cities. We suspect this is because the eccentricities of Wizarding life are less easily remarked, or more easily overlooked, when population is more sparsely distributed.

It is likely, however, that many wizards will not need to know how to work with magical creatures once they graduate from school. This would suggest that the Care of Magical Creatures course might, in real life, be a less popular course than it appears to be in the books: nearly everyone in Harry's year group ends up in that class, and there seem to be very few students dropping the course, despite the Skrewts in Harry's fourth year terrorizing the students. It is explicitly stated that Harry is using the class as a way to meet with, and discuss matters with, Hagrid, at times when the students are otherwise unable to leave Hogwarts castle. This does not explain Draco's remaining in the Care of Dangerous Creatures course; particularly after the Hippogriff attack, one would expect [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Draco's father]] to order Draco out of the class. We can only guess that the author chose to leave Draco in the class to be an ongoing source of conflict with the Trio, and perhaps rationalized it by having Lucius determine that he could cause more trouble for Hogwarts if Draco remained in this class being taught by a half-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giant]].

Professor Silvanus Kettleburn remained only a name until the publication of ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''. In that book, Professor Dumbledore's notes included significant information about Professor Kettleburn's exploits, which included [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Engorgio|enlarging]] an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ashwinder|Ashwinder]] to tremendous size as a prop in a school play, an effort that resulted in significant damage to the Great Hall when the ashwinder exploded unexpectedly. This sort of exploit, no doubt, is the reason for Dumbledore's comment about &quot;his remaining limbs&quot;. It seems that a certain disregard for danger is a necessary component for the teacher of Care of Magical Creatures, as the creatures involved are often dangerous. Dumbledore may have selected Hagrid for the post partly because of this potential for danger in the subject matter: Hagrid, being half Giant, has a natural resistance to many forms of attack. However, it is also likely that Hagrid's employment as Keeper of the Keys and Grounds, which apparently involved no small amount of familiarity with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] and the creatures therein, played a role in his selection for the post.

It is noted in the article on the Forbidden Forest that &quot;In order to have Care of Magical Creatures classes, there must be magical creatures; part of the Forbidden Forest's function is to provide a near-by habitat.&quot; By the same token, of course, the presence of the Forest and the creatures within it clearly requires some sort of management, which Hagrid is doing for the first two years of the series. Having Hagrid teach the students about the creatures he takes care of is, of course, a logical step for the author. The reader may suffer a small amount of dismay at the removal of the clearly flamboyant Professor Kettleburn, but the appointment of Hagrid to his post does simplify the process of the Trio meeting with Hagrid later in the series.

Harry does learn a number of valuable bits of information in this course. Notably, what he learns about Thestrals will help him and five others reach the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], and what he learns about Hippogriffs helps him rescue [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 21|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]. However, many of the magical creatures Harry encounters and has to deal with in his travels are covered in a different course; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teaches Harry about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggarts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Grindylow|Grindylows]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pixie|Pixies]], for instance, though he does have to learn about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragons]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisks]] on his own.

== Overview ==

'''''Astronomy''''' instructs students on planets, stars, and other sky objects and their role in the magical world. At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], astronomy is an elective, offered in years three through five; those with sufficiently high [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L. marks]] in the course can then go on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|N.E.W.T.-level study]] in years 6 and 7. We believe that at Hogwarts it is taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Sinistra|Professor Sinistra]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] sign up for this course in their third year, and we believe Hermione takes it through to her sixth year at least. Harry and Ron are seen to take the OWL exam in that course, but as they are disturbed by the firefight surrounding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] dismissal, they manage only an Acceptable OWL mark in the course, and do not continue at that point.

== Analysis ==

We must be careful in discussion of astronomy to differentiate it not only from the branch of Muggle fortune-telling and Wizarding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]] known as &quot;astrology&quot;, but from the study of the motion of spatial objects called &quot;Astronomy&quot; in the Muggle world. It is certain that Wizarding astronomy involves location of the heavenly bodies and determinations of their relative motions, but we expect that the impact of the motions of these bodies also has some magical effect, and the Astronomy course almost certainly is involved with the memorization of these effects and their uses. We note the following two examples of this sort of effect: in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 22|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] collecting something that is &quot;most efficacious if harvested at twilight&quot;, as he remarks to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]]. And in our world, there is a belief that crops will grow better if planted &quot;in the dark of the moon.&quot;

== Overview ==

'''''Locomotor Mortis''''' is the &quot;leg-locker&quot; curse. Similar in effect to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|body bind]], this spell causes only the legs to be bound together.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We see this spell used only a very few times. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] uses it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 13|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], though that is done off-stage and we only hear about it from Neville after he manages to hop into the Gryffindor Common Room. Harry Potter attempts to use it against Draco Malfoy in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 24|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] during their duel in the bathroom, but misses, shattering a cistern.

== Analysis ==

This spell is of limited utility as it leaves the target's wand arm free, so that he can either free himself or retaliate. It is likely to be useful only on a disarmed opponent or one without developed magical abilities. As such, it is probably a classic first-year sort of jinx, one that impedes the opponent but does not harm him particularly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What IS accumulation? ==

Recall that so far in this text it has been assumed that all systems are at '''steady state''', which means that there is no buildup of mass, energy, or other conserved quantities. However, there are many situations, such as whenever operating levels change, that a system will not be at steady state, and mass and energy will be '''accumulated''' over time. 

The most important thing to remember about accumulation is that ''it deals with the actual amount of stuff '''in the system''', not any sort of flow rate''. If you remember if you're dealing with actual system properties rather than flow rates, it will help keep the terms straight in unsteady-state balances.

=== Unsteady-state Mass Balance ===

Lets begin the derivation of an unsteady-state mass balance with the general balance equation which you should know and love by now:

&lt;math&gt; In - Out + Generation = Accumulation &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the terms we usually used for in, out, and generation, we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \dot{m}_{i, in} - \Sigma \dot{m}_{i,out} + \dot{m}_{i,gen} = Accumulation &lt;/math&gt;

Now we have to come up with a mathematical formulation for the accumulation. Unlike all of the other terms in this equation, which deal with energy ''flows'' into the system, '''the accumulation deals with the amount of energy that is already in the system at a certain point of time''', and more specifically how it ''changes'' with time. 

The rate of accumulation of energy ''will not be constant'' unless it is zero (otherwise every reactor in the world would either blow up from excessive mass and energy buildup or would cease operating because all of the reactants and products would be drained out). Recall that if the accumulation reaches zero, the system is at steady state. Most systems tend to move towards a steady state (it is possible to have more than one set of steady state conditions, but it won't be covered here) over long periods of time, as shown below:

{{todo|Diagram of plateau.}}

Such a system is called '''self-regulating''' (or '''naturally stable'''). If a system is not self-regulating then special control techniques (see [[Control systems]]) must be utilized to force the system into a steady state.

In order to take into account variation in the accumulation rate, we must consider the rate of change over a ''very small'' amount of time, so small in fact that it is practically zero, and the accumulation vs. time curve resembles a straight line. The slope of this line at time t is approximately:

&lt;math&gt; Slope = \mbox{ Accumulation rate at time t} = \frac{M_{sys, t + \Delta t} - M_{sys,t}}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore we could write the following:

&lt;math&gt; Accumulation = \frac{M_{sys, t + \Delta t} - M_{sys,t}}{ \Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

We then write our mass balance by substituting this accumulation into the mass balance above:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{ M_{sys, t + \Delta t} - M_{sys,t}}{ \Delta t} = \Sigma \dot{m}_{i,in} - \Sigma \dot{m}_{i,out} &lt;/math&gt;

For practical applications, this equation is generally multiplied by &lt;math&gt; \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;. Then, rather than dealing with flow rates, a new quantity is defined:

&lt;math&gt; \Delta m_i = \dot{m}_i * \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

This quantity is the ''total amount of mass that enters the system in a finite amount of time''. Substituting this definition into the mass balance yields the following:

{{box|'''Unsteady State Mass Balance''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \Sigma \Delta m_{i,in} - \Sigma \Delta m_{i, out} + m_{i,gen} = M_{sys, t + \Delta t} - M_{sys, t} &lt;/math&gt;}}


{{example|A feed stream with &lt;math&gt; 50 \frac{kg}{h} &lt;/math&gt; of water and &lt;math&gt; 1 \frac{kg}{h} &lt;/math&gt; of ethanol enters a distillation column. A distillation column generally has two outlet streams called the '''bottoms''' and the '''condensate'''. At steady state, the condensate is 12% ethanol by mass and the total condensate flowrate is &lt;math&gt; 9 \frac{kg}{h} &lt;/math&gt;.

One day, the boss calls and says that she needs more production, so you turn up the feed to &lt;math&gt; 60 \frac{kg}{h} &lt;/math&gt;. Two hours later, the distillation column floods.

'''a.''' What was the cause of the flooding?

'''b.''' Assuming that the total outlet mass flow rates remained the same throughout the process, what was the total mass accumulation in the column?

'''c.''' Describe two methods by which the flow rates may be modified to reach a new steady state. Will the new steady state produce the same outlet concentrations as the old steady state? Explain. (hint: how is the separation effectiveness related to the ratio of the two outlet flowrates? You may need to do some research on this) }}

{{TODO|Put in the solution to this}}

=== Unsteady-state Energy Balance ===

Lets start by examining what we have so far, but with the accumulation term (yet to be defined mathematically) added in the right side, since we're not at steady state any more:

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma(\frac{1}{2}\dot{m}v^2 + \dot{m}gh + \dot{H})_{i,in} 
- \Sigma(\frac{1}{2}\dot{m}v^2 + \dot{m}gh + \dot{H})_{i,out}
+ \Sigma \dot{Q}_j + \dot{W}_s = Accumulation &lt;/math&gt;

Following the logic from the mass balance, we obtain for the accumulation:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{E_{sys, t + \Delta t} - E_{sys,t}}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we have:

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma(\frac{1}{2}\dot{m}v^2 + \dot{m}gh + \dot{H})_{i,in} 
- \Sigma(\frac{1}{2}\dot{m}v^2 + \dot{m}gh + \dot{H})_{i,out}
+ \Sigma \dot{Q}_j + \dot{W}_s = \frac{E_{sys, t + \Delta t} - E_{sys,t}}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

Like in the case of the mass balance, we can only consider the '''total''' energy change over a '''total''' amount of time using this equation. To do this, we multiply the entire equation above by the time change from some starting point to the point of interest.

Now we need some definitions:

# &lt;math&gt; Q = \dot{Q}*\Delta t &lt;/math&gt; is the TOTAL heat flow over the time period.
# &lt;math&gt; W_s = \dot{W}_s * \Delta t &lt;/math&gt; is the TOTAL shaft work over the time period.
# &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_i * \Delta t = \Delta m_i &lt;/math&gt; is the TOTAL mass flow into (or out of) the system due to stream i during the time period.
# &lt;math&gt; \dot{H}_i * \Delta t = H &lt;/math&gt; is the TOTAL enthalpy carried into (or out of) the system due to stream i during the time period.

The major assumption here is that '''the enthalpies, heat flow rates, and shaft work on the left hand side of the equals sign must either be constant, or the average value over the whole time period must be used, in order for this equation to be valid'''. Whether this assumption is valid or not depends on the situation (for example, it depends on whether the process feeding mass to your process is itself at steady state or not).

With these in mind, we multiply by delta t in order to obtain the following, '''unsteady state''' energy balance. 

{{box|'''Unsteady State Energy Balance''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \Sigma(\frac{1}{2}\Delta{m}v^2 + \Delta{m}gh + {H})_{i,in} 
- \Sigma(\frac{1}{2}\Delta{m}v^2 + \Delta{m}gh + {H})_{i,out}
+ \Sigma {Q}_j + {W}_s = {E_{sys, t + \Delta t} - E_{sys,t}} &lt;/math&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hotbed'''

A hotbed is a pile of decaying organic matter warmer than its surroundings due to the heat given off by the metabolism of the microorganisms in the decomposing pile. Hotbeds are used for composting and keeping delicate plants warm during the winter. 

'''Cold Frame'''

[[Image:Coldframe 1.jpg|thumb|''A traditional home made cold frame'']]
In agriculture and gardening, a '''cold frame''' is a transparent-roofed enclosure, built low to the ground, used to protect plants from cold weather. The transparent top admits sunlight and relies on the greenhouse effect to reflect back radiant heat that would otherwise escape at night. Essentially, a cold frame functions as a miniature greenhouse season extension device.

Cold frames are found in home gardens and in vegetable farming. They create microclimates that provide several degrees of air and soil temperature insulation, and shelter from wind. In cold-winter regions, these characteristics allow plants to be started earlier in the spring, and to survive longer into the fall and winter. They are most often used for growing seedlings that are later transplanted into open ground, and can also be a permanent home to cold-hardy vegetables grown for autumn and winter harvest.

Cold frame construction is a common home or farm building project, although kits and commercial systems are available. A traditional plan makes use of old glass windows: a wooden frame is built {{units|30-60 cm|1-2 feet}}, and the window placed on top. The roof is often sloped towards the winter sun to capture more light, and to improve runoff of water, and hinged for easy access. Clear plastic, rigid or sheeting, can be used in place of glass. An electric heating cable, available for this purpose, can be placed in the soil to provide additional heat.

A function has an inverse if and only if it is one-to-one: that is, if for each ''y''-value there is only '''one''' corresponding ''x''-value. To test whether or not a function is one-to-one, we can draw multiple horizontal lines through the graph of the function. If any of these horizontal lines intersects with the graph of the function more than once, then the function is NOT one-to-one.

For example, take the graph of the function &lt;math&gt; f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, f(x) = x^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

We can draw a horizontal line anywhere on the graph (except for the turning point at &lt;math&gt; x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;) which will intersect with the graph twice. Therefore ''f'' is NOT a one-to-one function, and will NOT have an inverse function.

However, consider the function &lt;math&gt; g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, g(x) = x^3 &lt;/math&gt;.

This function IS one-to-one, and will therefore have an inverse function, which we label &lt;math&gt; g^{-1} \, &lt;/math&gt;.

===The rule of an inverse function===
The rule of the inverse of a function ''f'' can be found by letting &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt;, swapping the ''y'' and ''x'' variables, and re-arranging to make ''y'' the subject.

For example, consider ''g''. To find the rule of &lt;math&gt; g^{-1}(x) &lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt; g(x) = y &lt;/math&gt;
Now &lt;math&gt; y = x^3 \, &lt;/math&gt;. Swap the ''x'' and ''y'' variables to get &lt;math&gt; x = y^3 \,&lt;/math&gt;. Now take the cube root of each side to get &lt;math&gt; y = \sqrt[3]{x} \, &lt;/math&gt;. Now let &lt;math&gt; y = g^{-1}(x) &lt;/math&gt; and we have:-

&lt;math&gt; g^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} &lt;/math&gt;

===The domain and range of inverse functions===
Because, in finding inverse functions, we are swapping the ''x'' and ''y'' values in each ordered pair, it's logical that the domain of a function is the range of the inverse; and the range of a function is the domain of the inverse.

Thus: &lt;math&gt; \mbox{dom}f = \mbox{ran}f^{-1} \mbox{ and ran}f = \mbox{dom}f^{-1} \, &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory==
===Formula===
Given a function ''f'', the rule of the '''derivative''' (sometimes called the &quot;gradient&quot;) function is defined as &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \, &lt;/math&gt;.
===Method===
Remember that in order to evaluate a limit, we usually substitute the value given into the expression. However, with the above formula, substituting &lt;math&gt; h = 0 &lt;/math&gt; will result in a division by zero, which is mathematically impossible. Therefore,in order to make use of this formula, you need to substitute the rules &lt;math&gt; f(x+h) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt;, then simplify to eliminate the fraction, and only then substitute &lt;math&gt; h = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. This is called '''differentiation from first principles'''.

For example:

Let &lt;math&gt; f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, f(x) = 2x &lt;/math&gt;

Let us differentiate ''f'' from first principles.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 f'(x)  &amp; = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\
       &amp; = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2(x+h) - 2x}{h} \\
       &amp; = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2x + 2h - 2x}{h} \\
       &amp; = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2h}{h} \\
       &amp; = \lim_{h \to 0} 2 \\
       &amp; = 2 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, we can define the gradient function as &lt;math&gt; f': \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, f'(x) = 2 &lt;/math&gt;

==Exercises==
'''Question One'''&lt;br&gt;
Differentiate the following functions from first principles. &lt;br&gt;
'''(a)''' &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 4x &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(b)''' &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 7x &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(c)''' &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 2x + 1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(d)''' &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 3x + 3 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Question Two'''&lt;br&gt;
Differentiate the following functions from first principles. &lt;br&gt;
'''(a)''' &lt;math&gt; g(x) = x^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(b)''' &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 5x^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(c)''' &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 2x^2 + 3 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(d)''' &lt;math&gt; f(x) = (x+3)(x+4) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Cream of Tartar unneccesary? ==

I believe cream of tartar (Potassium bitartrate) does the same thing as citrus juice in this recipe. I would only use it if I had only lemon flavoring or lemon zest and not enough juice.  Likewise, lime juice can be substituted. 
Here is the article on Cream of Tartar in the Cookbook:
&quot;
Cream of tartar is an acid produced during winemaking. Citric acid is a good substitute.

Uses

* Mix with baking soda to make single-acting baking powder.
* Add to fruit-flavored frosting to make the frosting more sour.
* Mix with lemon extract or zest to make a lemon juice substitute.
* Use a 1/4 tsp. when beating egg whites to a stiff peak by hand with a wooden spoon (for 4 egg whites).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Early Islam can be categorized to that part of Islam that started with the life of prophet Muhammad (pbuh). since Allah says in the Quran that it is not a new religion but the same deen which was given to the early prophets starting from Adam to the last prophet Muhammad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to our Applied History of Psychology Wikibook. This project was the result of a graduate course in History and Systems in Psychology, HDP 3204 intersession class 2007 at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto (OISE/UT). This book represents ''a'' history of psychology--not the only one and certainly not a complete one, but definitely an interesting one and one that represents the varied interests of the students in this particular class. We hope you enjoy it and find it useful. 

The initial structure of this book emerged out of our individual interests, prior knowledge, and research contributions to this course. We first briefly acknowledge early thinkers that influenced the development of the discipline of psychology (Part I). Then, we address the history of various areas of inquiry that are highly relevant to our work. These broad areas include developmental theories (Part II), the field of intelligence and assessment (Part III), as well as the various approaches to understanding and treating psychological difficulties (IV). Finally, we also created a special topic section to provide space for particular topics that can &quot;stand on their own.&quot; (Part V).  

We welcome your comments, additions, and contributions. We invite you to consult our Introduction for more information.

==[[/Introduction/]]== 
Provides a brief overview and introduction to our Wikibook, including our guiding question.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ethnomedicine''' is a sub-field of medical anthropology and deals with the study of traditional medicines: not only those that have relevant written sources (e.g. Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda), but especially those, whose knowledge and practices have been orally transmitted over the centuries.

In the scientific arena, ethnomedical studies are generally characterized by a strong anthropological approach, more than a bio-medical one. The focus of these studies is then the perception and context of use of traditional medicines, and not their bio-evaluation.

Use this template freely for any medical condition that has an [[w:International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]] code, [[w:Mendelian Inheritance in Man|OMIM]] entry, MeshID, [[w:GeneReviews|GeneReviews]] ID, or other source that you think readers will benefit from seeing. Its use is not limited strictly to diseases. 

=== Usage ===
The template does not at the current time include summary information about the condition itself. Instead, it contains a consistent interface to other sources that provide information about the condition. Don't worry about trying to fill in all the fields -- even if you can only get one or two, that still can be useful.

While editing a condition, copy and paste the following text at the top of the page: (If you prefer, you can include the pipes at the beginning of the line instead.)

{{Infobox disease
 | Name           = {{PAGENAME}}
 | Image          = 
 | Alt            =
 | Caption        = 
 | DiseasesDB     = 
 | ICD10          = {{ICD10|Group|Major|minor|LinkGroup|LinkMajor}}
 | ICD9           = {{ICD9|xxx}}
 | ICDO           = 
 | OMIM           = 
 | MedlinePlus    = 
 | eMedicineSubj  = 
 | eMedicineTopic = 
 | MeshID         = 
}}
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Infobox disease
 | Name           = {{subst:PAGENAME}}
 | Image          = 
 | Alt            =
 | Caption        = 
 | DiseasesDB     = 
 | ICD10          = {{ICD10|Group|Major|minor|LinkGroup|LinkMajor}}
 | ICD9           = {{ICD9|xxx}}
 | ICDO           = 
 | OMIM           = 
 | MedlinePlus    = 
 | eMedicineSubj  = 
 | eMedicineTopic = 
 | MeshID         = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The best place to start is often the [[w:Diseases Database|Diseases Database]] searching at [http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/begin.asp?gif=1 DiseasesDB]. Click on that link, and type in the name of the condition (for example, &quot;Earache&quot;.) Click on the result you were looking for. At this point, you will see on your URL line something like &quot;http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/ddb18027.htm&quot;. You can copy the number (in this case, &quot;18027&quot; onto the &quot;DiseasesDB&quot; line in the template, so it looks like this 
&lt;pre&gt;
 | DiseasesDB     = 18027
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will see a label that reads &quot;Code translations and terms via UMLS.&quot;. Click on this link. The goal is to find the ICD9 and ICD10 codes. In this case, you can see &quot;388.7&quot; next to &quot;ICD-9-CM, 2006&quot; and &quot;H92.0&quot; next to &quot;German translation of ICD10, 1995&quot;. Fill in these two fields:
&lt;pre&gt;
 | ICD10          = H92.0
 | ICD9           = {{ICD9|388.7}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

You may find multiple codes listed. In this case, just fill them out as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
 | ICD10          = A11, B22
 | ICD9           = {{ICD9|123}}, {{ICD9|456}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In some cases, only one of the codes would apply to the current condition, but you may not always be able to determine which is which. [[Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages|Be bold]], and do your best.

You will notice that there are direct links provided for the ICD9 codes, but not for ICD10. Don't worry about providing direct links for ICD10 codes unless you are feeling very ambitious. Some of the technical issues involved are discussed at [[Template:ICD10]]. However, the easiest way to put in a direct link is to go to [[w:List of ICD-10 codes|List of ICD-10 codes]] and copy an example from there.

For the brave, the ICD10 template takes 5 parameters: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ICD10|Group|Major|minor|LinkGroup|LinkMajor}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
:'''Group''' - The upper-case Group letter to be displayed in Wikipedia 
:'''Major''' - Major group number (2 digits) 
:'''minor''' - Minor group number (optional) 
:'''LinkGroup''' - lower-case repeat of the '''Group''' letter to be presented to the WHO's website 
:'''LinkMajor''' - The major coding at the &lt;u&gt;top of webpage&lt;/u&gt; in which the target code exists (may or may not be the same as the '''Major''' code !)

In most cases you can skip over the &quot;ICD-O&quot; field, because that only applies to conditions that cause tumors. DiseasesDB doesn't provide these codes, but there are some resources listed for finding them at [[w:ICD-O|ICD-O]].

The final three fields are for [[w:OMIM|OMIM]], [[w:MedlinePlus|MedlinePlus]], and [[w:eMedicine|eMedicine]]. It's perfectly fine to leave these blank, but if you want to fill them out, you can sometimes find the pages by clicking on &quot;specific web sites&quot; in DiseaseDatabase. Alternatively use the following links to directly search [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM OMIM], [http://medlineplus.gov/ MedlinePlus] and [http://www.emedicine.com/ eMedicine].

Don't enter the full URL as this template's parameters, just the number at the end.

For eMedicine, two methods are acceptable as the website has restructured itself, but internally will redirect as required.

The old style, and hence the current parameter name usage, has two fields - put the number at the end into &quot;eMedicineTopic&quot;, and put the alphabetic code (such as &quot;neuro&quot; or &quot;orthoped&quot;) that precedes it into &quot;eMedicineSubj&quot;.

The current eMedicine site now uses a fixed 'article' space with an 'article number', and hence please use:
 | eMedicineSubj  = article   (this being a fixed literal text)
 | eMedicineTopic = 806890    (this being the variable article number) 

It's a little trickier to fill out the infobox if you can't find it listed in DiseaseDatabase. However, you can look up the codes individually if you would like. A good source for ICD9 codes is [http://icd9cm.chrisendres.com/index.php?action=procslist here], and a good source for ICD10 codes is [http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ here]. Many more sources for ICD codes are listed at [[w:ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]. You can look up OMIM codes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM here]. 

You can use the &quot;Image&quot;, &quot;Alt&quot; and &quot;Caption&quot; to provide an illustration. These fields are optional, but it is helpful to provide an image if you can find one. The Alt field specifies alt text, for readers who cannot see the image; see [[w:WP:ALT|WP:ALT]]. Of course most images on the internet are copyrighted, but you may be able to find an image already in Wikipedia on a related page. There are over a thousand free images of anatomical structures available at [[w:List of images and subjects in Gray's Anatomy|List of images and subjects in Gray's Anatomy]]. You could use one of these directly, or if you were feeling ambitious you could load one into a paint program on your computer, and annotate it with a couple of arrows to illustrate the point. Or just open [[w:Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] and spend a few minutes drawing a few circles. It doesn't have to be very fancy to be an improvement on having no image at all. But if you do create a new image, remember to upload it at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload Wikimedia], not at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Upload Wikibooks], so that it is easier to share images across languages.

There is also an optional &quot;Width&quot; parameter you can add for the image. If your picture is far too big, then add a new line and specify a custom width like this: 

 | Image          = mypicture.png
 | Alt            = A man's neck and shoulders, covered with giant green spots.
 | Caption        = The picture above illustrates a severe case of this condition.
 | Width          = 325

When no Width parameter is specified, it defaults to a width of 190.

Sometimes you will find a condition with more than one entry for OMIM, eMedicine, MedlinePlus, or DiseaseDatabase. There are optional &quot;_mult&quot; fields that allow additional parameters to be passed in.

The templates that may be used to provide the necessary links for these &quot;_mult&quot; fields, without specifying the source's name, are:
 | DiseasesDB_mult= &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;DiseasesDB2|'''number'''}}
 | OMIM_mult      = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;OMIM2|'''number'''}}
 | MedlinePlus_mult= &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;MedlinePlus2|'''number'''}}
 | eMedicine_mult = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;eMedicine2|'''field'''|'''topic number'''}}  (new usage would set '''field''' as the literal text 'article')

An example of how this is used at [[w:Nemaline myopathy|Nemaline myopathy]] is provided below. 
{{Infobox disease
 | Name           = {{PAGENAME}}
 | Image          = 
 | Alt            =
 | Caption        = 
 | DiseasesDB     = 31991
 | DiseasesDB_mult= {{DiseasesDB2|33448}} {{DiseasesDB2|33447}}
 | ICD10          = {{ICD10|G|71|2|g|70}}
 | ICD9           = {{ICD9|359.0}}
 | ICDO           = 
 | OMIM           = 161800
 | OMIM_mult      = {{OMIM2|256030}} {{OMIM2|605355}}
 | MedlinePlus    = 
 | eMedicineSubj  = neuro
 | eMedicineTopic = 76
 | eMedicine_mult = {{eMedicine2|neuro|230}}
}}
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Infobox disease
 | Name           = {{subst:PAGENAME}}
 | Image          = 
 | Alt            =
 | Caption        = 
 | DiseasesDB     = 31991
 | DiseasesDB_mult= {{DiseasesDB2|33448}} {{DiseasesDB2|33447}}
 | ICD10          = {{ICD10|G|71|2|g|70}}
 | ICD9           = {{ICD9|359.0}}
 | ICDO           = 
 | OMIM           = 161800
 | OMIM_mult      = {{OMIM2|256030}} {{OMIM2|605355}}
 | MedlinePlus    = 
 | MedlinePlus_mult=
 | eMedicineSubj  = neuro
 | eMedicineTopic = 76
 | eMedicine_mult = {{eMedicine2|neuro|230}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If there are too many eMedicine articles to list with eMedicine_mult, then one may directly show eMedicine's search list of topics.&lt;br /&gt;Set '''eMedicineSubj = search''' and '''eMedicineTopic''' to the term to be searched for.&lt;br /&gt;Note that any spaces in the search term must be replaced with the asci code of '''&lt;nowiki&gt;%20&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''. Hence: 
{{Infobox disease
 | eMedicineSubj  = search
 | eMedicineTopic = shaken%20baby%20syndrome
}}
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Infobox disease
 | eMedicineSubj  = search
 | eMedicineTopic = shaken%20baby%20syndrome
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't worry about getting all the fields -- just do your best, and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to ask at [[Template talk:Infobox disease]].

=== MeSH ===
The [[w:Medical Subject Headings|Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH), formerly known as the Supplement to [[w:Index medicus|Index medicus]], is a [[w:controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabulary]] managed by the [[w:National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]]. To find the MeSH code for a disease, go to the [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/MBrowser.html MeSH search page] and enter the term into the search box.  The needed MeSH number is the '''Unique ID''' in the MeSH Descriptor Page.

=== GeneReviews ===
[[w:GeneReviews|GeneReviews]] is an online collection of peer-reviewed articles that describe specific gene-releated diseases. To use it, go to its [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GeneTests/review?db=GeneTests search page] and find the page's ID and title. For example, its autism overview has the URL &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&amp;part=autism-overview&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and title &quot;Autism overview&quot;, so it can be coded as follows:

{{Infobox disease
| GeneReviewsID   = autism-overview
| GeneReviewsName = Autism overview
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{Infobox disease
| GeneReviewsID   = autism-overview
| GeneReviewsName = Autism overview
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Info|This page is a '''rough draft''' for the page ''JavaScript/Strings''}} 
== What is a string? ==
Strings are pieces of unformatted text, and may contain html to format the appearance for the viewer. (''You are the viewer of this page, and this text you are reading is made up of strings'') They have many uses, from storing the value of an input field in a variable to specifying the content of a pop-up.

== String variables ==
Strings are common in variables. When a variable has a string(s) in its value, the string(s) are enclosed within quotation marks.

''Example:''
 var string = &quot;This is a string&quot;;
 document.write(string);
Displays:
 This is a string

Sometimes, however, a variable contains other variables along ''with'' strings. In this case, the variables are outside the string closing/opening quotations, with a plus (+) sign on either side. Example:
 var othervar = &quot;variable&quot;;
 var string   = &quot;This is a &quot; + othervar + &quot; within another &quot; + othervar + &quot; as a string&quot;;
 document.write(string);
Result:
 This is a variable within another variable as a string

In the case of html-content string variables, sometimes the &quot;''+=''&quot; assignment is used. What this does in the case of strings is adds to what is already in the variable. Example:
 var string;
 string = &quot;&quot;;
 string += &quot;This &quot;;
 string += &quot;is &quot;;
 string += &quot;a &quot;;
 string += &quot;string &quot;;
 string += &quot;using &quot;;
 string += &quot;the &quot;;
 string += &quot;\&quot;+=\&quot; &quot;;
 string += &quot;assignment.&quot;;
 document.write(string);
Returns
 This is a string using the &quot;+=&quot; assignment</text>

== My purpose ==
I'm responsible for [[Template:auto archive|automatically archiving]] specially marked talk pages on various Wikimedia projects. I run everyday at 5 am and at 2 pm (UTC) analyzing pages marked for automatic archiving and moving sections to archives as specified.

== Mistakes ==
If you find mistakes with the way I work, please contact my owner on his [[w:de:Benutzer Diskussion:Sebmol|talk page]].

== Technical details ==
My code is based on a derivative of the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/dotnetwikibot DotNetWikiBot framework], a bot support library for the .NET framework. The source isn't published yet, mostly due to cleanup and documentation outstanding. I run on an AMD Sempron 2600+ (1.6 GHz) with 2 GB RAM.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Song or poem==

I notice they don't have a simple song section in this version.
If this book is translated into another language, it would be useful.

How about we add something like:
&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px; padding: 0.2em&quot;&gt;
Twinkle, twinkle little star&lt;br&gt;
How I wonder what you are&lt;br&gt;
up above the world so high&lt;br&gt;
like a diamond in the sky&lt;br&gt;
Twinkle, twinkle little star&lt;br&gt;
How I wonder what you are&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I'll add it.

== New Zealand in the Great Depression ==

As in many other countries, New Zealand
National income fell by 40 per cent in three years. Exports were greatly affected, falling by 45 per cent in just two years. 

The value of wool declined by 60 per cent from 1929 to 1932, but the value of meat wasn't so badly affected. Dairy farmers increased production of butter and cheese to try and meet the increasing problems, but failed in doing so.

In 1935, the Labour Party became the new government, seeking to promote economic stability. In this, they achieved much, developing social services, state housing, bringing wages back up, and restoring New Zealand to a sense of normality.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or login in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Welcome to the textbook on '''writing adolescent fiction'''. Adolescent fiction is a personal, identifiable and casual genre. When they have entered their teen years, many boys and girls alike try their hands at writing it. Sometimes they will decide a few years later that they have written utter crap and throw their stories into the trash (or the Recycle Bin on their computers). Some end up writing best-selling adolescent novels as adults.

Whether you are interested in writing novels that will be read by millions or just writing stories you want to share with a few friends, this textbook is for you.

Much of this advice will be specific to the genre of adolescent fiction, although some parts of it are useful to writers anywhere.

Yeah, that looks great! If possible, perhaps you could have the words ''next'' to the pictures rather than below? But I love the pictures. Did you make them or what?

== Thanks! ==

Hi, just a thanks for the message you wrote me back in March, which I didn't see until today. I see also that you haven't edited since October so you might not see this for quite some time either. I've since decided to throw the majority of my support toward the language called Occidental, and am thinking about making a textbook for that (some others exist, but one in my own style) so I might use the images then.

*'''delete''' I can't make heads nor tails out of this. Is it about economics? Is it history? Or is it just super-fly wiggity-whack? Whatever it is, delete it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:33, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' I think it's super-fly wiggity-whack made by someone with a big vocabulary. Regular spammers have no clue what Mandelbrot Sets are (I don't even know except that they're high-level math), or &quot;binary tree models&quot; (which are related to computer programming). [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 19:53, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

*&lt;s&gt;'''Keep'''&lt;/s&gt;{{comment}} It's a stub of high-math theories and techniques (there are several references, even to game theory) applied to economics to provide a predictable and stable model.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:23, 31 August 2007 (UTC)
*:regardless of what the topic is, are you saying that there is both (a) enough material here for another writer to understand the subject and scope of the book and (b) that this book is likely to ever progress beyond a trashy stub? I can't imagine either condition ever being satisfied on this book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:36, 31 August 2007 (UTC)
*::I don't engage in futurology (the topic is very technical so evolution will probably be slow if any), but the content as it is can be extended (a) and I'm for keeping stubs (if they have some valid content or provide some kind of structure even if empty of content) (b). I would agree that several stubs could be deleted if space was a problem...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:47, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

*'''Comment''': it's economics (specifically statistical modeling of equity market behavior). The author seems to have abandoned it, however, and the title is at best a neologism. Jguk might have some idea what to do with it. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:31, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - it's rubbish. It doesn't attempt to cover any of the topics it mentions in any useful way. Already covered in much better detail by [[Financial Derivatives]] and [[Option on the product of two asset prices]] (the latter of which should probably be merged into the former). [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:03, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

*'''Comment''': Just great, deleted it.  My purpose was to start a conversation and to contribute.  Unfortunately, I just didn't have the time to expand on this topic.  I have an understanding which is filled with gaps, so I was hoping someone better informed than I would fill in the gaps.  Specifically, I was interested in knowing about the formulation of finance using infinite variance assumption models rather than Bayesian statistics.  Now, when I return, it is gone.  Great, but Wikipedia is filled with fantasy which people complete with great energy and excitement which should be moved into a new domain WikiFantasy, e.g. Galactus, Dune, Star Trek and the Bible.  18:30, 21 December 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Help!!!!===
Tadew: How do I move my camera and lamps? Also I tried creating this hills with constraint to the z axis and it still came out flat with moutain tops stcking out flat... 

:(((

===Panels vs. Tabs===
mugatu: hi, it would be great if there's a consensus along the tutorial about what is a panel and what is a tab. For example in the '''Texturing the terrain''' section first it says Shading Tab (F5) and later it said Shading Panel (F6). It took me some time before i realized that these where both the same and the F6 was actually a mistake. I made the changes, hope that's ok.
:Sorry for the mistake.  I'm not very good about being consistent with what I call things.  Thanks for fixing it. [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] ([[User talk:Moohasha|talk]]) 18:26, 6 April 2008 (UTC)
===Rendering===
Stu: I figure most people should be able to figure this out eventually, but rendering with the suggested 100 by 100 grid takes a real long time (at least on my hunk of junk), and the impatient noob (e.g., myself) may think he's doing something wrong, especially given that up to this point in the wikibook, minimal rendering has taken place, so he doesn't know what to expect during said process.  Please address this in the tutorial!  Also, it's easy to end up with the camera placed poorly so that you end up rendering the bottom of your landscape, and again the noob may wonder what the deal is with the black-as-his-heart bit of landscape appearing before his eyes.  Warn the unwary about this, too!
:Thanks for the suggestion.  And you're right, it does take a long time, especially if you're trying to render the whole thing instead of just a portion.  I'll through something in at the end about it. [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] ([[User talk:Moohasha|talk]]) 18:26, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

I followed a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Adrignola&amp;diff=2058833&amp;oldid=2058736 'shameless plug'] here - so I'm giving it a look :-) cheers, [[User:Privatemusings|Privatemusings]] ([[User talk:Privatemusings|talk]]) 22:09, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

:Excellent.  I never got involved in Wikipedia, so I'm a poor candidate to really improve upon it.  If you'll notice, SB Johnny actually started the book.  Unfortunately, he's not around any longer, but I try to keep his legacy alive. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:53, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

I added a URL to what I think is probably the best resource I've found concerning the timeline - is this ok in wikibooks terms? (a link in the text?) - when I get the chance, I'll try and contact the author about how he feels about bringing some information over - it's currently copyright 'all rights reserved' (fair enough!).

:I didn't notice this message while checking RC. I've answered on your talk page. Regards [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 14:21, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
::no worries - have replied there too.. basically I'll try and see if I can adapt some of the information without being rude to the author (or infringing copyright) in due course - thanks for your cleanup :-) cheers, [[User:Privatemusings|Privatemusings]] ([[User talk:Privatemusings|talk]]) 01:50, 16 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Trouble adding more stencils===
Hi guys,
I have some trouble, please help me!
In your tut we use 3 textures and 2 stencils: works fine. BUT 4 textures and 3 stencils will cause, that the last stencil/texture does not work,means that in my last stencil the 4. texture will not be shown but therefore the 3rd.

*texture_1
*stencil_1
*texture_2
*stencil_2
*texture_3  // texture_3 is also shown in stencil_3-areas, where actually texture_4 should be 
*stencil_3  
*texture_4  // texture_4 does not appear 

thanks!

:I'm not entirely sure I follow, but be sure that your new stencil is applied to ALL previous stencils.  So if you add a third stencil, say a white circle in the middle of a black background, then both your second AND first stencils need to include the white circle, not just the previous one.  Also, be sure that for your 3rd stencil, you've gone the the MapTo tab and deselected Col and selected Stencil and NoRGB in order to treat it as a stencil.

::I've looked in multiple places and asked plenty of people, but I can't figure out how to combine the two separate stencil images.  If they were far apart, I could copy/paste, but in my design (not quite like this one, but similar) they're touching each other.  What software should i use, and how do I use it?  Thanks!  11/13/2009

:By the way, I edited your post to make it a little easier to read.   [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] 14:00, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for answering. curiously i fixed it by exactly not applying the new stencil to the older stencils.

:Hm, not sure what that did, but glad it worked for you. :) [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] ([[User talk:Moohasha|talk]]) 18:47, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

== Multiple Stencils ==

Could someone please post what sequence the textures and stencils should be organized in? E.g. grass, dirt, stencil 1 etc.
Thanks

Never mind, I think got it:

Grass

Stencil 1

Rock

Stencil 2

Dirt


Right?

ANSWER: yes, first the stencil then the texture as written in the tutorial:)

:Right, as the tutorial demonstrates, the order is TEX1, STEN1, TEX2, STEN2, TEX3... [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] ([[User talk:Moohasha|talk]]) 18:46, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

== Making The Sky? ==

I wonder if someone could explain how to make the sky in the final picture? i go to shading -&gt; world buttons and load a sky texture but i still get this homogen coulor background. how do i change this into the loaded sky texture? thanks for any hints. Hello?

edit: Yeah i got it! Its easy. Add a plane, scale it so its in the whole view of the camera. Add a skytexture. I wonder if you should note it in the tutorial?
:That's one way, and works for still frames, but difficult to keep up if you want to make an annimation.  The way I made the sky for this tutorial is this:
:* Select the camera in the 3D-viewport
:* Goto the Shading panel ('''F5''') and add a new Texture
:* Make it an image and load in a cloud texture (or use whatever texture you want)
:* Within the Shading panel, goto the World Buttons (It's the button two down from the Texture button.  Has a picture of the world)
:* In the ''Map To'' tab on the far right, deselect '''Blend''' and select '''Hori''' (for horizon)
:* In the preview tab, make sure '''Real''' and '''Blend''' are deselected, and '''Paper''' IS selected.
:So what did that do?  You basically applied a texture to the camera object.  To be honest, this whole process is a little confusing and dificult to get right, because you basically want to map the texture to the inside of a giant sphere that is behind everything else, so getting it to look good can be a little tricky.  It's been months since I did this, so I may be a little off, but that's the general idea.  Hope that helps. [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] ([[User talk:Moohasha|talk]]) 18:44, 6 April 2008 (UTC)


== Rock Texture? ==
Just wondering why you didn't provide a rock texture. Great tut other then That. But isn't there a easyer way to add textures to objects like that. Kinda like in Hexagon?

I was experimenting with the multiple stencil idea.  I followed the directions to the nth degree but the outcome was unexpected.

The location of the stenciled texture was reversed (see below).  Any thoughts?

== Problem with reversed stencils.  ==

I followed the instructions and ended up with my stenciled landscape displaying correctly in the preview window but when rendered, the stenciled area and textures were reversed.  It was if they became a mirror image overlaying the ground.  Any ideas anyone?

I tried to provide a screen shot but can't figure out how.

== reversed stencil ==

I had the same problem. Than I discovered that there is anothere texture panel when you push the material button it appears far right. There I erased the textures and loaded them again and changed the preview button to &quot;sphere&quot; then my wonderful mars-mountains appeared :-)

==Bumpmap==
I think you should make mention of the Bumpmap feature &quot;Nor in object mode&quot; as another method of adding realism to your map. I would write that in myself, but I'm still a bit of a noob myself, and it's not my tutorial.

== One texture instead of three ==
Is there possibility to export final texture (mixed from all three) to one file? I need to export the model to .obj file and it seems that .obj does not support multiple textures.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Topics to focus on in this area of health:
*[[/Drug Misuse/]]

== Alcohol ==
Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant and it is the central nervous system that is most severely affected by alcohol.  When ingested, alcohol passes from the stomach into the small intestine, where it is rapidly absorbed in the blood and distributed throughout the body.
As blood alcohol concentration increases, a person's response to stimuli decreases markedly; speech becomes slurred, and he or she becomes unsteady and has trouble walking.  With very high concentration, a person can become comatose and die.
When consumed in large amounts over time, alcohol can harm virtually every organ in your body.
*Alcohol and its effects
**Blood Alcohol Concentration
**Impaired judgment
**Aggressive Behavior
**Wrong Decisions
**Intensified Emotions
**Different systems (nervous, digestive, etc.)
*Effects of drinking while pregnant
**Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
**Low birth weight
*Alcohol and violence
**Domestic
**Lawbreaking
**Rape
**Drinking and Driving
*Alcoholism and effects on family
**Problems with:
***Relationships
***Money
***Jobs

== Tobacco ==
Smoking tobacco harms nearly every organ of the body, causing many diseases and affecting the health of smokers in general.  Quitting smoking has immediate as well as long-term benefits for you and your loved ones.  Smokeless tobacco is also a significant health risk and is not a safe substitute for smoking cigarettes.  The two main types of smokeless tobacco in the United States are chewing tobacco and snuff.  Although some forms of snuff can be used by sniffing or inhaling into the nose, most smokeless tobacco users place the product in their cheek or between their gum and cheek.
*Effects of smoking
**Cancer
**Respiratory Diseases
**Cardiovascular Diseases
**Accidents (fires)
*Effects of secondhand smoke
*Controlled substances and their effects
**Different types
***Stimulants
***Depressants
**Death
**Increased Risk of HIV
**Dependency
**Harms the brain
*Risk and protective factors
**Warning Signs (blank stare, slurred speech)
**Lack of self respect
**Peer Pressure
***How to say &quot;NO&quot;
***Practice Resistance

== Drugs ==
Drugs are substances that change the way your brain and body work.  Drugs can be swallowed, inhaled, smoked, or injected.  Whichever way drugs are taken, they end up in your bloodstream and go to all parts of your body.  many drugs are illegal, meaning it is against the law to have them.  Prescription drugs are given to you by a doctor if you have an injury,  illness, or other health condition.  You must follow your doctor's directions on how to take your medicine.  Do NOT take someone else's prescribtion medicine or share your medicine with others.  This isn't legal or safe.  You do not need a doctor's prescription to buy over-the-counter (OTC) drugs at a pharmacy or grocery store.  OTC drugs are used for colds, pain, and other health problems.

== Windows API and C++ Programming ==
There are already a number of books/pages that try to cover that specific topic (try searching for windows or into the Windows Book shelf) most are all stubs and providing a complete coverage of the topic is a very big task indeed. I have some time ago attempted to start doing it about the  MFC on the C++ Programming book since it is more related to C++ (it was latter moved to another book, I can't remember the name) the API is also more likely to be explained on a C oriented book (or general windows programming book) or the new .net framework on a .net oriented book (we could also talk about C++/CLI but on the C++ Programming (I'm don't like the idea). In place of adding just another stub (if you don't intend on doing a more complete job) why not reference one of the other Wiikibooks that already have some content on the subject ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:55, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The IDisposable Interface ==
{{stub}}
=== Basics ===
The IDisposable interface is implemented when an object needs to be &quot;cleaned up&quot; after use. If an object has a &quot;Dispose&quot; method, then it needs to be cleaned up after use.

The easiest way to clean up this sort of object is by using the VB keyword &quot;Using&quot;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Using f As New Form
        f.Show
    End Using
&lt;/source&gt;

When an IDisposable object is a form-level variable, it should be disposed in the Form_Closed event.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Public Class Form1
        Private mfrmChild As Form
        Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
            mfrmChild = New Form
            mfrmChild.Text = &quot;Child&quot;
            mfrmChild.Show()
        End Sub
        Private Sub frmMain_FormClosed(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.FormClosedEventArgs) Handles Me.FormClosed
            mfrmChild.Dispose()
        End Sub
    End Class
&lt;/source&gt;

In the branch of [[mathematics]] called [[functional analysis]], the '''Laplace transform''', &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{L} \left\{f(t)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[linear operator]] on a function ''f''(''t'') (''original'' ) with a real argument ''t'' (''t'' ≥ 0) that transforms it to a function ''F''(''s'') (''image'') with a complex argument ''s''. This transformation is essentially [[bijection|bijective]] for the majority of practical uses; the respective pairs of ''f(t)'' and ''F(s)'' are matched in tables. The Laplace transform has the useful property that many relationships and operations over the originals ''f''(''t'') correspond to simpler relationships and operations over the images ''F''(''s'')&lt;ref&gt;Korn and Korn, Section 8.1&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
The Laplace transform has many important applications in mathematics, [[physics]], [[optics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[control engineering]], [[signal processing]], and [[probability theory]]. In mathematics, it is used for solving differential and integral equations. In physics, it is used for analysis of [[LTI system|linear time-invariant]] [[dynamical system|systems]] such as [[electrical circuit]]s, [[harmonic oscillator]]s, [[optical device]]s, and mechanical systems.  In this analysis, the Laplace transform is often interpreted as a transformation from the ''[[time-domain]]'', in which inputs and outputs are functions of time, to the ''[[frequency-domain]]'', where the same inputs and outputs are functions of [[complex number|complex]] [[angular frequency]], or [[radians]] per unit time. Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a system, the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications.

The Laplace transform is named in honor of [[mathematician]] and [[astronomer]] [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], who used the transform in his work on [[probability theory]].   

==Formal definition==

The Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''t''), defined for all [[real number]]s ''t'' &amp;ge; 0, is the function ''F''(''s''), defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \mathcal{L} \left\{f(t)\right\}=\int_{0^-}^\infty e^{-st} f(t) \,dt. &lt;/math&gt;

The lower limit of 0&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; is short notation to mean

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0+}\int_{-\varepsilon;}^\infty &lt;/math&gt;

and assures the inclusion of the entire [[Dirac delta]] function &amp;delta;(''t'') at 0 if there is such an impulse in ''f''(''t'') at 0.

The parameter ''s'' is in general [[complex number|complex]]:

:&lt;math&gt;s = \sigma + i \omega \, &lt;/math&gt;

This [[integral transform]] has a number of properties that make it useful for analyzing linear [[dynamical system]]s. The most significant advantage is that [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]] become multiplication and division, respectively, by ''s''. (This is similar to the way that [[logarithm]]s change an operation of multiplication of numbers to addition of their logarithms.)  This changes [[integral equation]]s and [[differential equation]]s to [[polynomial equation]]s, which are much easier to solve.  Once solved, use of the inverse Laplace transform reverts back to the time domain.

===Bilateral Laplace transform===
{{Main|Two-sided Laplace transform}}

When one says &quot;the Laplace transform&quot; without qualification, the unilateral or one-sided transform is normally intended. The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined as the ''bilateral Laplace transform'' or [[two-sided Laplace transform]] by extending the limits of integration to be the entire real axis.  If that is done the common unilateral transform simply becomes a special case of the bilateral transform where the definition of the function being transformed is multiplied by the [[Heaviside step function]].

The bilateral Laplace transform is defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;F(s)  = \mathcal{L}\left\{f(t)\right\}  =\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-st} f(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverse Laplace transform===
The inverse Laplace transform is the [[Bromwich integral]], which is a [[complex number|complex]] integral given by

: &lt;math&gt;f(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \{F(s)\} = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{ \gamma - i \cdot \infty}^{ \gamma + i \cdot \infty} e^{st} F(s)\,ds,&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;gamma; is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the ''[[region of convergence]]'' of  ''F''(''s'') normally requiring &amp;gamma; &gt; Re(''s''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) for every [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] ''s''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; of ''F''(''s'') and ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1. If all singularities are in the left half-plane, that is Re(''s''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; 0 for every ''s''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, then &amp;gamma; can be set to zero and the above inverse integral formula above becomes identical to the inverse [[Fourier transform]].

An alternative formula for the inverse Laplace transform is given by [[Post's inversion formula]].

==Region of convergence==

The Laplace transform ''F''(''s'') typically  exists for all complex numbers such that Re{''s''} &gt; ''a'', where ''a'' is a real constant which depends on the growth behavior of ''f''(''t''), whereas the two-sided transform is defined in a range
''a'' &lt; Re{''s''} &lt; ''b''.  The subset of values of ''s'' for which the Laplace transform exists is called the ''region of convergence'' (ROC) or the ''domain of convergence''.  In the two-sided case, it is sometimes called the ''strip of convergence.''

There are no specific conditions that one can check a function against to know in all cases if its Laplace transform can be taken,  other than to say the defining integral converges. It is however easy to give theorems on cases where it may or may not be taken.

== Properties and theorems==


Given the functions ''f''(''t'') and ''g''(''t''), and their respective Laplace transforms ''F''(''s'') and ''G''(''s''):
:&lt;math&gt; f(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \{  F(s) \} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \{  G(s) \} &lt;/math&gt;

* '''Initial value theorem''':
: &lt;math&gt;f(0^+)=\lim_{s\to \infty}{sF(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Final value theorem''':
: &lt;math&gt;f(\infty)=\lim_{s\to 0}{sF(s)}&lt;/math&gt;, all poles in left-hand plane.
: The final value theorem is useful because it gives the long-term behaviour without having to perform [[partial fraction]] decompositions or other difficult algebra. If a function's poles are in the right hand plane (e.g. &lt;math&gt;e^t&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sin(t)&lt;/math&gt;) the behaviour of this formula is undefined.

=== Proof of the Laplace transform of a function's derivative===

It is often convenient to use the differentiation property of the Laplace transform to find the transform of a function's derivative.  This can be derived from the basic expression for a Laplace transform as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \left\{f(t)\right\}  =\int_{0^-}^{+\infty} e^{-st} f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; ~~ = \left[ \frac{f(t)e^{-st}}{-s} \right]_{0^-}^{+\infty} - 
\int_{0^-}^{+\infty} \frac{e^{-st}}{-s} f'(t)dt&lt;/math&gt; (by parts)

:&lt;math&gt; ~~ = \left[-\frac{f(0)}{-s}\right] + 
\frac{1}{s}\mathcal{L}\left\{f'(t)\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

yielding

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left\{\frac{df}{dt}\right\} = s\cdot\mathcal{L} \left\{ f(t) \right\}-f(0), &lt;/math&gt;

and in the bilateral case, we have

: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}\left\{ { df \over dt }  \right\}
  = s \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-st} f(t)\,dt  = s \cdot \mathcal{L} \{ f(t) \}. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Relationship to other transforms ===
====Fourier transform====
The [[continuous Fourier transform]] is equivalent to evaluating the bilateral Laplace transform with complex argument ''s'' = ''i''&amp;omega;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
F(\omega) &amp; = &amp; \mathcal{F}\left\{f(t)\right\} \\[1em]
&amp; = &amp; \mathcal{L}\left\{f(t)\right\}|_{s = i \omega}  =  F(s)|_{s = i \omega}\\[1em]
&amp; = &amp; \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-\imath \omega t} f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t.\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this expression excludes the scaling factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is often included in definitions of the Fourier transform.

This relationship between the Laplace and Fourier transforms is often used to determine the [[frequency spectrum]] of a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] or [[dynamical system]].

====Mellin transform====

The [[Mellin transform]] and its inverse are related to the two-sided Laplace transform by a simple change of variables. If in the Mellin transform

:&lt;math&gt;G(s) = \mathcal{M}\left\{g(\theta)\right\} = \int_0^\infty \theta^s g(\theta) \frac{d\theta}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

we set &amp;theta; = e&lt;sup&gt;-t&lt;/sup&gt; we get a two-sided Laplace transform.

====Z-transform====
The [[Z-transform]] is simply the Laplace transform of an ideally sampled signal with the substitution of

:&lt;math&gt; z \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  e^{s T} \ &lt;/math&gt;

: where &lt;math&gt;T = 1/f_s \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Sampling theorem|sampling]] period (in units of time e.g. seconds) and &lt;math&gt; f_s \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[sampling rate]] (in [[sample (signal)|samples per second]] or [[hertz]])

Let
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_T(t) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}  \delta(t - n T) &lt;/math&gt;

be a sampling impulse train (also called a [[Dirac comb]]) and
:&lt;math&gt; x_q(t) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  x(t) \Delta_T(t) = x(t) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}  \delta(t - n T)  &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x(n T) \delta(t - n T) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x[n] \delta(t - n T) &lt;/math&gt;

be the continuous-time representation of the sampled &lt;math&gt; x(t) \ &lt;/math&gt;.
: &lt;math&gt; x[n] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  x(nT) \ &lt;/math&gt; are the discrete samples of &lt;math&gt; x(t) \ &lt;/math&gt;.

The Laplace transform of the sampled signal &lt;math&gt; x_q(t) \ &lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;X_q(s) = \int_{0^-}^{\infty} x_q(t) e^{-s t} \,dt &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \ = \int_{0^-}^{\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x[n] \delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \, dt &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \ = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x[n] \int_{0^-}^{\infty} \delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \, dt &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \ = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x[n] e^{-n s T}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is precisely the definition of the [[Z-transform]] of the discrete function &lt;math&gt; x[n] \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; X(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x[n] z^{-n} &lt;/math&gt;

with the substitution of &lt;math&gt; z \leftarrow e^{s T} \ &lt;/math&gt;.

Comparing the last two equations, we find the relationship between the Z-transform and the Laplace transform of the sampled signal:
:&lt;math&gt;X_q(s) =  X(z) \Big|_{z=e^{sT}}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Borel transform====
The integral form of the [[Borel transform]] is identical to the Laplace transform; indeed, these are sometimes mistakenly assumed to be synonyms. The [[generalized Borel transform]] generalizes the Laplace transform for functions not of [[exponential type]].

==== Fundamental relationships ====
Since an ordinary Laplace transform can be written as a special case
of a two-sided transform, and since the two-sided transform can be written as
the sum of two one-sided transforms, the theory of the Laplace-, Fourier-, Mellin-, and Z-transforms are at bottom the same subject. However, a different point of view and different
characteristic problems are associated with each of these four major integral transforms.

==  Table of selected Laplace transforms ==

The following table provides Laplace transforms for many common functions of a single variable. For definitions and explanations, see the ''Explanatory Notes'' at the end of the table.

Because the Laplace transform is a linear operator:

* The Laplace transform of a sum is the sum of Laplace transforms of each term.

::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left\{f(t) + g(t) \right\}  = \mathcal{L}\left\{f(t)\right\} + \mathcal{L}\left\{ g(t) \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;

* The Laplace transform of a multiple of a function, is that multiple times the Laplace transformation of that function. 

::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left\{a f(t)\right\}  = a \mathcal{L}\left\{ f(t)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The unilateral Laplace transform is only valid when t is non-negative, which is why all of the time domain functions in the table below are multiples of the Heaviside step function, u(''t'').

==s-Domain equivalent circuits and impedances==
The Laplace transform is often used in circuit analysis, and simple conversions to the s-Domain of circuit elements can be made. Circuit elements can be transformed into [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s, very similar to [[phasor]] impedances.

Here is a summary of equivalents:
:[[Image:S-domain_circuit_equivalents.png]]

Note that the resistor is exactly the same in the time domain and the s-Domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the s-Domain account for that.

The equivalents for current and voltage sources are simply derived from the transformations in the table above.

==Examples: How to apply the properties and theorems==
{{Copy to Wikibooks}}

The Laplace transform is used frequently in [[engineering]] and [[physics]]; the output of a [[LTI system theory|linear dynamic system]] can be calculated by convolving its unit [[impulse response]] with the input signal. Performing this calculation in Laplace space turns the [[convolution]] into a [[multiplication]]; the latter being easier to solve because of its algebraic form. For more information, see [[control theory]].

The Laplace transform can also be used to [[Laplace transform applied to differential equations|solve differential equations]] and is used extensively in [[electrical engineering]].  The method of using the Laplace Transform to solve [[differential equations]] was developed by the English electrical engineer [[Oliver Heaviside]].

:''The following examples, derived from applications in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], will use [[SI]] units of measure.  SI is based on [[meters]] for distance, [[kilograms]] for mass, [[second]]s for time, and [[ampere]]s for electric current.''

===Example #1: Solving a differential equation===

:''The following example is based on concepts from [[nuclear physics]]''.

Consider the following first-order, linear differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is the fundamental relationship describing [[radioactive decay]], where

:&lt;math&gt; N \ = \ N(t) &lt;/math&gt;

represents the number of undecayed atoms remaining in a sample of a radioactive [[isotope]] at time ''t'' (in seconds), and &lt;math&gt;\ \lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the [[decay constant]].

We can use the Laplace transform to solve this equation.

Rearranging the equation to one side, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} +  \lambda N  =  0. &lt;/math&gt;

Next, we take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \left( s \tilde{N}(s) - N_o  \right) + \lambda \tilde{N}(s) \ = \ 0   &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{N}(s) = \mathcal{L}\{N(t)\}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;N_o \ = \ N(0).&lt;/math&gt;

Solving, we find

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{N}(s) = { N_o \over s + \lambda  }.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, we take the inverse Laplace transform to find the general solution

: &lt;math&gt;N(t) \ = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \{\tilde{N}(s)\} = \mathcal{L}^{-1}  \left\{ \frac{N_o}{s + \lambda} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

::: &lt;math&gt; = \ N_o e^{-\lambda t},&lt;/math&gt;

which is indeed the correct form for radioactive decay.

===Example #2: Deriving the complex impedance for a capacitor===

:''This example is based on the principles of [[electrical circuit]] theory.''

The constitutive relation governing the dynamic behavior of a [[capacitor]] is the following differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt; i = C { dv \over dt} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the capacitance (in [[farads]]) of the capacitor, ''i'' = ''i''(''t'') is the [[electrical current]] (in [[amperes]]) flowing through the capacitor as a function of time, and ''v'' = ''v''(''t'') is the [[electrostatic potential|voltage]] (in [[volts]]) across the terminals of the capacitor, also as a function of time.

Taking the Laplace transform of this equation, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;  I(s) = C \left( s V(s) - V_o  \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; I(s) = \mathcal{L} \{ i(t) \}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; V(s) = \mathcal{L} \{ v(t) \}, &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; V_o \ = \ v(t)|_{t=0}. &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''V''(''s'') we have

:&lt;math&gt;  V(s) = { I(s) \over sC }  +  { V_o  \over s }.  &lt;/math&gt;

The definition of the [[complex number|complex]] [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] ''Z'' (in [[ohm (unit)|ohms]]) is the ratio of the complex voltage ''V'' divided by the complex current ''I'' while holding the initial state ''V''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; at zero:

:&lt;math&gt;Z(s) = { V(s) \over I(s) } \bigg|_{V_o = 0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using this definition and the previous equation, we find:

:&lt;math&gt;Z(s) = \frac{1}{sC}, &lt;/math&gt;

which is the correct expression for the complex impedance of a capacitor.

===Example #3: Finding the transfer function from the impulse response===

:''This example is based on concepts from [[signal processing]], and describes the dynamic behavior of a [[damped harmonic oscillator]].  See also [[RLC circuit]].''

Consider a linear time-invariant system with [[impulse response]]

:&lt;math&gt; h(t) = A e^{- \alpha t} \cos(\omega_d t - \phi_d) \, &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_d t - \phi_d \ge 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the time (in seconds), and

:&lt;math&gt;  0 \le \phi_d \le 2 \pi &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[phase (waves)|phase delay]] (in [[radians]]).

Suppose that we want to find the [[transfer function]] of the system.  We begin by noting that

:&lt;math&gt; h(t) = A e^{- \alpha t} \cos \left[ \omega_d (t - t_d) \right] \cdot u(t - t_d) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;t_d = { \phi_d \over \omega_d }&lt;/math&gt;

is the time delay of the system (in seconds), and &lt;math&gt; \ u(t) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heaviside step function]].

The transfer function is simply the Laplace transform of the impulse response:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) \ = \ \mathcal{L} \{ h(t) \}  = A e^{-s t_d} {(s + \alpha) \over (s + \alpha)^2 + \omega_d^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;  = \ A e^{-s t_d} {(s + \alpha) \over (s^2 + 2 \alpha s + \alpha^2) + \omega_d^2 }  &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;  = \ A e^{-s t_d} {(s + \alpha) \over (s^2 + 2 \alpha s + \omega_0^2 ) }  &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_0 = \sqrt{\alpha^2 + \omega_d^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is the (undamped) [[resonance|natural frequency]] or [[resonance]] of the system (in [[radians per second]]).

=== Example #4: Method of partial fraction expansion ===

Consider a linear time-invariant system with [[transfer function]]

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{1}{(s+\alpha)(s+\beta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[impulse response]] is simply the inverse Laplace transform of this transfer function:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{H(s)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

To evaluate this inverse transform, we begin by expanding ''H''(''s'') using the method of [[partial fraction|partial fraction expansion]]:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{1}{(s+\alpha)(s+\beta)} =   { P \over (s+\alpha) } + { R  \over (s+\beta) }  &lt;/math&gt;

for unknown constants ''P'' and ''R''.  To find these constants, we evaluate

:&lt;math&gt;P = \left.{1 \over (s+\beta)}\right|_{s=-\alpha} = {1 \over (\beta - \alpha)} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;R = \left.{1 \over (s+\alpha)}\right|_{s=-\beta} = {1 \over (\alpha - \beta)} = {-1 \over (\beta - \alpha)} = - P . &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these values into the expression for ''H''(''s''), we find

:&lt;math&gt;H(s)  = \left( \frac{1}{\beta-\alpha} \right) \cdot \left(  { 1 \over (s+\alpha) } - { 1  \over (s+\beta) }  \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, using the linearity property and the known transform for exponential decay (see ''Item'' #''3'' in the ''Table of Laplace Transforms'', above), we can take the inverse Laplace transform of ''H''(''s'') to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{H(s)\} = \frac{1}{\beta-\alpha}\left(e^{-\alpha t}-e^{-\beta t}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which is the impulse response of the system.

=== Example #5: Mixing sines, cosines, and exponentials ===

| &lt;math&gt;e^{-\alpha t}\left[ \cos{(\omega t)}+\left(\frac{\beta-\alpha}{\omega}\right)\sin{(\omega t)}\right]u(t) &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{s+\beta}{(s+\alpha)^2+\omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Starting with the Laplace transform

:&lt;math&gt;X(s) = \frac{s+\beta}{(s+\alpha)^2+\omega^2}, &lt;/math&gt;

we find the inverse transform by first adding and subtracting the same constant &amp;alpha; to the numerator:

:&lt;math&gt;X(s) = \frac{s+\alpha } { (s+\alpha)^2+\omega^2}  +   \frac{\beta - \alpha }{(s+\alpha)^2+\omega^2}.  &lt;/math&gt;

By the shift-in-frequency property, we have

:&lt;math&gt; x(t) = e^{-\alpha t} \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{   {s \over s^2 + \omega^2}  +  {  \beta - \alpha \over s^2 + \omega^2  } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; = e^{-\alpha t} \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{   {s \over s^2 + \omega^2}  + \left( {  \beta - \alpha \over \omega } \right) \left( { \omega \over s^2 + \omega^2  } \right) \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; = e^{-\alpha t} \left[  \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{   {s \over s^2 + \omega^2}  \right\}  + \left( {  \beta - \alpha \over \omega } \right) \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{  { \omega \over s^2 + \omega^2  }  \right\}  \right].  &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, using the Laplace transforms for sine and cosine (see the table, above), we have

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)   =  e^{-\alpha t}  \left[ \cos{(\omega t)}u(t)+\left(\frac{\beta-\alpha}{\omega}\right)\sin{(\omega t)}u(t)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)   =  e^{-\alpha t}  \left[ \cos{(\omega t)}+\left(\frac{\beta-\alpha}{\omega}\right)\sin{(\omega t)}\right]u(t).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example #6: Phase delay ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Time function
! Laplace transform
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\sin{(\omega t+\phi)} \ &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{s\sin\phi+\omega \cos\phi}{s^2+\omega^2} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\cos{(\omega t+\phi)} \ &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{s\cos\phi - \omega \sin\phi}{s^2+\omega^2} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Starting with the Laplace transform,

: &lt;math&gt;X(s) = \frac{s\sin\phi+\omega \cos\phi}{s^2+\omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;

we find the inverse by first rearranging terms in the fraction:

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;X(s) \,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; {} = \frac{s \sin \phi}{s^2 + \omega^2} + \frac{\omega \cos \phi}{s^2 + \omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt; {} = (\sin \phi) \left(\frac{s}{s^2 + \omega^2} \right) + (\cos \phi) \left(\frac{\omega}{s^2 + \omega^2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
|}

We are now able to take the inverse Laplace transform of our terms:

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;x(t) \,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; {} = (\sin \phi) \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{s}{s^2 + \omega^2} \right\} + (\cos \phi) \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{\omega}{s^2 + \omega^2} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt; {}=(\sin \phi)(\cos \omega t) + (\sin \omega t)(cos \phi). \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

To simplify this answer, we must recall the [[trigonometric identity]] that

:&lt;math&gt;a \sin \omega t + b \cos \omega t = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} \cdot \sin \left(\omega t + \arctan (b/a) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and apply it to our value for x(''t''):

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;x(t) \,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; {} = \sqrt{\cos^2 \phi + \sin^2 \phi} \cdot \sin \left( \omega t + \arctan \left(\frac{\sin \phi}{\cos \phi} \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt;{}= \sin (\omega t + \phi) . \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

We can apply similar logic to find that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{s\cos\phi - \omega \sin\phi}{s^2+\omega^2} \right\} = \cos{(\omega t+\phi)}. \ &lt;/math&gt;

==History==
From [[1744]], [[Leonhard Euler]] investigated integrals of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; z = \int X(x) e^{ax} dx&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt; z = \int X(x) x^A dx&lt;/math&gt;,

&amp;mdash; as solutions of differential equations but did not pursue the matter very far.&lt;ref&gt;Euler (1744), (1753) and (1769)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] was an admirer of Euler and, in his work on integrating [[probability density function]]s, investigated expressions of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \int X(x) e^{- a x } a^x dx&lt;/math&gt;

&amp;mdash; which some modern historians have interpreted within modern Laplace transform theory.&lt;ref&gt;Lagrange (1773)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grattan-Guiness (1997) ''p.''260&lt;/ref&gt;

These types of integrals seem first to have attracted Laplace's attention in [[1782]] where he was following in the spirit of Euler in using the integrals themselves as solutions of equations.&lt;ref&gt;Grattan-Guiness (1997) ''p.''261&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[1785]], Laplace took the critical step forward when, rather than just look for a solution in the form of an integral, he started to apply the transforms in the sense that was later to become popular. He used an integral of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \int x^s \phi (s) dx&lt;/math&gt;,

&amp;mdash; akin to a [[Mellin transform]], to transform the whole of a [[difference equation]], in order to look for solutions of the transformed equation. He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.&lt;ref&gt;Grattan-Guiness (1997) ''p.''261-262&lt;/ref&gt;

Laplace also recognised that [[Joseph Fourier]]'s method of [[Fourier series]] for solving the [[diffusion equation]] could only apply to a limited region of space as the solutions were periodic. In [[1809]], Laplace applied the eponymous transform to find solutions that diffused indefinitely in space.&lt;ref&gt;Grattan-Guiness (1997) ''p.''262-266&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Subpages}}
'''Weatherization''' (American English) or '''weatherproofing''' (British English) is the practice of protecting a building and its interior from the elements, particularly from sunlight, precipitation, and wind, and of modifying a building to reduce energy consumption and optimize energy efficiency.  A house with no weatherization is virtually uninhabitable.

Weatherization is sometimes confused with, but is distinct from, insulation. However, insulation requires weatherization for proper functioning. Many types of insulation can be thought of as weatherization, because they block drafts or protect from cold winds. Whereas insulation primarily reduces ''conductive'' heat flow, weatherization primarily reduces ''convective'' heat flow.

==Weatherizing your home. Why you should care?==
Buildings use one third of all energy consumed in the United States and two thirds of all electricity. Additionally, they are a major source of the pollution that causes urban air quality problems and pollutants that contribute to climate change. According to [http://www.harc.edu/About/People/Staff/rhaut Dr. Richard Haut], Senior Research Scientist with the Houston Advanced Research Center, buildings account for “49 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25 percent of nitrous oxide emissions, and 10 percent of particulate emissions, all of which damage urban air quality.”

==Weatherization Preparation==
===Evaluating your residence===
Perform a visual survey of the residence, noting any obvious potential evaluation questions:
* Do exterior doors already have weather stripping, and if so, is it in working order?
* Is there mold or rust at the A/C registers?  (May indicate leaky ductwork.)
* Is the water heater wrapped and are exposed pipes insulated?  What is the temperature on the surface of the water heater?
* If the attic is already insulated (fiberglass batts), is it in good condition?  If it is blown-in insulation, has it settled excessively?  Is insulation covering the soffit vents?  
* What type of attic ventilation is present; roof turbines, gable vents, ridge vents, soffit vents?
* Do lights flicker or dim when the HVAC system turns on?  This may be a sign of bad wiring or circuit overload.

===Selecting the right contractor to weatherize your residence===
Selecting the right contractor to weatherize your residence is crucial. Remember it is your money! Homeowners should request contractors to address all significant utility costs in their energy efficiency, conservation and cost reduction proposal.  Contractors should be notified that the homeowner intends to upgrade outdated and obsolete equipment and to perform limited selective improvements.

Ask the tough questions: Check contractor’s references. Discuss the contractor’s experience with energy efficiency and conservation retrofit of residential homes. Ask the contractor to provide you with a list of references indicating experience in conducting comprehensive utility efficiency and guaranteed savings for residential homes of a similar nature to your residence.  

Request from the contractor a guaranteed annual utility savings, clearly identifying each type of savings (utility, operational, and cost avoidance). Request the anticipated return on investment (ROI)? You decide, not the contractor, what is economically feasible and what is not.

Once selected, the successful contractor should provide all services necessary to implement energy efficiency conservation and cost savings measures including but not limited to the following: assess and verify existing conditions; issue energy audits for the residence, review and verify applicable design standards requirements; provide drawings and specifications; provide permitting services; and provide estimated construction costs.

The homeowner should anticipate a major reduction in annual utility and operating costs through the implementation of this energy efficiency and utility conservation effort. Therefore, the contractor’s proposal should contain a sample of his/her written guarantee applicable for all utility reductions. The proposal must include clear instructions on how the guarantee calculation is derived specifically for the residence in question. 

Going to the next level! 
Weatherization contractors should provide a detailed work plan that includes the following:

Solutions to reduce energy consumption of the residence and provide an estimate of the savings expressed as a percentage.  Solutions should clearly demonstrate creativity and innovation in a holistic manner and may include but not be limited to; heating and central cooling systems, insulation, lighting, intelligent controls, operational practices, and others.

Homeowners should demand that the contractor provide creative and innovative cost-effective solutions to make the residence more self-sustaining, including features such as but not limited to: renewable energy systems (solar, wind), recapture systems, and others.
Incorporate leading proven, commercially viable technology as part of the solutions design process to increase energy savings performance and reduce costs, possible examples could be but should not be limited to LED lighting, intelligent controls, etc.

A Measurement and Verification Plan, which clearly explains the process, procedures, controls and degree to which third party verification is a possibility.

==Overview of weatherization procedures==
Typical weatherization procedures include:
* Sealing bypasses (cracks, gaps, holes), especially around doors, windows, pipes that penetrate the attic ceiling, and other areas with high potential for heat loss, using caulk, foam sealant, weather-stripping, window film, door sweeps, electrical receptacle gaskets, and so on to reduce infiltration.
* Protecting pipes from corrosion and freezing.
* Installing footing drains, foundation waterproofing membranes, interior perimeter drains, sump pump, gutters, downspout extensions, downward-sloping grading, French drains, swales, and other techniques to protect a building from both surface water and ground water.
* Providing proper ventilation to unconditioned spaces to protect a building from the effects of condensation.
* Installing roofing, building wrap, and siding, or making sure they are in good condition on an existing building.
* Installing insulation in walls, floors, and ceilings, around ducts and pipes, around water heaters, and near the foundation and sill.
* Installing storm doors and storm windows.
* Replacing old drafty doors with tightly sealing, foam-core doors.
* Replacing older windows with low-energy, double-glazed windows.

Sometimes, people use the phrase &quot;whole-house weatherization&quot;.  This extends the traditional definition of weatherization to include installation of modern, energy-saving heating and cooling equipment, or repair of old, inefficient equipment (furnaces, boilers, water heaters, programmable thermostats, air conditioners, and so on).  The &quot;Whole-House&quot; approach also looks at how the house performs as a system.  

The practice of installing a vapor barrier inside the house has more to do with protecting the house from itself (its own internal moisture and temperature differences) than with protecting the house from the elements, therefore, vapor barriers are not technically weatherization.  However, you should understand the concept of vapor barriers before installing insulation or siding, or altering the ventilation in your house.  Some houses do not need vapor barriers (depending on climate, type of insulation, amount of conditioned space within house, and so on).

== Sealing bypasses ==
A bypass is any crack, gap, or hole that allows conditioned air to leak between your home’s conditioned and unconditioned space.  This includes, for example, warm air escaping from the living area into an unheated attic, or cold air entering the living area from the basement or from the outdoors.  You should focus your attention at the points where the conditioned space in your house meets unconditioned space.  It doesn't matter if there are bypasses between two heated rooms.

Loose-fill, batt, blanket, and open-cell foam insulation will not stop air from flowing through bypasses.  If you don’t seal bypasses, the insulation will only filter the warm air as it escapes into the attic, resulting in dirty smudges on the insulation.

Having bypasses:
* Puts moisture into the attic, where it condenses and causes damage.
* Allows insects, spiders, and small rodents to enter the house, travel between floors, and travel between rooms.
* Wastes energy and money.  If you seal as many bypasses as possible, your house will need less insulation, because the house will be doing much of the insulating itself by preventing convective heat loss.

If you are lucky enough to buy a house that is still under construction, you can take steps to make sure the house is as tight as possible.  In the case of bypasses that pass through the foundation and exterior walls, you should, if possible, seal the bypass from both the inside and the outside before the contractor backfills.  On the inside of the house, seal bypasses after the ducts, pipes, and wires are installed, but before insulation is installed.  Going back to find and seal the bypasses is extremely difficult and costly once the contractor has installed insulation, seals up the walls, and installs floorboards.

If you buy a house that was built a long time ago, and if you feel drafts in the house, you can sometimes locate the source of the drafts with a candle.  Light a candle, put the candle down in different spots in your house, step away, remain as motionless as possible, and see if the flame distorts to one side.

Materials to use for sealing cracks, gaps, and bypasses:
* Caulk.  (Pick the type of caulk that is appropriate for what you are doing.  For example, use swimming pool caulk to seal bypasses in the concrete foundation.  Alternatively, you could use hydraulic cement or an expansive mortar.)
* Putty or hydraulic cement, for big holes.
* Closed-cell foam, such as “Great Stuff” - especially good for rough, irregular holes, narrow gaps, and difficult-to-reach areas such as sill plate.  If you’re not sure if a foam is closed-cell, check the manufacturer’s website.  For example, from Dow Chemical’s website:
''&quot;Latex foams are typically “open celled” and, as a result, can take on water. In fact, the same properties that allow you to wash latex foam off your hands with water also mean that the cured foam can absorb water. This can cause wood rot or deterioration in areas where wet latex foam is next to wood, such as a window frame. In contrast, GREAT STUFF is closed-cell foam. It forms a water-resistant outer coating when cured.&quot;''
* Sheet metal and furnace cement, or Roxul [http://www.roxul.com] products, for sealing around fluepipes.  If you’re not sure how to do this safely, check your local fire codes.
* Rigid foam insulation or gypsum board, cut to fit, for sealing large gaping holes.  Caulk around edge.  Cover the rigid foam with gypsum board if it is in an exposed location, to protect from toxic fumes in the event of a fire.
* Electrical receptacle and light switch insulating gaskets, designed to fit in between the electrical box and cover plate.
* Holes in electrical boxes, and drafty oversized holes through fire-rated walls (i.e., for sprinkler pipes or wiring conduit) can be sealed with intumescent (fire stop) caulking or putty.

Where to look for bypasses:
* In a home with an unheated attic, you should start looking for and sealing bypasses between the living area and the attic.  Most of the heat that you are losing is probably escaping through the ceiling, because hot air rises.  Look for gaps around the fireplace chimney, furnace fluepipe, and vent pipes that extend through the attic, and seal any gaps that you find.
* To protect from fire, don’t pile insulation against fan motors and non-IC-rated recessed lights.
* Don’t forget to seal and weather-strip the attic access door or hatch (usually in the form of pull-down stairs).  An enormous amount of heat can escape through gaps around this door.
* After focusing on the attic, the next most important place to look is around exterior doors and windows.  Be sure to check between the exterior window trim and the siding (especially where the siding butts against the corner of the trim).
* Apply caulk and spray foam, and then install weather-stripping on the bottom, sides, and tops of doors and windows.  There are many types of weather-stripping, including rubber strips, foam strips, vinyl tubular gaskets, and metal spring-type weather-stripping.  Choose whichever one(s) you think are most appropriate.
* While you’re outside, seal any other gaps in the siding, especially around outdoor electrical receptacles, hose bibbs, and points where walls meet.
* If your house is made of brick or stone, or if you have a chimney, check for gaps, and repoint with mortar, if necessary.
* Now go into the basement and seal the sill plate (where the basement ceiling meets the foundation wall) if it hasn’t been sealed already.  Seal around all pipes and conduits that pass through the foundation wall.  Seal any cracks between concrete blocks.  Seal around any pipes, conduits, wires, or cables that pass between floors.
* Finally, go back upstairs, and seal any gaps around electrical outlets and switch boxes, and around any pipes or ducts that pass through floors, walls, or ceilings.  Be especially attentive under sinks in the kitchen and the bathroom.
* Sometimes, pipes are hidden behind access panels for safety or cosmetic reasons.
* Don't forget to check for roof damage.  For example, patch holes with roofing cement.
* Now and then, check if the sealants have dried up and stopped sealing the gaps properly.  Reapply as necessary.

After you seal all of the bypasses that you possibly can, make sure that your house is not ''too'' tight.  A house without sufficient ventilation will trap moisture, odors, chemicals, dust, and microbes (such as bacteria and fungi spores).  You lose some money paying for heat and air-conditioning, but that is the price you pay for not breathing stale, unhealthy air.  Open some windows, operate the whole-house fan, install energy-efficient mechanical ventilation [http://oikos.com/library/energy_outlet/hrv.html], or install more ventilation, if necessary.

==Water and Freeze Protection==
=== Freeze protection ===
House features that are vulnerable to freezing:
* Fuel line of external oil tank.
* External hose bibbs, especially if they are dripping and the water supply was not turned off in autumn.
* Pipes along outside walls.
* Pipes traversing uninsulated spaces.

Ways to prevent fuel line and plumbing fixtures from freezing:
* Drain outside hose bibbs and turn off water supply before cold weather comes.
* In an emergency, provide temporary insulation - anything from leaves, to hay bales, to sheets of plywood, to a homemade shed.
* Install electric heat wrap on the pipes.
* Replace regular hose bibbs with “freeze-proof” hose bibbs.
* Move the oil tank inside.

Make sure to protect water pipes in unconditioned areas from freezing during the winter!  There should be no problems with pipes that are in the basement, and are nearby a basement furnace, and are away from any holes in the foundation that may allow outside air currents to blow direct on them.

=== Drainage (preventing soil saturation) ===
Reasons for water in the basement:
* Saturated backfill (the most common reason).  Soil saturation causes hydrostatic pressure.  The pressure of the water forces the water through the foundation walls and slab floor (either through cracks, around the edges, or directly through the porous concrete).  This shows up as persistent seepage.
* Blocked footing drains.
* High water table.
* Condensation of interior humidity.

The key to a dry basement is to control surface water as well as ground water.  The way to tell surface water and ground water apart is that surface water shows up in one area of the basement, whereas ground water (from a rising aquifer) usually comes up everywhere all at once, and leaves uniformly as well.  Often, with groundwater problems, the water doesn't come up until after it has stopped raining.

Saturated backfill causes most of the water problems in houses.  Effects of soil saturation around the perimeter of the foundation:
* Saturated backfill can freeze, lifting the foundation wall and cracking the slab.  This is called frost heaving.
* Gutter downspouts that drain too close to the foundation can undermine footings.  Parts of the house could shift out of place.
* Moisture that enters the basement can cause all kinds of problems elsewhere in the house, even in the attic, such as warped wood, mold, rot, and peeling paint.

General drainage advice:
* Don't use black flexible corrugated pipe for drainage.  This clogs easily, doesn’t allow water to flow freely, and is weak and flimsy.  Instead, use some type of PVC.
* The best drainage material is crushed stone, especially if the pieces are relatively flat, such as with crushed shale.  Pieces of crushed limestone are often irregular in shape, rather than flat.  Do not use gravel, rounded river pebbles, item 4, or QP (quarry product) for drainage.

Ways to prevent soil saturation around your house:
* Install swales (trenches) and French drains (trenches containing slotted PVC pipe and crushed stone, underneath a driveway, for example) to intercept surface water long before it comes close to the house.
* Install footing drains using schedule 40 slotted PVC pipe, with the holes facing downward.  Filter out silt by wrapping the footing drain with crushed stone, surrounded with filter fabric, surrounded with sand.  Make sure the footing drains stay unclogged.  Ideally, footing drains should have one or more cleanouts on the surface, and should open to daylight somewhere downhill from the foundation.  Footing drains are much easier to install when a house is being built than after the house is built.
* Make sure any pipes entering the house below grade are set in impermeable soil such as tightly-compacted, &quot;hardpan&quot; clay (not sand) where they meet the foundation.
* The soil or material against the lower part of a foundation should have high percolability, and should have a way for water to flow away from the foundation, such as footing drains leading downhill.  Ideally, you should have crushed stone against the lower part of the foundation with crushed stone and footing drains extending downhill from there.  The worst type of soil to have against the lower part of a foundation is high-clay soil, because it holds water, stays saturated for long periods of time. When that soil is saturated, it tends to cause foundations to shift, crack, and buckle inward.
* Correct settled backfill, which directs surface water towards the foundation.  Instead, slope the soil away from the foundation.  The soil that is on the surface around the foundation is called grading soil.  The grading soil, unlike the soil against the lower part of a foundation, should be high in clay, tightly compacted, and at least 6 inches thick.  Such soil is virtually impermeable to water, directs water away from the foundation, and allows air to easily pull moisture out of the soil during hot, dry weather.  You can compact the soil yourself with a tamper.  Make sure you compact the soil, or it will absorb and hold moisture, exactly what you don’t want.
* Do not plant large, deep-rooted shrubs within 4 feet of the foundation.  Do not plant trees anywhere near the foundation.
* Water plants near the foundation early in the day, so that the soil has time to dry off before the water sinks too deep and lingers against the foundation.
* Remove tree roots near the foundation, which provide channels for water.
* Slope window wells away from the house, install bubbles over them to prevent water from collecting, or eliminate them.
* If your house has no gutters and downspouts, install them, and keep them clean and free of clogs.  Repair any holes, cracks, or other damage.  If the downspouts detach from the gutters, reconnect them promptly, using sheet metal screws.
* Don't use louvers to disperse water (so-called &quot;clog-proof gutters&quot;).  They are the equivalent of having no gutters at all.
* Do not allow gutters to drain against the foundation.  Instead, install downspout extensions and connect them to 4-inch PVC that is buried underground, slopes downward, directs water at least 10 feet away from the foundation, and either opens to daylight or connects to a storm drain.
* Do not tie gutters into footing drains!  They will both clog.
* You can tie gutters into French drains, but don't forget to install clean-outs in French drains.  Check for clogs regularly.
* Don’t install screens over the gutters or wire baskets in the downspouts.  All they do is clog up the gutters.
* Repair cracks or holes in the interior foundation wall with swimming pool caulk, hydraulic cement, or an expansive mortar.  Do not use &quot;waterproofing&quot; paints, vapor barrier]] paints, or moisture sealants on the interior foundation wall.  Hydrostatic pressure will build up and water will find its way through the weakest spots, causing the paint or sealant to flake and peel, and causing disintegration of the underlying concrete block.
* If nothing else works, install an interior perimeter drain, also known as a &quot;dewatering&quot; or &quot;pickup&quot; system.  This channels water, usually towards a sump pump, and is therefore usually dependent on electric power for continued proper functioning.  Do not connect interior perimeter drains into the exterior footing drains – this could undermine the footings.  You should never increase the amount of water next to your footings.

=== Sources and effects of water in a house ===
Water causes more damage to houses than anything else.  The most important tasks in maintaining a house all involve protecting the house from the effects of water.

Paradoxically, water vapor from damp basements causes most attic problems.

Water vapor turns to liquid water when it reaches the dew point.  Humid air reaches the dew point more easily than dry air.

Sources of moisture in homes:
* Dirt floor basements and crawlspaces.
* Saturated backfill, which causes seepage through foundation.
* Wicking through concrete slabs in the basement or crawlspace.
* Showers.
* Clothes dryers.
* Kitchen appliances.
* Leaking or dripping pipes (supply pipes as well as drain pipes) and fixtures.
* Leaks in roof, often near vents, pipes, or skylights, resulting from corroded, damaged, or missing flashing or shingles.
* Leaks resulting from damaged siding.

Harmful effects of moisture in a house, especially if the ventilation is poor:
* Warped wood.  (Wood absorbs moisture and swells.)
* Mold.
* Rot.  (Wood consistently kept at a high humidity will rot, as will wood touching the dirt for long periods of time.  There are many different types of rot.  Most are destructive.  Even the presence of non-destructive types of rot can indicate conditions that are favorable to destructive forms of rot.) 
* So much water can condense in the attic that it starts leaking through to the ceiling below, as if the roof were leaking.
* Ice dams and roof leaks.
* Soaked, compacted, ineffective insulation (resulting from roof leaks, or from condensation within the walls).  Moisture passing through insulation will often appear as condensation on the outer, cooler edges of the insulation.  Eventually, if enough moisture condenses, the water will drip down and soak the rest of the insulation.
* Moisture pushing through from the inside can cause blistered, chipped, cracked, peeling, and stained paint or siding, and popped nails, on the outside of the house.  (External temperature and humidity conditions can also cause these symptoms, but excessive internal moisture drastically hastens their appearance.)
* Termites and other insects.
* Clammy feeling in the cooler months, muggy feeling in the warmer months.
* When combined with excessive heat in the attic, excessive moisture can shorten the life of roofing shingles.

== Ventilation ==
See [[w:HVAC|HVAC]].  Also be aware that poor attic ventilation, combined with poor insulation, can create an ice dam.

==Roofs==
=== Roofing tips ===
Miscellaneous advice on choosing shingles and roofing material:
* If you choose to install a roof with asphalt shingles, be sure to buy fiberglass asphalt shingles.  They are stronger and more durable than regular asphalt shingles.
* If you install a metal roof, you must install some kind of lightning protection, and you will need to remove or isolate all other metal protrusions to prevent the dissimilar metals from corroding each other.  If damage occurs, you can solder a piece of metal to a steel roof, whereas, with an aluminum roof, you have to use mesh and roofing cement.
* The advantage of tile roofs is that they stay cool in hot weather.  They are not appropriate in cold climates, because they are not designed to handle snow and ice well.
* If your roof has a low slope, you should install a rubberized ice-shield membrane almost all the way to the ridge of the roof.

Advantages of wood shakes and shingles:
* Shed water well.
* Insulate from heat and cold more effectively than asphalt shingles.

Disadvantages:
* Flammable.
* Susceptible to the effects of trapped moisture (mold, rot, insects) when items fall on the roof (sticks, leaves).
* Not appropriate on a low-slope roof.

Before installing a new roof, check the roof sheathing for rot, both on the exterior surface (the decking) and the interior surface (in the attic).  Don’t just replace rotten sheathing.  Also find out why the sheathing rotted in the first place.  Do not install a new roof until you have solved all moisture problems.

To protect the fascia boards from rot:
* Always install a metal drip edge.
* Overlap the eaves with a few inches of roofing material.

Use roofing cement to seal around nail holes and damaged spots in the roof.

=== Flashing ===
Flashing is a sheet or molded form, made of copper, aluminum, or plastic, that seals the parts of a roof where chimneys, vents, skylights, and other things penetrate or break up the roof surface.  Repair holes in flashing with roofing cement.  There are many different types of flashing:
* Install step flashing where the roof meets a wall.  The correct way to install step flashing:  Shingle, flashing, shingle, flashing, shingle, flashing, and so on, until you have wrapped around the top edge of whatever you are trying to direct water away from.
* Install “formed flashing” over ventilation pipes in the roof.  These consist of molded plastic with a rubber collar that seals around the pipe.
* The best solution for the valleys of a roof is copper W-flashing.
* Flashing a chimney and the roof next to the chimney is somewhat complicated, involving base flashing, step flashing, and counterflashing (which seals other flashing).  You insert counterflashing into a mortar joint in the chimney and secure it with mortar.  The procedure for properly flashing a chimney is difficult to describe; refer to a roofing manual or roofing website.
* You can also create a “cricket” (a built-up ridge constructed with lumber and shingles) on the uphill side of the chimney) to deflect water and snow away from the chimney.

=== Skylights ===
Skylights can warm the house, by allowing more sunlight to come in, and can cool the house, if they are the type that you can open.  Solar tubes are similar to skylights, in that they allow more sunlight to come in, but they do so differently, by collecting the light in a tube and sending it to a diffuser.  Make sure flashing is installed properly around skylights and solar tubes.  If you install a skylight, only install a high-quality one with an integral frame.  Plastic bubble skylights tend to leak because the seam between the roof and the bubble expands and contracts over time.  Pre-framed skylights are built to accommodate this expansion and contraction without leaking.

Houses in cold climates should have a narrow overhang to allow in more sunlight.  Houses in warm and wet climates, on the other hand, should have a wide overhang.

=== Roof drain plane ===
If you have a relatively steep roof with few valleys, you should install a drain plane.  A drain plane is a gap that you create between the roof sheathing or rigid panel roof insulation and the exterior roof surface.  Functions of a drain plane on a roof:
* Allows any stray water or condensation to drain out from underneath the exterior roof surface.
* Provides ventilation to allow the back of the exterior roof surface to dry (especially important with wood shakes and shingles).
* Extends the life of the roof by keeping it cool and dry.
* Allows moisture forcing its way out from the interior of the house to evaporate quickly.

=== Roof insulation ===
If they do not already exist, you should add rigid closed-cell foam panels between the roof sheathing and exterior roof surface.  You may need to modify skylights to match the new thickness of the insulation and roof.

Advantages of adding rigid closed-cell foam between roof sheathing and exterior roof surface:
* Thermally insulates attic ceiling.  If you install foil-faced rigid foam panels, you will also block radiative heat transfer.  If you install enough rigid panels, you may not need to put any insulation between the rafters.
* Resists air infiltration (and therefore, convective heat transfer) between interior and outdoors.
* Prevents condensation from forming in the rafters by keeping the temperature and humidity between the rafters similar to that in the rest of the attic.

In the attic, you should install expanding closed-cell spray foam against the interior side of the sheathing, and between the rafters, before installing (fire-rated) drywall.  (If fiberglass batts exist, remove them.)  Advantages of closed-cell spray foam between the rafters:
* They keep the temperature and humidity between the rafters similar to that in the rest of the attic.
* You don't need a separate vapor barrier.  Closed-cell spray foam is virtually impermeable to moisture, and acts as its own vapor barrier, preventing moisture from condensing on the sheathing or rafters.  You no longer have to concern yourself with moist air leaking into the attic and condensing on the sheathing and rafters.

Once you insulate the attic with rigid panels on the exterior of the sheathing, spray foam on the interior of the sheathing, and some type of insulation in the walls, you can treat your attic as part of the conditioned space of the house.  In other words, you can allow the attic to warm up in the winter, and you can more easily keep the attic cool in the summer.  You will most likely not be heating your attic directly -- the attic will draw heat escaping from the floors below.  You no longer have to struggle to keep the attic cold and well-ventilated in the winter at the same time that you are turning the furnace up to keep your living space warm.  You can insulate the floor of the attic, but since the attic is part of the conditioned space, it is not necessary.

==Walls==
=== Building wrap ===
A building wrap or air retarder cuts drafts and seepage that creep through exteriors, especially at corners and around windows and doors, but allows moisture to pass through, allowing the house to breathe (similar to Gore-Tex).  Building wraps do not insulate much, but they block conditioned interior air from escaping, and block unconditioned outdoor air from creeping in, especially on windy days.  Thus, they reduce heat transfer, keep the house more comfortable, and save energy.

Building wrap is sometimes confused with vapor barriers.

Building wraps have permeability ratings of 5.0 or higher, to block air, but allow moisture to escape from the wall cavities.  The higher the perm rating, the more moisture can pass through.  Do not use asphalt felt paper or tar paper as building wrap.  Asphalt felt paper has a permeability rating of approximately 1.0, so it traps moisture against the sheathing (not very well, but well enough to cause problems).

Materials used as building wrap:
* Tyvek, 6 mil or greater in thickness.

How and where to install building wrap:
* On exterior of house, between sheathing and siding (including brick and stone).  Staple to sheathing with 2-inch overlap on top, and 6-inch overlap on sides.
* Cut house wrap into framed openings for doors and windows, and tuck back and staple excess against side of framing.  You can also use rigid closed-cell foam under the windowsill when installing a window.
* You don’t need to put building wrap against exposed parts of the foundation wall, because concrete does not allow drafts to pass through (as long as there are no bypasses), concrete does not rot, and concrete is porous, so any trapped moisture will eventually find its way out.

When replacing siding, you should add building wrap and insulation if they do not already exist.  You install the building wrap onto the sheathing first, then install the insulation over the building wrap.

=== Siding ===
When installing or replacing siding:
* Don't bury problems under new siding.  If sheathing is rotted in one area, find out why, and fix the sheathing as well as the cause of the rot.
* Always overlap siding around obstructions, so that water will not find its way in.
* Use corner boards to protect the corners of the house where siding tends to leak.
* Be aware that some vinyl siding can be insulated from behind with molded panels called backer boards.
* If you choose wood siding, apply primer to the backside of wood siding before you install it to the sheathing.  Use paint, stain, or clear sealant to protect wood siding once it is installed.  Stain is preferable, because moisture entering the wall from the inside can push paint off the wall, but can seep through stain causing only fading and weathering.
* If they do not already exist, you should add building wrap and rigid closed-cell foam panels between the sheathing and the siding.  You attach the building wrap to the sheathing, then install the insulation over the building wrap.  You may need to build out window casings to match the new thickness of the insulation and siding.

Advantages of adding rigid closed-cell foam between sheathing and siding:
* Thermally insulates wall.  If you install foil-faced rigid foam panels, you will also block radiative heat transfer.  If you install enough rigid panels, you may not need to put any insulation in the wall cavity.
* Resists air infiltration (and therefore, convective heat transfer) between interior and outdoors.
* Prevents condensation from forming in the wall cavity by keeping the temperature and humidity in the wall cavity similar to that in the interior of the house.

Do not put a vapor barrier in between the sheathing and siding.  Vapor barriers belong on the interior side of walls.

=== Siding drain plane ===
You should install a drain plane on all walls.  A '''drain plane''' is a gap that you create between the insulation, building wrap, and sheathing and the exterior siding.  You create this gap by installing furring strips or plastic mesh to hold the siding off the wall.

Functions of drain plane:
* Prevents water from entering the wall from the outside.
* Helps prevent mold from growing in cellulose insulation.
* Allows any stray water or condensation to drain out.
* Provides air circulation to allow the back of the siding to dry (especially important with wood siding).
* Extends the life of the siding by keeping it cool and dry.
* Increases paint retention, since moisture will no longer force its way out through the paint.

=== Insulation ===
See Building insulation.

== Installing or replacing doors and windows ==
When choosing new doors and windows:
* Replace solid core external doors with metal-clad, foam-core doors or fiberglass doors.
* Replace drafty single-glazed windows with efficient, low-E, double-glazed, insulated windows.  Krypton is more insulating than argon, but windows with krypton cost more.
* Avoid metal-framed windows.  Replace steel or aluminum windows with a wood, vinyl, or fiberglass windows.  If you must buy a metal-framed window for some specific reason, make sure that there is a thermal break separating the inner half from the outer half.
* If you can't afford new double-glazed windows, keep your existing windows, and install year-round storm windows on the outside.  You can open them and insert a bug screen in the warmer months.  Alternatively, you can shrink-wrap polyethylene on the windows in the colder months with a hair dryer to trap air, you can install low-E film on the window panes, or you can install an &quot;interior insulating window&quot;.
* In the attic, install double-glazed windows with built-in venting around the frame, so that you can close the windows in cold weather without stopping air from flowing through the attic.

When installing new doors and windows:
* Seal the gap between the window casing or nailing flange and the sheathing by applying a bead of exterior-grade caulk before attaching the window to the framing studs.
* Seal the gap between the window or door framing and the framing studs (the rough opening).
* Make sure new windows and doors have drip caps (flashing) above them to keep water away.  If there are no drip caps, install them while installing the windows or doors.
* Be aware that all multi-pane windows will eventually lose their air-tight seal.  Fog that appears on the interior of the window (between the layers of glazing) is an indication of leakage.

==US Weatherization Assistance Program==
Weatherization has become increasingly high-profile as the cost of home heating has risen. Fortunately, there are programs available to help low income families reduce energy consumption and costs.  

The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) was created in 1976 to assist low-income families who lacked resources to invest in energy efficiency. WAP is operated in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and works with Native American tribes. The funds provided by Congress are used to improve the energy efficiency of low-income dwellings using the most advanced technologies and testing protocols available in the housing industry. The energy conservation resulting from the efforts of state and local agencies helps our country reduce its dependency on foreign oil and decrease the cost of energy for families in need, while improving the health and safety of their homes. 

The WAP is governed by various federal regulations designed to help manage and account for the resources provided by DOE. WAP funding is derived from annual appropriations from Congress. Each year Senate and House Interior Appropriations committees decide how much will be allocated. 

Since the inception of the WAP, over 5.6 million homes have been weatherized with DOE funds. This year, an estimated 93,408 homes will be weatherized with Department of Energy (DOE) funds. An average of 30.5 million MBtu of energy is saved as a result of weatherization. This equates to a 23% reduction in primary heating fuel use. Low-income families will save an average of $358 in reduced first-year energy costs, at current prices. Taken together, for every $1 invested in the Program, Weatherization returns $2.69 in energy and non-energy related benefits.  

Many state LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance) programs work side by side with WAP to provide both immediate and long term solutions to energy poverty.

The simple definition of '''computer forensics''' &lt;blockquote&gt;
''... is the art and science of applying computer science to aid the legal process.  Although plenty of science is attributable to computer forensics, most successful investigators possess a nose for investigations and a skill for solving puzzles, which is where the art comes in.
- Chris L.T. Brown, Computer Evidence Collection and Preservation, 2006''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   Thus, it is more than the technological, systematic inspection of the computer system and its contents for evidence or supportive evidence of a civil wrong or a criminal act.  Computer forensics requires specialized expertise and tools that goes above and beyond the normal data collection and preservation techniques available to end-users or system support personnel.  One definition is analogous to &quot;Electronic Evidentiary Recovery, known also as e-discovery, requires the proper tools and knowledge to meet the Court's criteria, whereas Computer Forensics is simply the application of computer investigation and analysis techniques in the interests of determining potential legal evidence.&quot;[http://www.computerlegalexperts.com/ComputerExpertWitnessandComputerForensicServicesandFeeSchedule.html] Another is &quot;a process to answer questions about digital states and events&quot;[http://www.digital-evidence.org/di_basics.html].  This process often involves the  investigation and examination computer system(s), including, but not limitied to the data acquisition that resides on the media within the computer.  The forensic examiner renders an opinion, based upon the examination of the material that has been recovered.  After rendering an opinion and report,  to determine whether they are or have been used for criminal, civil or unauthorized activities. Mostly, computer forensics experts investigate data storage devices, these include but are not limited to hard drives, portable data devices (USB Drives, External drives, Micro Drives and many more). Computer forensics experts:

#Identify sources of [[documentary evidence|documentary]] or other [[digital evidence|digital]] [[evidence (law)|evidence]].
#Preserve the evidence.
#Analyze the evidence.
#Present the findings.
Computer forensics is done in a fashion that adheres to the [[Federal Rules of Evidence|standards of evidence]] that are admissible in a [[court of law]]. Thus, computer forensics must be techno-legal in nature rather than purely technical or purely legal. Refer to ''[http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/s&amp;smanual2002.htm Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations]'' for the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] requirements for '''Computer Forensices''' and electronic evidence processing. 

==Understand the suspects==
It is absolutely vital for the forensics team to have a solid understanding of the level of sophistication of the suspect(s).  If insufficient information is available to form this opinion, the suspects ''must be considered to be experts'', and should be presumed to have installed countermeasures against forensic techniques.  Because of this, it is critical that you appear to the equipment to be as indistinguishable as possible from its normal users until you have shut it down completely, either in a manner which probably prohibits the machine modifying the drives, or in exactly the same way they would.

If the equipment contains only a small amount of critical data on the hard drive, for example, software exists to wipe it permanently and quickly if a given action occurs. It is straightforward to link this to the [[Microsoft Windows]] &quot;Shutdown&quot; command, for example.  However, simply &quot;pulling the plug&quot; isn't always a great idea, either-- information stored solely in [[Random access memory|RAM]], or on special peripherals, may be permanently lost.  Losing an [[key (cryptography)|encryption key]] stored solely in Random Access Memory, and possibly unknown even to the suspects themselves by virtue of having been automatically generated, may render a great deal of data on the hard drive(s) unusable, or at least extremely expensive and time-consuming to recover.

==Electronic evidence considerations==

Electronic evidence can be collected from a variety of sources. Within a company’s network, evidence will be found in any form of [[technology]] that can be used to transmit or store data. Evidence should be collected through three parts of an offender’s network: at the workstation of the offender, on the [[Server (computing)|server]] accessed by the [[offender]], and on the network that connects the two. Investigators can therefore use three different sources to confirm of the [[data]]’s origin.

Like any other piece of evidence used in a case, the information generated as the result of a computer forensics investigation must follow the [[Federal Rules of Evidence|standards of admissible evidence]].  Special care must be taken when handling a suspect’s files; dangers to the evidence include [[Computer virus|viruses]], [[electromagnetic]] or mechanical damage, and even [[Computer forensics#Inspect for traps|booby traps]].  There are a handful of cardinal rules that are used to ensure that the evidence is not destroyed or compromised:
#Only use tools and methods that have been tested and evaluated to validate their accuracy and reliability.
In order to verify that a tool is forensically sound, the tool should be tested in a mock forensic examination to verify the tool's performance.  There are government agencies such as the [http://www.dc3.mil/dcci/form10.htm Defense Cyber Crime Institute] that accept requests to test specific digital forensic tools and methods for governmental agencies, law enforcement organizations, or vendors of digital forensic products at no cost to the requestor.
#Handle the original evidence as little as possible to avoid changing the data.
#Establish and maintain the chain of custody.
#Document everything done.
#Never exceed personal knowledge.
If such steps are not followed the original data may be changed, ruined or become tainted, and so any results generated will be challenged and may not hold up in a [[court of law]].  Other things to take into consideration are:
#The time that business operations are inconvenienced.
#How sensitive information which is unintentionally discovered will be handled.
In any investigation in which the owner of the digital evidence has not given consent to have his or her media examined – as in most criminal cases – special care must be taken to ensure that you as the forensic specialist have legal authority to seize, image, and examine each device.  Besides having the case thrown out of court, the examiner may find him or herself on the wrong end of a hefty civil lawsuit.  As a general rule, if you aren't sure about a specific piece of media, do not examine it.  Amateur forensic examiners should keep this in mind before starting any unauthorized investigation.

Some of the most valuable information obtained in the course of a forensic examination will come from the computer user themself.  In accordance with applicable laws, statutes, organizational policies, and other applicable regulations, an interview of the computer user can often yield invaluable information regarding the system configuration, applications, and most important, software or hardware encryption methodology and keys utilized with the computer.  Forensic analysis can become exponentially easier when analysts have passphrase(s) utilized by the user open encrypted files or containers used on the local computer system, or on systems mapped to the local computer through a local network or the internet.

==Secure the machine and the data==
Unless completely unavoidable, data should never be analyzed using the same machine it is collected from.  Instead, forensically sound copies of all data storage devices, primarily [[hard drive]]s, must be made.  Exceptional consideration to this practice are detailed below regarding live system considerations.

To ensure that the machine can be analyzed as completely as possible, the following sequence of steps must be followed:

===Examine the machine's surroundings===
[[Image:USB flash drive.jpg|100px|thumb|A USB keydrive]]
[[Image:Xd-memory-card-comparison.jpg|100px|thumb|XD Picture Card]]
[[Image:Secure Digital 16Mb card.jpg|thumb|100px|Secure Digital card]]

The collection phase starts off with the computer forensic team analyzing its surroundings. Similar to [[police]] investigating a crime in any other case, all printouts, disks, notes, and other physical evidence must be collected to take back to the [[laboratory]] for analysis. Furthermore, an investigating team must take [[digital photograph]]s of the surrounding environment before any of the hardware is dealt with. This initial collection phase sets the tone for the rest of the investigation and therefore the evidence must be locked away securely, with limited access granted to authorized team members only.

Look for notes, concealed or in plain view, that may contain passwords or security instructions. Secure any recordable media, including music mixes. Also look for removable storage devices such as [[USB flash drive|keydrive]]s, [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]] or [[security token]]s. See [[:Category:Solid-state computer storage media]].

===Examine the Live System and record open applications===
If the machine is still active, any intelligence which can be gained by examining the applications currently open should be recorded. If the machine is suspected of being used for illegal communications, such as terrorist traffic, not all of this information may be stored on the hard drive.  If information stored solely in [[Random access memory|RAM]] is not recovered before powering down it may be lost, so acquiring the data while the RAM is still powered is a priority.  For most practical purposes, it is not possible to completely scan contents of RAM modules in a running computer. Though specialized hardware could do this, the computer may have been modified to detect chassis intrusion (some [[Dell Computer|Dell machines]], for example, can do this stock; software need only monitor for it) and removing the cover could cause the system to dump the contents.  Ideally, prior intelligence or surveillance will indicate what action should be taken to avoid losing this information. 

Several Open Source tools are available to conduct an analysis of open ports, mapped drives (including through an active VPN connection), and of significant importance, open or mounted encrypted files (containers) on the live computer system.  Additionally, through Microsoft's implementation of the [[Encrypted filesystem|Encrypted File System]] (EFS), once a system is powered down, the difficulty to examine previously mounted EFS files and directory structures is substantially increased.  Utilizing open source tools and commercially available products, it is possible to obtain an image of these mapped drives and the open encrypted containers in an unencrypted format.  For Windows based systems, these Open Source tools include [[Knoppix]] and [[Helix (distro)|Helix]].  Commercial imaging tools include Access Data's Forensic Tool Kit and Guidance Software's [[EnCase]] application.  Both companies make available their imaging tools for free; however, in order to analyze the data imaged using these tools you will need to purchase a full licensed version of the application.

The aforementioned Open Source tools can also scan RAM and Registry information to show recently accessed web-based email sites and the login/password combination used.  Additionally these tools can also yield login/password for recently access local email applications including MS Outlook.

With MS most recent addition, Vista, and Vista's use of BitLocker and the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), the importance of developing procedures for examining and imaging live (mounted unencrypted) systems is anticipated to significantly increase.

It is possible that in utilizing tools to analyze and document a live computer system that changes can be made to the content of the hard drive.  During each phase of system analysis, the forensic examiner must document what they did and why they did it.  Specifically, the examiner should detail the potentially perishable information that can/will be lost during a system power down process.  The examiner must balance the need to potentially change data on the hard drive versus the evidentiary value of such perishable data.

RAM can be analyzed for prior content after power loss. Although as production methods become cleaner the impurities used to indicate a particular cell's charge prior to power loss are becoming less common.  Data held statically in an area of RAM for long periods of time are more likely to be detectable using these methods.  The likelihood of such recovery increases as the originally applied voltages, operating temperatures and duration of data storage increases.  Holding unpowered RAM below − 60 °C will help preserve the residual data by an order of magnitude, thus improving the chances of successful recovery. However, the practicality of utilizing such a method in a field examination environment severely limits this approach.

As expeditious destruction of chronic residual stress within the module can really only be achieved by impractical exposure to high energies, applications written with data security in mind will periodically [[Bitwise operation#NOT|bit-flip]] critical data, such as encryption keys, to eliminate 'imprinting' of this data on the RAM, thus preventing the need to actively destroy it in the first place.&lt;ref name=nz&gt;Peter Gutmann [http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory] [[University of Auckland]]&lt;/ref&gt;


It is important to note that when preforming a live analysis that the order of volatility be followed. The data that is most likely to be modified or damaged first should be captured first. The order of volatility is.

1. Network connections

Network connections can close quickly and often leave no evidence of where they were connected to or the data being transferred.

2. Running Processes

It is important to note which programs are running on a computer before further analysis is conducted.

3. RAM

The systems Random Accessing Memory contains information on all running programs as well as recently run programs. The information that can be gained from the system ram includes Passwords, encryption keys, personal information and system and program settings.

4. System settings

The Operating system settings can now be extracted. this includes User lists, currently logged in users, system date and time, currently accessed files and current security policies.

5. Hard Disk

The hard disk can then be imaged. It is important to note that it is not forensically sound to image a hard drive while it is running live unless there are extenuating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[www.porcupine.org/forensics/forensic-discovery/appendixB.html] [order of volatility] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Power down carefully===
If the computer is running when seized, it should be powered down in a way that is least damaging to data currently in memory and that which is on the [[hard disk]]. The method that should be used is dependent on many differing values, such as the [[operating system]] in use, and the role of the computer to be seized.  Performing a proper shut down may cause malicious scripts to be run, or volatile data to be lost.  On the other hand, removing the power plug may cause corruption of the [[filesystem]] or loss of crucial data.  

Be aware of the fact that computers may feature an '''internal''' [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS).  With such devices the computer may stay running long after the power cable has been removed.

===Inspect for traps===
{{seealso|commons:Category:Computer hardware}}

===Fully document hardware configuration===
Completely photograph and diagram the entire configuration of the system.  Note serial numbers and other markings. Pay special attention to the order in which the hard drives are wired, since this will indicate boot order, as well as being necessary to reconstruct a [[redundant array of independent disks|RAID]] array.  A little time being thorough here will save you more later.

===Duplicate the electronic media (evidence)===
The process of creating an exact duplicate of the original evidenciary media is often called '''Imaging.'''  Using a standalone hard-drive duplicator or software imaging tools such as [[DCFLdd]] or [[IXimager]], completely duplicate the ''entire'' [[hard drive]].  This should be done at the [[Disk sector|sector]] level, making a bit-stream copy of every part of the user-accessible areas of the hard drive which can physically store data, rather than duplicating the filesystem.  Be sure to note which physical drive each image corresponds to.  The original drives should then be moved to secure storage to prevent tampering.

Usually some kind of hardware write protection to ensure no writes will be made to the original drive is used.  Even if operating systems
like Linux can be configured to prevent this, a hardware write blocker is usually the best practice. The [[Defense Cyber Crime Institute]] warns that if a hardware write-block is used the examiner should take into consideration the fact that write-blocks can introduce extra benign data when being used to image damaged media (bad sectors).&lt;ref name=BadSectors&gt;Cyrus Robinson [http://www.dc3.mil/dcci/search.htm?zoom_query=IXImager+Bad+Sector+Drive+Imaging+Study&amp;zoom_per_page=10&amp;zoom_and=1&amp;zoom_sort=0.htm IXImager Bad Sector Drive Imaging Study] [[Defense Cyber Crime Institute Cyber Files]] Reports and studies are available only to US governmental agencies and law enforcement organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;  Special consideration is also given to hard drives with [[Host Protected Areas]] (HPAs) and [[Device Configuration Overlays]] (DCOs).  These small areas of a hard drive, normally reserved for hard drive device and diagnostic utilities and hidden from the operating system, can be altered up to the entire capacity of the hard drive and used to store information (potential evidence) that many imaging applications and devices fail to image.
You can image to another hard disk drive, a tape, or other media. Tape is a preferred format for archive images, since it is less vulnerable for damage and can be stored
for a longer time. There are two goals when making an image:
#Completeness (imaging all of the information)
#Accuracy (copying it all correctly)
The imaging process is verified by using the [[SHA hash functions|SHA-1]] [[message digest]] [[algorithm]] (with a program such as &lt;tt&gt;sha1sum&lt;/tt&gt;) or other still viable algorithms. To make a forensically sound image, you need to make two reads that result in the same output by the message digest algorithm. Generally, a drive should be hashed in at least two algorithms to help ensure its authenticity from modification in the event one of the algorithms is cracked.  This can be accomplished by first imaging to one tape labeled as the Master and then make an image labeled Working. If onsite and time is critical, the second read can be made to Null.

Note: Ultimately the methodology used by computer forensic investigators in capturing potential evidence on a system (such as imaging hard drives) will be dictated by the proportionality of the likely importance of that evidence in the matter for which these services are engaged. Additional influences such as claims of privilege and potential damages sought for business interruption create potential headaches for corporate investigations where forensic soundness is often sacrificed for practicality. Law enforcement personnel moving into the corporate environment tend to be overly strict in their application of computer forensic principles in litigations where the burden of proof does not require it. There is an increasing need to capture servers live and capturing less than whole disks worth of data in an effort to work within a time and cost framework. Even an unsolved murder investigation must be wound up at some point where there are diminishing gains to be had in progressing the investigation, so too with computer forensic investigations in both the corporate and criminal arenas where the sheer quantity of digital evidence can become overwhelming and threaten to overburden investigators. Also, it must be remembered that any computer evidence is potentially admissible regardless of the methodology by which it came to the attention of the court. If an examiner fails to create a SHA or MD5 hash on the original hard drive, the data is not necessarily worthless or non admissible.  Traditional discovery has been happening for at least a decade (often without a hashes). Application of proper forensic principles will however improve its overall credibility and diminish admissibility challenges.  However, reasonable attempts should be made to ensure that the most complete and accurate image possible is obtained.

==E-mail review==
[[E-mail]] has become one of the primary mediums of communication in the digital age, and vast amounts of evidence may be contained therein, whether in the body or enclosed in an attachment. Because users may access email in a variety of ways, it's important to look for different kinds of emails. The user may have used a dedicated program, or [[E-mail client|Mail User Agent]] (MUA), a web browser, or some other program to read and write email. Additionally, files for each of these programs may be stored on a local hard drive, a network device, or a removable device. A good examiner will search all of these locations for email data. Be aware that many email clients will save a copy of outgoing messages, so both the sender and the recipient may have a copy of each message. Finally, mail may also be stored on a dedicated mail server, either awaiting delivery or as permanent storage.

===E-mail headers===
{{main|E-mail#Internet e-mail header}}
All email programs generate headers that attach to the messages. The study of these headers is complex. Some investigators favor reading the headers from the bottom up, others from the top down. Under normal circumstances, headers are supposed to be created by the mail user agent and then prepended by mail servers, the bottom up method should work. But a malicious mail server or forger may make this difficult.

The headers added by an MUA are different from those added by mail servers. For example, here is the format for headers generated by Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0 running on Microsoft Windows. &lt;!--Note to editors: This should eventually be moved to a page about analyzing MUA headers--&gt;

#A random value called a [[salt (cryptography)|salt]]. The salt is of the format #0#0#0# where # is a random digit. Because Thunderbird treats the salt like a number, it may be shorter if the leading digits are zeros. For example, a salt of &quot;0030509&quot; would display as &quot;30509&quot;.
#The fully qualified domain name of the sender.

 Message-ID: [time].&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[salt (cryptography)|salt]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;@[domain-name]

Information on the Message-ID header was derived from the source code in mozilla/mailnews/compose/src/nsMsgCompUtils.cpp in function msg_generate_message_id() and therefore applies only to mail sent by this application.  Generally the format of the Message-ID is arbitrary, and you should refer to the applicable RFCs.

===Sorting through the masses===
While theoretically possible to review all e-mails, the sheer volume that may be subject to review may be a daunting task; large-scale e-mail reviews cannot look at each and every e-mail due to the sheer impracticality and cost.  Forensics experts use review tools to make copies of and search through e-mails and their attachments looking for incriminating evidence using keyword searches.  Some programs have been advanced to the point that they can recognize general threads in e-mails by looking at word groupings on either side of the search word in question.  Thanks to this technology vast amounts of time can be saved by eliminating groups of e-mails that are not relevant to the case at hand.

Also, emails may contain In-Reply-To: headers that allow threads to be reconstructed. Good email clients can do this.

===Computer forensic examples===
Forensics can be defined as the use of technology and science for investigation and fact recovery when dealing with criminal matters.  Computer forensics is the technological aspect of retrieving evidence to use within criminal or civil courts of law.  They are able to recover damaged and deleted files.  Some cases in particular used the art of computer forensics as their lead of evidence to indict a criminal offender or find the location of a missing person.  

==== Example====  
[[Chandra Levy]], who went missing on [[April 30]], [[2001]], was a [[Washington, D.C.]] intern whose disappearance was widely publicized.  While her location was unknown, she had used the Internet as well as e-mail to make travel arrangements and to communicate with her parents.  The use of this technology helped a computer criminalist trace her whereabouts.  The information found on her computer led police to her location, even though she had been missing for one year.

==== Example two ==== 
There have been a number of cases at private schools where authority figures have been charged with possession of child pornography.  These discoveries were made using computer forensics.  By tracking the buying and selling of pornography online, computer forensic investigators have been able to locate people involved in these crimes.  They are able to use information found on the computers as circumstantial evidence in court, allowing prosecution to occur.

==== Example three ====
A final example of how computer forensics is affecting the current workplace is the aspect of security. Employees' work computers are now being monitored to ensure no illegal actions are taking place in the office. They also have heightened security so outsiders cannot access a company’s confidential files. If this security is broken a company is then able to use computer forensics to trace back to which computer was being tampered with and what information was extracted from it, possibly leading to the guilty parties and other potential parties involved.

== Comparison to Physical Forensics==
There are many core differences between computer forensics and &quot;physical forensics.&quot; [http://www.digital-evidence.org/di_basics.html]  At the highest level, the physical forensic sciences focus on [[identification]] and [[individualization]].  Both of these processes compare an item from a crime scene with other substances to identify the class of the item (i.e. is the red liquid fruit juice or blood?) or the source of the item (i.e. did this blood come from person X?).  Computer forensics on the other hand focuses on finding the evidence and analyzing it.  Therefore, it is more analogous to a physical crime scene investigation&lt;ref name=purdue&gt;Brian Carrier, Eugene H. Spafford [https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/tools_and_resources/bibtex_archive/archive/2003-29.pdf Getting Physical with the Digital Investigation Process] [[International Journal of Digital Evidence]] Fall 2003, Volume 2, Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt; than the physical forensic processes.

The '''transcription of English to Japanese''' has been done since the earliest cultural contacts between English speakers and Japanese. During the Edo period, kanji were used phonetically to write English and other foreign words, but in the modern period [[katakana]] have become the principal target script. Unlike the systems for romaji, there is no standard for transcribing into katakana, and methods vary. However, generally all methods attempt to preserve the pronunciation of English, not the spelling. That is, transcription not transliteration is done.

This article deals with transcription of English words into the nearest phonetic equivalent in Japanese. 

== Reasons for transcribing ==

The purpose of the transcription partly determines how it is done. There are reasons why one would want to transcribe an English word to Japanese: Many legal documents, such as [[company registration]]s, require that only Japanese script is used. A computer database may need entry in Japanese script for the purpose of sorting and collation. Educators want to explain the pronunciation of English words by transcribing. Loan words from English are usually written in a transcribed form. Or one may simply be interested in how one's name looks in Japanese. 

Accordingly, there are different priorities for the transcriber. The educator might want to indicate many of the subtleties of English pronunciation whereas a person naming a new product might be more concerned with the ease of pronunciation for native speakers of Japanese.

== Difficulties ==

Japanese distinguishes fewer sounds than English. For example, Japanese does not distinguish the [[vowel]] sound of &quot;run&quot; and &quot;ran&quot;, or the [[consonant]] sound of &quot;row&quot; and &quot;low&quot;.  Moreover the rules by which sounds can be combined in Japanese are generally more restrictive than the English rules. As a result, the [[Non-native_pronunciations_of_English#Japanese|pronunciation]] of the transcribed word can differ quite considerably from the original word in English.

If writing for a Japanese audience, it is worth checking whether there is already an accepted transcription into Japanese, and whether the meaning of the new word has changed in Japanese.  The word ''mishin'' illustrates both pitfalls: not only is this an unexpected rendering of the English word &quot;machine&quot;, but the Japanese word's meaning is limited to [[sewing machine]]s.  It is also worth noting that some terms which may at first glance appear to be mangled English loanwords are, in fact, loans from other languages: ''koppu'' (drinking glass) is not a version of the English &quot;cup&quot; but a loan of Dutch ''kop'', and ''tabako'' is from Portuguese ''tabaco'', not from &quot;tobacco&quot;.

== Procedure for transcription ==

Most Japanese people do not use a systematic procedure for transcription; instead they transcribe according to their perception of the English pronunciation, albeit significantly influenced by the spelling. However, the process can be represented formally as a set of transformations, which is presented in one possible order below. Proficient Japanese speakers internalize the transformations and perform them all simultaneously when inserting English words into written or spoken Japanese.

=== Step 1: Transcribe the English phonetically===
The first step is to start with a phonetic representation of the English word, as distinct from the spelling. The [[phonetic transcription]] should reflect the careful pronunciation of the word. Spelling can often mislead as to what the pronunciation is. If there is any doubt, a dictionary will provide an accurate indication of what the sounds are. The letter ''x'' typically corresponds to two sounds (ks) and the digraphs ''sh'', ''ch'', and ''th'' each correspond to a single sound. The English sounds in the examples below are in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. (See [[International Phonetic Alphabet for English]] and [[IPA chart for English]] for explanation of these symbols used for transcribing English.)

=== Step 2: Transform the vowels from English to Japanese ===
Japanese has a different and smaller sound set than English, so many sounds have to be changed to equivalent or similar sounds in Japanese. The Romanization system used here is a variation of the [[Hepburn system]], where long vowels are represented by doubled letters (ii, ee, aa, oo, uu) and the moraic nasal is represented with capital N. 

Vowels need to be changed to correspond to use the five Japanese vowels. Typically, the vowels used in a British [[Received Pronunciation]] are used as the base English vowels for transcription, using the following system, where doubled vowels mean long (2-mora) vowels:

In [[rhotic]] dialects of English, like [[American English]], the letter ''r'' sounds at the end of syllables, but for the purpose of transcription into Japanese, this sound transcribes into a vowel sequence ending in ''a'', except for the sequence {{IPA|[ɔɹ]}}, which corresponds to Received Pronunciation {{IPA|[ɔː]}}, and is transcribed as ''oo''. That is, ''car'' becomes ''kaa'' not ''karu'', and ''pork'' becomes ''pooku'' not ''poruku''.

=== Step 3: Transform consonants ===
Some consonants require changing during transcription into Japanese. This process has three substeps: 

==== Transform non-Japanese sounds to closest Japanese equivalents ====
First, English has a few consonant sounds that Japanese lacks or only contains in certain contexts, so they must be transcribed into other sounds that Japanese has. 

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 103%;&quot;
|-
| English || Japanese || example 
|-
| {{IPA|θ}} || s || '''th'''in → siN
|-
| {{IPA|ð}} || z || '''th'''at → zatto
|-
| {{IPA|l}} || r || '''l'''eft, mi'''l'''k → refuto, miruku
|-
| {{IPA|ŋ}} (when spelled &quot;ng&quot;) || Ng, N || so'''ng''', darli'''ng''' → soNgu, daariN
|-
| {{IPA|j}} (before the sounds {{IPA|i}}, {{IPA|ɪ}}, or {{IPA|e}})  || i || '''y'''east, '''y'''es → iisuto, iesu
|-
| {{IPA|h}} (before the sounds {{IPA|u}} or {{IPA|ʊ}})  || f || '''h'''oop → fuupu
|-
| {{IPA|w}} (before the sound {{IPA|u}}) || u || '''w'''oods → uzzu
|-
| {{IPA|v}} * || b || Da'''v'''id → debiddo
|}

There are other English consonants that Japanese lacks, such as {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, the closest equivalent being {{IPA|/ɕ/}}. And though both languages contain {{IPA|/h/}}, in Japanese it assimilates to {{IPA|/ç/}} before {{IPA|/i/}}. (See [[Japanese phonology]]) However these differences in pronunciation are small enough that they need not be considered different sounds for the purpose of transcription.

'''*''' It is possible to notate {{IPA|/v/}} in Japanese [[kana]], and it is done in the Japanese spellings of &quot;Vietnam&quot; (ヴェトナム vetonamu) and &quot;[[Vicks]]&quot; (ヴィックス vikkusu), but the sound does not exist in native Japanese phonology and is usually changed to &quot;b&quot; when transcribing English words.

==== Palatalize coronal obstruents ====
Next, Japanese requires [[coronal consonant|coronal]] [[obstruent]]s &quot;s&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot; to be [[palatalized]] when they occur before the vowel ''i'', so if these consonants occur before &quot;i&quot;, either they change to their palatalized form or the vowel &quot;i&quot; changes to &quot;e&quot;:
* &quot;si&quot; changes to &quot;shi&quot; (Remember &quot;si&quot; might come originally from &quot;thi&quot;, as in ''thick'').
* &quot;ti&quot; changes to &quot;chi&quot; or &quot;te&quot;
* &quot;di&quot; changes to &quot;ji&quot; or &quot;de&quot;
* &quot;zi&quot; changes to &quot;ji&quot;
In recent loanwords, &quot;ti&quot; and &quot;di&quot; are often preserved. In [[kana]], this sound is represented by a full-sized &quot;te&quot; or &quot;de&quot; and a small-sized &quot;i&quot;: ティ (ti), ディ (di).

==== Double voiceless obstruents after short vowels ====
In Japanese, the voiceless obstruents &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, and &quot;sh&quot; have geminate (doubled) forms, written using a [[sokuon]] (small tsu) character, and in English transcription these geminates are used after short vowels. Short vowels are vowels which are transcribed using the vowel table above using a single vowel (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, or &quot;u&quot;). This transformation is usually but not always applied in the middle of a word. Also, sometimes syllable-final &quot;t&quot; is transformed to &quot;ts&quot; instead of &quot;tt&quot;.

=== Step 4: Add epenthetic vowels ===
Japanese has strict constraints on the structure of syllables, and any syllables that violate these constraints have vowels inserted until the constraints are met. These are called [[epenthetic vowel]]s.
* The only [[consonant cluster]]s (sequences of consonants with no intervening vowels) allowed in Japanese are the geminate (doubled) consonants ''cch'', ''mm'', ''nn'', ''ss'', ''ssh'', ''tch'' and ''tt''.  However, the sounds represented by the English digraphs ''ch'', ''sh'', and ''ts'' are considered single sounds for the purpose of transcribing into Japanese.
* Japanese syllables can only end in vowels and ''N''.

Any sequence of sounds that does not obey these rules must have epenthetic vowels inserted. The epenthetic vowel is usually &quot;u&quot;, but there are a few exceptions:

* &quot;m&quot; does not take an epenthetic vowel when followed by &quot;b&quot; or &quot;p&quot;, but is instead replaced by &quot;N&quot; (which is pronounced the same as &quot;m&quot; in those contexts). (See [[N (kana)]].) For example, computer becomes &quot;コンピュータ&quot; (koNpyuuta). &quot;N&quot; is also pronounced as {{IPA|/ŋ/}} before &quot;k&quot; or &quot;g&quot;, requiring no epenthesis after the &quot;n&quot; in words such as &quot;ink&quot;, which becomes &quot;インク&quot; (iNku or iNki)
* &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot; take &quot;o&quot; as an epenthetic vowel. &quot;t&quot; can also take &quot;u&quot; in which case the &quot;t&quot; is affricated to &quot;ts&quot; (i.e. &quot;tsu&quot;).
** The rule for &quot;tsu&quot; described above is sometimes replaced by one where &quot;tu&quot;, written in kana with a full-sized &quot;to&quot; followed by a small &quot;u&quot;: トゥ, is used. This is more common in more recent innovative Japanese dialects. For example, the name of the film &quot;The Truman Show&quot; in Japanese is &quot;トゥルーマン・ショー&quot; (turuumaN shoo)
* &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;j&quot; take &quot;i&quot; as an epenthetic vowel.
* &quot;k&quot; and &quot;sh&quot; usually takes &quot;u&quot; as an epenthetic vowel, but sometimes it takes &quot;i&quot; or may vary between &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot;. &quot;i&quot; is the more conversative pattern.

=== Step 5: Break into morae ===
Japanese is divided into [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]e, with each mora containing one of the following:
* A consonant and a single vowel (CV)
* A consonant, &quot;j&quot; and a single vowel (CjV)
* A single vowel (V)
* Moraic (final) &quot;n&quot; (N) ン
* Doubled (geminate) consonant ッ

=== Step 6: Transcribe rōmaji into katakana ===
Each mora corresponds to one or sometimes two [[katakana]] characters. The second mora of a long vowel is uniformly transcribed as ー in katakana. Moraic &quot;n&quot; (transcribed here as &quot;N&quot;) is ン in katakana.

==Inconsistencies==

Though commonly used katakana spellings tend to be consistent with the above system of transcription, there are also many exceptions. Some transcriptions are apparently based on misinterpretations of the word's pronunciation based on its spelling. For example, the &quot;u&quot; in &quot;studio&quot; seems to have been interpreted as if it were {{IPA|/ʌ/}} (as in the word &quot;study&quot;), not {{IPA|/uː/}}, resulting in the transcription &quot;スタジオ&quot; (sutajio).

Though the basis for English to Japanese transcription is usually British Received Pronunciation, with its different short &quot;o&quot; sound and unpronounced rhotic &quot;r&quot;s, there are also exceptions. The words &quot;cocktail&quot; and &quot;soccer&quot; are transcribed as &quot;カクテル&quot; (kakuteru) and &quot;サッカー&quot; (sakkaa), and the Japanese name of the English letter &quot;r&quot; is &quot;アール&quot; (aaru), which corresponds more closely to a [[rhotic accent]].

The final {{IPA|t}} sound in English words is usually transcribed as &quot;ト&quot; (to), but it in some words such as &quot;fruit&quot; and &quot;suit&quot; it is transcribed as &quot;ツ&quot; (tsu), making the pronunciation of some singular nouns sound more like their plural forms, even though plural &quot;s&quot;s tend to be ignored when transcribing English nouns into Japanese.

Transcribing using the steps outlined above results in the English short &quot;i&quot; sound becoming the Japanese i sound, but there are also cases in which it becomes the Japanese e sound. Examples include &quot;digital&quot; and &quot;sticker&quot; becoming &quot;デジタル&quot; (dejitaru) and &quot;ステッカー&quot; (sutekkaa). Also, the &quot;re&quot; in the English words &quot;report&quot; and &quot;reporter&quot;, which is pronounced as {{IPA|/rɪ/}} in Received Pronunciation, becomes re in &quot;レポート&quot; (repooto) and &quot;レポーター&quot; (repootaa), though they are sometimes alternately transcribed as &quot;リポート&quot; (ripooto) and &quot;リポーター&quot; (ripootaa)

Even within the common system of transcriptions, there are multiple possible ways in which a certain sound can be transcribed. This can result in multiple transcriptions of a single word, such as the name &quot;David&quot;, which is written a number of ways in Japanese. Different pronunciations of the same word are sometimes used to show what meaning of the word is being used. For example, &quot;ストライク&quot; (sutoraiku) refers to a strike in baseball or bowling, while &quot;ストライキ&quot; (sutoraiki) refers to a workers' strike. Also, &quot;ポンチ&quot; (poNchi) refers to fruit punch while &quot;パンチ&quot; (paNchi) is used for other meanings of the word.

As mentioned above, many transcriptions (particularly those involving a non-final [[schwa]]) are non-fixed and are often based more on spelling than actual pronunciation. This often leads to words which sound similar to each other in English sounding radically different from each other in their Japanese pronunciations. While the pronunciations of the English words &quot;pirate&quot; and &quot;pilot&quot; differ only in the &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, the two words are transcribed respectively into Japanese as &quot;パイレーツ&quot; (paireetsu) and &quot;パイロット&quot; (pairotto), with the only difference between the original pronunciations disappearing and some new differences appearing in other places.

There are also some inconsistencies in Japanese between the way English words are transcribed, and the way words from some other languages containing the same sounds are transcribed. A final velar nasal consonant in an English word (spelled &quot;ng&quot;) is usually transcribed as &quot;ング&quot; (Ngu), but the same sound in Korean and Chinese words is transcribed as &quot;ン&quot; (N). For example &quot;Hong Kong&quot; and &quot;Kung-Fu&quot; become &quot;ホンコン&quot; (hoNkoN) and &quot;カンフー&quot; (kaNfuu) respectively, and the &quot;Yong&quot; in Korean actor Bae Yong Joon's name becomes &quot;ヨン&quot; (yoN).

===Exceptional transcriptions===

The following are commonly used transcriptions which do not conform to the common system of transcription. This does not include Japanese abbreviations of English words or words which resemble English, but came into Japanese directly from other languages.

'''*''' in the case of James Curtis Hepburn, but not Katharine Hepburn or Audrey Hepburn, whose last name is transcribed as &quot;ヘップバーン&quot; (hepubaaN).

'''**''' &quot;Holly&quot; on its own is transcribed as &quot;ホリー&quot; (horii).

==Transcribing multiple words==

In some instances, such as language textbooks or song lyrics, phrases or entire sentences may be transcribed into Japanese. 

Multiple word transcription is typically done on a word-by-word basis, with no account being taken of word linking. For example, &quot;an engineer&quot; would most naturally be transcribed into Japanese as &quot;a.N.e.N.ji.ni.a&quot; rather than the more natural &quot;a.ne.N.ji.ni.a&quot;, with the linking between the &quot;n&quot; and &quot;e&quot; represented by the Japanese mora &quot;ne&quot;. In some set phrases, such as &quot;kaman&quot; for &quot;come on&quot;, this general trend is broken.

===Example of transcribing a whole sentence===

'''English:'''
&quot;My hovercraft is full of eels.&quot;

'''Step 1:'''
{{IPA|maɪ hɒvəkrɑːft ɪz fʊl ɒv iːlz}}

'''Step 2-3:'''
&quot;mai hobaakraft iz ful ob iirz&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, or S.M.A.R.T., is a monitoring system for computer hard disks to detect and report on various indicators of reliability, in the hope of anticipating failures.

==Background==
Fundamentally, hard drives can suffer one of two classes of failures: 
*Predictable ones, when some failure modes, especially mechanical wear and aging, happen gradually over time.  A monitoring device can detect these, much as a temperature dial on the dashboard of an automobile can warn a driver — before serious damage occurs — that the engine has started to overheat.  
*Unpredictable ones, when other failures may occur suddenly and unpredictably, such as an electronic component failing.

Mechanical failures, which are usually predictable failures, account for 60 percent of drive failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/enhanced_smart.pdf Seagate statement on enhanced smart attributes]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of S.M.A.R.T. is to warn a user or system administrator of impending drive failure while time remains to take preventative action — such as copying the data to a replacement device. Approximately 30% of failures can be predicted by S.M.A.R.T.&lt;ref&gt;http://smartlinux.sourceforge.net/smart/faq.php?#2 (&quot;How does S.M.A.R.T. work?&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Work at Google on over 100,000 drives has shown little overall predictive value of S.M.A.R.T. status as a whole, but that certain sub-categories of information S.M.A.R.T. implementations might track do correlate with actual failure rates - specifically that following the first scan error, drives are 39 times more likely to fail within 60 days than drives with no such errors and first errors in reallocations, offline reallocations, and probational counts are also strongly correlated to higher failure probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://labs.google.com/papers/disk_failures.pdf Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population] (Conclusion section) by Eduardo Pinheiro, Wolf-Dietrich Weber and Luiz André Barroso, Google Inc.  1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy  Mountain View, CA 94043&lt;/ref&gt;

Pctechguide's page on S.M.A.R.T. (2003)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pctechguide.com/31HardDisk_SMART.htm pctechguide's page on S.M.A.R.T. (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; comments that the technology has gone through three phases: 
:&quot;In its original incarnation SMART provided failure prediction by monitoring certain online hard drive activities. A subsequent version improved failure prediction by adding an automatic off-line read scan to monitor additional operations. The latest SMART III technology not only monitors hard drive activities but adds failure prevention by attempting to detect and repair sector errors. Also, whilst earlier versions of the technology only monitored hard drive activity for data that was retrieved by the operating system, SMART III tests all data and all sectors of a drive by using off-line data collection to confirm the drive's health during periods of inactivity.&quot;

==SMART Information==
The technical documentation for SMART is in the AT Attachment standard.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most basic information that SMART provides is the SMART status.  It provides only two values, &quot;threshold not exceeded&quot; or &quot;threshold exceeded&quot;.  Often these are represented as &quot;drive OK&quot; or &quot;drive fail&quot; respectively.  A &quot;threshold exceeded&quot; value is intended to indicate that there is a relatively high probability that the drive will not be able to honor its specification in the future: that is, it's &quot;about to fail&quot;.  The predicted failure may be catastrophic or may be something as subtle as inability to write to certain sectors or slower performance than the manufacturer's minimum.

The SMART status does not necessarily indicate the drive's reliability now or in the past.  If the drive has already failed catastrophically, the SMART status may be inaccessible.  If the drive was experiencing problems in the past, but now the sensors indicate that the problems no longer exist, the SMART status may indicate the drive is OK, depending on the manufacturer's programming.

The inability to ''read'' some sectors is not always an indication that the drive is about to fail; one way that unreadable sectors can be created even when the drive is functioning within specification is if the power fails while the drive is writing.  Even if the physical disk is damaged in one location so that a sector is unreadable, the disk may be able to use spare space to replace the bad area so that the sector can be overwritten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More detail on the health of the drive may be obtained by examining the SMART Attributes.  SMART Attributes were included in some drafts of the ATA standard but were removed before the standard became final. The meaning and interpretation of the attributes varies between manufacturers and is sometimes considered a trade secret by the manufacturer.   Attributes are discussed further below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Drives with SMART may optionally support a number of 'logs'.  The ''error log'' records information about the most recent errors that the drive has reported back to the host computer.  Examining this log may help to determine whether computer problems are disk-related or caused by something else.

A drive supporting SMART may optionally support a number of self-test or maintenance routines, and the results of the tests are kept in the ''self-test log''.  The self-test routines can be efficiently used to detect any unreadable sectors on the disk so that they may be restored from backup (for example, from other disks in a RAID).  This helps to reduce the risk of a situation where one sector on a disk becomes unreadable, then the backup is damaged, and the data is lost forever.

==Standards and implementation==
Many motherboards will display a warning message when a disk drive approaches failure.  Although an industry standard among most major hard drive manufacturers,&lt;ref&gt;pctechguide: &quot;Industry acceptance of PFA technology eventually led to SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) becoming the industry-standard reliability prediction indicator...&quot; [http://www.pctechguide.com/31HardDisk_SMART.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; there are some remaining issues and much proprietary &quot;secret knowledge&quot; held by individual manufacturers as to their specific approach. As a result, S.M.A.R.T. is not always implemented correctly on many computer platforms due to the absence of industry-wide software &amp; hardware standards for S.M.A.R.T. data interchange.

From a legal perspective, the term &quot;S.M.A.R.T.&quot; refers only to a signaling method between internal disk drive electromechanical sensors and the host computer — thus a disk drive manufacturer could include a sensor for just one physical attribute and then advertise the product as S.M.A.R.T. compatible.  For example, a drive manufacturer might claim to support S.M.A.R.T. but not include a temperature sensor, which the customer might reasonably expect to be present.

Some S.M.A.R.T.-enabled motherboards and related software may not communicate with certain S.M.A.R.T.-capable drives, depending on the type of interface.  Few external drives connected via USB and Firewire correctly send S.M.A.R.T. data over those interfaces.  With so many ways to connect a hard drive (e.g. SCSI, Fibre Channel, ATA, SATA, SAS, SSA) it's difficult to predict whether S.M.A.R.T. reports will function correctly.

Even on hard drives and interfaces that support it, S.M.A.R.T. data may not be reported correctly to the computer's operating system.  Some disk controllers can duplicate all write operations on a secondary &quot;backup&quot; drive in real-time.  This feature is known as &quot;RAID mirroring&quot;.  However, many programs which are designed to analyze changes in drive behavior and relay S.M.A.R.T. alerts to the operator do not function when a computer system is configured for RAID support, usually because under normal RAID array operational conditions, the computer may not be permitted to 'see' (or directly access) individual physical drives, but only logical volumes, by the RAID array subsystem.

On the Windows platform, many programs designed to monitor and report S.M.A.R.T. information will only function under an administrator account. At present S.M.A.R.T. is implemented individually by manufacturers, and while some aspects are standardized for compatibility, others are not.

One of the other fundamental problems with S.M.A.R.T is that it slows performance and for this reason it is disabled by default in many motherboard BIOSes.

==Attributes==

Each drive manufacturer defines a set of attributes and selects threshold values which attributes should not go below under normal operation.  Attribute values can range from 1 to 253 (1 representing the worst case and 253 representing the best).  Depending on the manufacturer, a value of 100 or 200 will often be chosen as the &quot;normal&quot; value.  Manufacturers that have supported one or more S.M.A.R.T. attributes in various products include: Samsung, Seagate, IBM (Hitachi), Fujitsu, Maxtor, Western Digital.  These manufacturers do not necessarily agree on precise attribute definitions and measurement units; therefore the following list should be regarded as a general reference only.  Note that the attribute values are always mapped to the range of 1 to 253 in a way that means higher values are better.  For example, the &quot;Reallocated Sectors Count&quot; attribute value ''decreases'' as the number of reallocated sectors ''increases''.  In this case, the attribute's ''raw value'' will often indicate the actual number of sectors that were reallocated, although vendors are in no way required to adhere to this convention.

|- style=&quot;background-color: #ffa07a&quot;
| 01 || 01 || nowrap | '''Read Error Rate''' || [[Image:Green Arrow Down.svg|12px]] || Indicates the rate of hardware read errors that occurred when reading data from a disk surface. Any number indicates a problem with either disk surface or read/write heads.
|-
| 02 || 02 || nowrap | '''Throughput Performance''' || [[Image:Green Arrow Up.svg|12px]] || Overall (general) throughput performance of a hard disk drive. If the value of this attribute is decreasing there is a high probability that there is a problem with the disk.
|-
| 03 || 03 || nowrap | '''Spin-Up Time''' || [[Image:Green Arrow Down.svg|12px]] || Average time of spindle spin up (from zero RPM to fully operational).

|-style=&quot;background-color: #ffa07a&quot;
| 05 || 05 || nowrap | '''Reallocated Sectors Count''' || [[Image:Green Arrow Down.svg|12px]] || Count of reallocated sectors. When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it marks this sector as &quot;reallocated&quot; and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area). This process is also known as remapping and &quot;reallocated&quot; sectors are called remaps. This is why, on modern hard disks, &quot;bad blocks&quot; cannot be found while testing the surface — all bad blocks are hidden in reallocated sectors. However, the more sectors that are reallocated, the more read/write speed will decrease.
|-
| 06 || 06 || nowrap | '''Read Channel Margin''' || || Margin of a channel while reading data. The function of this attribute is not specified.
|-
| 07 || 07 || nowrap | '''Seek Error Rate ''' || [[Image:Green Arrow Down.svg|12px]] || Rate of seek errors of the magnetic heads. If there is a failure in the mechanical positioning system, a servo damage or a thermal widening of the hard disk, seek errors arise. More seek errors indicates a worsening condition of a disk surface and the mechanical subsystem.
|-

This attribute stores a total count of the spin start attempts to reach the fully operational speed (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). An increase of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem.
|-
| 11 || 0B || nowrap | '''Recalibration Retries''' || [[Image:Green Arrow Up.svg|12px]] || This attribute indicates the number of times recalibration was requested (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). A decrease of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem.

| 197 || C5 || nowrap | '''Current Pending Sector Count''' || [[Image:Green Arrow Down.svg|12px]] ||  Number of &quot;unstable&quot; sectors (waiting to be remapped).  If the unstable sector is subsequently written or read successfully, this value is decreased and the sector is not remapped.  Read errors on the sector will not remap the sector, it will only be remapped on a failed write attempt.  This can be problematic to test because cached writes will not remap the sector, only direct I/O writes to the disk.

===Threshold Exceeds Condition===

Threshold Exceeds Condition (TEC) is a supposed date when a critical drive statistic attribute will achieves its threshold value. When Drive Health software reports a &quot;Nearest T.E.C.&quot; it should be considered as a &quot;Failure date&quot;.

Prognosis of this date is based on the factor &quot;Speed of attribute change&quot;; how many points each month the value is decreasing/increasing. This factor is calculated automatically at any change of S.M.A.R.T. attributes for each attribute individually. Note that TEC dates are not guarantees; hard drives can and will either last much longer or fail much sooner than the date given by a TEC.

===Software===

Various operating-system specific software can extend the users ability to monitor disk drive conditions through the S.M.A.R.T. interface and predict when a failure is likely to occur by logging deviations in attribute values. This software may also possess the capability to distinguish between gradual degradation over time (representing normal wear) and a sudden change (which may indicate a more serious problem).

==The context of product management==

The existence of [[product manager]]s  in the product software industry indicates that software is becoming more and more commercialized as a standard product.  This manager is responsible over the whole line of software requirement management, defining of products and their releases and this with all internal and external [[stakeholders]]  involved. In this context, product roadmapping can be placed to aid. The software product manager is planning and placing his products with the use of scientific and technological resources.  For managing and using the technological resources technology planning can be used. 

Technology Roadmapping, a form of technology planning, can aid a company in a competitive environment.  Technology planning is needed to identify and develop the technologies required in the company.  Once these technology enhancements or new technologies are identified they can be developed internally or collaboratively with external partners.  For both approaches technology roadmapping can be used as a tool to plan and coordinate the set of activities involved in the processes.

=Overview of the Roadmapping process=
[[Image:Phase1-3-cut.jpg|frame|Figure 1: The Technology Roadmapping phases.]]

The Technology Roadmapping Process conducts 3 phases (see figure 1.); preliminary activities, the development of the roadmap and the follow-up activities phase.  Because the process is too big for 1 model the phases are modeled separately.  Only the first two phases are considered. In the models no different roles are made, this is because everything is done by the [[Participation (decision making)|participants]]  as a group. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
==Phase 1: Preliminary phase==

The first phase, the preliminary phase (see figure 2.), consists of 3 steps: &lt;i&gt;satisfy essential conditions, provide leadership / sponsorship and define the scope and boundaries for the technology roadmap&lt;/i&gt;. In this phase the key decision makers must identify that they have a problem and that technology roadmapping can help them in solving the problem.

[[Image:Phase1.3 Process Data Model.jpg|frame|Figure 2. The process-data model of the preliminary phase.]]


===Satisfy essential conditions===

In this step it must become clear what the conditions are (they have to be identified) and if they are not met that somebody will take the actions necessary to meet the unmet conditions. These conditions include for example the following: there must be a need for the technology roadmap, input and participation from several different parts of the organization (e.g. marketing, R&amp;D, the [[Strategic Business Unit]]s ) with different [[planning horizon|planning horizons]] and different perspectives and the process should be needs driven. All the conditions should be satisfied (or someone is going to take the actions necessary) in order to continue to the next step. The participants can have zero or more conditions of their own. It applies to all the conditions that they have the attribute to be met or not.

===Provide leadership / sponsorship===

Committed leadership  is needed because time and effort is involved in creating the technology roadmap. Additionally the [[leadership]] should come from one of the participants, one of them provides leadership / sponsorship. This means that the line organization must drive the process and use the roadmap to make [[resource allocation]]  decisions. 

===Define the scope and boundaries for the technology roadmap===

In this step the context for the roadmap will be specified. In the company a [[vision statement|vision]]  should exist and it must be clear that the roadmap can support that vision. If the vision does not exist one should be developed and clearly stated. When that is done the boundaries and the [[scope (project management)|scope]] of the roadmap should be specified. Furthermore the [[planning horizon]] and the level of details should be set. The scope can be further divided into the technology scope and the participation scope.

In table 1. all the different sub-activities of the preliminary activity phase can be seen. All the sub-activities have concepts as end “products”, these are marked in uppercase. These concepts are the actual [[meta-modeling|meta-data model]] , which is an adjusted [[class diagram]] .

==Phase 2: Development phase==

The second phase, the development of the technology roadmap phase (see figure 3.), consists of 7 steps: &lt;i&gt;identify the “product” that will be the focus of the roadmap, identify the critical system requirements and their targets, specify the major technology areas, specify the technology drivers and their targets, identify technology alternatives and their timelines, recommend the technology alternatives that should be pursued and create the technology roadmap report&lt;/i&gt;. These steps create the actual roadmap.

In this step the common product needs are identified and should be agreed on by all the participants. This is important to get the acceptance of all groups for the process. In case of uncertainty of the product needs [[scenario_planning|scenario-based planning]]  can be used to determine the common product needs. In figure 3. can be seen that the participants and the possibly the scenario-based planning provide the common product needs. 

===Identify the critical system requirements and their targets===

Once it is decided what needs to be roadmapped the critical [[system requirements]]  can be identified, they provide the overall framework for the technology roadmap. The requirements can have targets (as an attribute in figure 3.) like reliability and costs.

===Specify the major technology areas===

These are the areas which can help achieve the critical system requirements. For each technology area several [[Technology|technologies]]  can be found. Example technology areas are: Market assessment, Crosscutting technology, Component development and System development.
		
===Specify the technology drivers and their targets===

In this step the critical system requirements from step &lt;i&gt;Identify the critical system requirements and their targets&lt;/i&gt; are transformed into technology drivers (with targets) for the specific technology area. These drivers are the critical variables that will determine which technology alternatives are selected. The drivers depend on the technology areas but they relate to how the technology addresses the critical system requirements. 

===Identify Technology alternatives and their timelines===

At this point the technology drivers and their targets are specified and the technology alternatives that can satisfy those targets should be specified. For each of the alternatives a timeline should be estimated for how it will mature with respect to the technology driver targets. 

====Time====

This factor can be adapted suitable for the particular situation. The time horizons for [[E-commerce]]   and [[software]]  related sectors are usually short. Other distinctions can be made on scale and intervals. 

===Recommend the technology alternatives that should be pursued===

Because the alternatives may differ in costs, timeline etc. a selection has to be made of the alternatives. These will be the alternatives to be pursued in figure 3. In this step a lot of trade-off has to be made between different alternatives for different targets, performance over costs and even target over target. 

===Create the technology roadmap report===

At this point the technology roadmap is finished. In figure 3, it can be seen that the technology roadmap report consists of 5 parts: the identification and description of each technology area, critical factors in the roadmap, unaddressed areas, [[implementation]]  recommendations and technical recommendations. The report can also include additional information. In table 2. all the different sub-activities of the development phase can be seen.

report includes: IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION THE TECHNOLOGY, CRITICAL
FACTOR, UNADDRESSED AREA, and IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION AND TECHNICAL
RECOMMENDATION.&lt;/p&gt;
|}

==Phase 3: Follow-up activity phase==
This is the moment when the roadmap must be critiqued, validated and hopefully accepted by the group that will be involved in any implementation. For this a plan needs to be developed using the technology roadmap. Next there must be a periodical review and update point, because the needs from the participants and the technologies are evolving. 

=Planning and Business Development Context for Technology Roadmapping=

The process of technology roadmapping fits into [[corporate_strategy|corporate strategy]] , corporate [[strategic_planning|strategic planning]] , technology planning and the [[business_development|business development]]  context. 3 critical elements should be connected: needs, products and technology. 

==Knowledge and skills required==
===Consultant with skills===
In order to create a technology roadmap it is required to have a certain set of knowledge and skills. This means that some of the participants must know the process of technology roadmapping. Next to this group-process and interpersonal skills are required since the process includes a lot of discussions and finding out what the common need is. If the amount of participants is really large there might be need for a [[consultant]]  or facilitator. 

==The variety in technology Roadmapping (some examples)==

===The purpose of technology Roadmapping===
====Product planning:====

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Purpose_product_planning.jpg|frame|Figure 4. Product planning example.]] --&gt;

This is the most common type of a technology roadmap; linking the insertion of technologies into products. This can overlap between generations.

===Programme planning:===
[[Image:Purpose_programme_planning.jpg|frame|Figure 5. Programme planning example.]]

This type is more directed to the implementation of strategy and related to project planning. Figure 5 shows the relationships between technology development phases, programme phases and milestones. 

===The formats of technology Roadmapping===
====Bars:====
[[Image:Format_bars.jpg|frame|Figure 6. Bars example.]]

Almost all the roadmaps are (partly) expressed in bars for each layer. This makes the roadmaps very simple and unified, which makes the communication and integration easier.  


====Graphs====
[[Image:Format_graphs.jpg|frame|Figure 7. Graphs example.]]
Also a technology roadmap can be expressed as a graph, usually one for each of the sub layers. (e.g. IMEC uses the second method.

'''MAME arcade cabinets''' are meant to provide the experience of an entire video arcade in one unit. The name MAME cabinet refers to the emulation software MAME, the software used in such a cabinet. They come in many different flavors, such as upright cabinets which are the full-size cabinets many people are used to, cocktail cabinets which are similar to tables with a glass top that players look down on to play on, and bar-top machines which are miniature versions of the uprights. These can be bought fully built at numerous companies on the internet.

==Control panel design==
When designing the control panel of the MAME arcade cabinet, one needs to take into account the position and quantity of buttons, as well as how the buttons will interface with the computer. In addition there are different ways one can actually build the control panel. One common way to do it is to build the panel out of wood, then place a graphic on the top of wood and cover that in plexi  glass. The other way that one can do this is to use counter-top surface materials such as granite or cheaper materials to build the control panel.

===Control panel interfaces===
Interfacing a computer with arcade controls is generally done in one of two ways: the &quot;keyboard hack&quot;, and through the use of a keyboard encoder.

====Keyboard hack====
The &quot;keyboard hack&quot; requires the extraction of the control board of a keyboard and then the soldering of the arcade buttons to the actual solder points of individual keys on the keyboard. Therefore, one may solder a blue arcade button to the connection point of the 'b' key.

====Custom interface boards====
An easy alternative to the classic &quot;keyboard hack&quot; is an interface board that is detected by the computer as a standard PS/2 or USB keyboard. The most popular units are the I-PAC and J-PAC by [http://www.ultimarc.com/ipac1.html Ultimarc] and the KeyWiz by [http://www.groovygamegear.com/Page5.html Groovy Game Gear]. Some of these vendors offer adaptors for consoles such as Xbox and Playstation. Some vendors such as [http://www.thrustvector.com ThrustVector Controls], provide features such as variable rate autofire and macros with adjustable delay between each keystroke.

==Monitors==
There are three different types of displays used in MAME arcade cabinets: Computer Monitors, Arcade Monitors, and Televisions, each having specific advantages and requirements.

===Computer monitors===
A computer monitor is the least-troublesome way to go. Although more common sizes are normally less expensive than an arcade monitor, monitors that approach the size of arcade monitors are relatively rare and expensive. Computer monitors are also not designed for being mounted inside of a cabinet, so the construction of a custom mount is normally required, even though this is a relatively easy task of building proper supports within the cabinet. Using a computer monitor has a specific advantage in that you will be able to run a desktop operating system as computer monitors can handle the full resolution some modern operating systems require. Due to the higher refresh rate and higher picture quality, paradoxically this type of monitor will provide the least authentic image.

===Arcade monitors===
If one is performing a conversion on an existing cabinet, it may already have an arcade monitor. An arcade monitor allows games to be played on a monitor that displays the original resolution the game was designed for. Arcade monitors pose a specific challenge in interfacing with a computer, as the frequency output by modern video cards (31kHz) is different from the frequency used by arcade monitors (15kHz). Using a video card designed for use with an arcade monitor, such as an ArcadeVGA by Ultimarc, can help with this problem. An alternative is to use a DOS or Linux based solution where appropriate software can force many types of graphics card to produce the required 15kHz frequency. This is also possible in Microsoft Windows using special utilities such as PowerStrip from Entech Taiwan [http://www.entechtaiwan.com]

===Televisions===
Televisions are a popular choice for the fact that they are capable of displaying any and all content on a MAME arcade machine but give closer to the real thing than computer monitors can do. The only problem with televisions that can sometimes present itself is the need for the television to have an input available on it that can interface with a computer graphics card. Since VGA and DVI connectors on TV's are only present on high-end expensive flat panel TV's that usually isn't an option. However S-Video can be done, but you still typically will need newer equipment to be able to accommodate this as well.

==Customization==
This is the final point of construction. There are many things one can do at this point such as changing the t-molding, re-enameling the metal exterior parts, changing the marquee, or general painting. This really just has to do with personalization. 

;'''Marquee''': The Marquee is the backlit banner above the monitor. These can be backlit by either fluorescent lights or black lights. In commercial arcade machines, this normally shows the name of the game within the cabinet.&lt;/li&gt;
;'''T-molding''': The molding used on classic arcade machines acquiring the T name because of its shape, when viewed in cross section. In addition you can always lay down wood tape on the edges and then router the edges to make the edges appear rounded.&lt;/li&gt;
;'''Painting/enameling''': Allows for color changes/restoration or even just a bit of personalization.&lt;/li&gt;
;'''Side Art''': You can put new art pictures on the sides of the cabinet. On commercial arcade machines these are typically pictures of the game inside the cabinet.&lt;/li&gt;
;'''Speakers''': There are many options available for a speaker system inside a cabinet. The cheapest way being just two simple PC speakers, this is usually enough to represent the arcade experience as older arcade games didn't have any advanced sound in them. However a lot of arcade cabinets built now can do full sound with good speakers and subwoofers inside them, and can be commonly used as sound systems themselves.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

Xboxes have special protection schemes to prevent their users from using them to run software other than Xbox games. Many people hack their Xboxes to overcome this protection and make them run other software, e.g., special editions of Linux. but hacking Xboxes may be illegal in some areas.

However there is another, legal, way to run Linux on an Xbox. Instead of hacking its original, non-standard motherboard, you just replace it with a standard PC motherboard. It then becomes a normal PC, and you can install any operating system designed for normal PCs on it, including any PC version of Linux. The modified Xbox cannot run Xbox games.

==Motherboard choice==

The PC motherboard you install into the Xbox should be small in size. There's one such project called [http://www.mini-itx.com/projects/i64xbox/ i64XBOX] (unfortunately, it runs Windows 98) that involves use of a Mini-ITX motherboard , but any other motherboard that is small enough to fit into the Xbox case will also do. Due to size limitations, you probably won't be able to install anything into the motherboard slots, so the motherboard should have integrated video card (and sound card if you want sound, and network card if you want Ethernet, etc).

==Warranty, electrical safety and legal issues==

This mod will definitely void your Xbox warranty, so it is better to modify a machine with warranty expired. You can cheaply buy a second-hand Xbox with defunct motherboard to perform this mod on it. Dumpster diving may also help if it is legal in your area.

When buying a second-hand Xbox for this mod, make sure that its defunct component is motherboard, not power supply, hard disk drive or anything else. Do not attempt to open the Xbox power supply, unless you have experience in repairing switchmode power supplies, as it has a lot of mains-connected components as well as capacitors which remain being charged even for some time after unplugging.

Please do not attempt to sell your Xbox modified this way, as while performing this mod is probably legal, selling it may still be illegal. See [http://www.retropod.com Retropod] to get idea of what may happen.

==Overcoming the RAM limitations==

With traditional way of installing Linux on Xbox, you can face a problem that it has only 64 MB of RAM. You can [http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Upgrading_Xbox_RAM_HOWTO upgrade it to 128 MB], but this is also too low for most modern Linux distros. With Xbox motherboard replacement, you eliminate this problem, and can install as much RAM as your motherboard supports.

      <text xml:space="preserve">TI-BASIC is a simple programming language used on Texas Instruments graphing calculators. This module shows you how to program some standard financial calculations:
==TI-BASIC programs==

===Ito's lemma===
Let's begin defining a stochastic process through its Ito's definition:

 :defsto(t,x)
 :Func
 :{t,x}
 :EndFunc

So for our TI-calculator, a diffusion process formally defined by:

&lt;math&gt;dS = f(S,t) dt + g(S,t) dW&lt;/math&gt;

is defined by a set of two terms:

 { f(S,t), g(S,t) }

For an exponential brownian motion, we define:

 defsto(m*s, sigma*s) &amp;rarr; ds(s)

Now we want to use Ito's lemma on functions of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:

 :dsto(f,x,t,ds)
 :Func
 :{d(f,t)+ds[1]*d(f,x)+ds[2]^2*d(d(f,x),x)/2 , ds[2]*d(f,x)}
 :EndFunc

This can now be used to apply Ito's lemma to &lt;math&gt;\ln(S)&lt;/math&gt;:

 dsto(ln(S),S,t,ds(S))
 &gt;&gt; { m - sigma^2/2 , sigma }

this tell us that:

&lt;math&gt;d \ln(S) = \left(m-{1\over 2}\sigma^2\right) dt + \sigma dW, \;{\rm when}\; dS = m S dt + \sigma S dW&lt;/math&gt;

===Black-Scholes Equation===
Now we can try to prove the Black-Scholes equation.

Define a portfolio with an option and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; shares of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;:

 V(S,t) - Delta * S &amp;rarr; Pi

and apply Ito's lemma to obtain &lt;math&gt;d \Pi&lt;/math&gt;:

 dsto(Pi, S, t, ds(S)) &amp;rarr; dPi

we now want to nullify the stochastic part of &lt;math&gt;d \Pi&lt;/math&gt; by chosing an appropriate value for &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;:

 solve( dPi[2]=0, Delta)
 &gt;&gt; Delta = d(V(S,t), S) or sigma S = 0

we now know that the correct value for &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta = {\partial V(S,t)\over \partial S}&lt;/math&gt;

On another side, we have:

&lt;math&gt; d\Pi = r \Pi dt = r ( V(S,t)-\Delta\cdot S) dt&lt;/math&gt;

which leads us to the equation:

&lt;math&gt; (\partial_t V + {1\over 2}\sigma^2 S^2 \partial^2_S V) dt = r ( V(S,t)-\Delta S) dt&lt;/math&gt;

At first we need to replace &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; by its value into &lt;math&gt;d\Pi&lt;/math&gt;, and then equalize with 

 solve( dPi[2]=0, Delta) | sigma &gt; 0 and S &gt; 9 &amp;rarr; sol
 &gt;&gt; Delta = d(V(S,t), S)
 dPi | sol &amp;rarr; dPi
 &gt;&gt; {sigma^2 d^2(V(S,t), S^2) S^2 /2 + d(V(S,t), t) , 0 }
 dPi = defsto( r(V(S,t) - Delta S) ) | sol &amp;rarr; BS
 &gt;&gt; { BS_equation , true }

and now '''we've got the Black-Schole Differential Equation into the variable BS_equation[1]'''!

The knowledge developed by academic computer science (CS) is applied to various non-academic situations to arrive at systems that help humans perform tasks that were either out of their reach for being too complex or the tasks that are repetitive in nature. Techniques developed in CS and software engineering are being put to use in the following areas.

== Domain listing &lt;ref&gt;IEEE: [http://www.computer.org/portal/site/ieeecs/menuitem.c5efb9b8ade9096b8a9ca0108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&amp;pName=ieeecs_level1&amp;path=ieeecs/education&amp;file=careers.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl&amp;;jsessionid=GKDpHZyL23qG29LYYp7DW1sh5M2r1TZYTqmY9JmflMBLhhJwvXyf!-514941101 Careers in Computer Science and Computer Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt; ==
=== SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) ===
Automation of industrial manufacturing processes for better precision, optimal resource usage for production, better and consistent product yields, mechanical control in environments too hazardous for human operators.
;How CS helps?
SCADA software products collect data (''control parameters'') from the sensors in the actual field. Based on this input and the control logic specified by a process engineers, certain actions are taken by manipulating certain preidentified ''controlled parameters'' to achieve the results desired by the manufacturing process. The software provides means to interface known as well as new data scanners, means to specify the control logic, GUI for human interactions and overall configuration of numerous control applications that could be developed using the software.
Engineers from Computer Science stream have certain advantages - such as knowledge of internal architecture of microcontrollers as well as microprocessors. Knowledge of lower level programming languages like Assembly and higher level languages like C and C++, C#.
;Challenges to consider
#SCADA in control engineering has a long history of evolution. Training and getting work experience is not very easy in most of the countries.
#Control Systems like Distributed Control System (DCS) also plays a major role in automation.
#Knowledge of an array of various programmable logic controllers (PLCs), production processes, quality measures, communications protocols like Modbus, Profibus, CAN etc. is essential.
#Most of the projects have to be implemented onsite at shop floor (factory floor). So travelling is an inevitable part of this career option.

=== Embedded systems ===
Any computing system that controls electronics hardware for delivering specific, predetermined results. Characteristics that distinguish embedded systems from the conventional workstation/ personal computers are:
* most of these systems have restricted resources such as processor power and memory. These constraints impose stricter limitations on the way software could be written and debugged.
* paradoxical requirements of real time performance for timely response for given limited resources. Delayed response by few seconds from an inventory management software would not matter as much as nanosecond response delays in an aeroplane flight control system.
* once commissioned to a task they are designed for, they cannot be customized further to perform other tasks.
* lack of a typical keyboard and a display monitor for the systems that do not need human intervention. For those that do need, there are alternate means of input (jog wheel on an iPod) and output (tiny LCDs on PDAs). They can be found in all forms--miniature form factors such as an iPOD, cell phone to as large as space shuttle control.
;How CS helps?
Techniques of writing time and memory space efficient programs by employing low foot print data structures and algorithms.
;Challenges to consider

=== Multimedia ===
This is quite a wide field encompassing creation of information contents, storage, transmission/ distribution and rendering in various mediums. The information contents could be consisting of one or more of text, audio, static images and video.

The field includes digital signal processing.
;How CS helps?
Specialized techniques in information capture: WYSIWYG text and graphics editors, digital signal processing (DSP) for compression (encoding) of audio, image, and video data in digital forms such as MPEG for efficient storage and transmission.  Multimedia oriented content distribution systems: video on demand.  Techniques and algorithms in computer graphics for rendering the images, video and graphics. DSP based
decoders for high fidelity audio playback.

Software systems that maintain database of financial accounts of an organization's customers. Data retrieval and presentation functions such as account statement, billing are provided to support the pre-defined business processes.
;How CS helps?
These systems make use of ready-to-use database systems for efficient data storage and retrieval. Based on specified requirements, data entry forms are provided by a user interface front-end. Data reports are generated using SQL queries on the backend database.

=== Business applications - CRM (customer relationship management) ===
;How CS helps?
Most businesses rely today on CRM databases to store large amounts of information about customers and potential customers.  Software Engineers now develop these large databases that can be as few as several hundred records to several million records depending on the size of the company using the database.  People with a Computer Science background also help in integrating these applications with sales and customer service practices to help businesses increase sales and customer retention.

The '''Maude system''' is an implementation of [[rewriting logic]] developed at [[SRI International]]. It is similar in its general approach to [[Joseph Goguen]]'s [[OBJ3]] implementation of [[equational logic]], but based on rewriting logic rather than [[order-sorted equational logic]], and with a heavy emphasis on powerful [[metaprogramming]] based on [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]].

==Maude - the basics==
Maude modules (rewrite theories) consists of a term-language plus sets of equations and rewrite-rules. Terms in a rewrite theory are constructed using operators (functions taking 0 or more arguments of some '''sort''', which return a term of a specific '''sort'''). Operators taking 0 arguments are considered constants, and we construct our term-language by these simple constructs.

'''NOTE''': If you want to test these examples on your own, you should start Maude with the option '''-no-prelude''' which lets Maude know that none of its basic modules are included (like Maude's own NAT module which will cause a conflict).

====Example 1====
&lt;pre&gt;
 mod NAT is
   sort Nat .

   op 0 : -&gt; Nat [ctor] .
   op s : Nat -&gt; Nat [ctor] .
 endm
&lt;/pre&gt;

This rewrite theory specifies all the natural numbers. First we introduce the '''sort''', saying that there exists a sort called Nat (short for natural numbers), and below is the specification of how these terms are constructed. The operator '''s''' in Example 1 is the successor function representing the next natural number in the sequence of natural numbers i.e. s(N) := N + 1. s(0) is meant to represent the natural number 1 and so on. '''0''' is a constant, it takes no input parameter(s) but returns a '''Nat'''.

====Example 2====
&lt;pre&gt;

mod NAT is
sort Nat .

op 0 : -&gt; Nat [ctor] .
op s : Nat -&gt; Nat [ctor] .
op _+_ : Nat Nat -&gt; Nat .

vars N M : Nat .

eq 0 + s(N) = s(N) .
eq s(N) + M = s (N + M) .

endm

&lt;/pre&gt;

In Example 2 we introduce the '''+''' sign meant to represent addition of natural numbers. It's definition is almost identical to the previous one, with input and output '''sort'''s but there is a difference, its operator has underscores on each side. Maude lets the user specify whether or not operators are infix, postfix or prefix (default), this is done using underscores as place fillers for the input terms. So the + operator takes its input on each side making it an infix operator.  Unlike our previous operator '''s''' which takes its input terms after the operator (prefix).

&lt;pre&gt;
op + : Nat Nat -&gt; Nat .
*** is the same as

op +__ : Nat Nat -&gt; Nat . *** two underscores

&lt;/pre&gt;

The three stars are Maude's rest-of-line-comments and lets the parser know that it can ignore the rest of the line (not part of the program), with parenthesis we get section comments:

&lt;pre&gt;
*** rest of line is ignored by Maude
*** (
section
is
ignored by Maude
)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The extended '''Nat''' module also holds two variables and two sets of equations.

&lt;pre&gt;
vars N M : Nat .

eq 0 + s(N) = s(N) .
eq s(N) + M = s (N + M) .
&lt;/pre&gt;

When Maude &quot;executes&quot;, it rewrites terms according to our specifications. And this is done with the statement
&lt;pre&gt;
reduce in &lt;some module&gt; : &lt;some term&gt; .
&lt;/pre&gt;

or the shorter form

&lt;pre&gt;
red &lt;some term&gt; .
&lt;/pre&gt;

For this last statement to be used it is important that nothing is ambiguous. A small example from our rewrite theory representing the natural numbers:

&lt;pre&gt;
reduce in NAT : s(0) + s(0) .
rewrites: 2 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second)
result Nat: s(s(0))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using the two equations in the rewrite theory '''NAT''' Maude was able to reduce our term into the desired term, the representation of the number two i.e. the second successor of '''0'''. At that point no other application of the two equations were possible, so Maude halts. Maude rewrites terms according to the equations whenever there is a '''match''' between the '''closed terms''' that we try to rewrite (or reduce) and the '''left hand side''' of an equation in our equation-set. A match in this context is a [[substitution]] of the variables in the left hand side of an equation which leaves it identical to the term we try to rewrite/reduce.

To illustrate it further we can look at the left hand side of the equations as Maude executes, reducing/rewriting the term.

&lt;pre&gt;
eq s(N) + M = s (N + M) .

can be applied to the term:

s(0) + s(0)

since the substitution:

N =&gt; 0
M =&gt; s(0)

s(N) + M [[N =&gt; 0, M =&gt; s(0)]] == s(0) + s(0)
&lt;/pre&gt;

makes them identical, and therefore it can be reduced/rewritten using this equation. After this equation has been applied to the term, we are left with the term:

&lt;pre&gt;
s (0 + s(0))
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we take a close look at that term we will see that it has a fitting substitution with matches the first equation, at least parts of the term matches the first equation:

&lt;pre&gt;
eq 0 + s(N) = s(N) .

substitution:

N =&gt; 0

s (0 + s(N)) [[N =&gt; 0]] == s (0 + s(0))

0 + s(0) - matches first equation and is rewritten
&lt;/pre&gt;

As we can see the second substitution and rewrite step rewrites the an inner-term (the whole term does not match any of the equations but the inner term does). Then we end up with our resulting term '''s(s(0))''', and it can seem like a lot of hassle to add 1 + 1, but hopefully you will soon see the strength of this approach.

Another thing worth mentioning is that reduction/rewriting up to this point has taken something very important for granted, which is:
* Reduction/Rewriting '''terminates'''
* Reduction/Rewriting is '''confluent''' (applying the equations in any order will eventually lead to the same resulting term)

This cannot be taken for granted, and for a rewrite theory to be sane, we have to ensure that equational application is confluent and terminating. To prove that term-rewriting terminates is not possible in any instance, as we know from the [[halting problem]]. To be able to prove that term-rewriting (with regards to the equations) terminates, one can usually create some mapping between terms and the natural numbers, and show that application of the
equations reduces the associated value of the term. Induction then proves that it is a halting process since the event of finding smaller natural numbers is a halting process. Naturally equation sets that can cause a term-rewrite to contain cycles will not be terminating. To prove confluence is another important aspect since a rewrite theory lacking this ability will be rather flawed. To prove that the equation set is confluent one has to prove that '''any''' application of the equations to any belonging term will lead to the same resulting term (termination is a prerequisite). Details for how to prove termination or confluence will not be given here, it just had to be mentioned, since this is where equations and rewrite-rules differ, which is the next topic of this short overview.

==Rewrite Rules==
Up to this point we have been talking about rewriting and reduction as more or less the same thing, our first rewrite theory had no rewrite rules, still we rewrote terms, so it is time to illustrate what rewrite rules are, and how they differ from the equations we have seen so far (they do not differ much from equations naturally since we talk about the two concepts almost interchangeably).

The module presented so far '''NAT''' which represented the natural numbers and addition on its elements, is considered a functional module/rewrite theory, since it contains no rewrite rules. Such modules are often encapsuled with a '''fmod''' and '''endfm''' (instead of '''mod''' '''endm''') to illustrate this fact. A functional module and its set of equations must be confluent and terminating since they build up the part of a rewrite theory that always should compute the same result, this will be clear once the rewrite rules come into play.

====Example 3====
&lt;pre&gt;
mod PERSON is

including NAT . *** our previous module

sort Person .
sort State .

op married : -&gt; State [ctor] .
op divorced : -&gt; State [ctor] .
op single : -&gt; State [ctor] .
op engaged : -&gt; State [ctor] .
op dead : -&gt; State [ctor] .

op person : State Nat -&gt; Person [ctor] .

var N : Nat .
var S : State .

rl [birthday] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (S, N + s(0)) .

rl [get-engaged] :

person (single, N) =&gt; person (engaged, N) .

rl [get-married] :

person (engaged, N) =&gt; person (married, N) .

rl [get-divorced] :

person (married, N) =&gt; person (divorced, N) .

rl [las-vegas] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (married, N) .

rl [die] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (dead, N) .

endm
&lt;/pre&gt;

This module introduces two new '''sort'''s, and a set of rewrite rules. We also include our previous module, to illustrate how equations and rewrite rules differ. The rewrite rules is thought of as a set of legal state changes, so while equations hold the same meaning on both sides of the equality sign, rewrite rules does not (rewrite rules use a =&gt; token instead of an equality sign). You are still the same person after your married (this is open for debate), but something has changed, your marital status at least. So this is illustrated by a rewrite rule, not an equation. Rewrite rules does '''not''' have to be '''confluent''' and '''terminating''' so it does matter a great deal what rules are chosen to rewrite the term. The rules are applied at &quot;random&quot; by the Maude system, meaning that you can not be sure that one rule is applied before another rule and so on. '''If''' an equation can be applied to the term, it will '''always''' be applied '''before''' any rewrite rule.

A small example is in order:

====Example 4====
&lt;pre&gt;
rewrite [[3]] in PERSON : person (single, 0) .

rewrites: 4 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second)

result Person: person (married, s(0))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here we tell the Maude system to rewrite our input term according to the rewrite theory, and we tell it to stop after 3 rewrite steps (remember that rewrite rules do not have to be terminating or confluent so an upper bound is not a bad idea), we just want see what sort of state we end up in after randomly choosing 3 '''matching''' rules. And as you can see the state this person ends up in might look a bit strange. (When you're married at the age of one you kind of stick out a bit in kindergarten I guess). It also says 4 rewrite steps, although we specifically stated an upper limit of 3 rewrite steps, this is because rewrite steps that are the result of applying equations does not count (they do not change the term, at least if the equations are sane). In this example one of the equations of the NAT module has been used to reduce the term '''0 + s(0)''' to '''s(0)''', which accounts for the 4'th rewrite step.

To make this rewrite theory a bit less morbid, we can alter some of our rewrite rules a bit, and make them '''conditional''' rewrite rules, which basically means they have to fulfill some criteria to be applied to the term (other than just matching the left hand side of the rewrite rule).

&lt;pre&gt;
crl [las-vegas] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (married, N) if (S =/= married) /\ (S =/= dead) .

crl [die] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (dead, N) if (S =/= dead) .
&lt;/pre&gt;

It seems reasonable that you cannot die once you're dead, and you cannot marry as long as you are married. The leaning toothpicks ('''/\''') are supposed to resemble a logical '''AND''' which means that both criteria have to be fulfilled to be able to apply the rule (apart from term matching). '''Equations''' can also be made conditional in a similar manner.

====Why Rewriting Logic? Why Maude?====
As you probably can tell Maude sets out to solve a different set of problems than ordinary imperative languages like C, Java or Perl. It is a formal reasoning tool, which can help us verify that things are &quot;as they should&quot;, and show us why they are not if this is the case. In other words Maude lets us define formally what we mean by some concept in a very abstract manner (not concerning ourselves with how the structure is internally represented and so on), but we can describe what is thought to be the equal concerning our theory ('''equations''') and what state changes it can go through ('''rewrite rules'''). This is extremely useful to validate security protocols and critical code. The Maude system has proved flaws in cryptography protocols by just specifying what the system can do (in a manner similar to the PERSON rewrite theory), and by looking for unwanted situations (states or terms that should not be possible to reach) the protocol can be showed to contain bugs, not programming bugs but situations happen that are hard to predict just by walking down the &quot;happy path&quot; as most developers do.

We can use Maude's built-in search to look for unwanted states, or it can be used to show that no such states can be reached.

A small example from our PERSON module once again.

&lt;pre&gt;
search [1] in PERSON : person (single, 1) =&gt;1 person (married, 2) .

No solution.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here the Natural numbers have a more familiar look (the basic Maude modules prelude.maude has been loaded, that can be done with the command &quot;'''in prelude'''&quot;, or 1 can be replaced by s(0) and 2 by s(s(0)) if you don't want to load the default Maude-modules), naturally Maude has built-in support for ordinary structures like integers and floats and so on. The natural numbers are still members of the built-in '''sort''' Nat. We state that we want to search for a transition using one rewrite rule (=&gt;1), which rewrites the first term into the other. The result of the investigation is not shocking but still, sometimes proving the obvious is all we can do. If we let Maude use more than one step we should see a different result:

&lt;pre&gt;
search [1] in PERSON : person (single, 1) =&gt;+ person (married, 2) .

Solution 1 (state 7)
states: 8 rewrites: 14 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second)
&lt;/pre&gt;

To see what led us in that direction we can use the buit in command '''show path''' which lets us know what rule applications led us to the resulting term. The token (=&gt;+) means one or more rule application.

&lt;pre&gt;
show path 7 .
state 0, Person: person (single, 1)
===[[rl person(S, N) =&gt; person(S, N + 1) [label 'birthday]] .]
===&gt;
state 1, Person: person (single, 2)
===[[crl person(S, N) =&gt; person(married, N) if S =/= married = true /\ S =/= dead = true [label las-vegas]] .]
===&gt;
state 7, Person: person (married, 2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

As we can see the rule application &quot;birthday&quot; followed by &quot;las-vegas&quot; got us where we wanted. Since all rewrite theories or modules with many possible rule applications will generate a huge tree of possible states to search for the '''search''' command, this approach is not always the solution. We also have the ability to control what rule applications that should be attempted at each step of the way using meta-programming, due to the reflective property or rewriting logic. This subject of meta-programming and reflection requires a great deal of explanation for it to be simple, so that will be left for another section.

Maude is free software with great performance, and well written tutorials are available online (don't let this short howto scare you away).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Inheritance ==
[[w:Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Inheritance]] is mainly used to reduce duplication of code. By using the &lt;code&gt;Inherits&lt;/code&gt; keyword, you can extend and modify an existing class to have additional properties and methods.

For example, imagine we have an existing class called &quot;Person&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Public Class Person
       Public FirstName As String
       Public LastName As String
       Public DateOfBirth As Date
       Public Gender As String
       Public ReadOnly Property FullName() As String
           Get
               Return FirstName &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; LastName
           End Get
       End Property
   End Class
&lt;/source&gt;

Now imagine we wanted to create a special class called &quot;Customer&quot;, which had all the properties of &quot;Person&quot;, but also additional properties called &quot;CustomerID&quot; and &quot;CustomerType&quot;. We could just make a different class with similar properties as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Public Class Customer
       Public FirstName As String
       Public LastName As String
       Public DateOfBirth As Date
       Public Gender As String
       Public ReadOnly Property FullName() As String
           Get
               Return FirstName &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; LastName
           End Get
       End Property
       Public CustomerID As String
       Public CustomerType As String
   End Class
&lt;/source&gt;

An alternative approach, however is to use the &lt;code&gt;Inherits&lt;/code&gt; keyword as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
   Public Class Customer
       Inherits Person
       Public CustomerID As String
       Public CustomerType As String
   End Class
&lt;/source&gt;

&quot;Inherits Person&quot; automatically gives the new &quot;Customer&quot; class all the properties and methods of the &quot;Person&quot; class, as well as the two new properties. This approach also has several advantages:
* We don't have to re-type the FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth etc properties
* When properties and methods of the &quot;Person&quot; class are updated, the &quot;Customer&quot; class need not be rewritten as well.
* The .FullName property needs to be debugged in only one place
* Any code that uses a &quot;Person&quot; object can also use a &quot;Customer&quot; object.

:Thanks Mike. The 'Forensic Science Informatics' unit is about using ICT to aid forensic science, not about forensic examination of ICT evidence. However, we're looking into what we can offer students on the topic about Forensic computing so I'm very grateful to you for spotting the resource.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a general purpose function that creates a tabular view of hierarchical data.

== Method ==
We will write a recursive function to display each node and then to display each child in an HTML table.

Some systems call this a &quot;Grid View&quot; of XML data.

== element-to-nested-table function ==
The following function generates an HTML table with nested subtables for the child nodes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:element-to-nested-table($element) {
   if (exists ($element/(@*|*)))
     then 
     &lt;table&gt;
        {if (exists($element/text()))
         then &lt;tr class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
                  &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
                  &lt;td&gt;{$element/text()}&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;/tr&gt;
         else ()
       }
       {for $attribute in $element/@*
       return
          &lt;tr class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;
             &lt;th&gt;@{name($attribute)}&lt;/th&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;{string($attribute)}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
       }
       {for $node in $element/*
       return 
          &lt;tr class=&quot;element&quot;&gt;
             &lt;th&gt;{name($node)}&lt;/th&gt; 
             &lt;td&gt;{local:element-to-nested-table($node)}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;       
        }
    &lt;/table&gt;
    else $element/text()
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the rows displaying different kinds of items (text, attribute,element) are classed so that they may be styled.

== Document display ==

This function can be used in a script to provide a viewer for any XML document.

&lt;pre&gt;
declare namespace hc =&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

 (: function declaration :)

let $uri := request:get-parameter(&quot;uri&quot;,())
let $element:= httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($uri),true(),())/hc:body/html
return
 &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Tree view&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
      th {{border-style:double}}
      tr {{border-style:dotted}}
      tr .attribute {{font-style:italic}}
      td {{border-style:ridge}}
     &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Tree view of {$uri} &lt;/h1&gt;
     {local:element-to-nested-table($element)}
     &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

|previous=Your First Test
}}


This tutorial will teach you the basics of the Blender Game Engine, and how to create a platform game, which is a game where you overcome in-game obstacles by controlling the character's motions. (e.g. Super Mario)


==Set Up==
[[Image:BlenderNoobProPlatformerSetUp.jpg|right|thumb|How it should look so far.]]
To start, switch to the frontal view '''NUM1''' and move the starting cube to -3.0 along the Z azis, or three spaces down. If your default settings do not have you starting with a cube, create one now. (Don't forget to switch to the Blender Game engine. You can do this by going to the button on the top center of the screen that says Blender Render and switch it to Blender Game.) Next, hit '''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Add  &amp;rarr; Mesh &amp;rarr; Monkey''  to create Suzanne the Monkey. Any mesh will do, but it's the easiest of the basic meshes to intuitively determine local direction from. Next, go to the logic window (with Suzanne still selected) and toggle on &quot;Actor&quot; and then &quot;Dynamic&quot;. Hit '''PKEY''' to test. Suzanne should fall, then stop upon hitting the cube. Press '''ESC''' to exit.

[[Image:BlenderLogicActor_Dyn.jpg]]

==Controls==

Now we will add the controls. First, forward:

In Blender 2.59 these controls are available in the 'Logic Editor' window.

# Create a Keyboard Sensor, AND Controller, and Motion Actuator. Connect them by dragging lines between the dots next to their names. (In 2.59 the controller is created automatically, if the other two are connected)
# Select the empty box next to the word &quot;Key&quot; on the Keyboard Sensor and hit the up arrow key on your keyboard.
# Set the dLoc on the Motion Actuator to 0.10 Z and toggle Local Transformation (may appear as simply an L next to the dLoc row).

Next, backward. Repeat the process used for forward, but set the dLoc to -0.10 Z and the key to the down arrow. You can repeat this for left and right if you so choose to have a linear control scheme. We will not be using such a scheme for this tutorial, but you should still be able to follow along just fine. Instead, the character will rotate left and right and move in the new forward and backward.

To rotate right:

# As before, create a Keyboard Sensor, AND Controller, and Motion Actuator, then connect them.
# Set the key to the right arrow and set the dRot to -0.10 Y.

Repeat for left, with the left arrow and 0.10 Y.

[[image:BlenderLogic_ForRgt_Optm.gif]]

Finally, the ubiquitous, and some say defining, Platformer move: the jump. Repeat the previous processes, with the space key as the trigger and the linV of the motion effect as 7.50 Z (not local). This doesn't actually move the character in a certain direction, but sets its velocity. If you've done programming for games before, this will probably be familiar to you. Each frame, the engine adds the velocity of the object to its current position. The gravity portion of the engine subtracts from the upward velocity each time. When it reaches a negative, it's adding a negative number to its altitude, ergo subtracting from it, ergo causing it to fall. This is why using linV to move the character does not cause it to immediately relocate to the target position.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page contains a number of tips or hints that will be useful for the examinations:

* Do not use brand names when answering exam questions. These will gain no credit, so give a generic answer (For example, use word processor rather than Microsoft Word)

* Always give binary to the required number of bits, even if this means adding leading zeros

* Ensure you consider the number of marks that can be awarded for the question. Each mark will normally be for different aspects i.e. a 2 mark question may be of the form - define XYZ (1st mark) and compare XYZ to ABC (2nd mark)

* Structure your answer from general concept to any specific point. For instance, if asked how the computers in an office can share files, the answer would be &quot;A network is required for computers to communicate with each other. An intranet should be set-up in star topology with a switch and a Network Interface Card (NIC) for each computer, to ensure optimum speed and reliability.&quot;

* Attempt as many previous papers as possible and pay attention to the technical terms used in the mark scheme.

* If the question ask for a specific number of points, do not attempt to answer more points. If the question asks for two points and the candidates answers four points, the first two would be taken as answers and graded accordingly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Ethers=

Ethers can be derived from alcohols. The functional group of ethers is '''R-O-R''' (instead of R-O-H in an alcohol). Ethers can be viewed as a water molecule in which both H atoms are replaced with alkyl groups. Ethers may exist in straight chain carbons (acyclic) or as part of a carbon ring (cyclic). 

[[Image:Etherexamples.gif|frame|center|Example ethers. MTBE is acyclic. THF is cyclic.]]

=Preparation of ethers=

===Synthesis of acyclic ethers===

Most acyclic ethers can be prepared using '''Williamson's synthesis'''. This involves reacting an alkoxide with a haloalkane. As stated previously, alkoxides are created by reacting an alcohol with metallic sodium or potassium, or a metal hydride, such as sodium hydride (NaH).  To minimize steric hindrance and achieve a good yield, the haloalkane must be a primary haloalkane.  This is because the mechanism is S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2, where the oxygen atom does a backside attack on the carbon atom with the halogen atom, causing the halogen atom to leave with its electrons.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Williamsonsynthesis.gif|frame|center|'''General Williamson synthesis''']] --&gt;

===Synthesis of cyclic ethers===
You can also use the Williamson synthesis to produce cyclic ethers. You need a molecule that has a hydroxyl group on one carbon and a halogen atom attached to another carbon.  This molecule will then undergo an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction with itself, creating a cyclic ether and a halogen anion.

=Properties of ethers=
==Acyclic ethers==

===Naming acyclic ethers===

Name the two sides of the ether as substituents, then add the word &quot;ether&quot; at the end.  For example, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-O-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is dimethyl ether.  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-O-C(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be called methyl ''tert''-butyl ether (MTBE) or ''tert''-butyl methyl ether (TBME).

===Cleavage of acyclic ethers===
Acyclic ethers can be cleaved by a strong acid, typically HI or HBr, but not HCl. The acid breaks the ether apart into an alcohol and an alkyl halide (a haloalkane.)  Cleavage of ethers by an acid was first seen by Alexander Butlerov in 1861, when he discovered that hydroiodic acid causes 2-ethoxypropanoic acid to break apart into iodoethane (ethyl iodide) and lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid.)  The mechanism used in acidic cleavage of ethers depends on whether they have primary, secondary, or tertiary groups attached to oxygen. If one of the carbons attached to the central oxygen atom is tertiary, benzylic (contains benzene ring), or allylic (contains carbon-carbon double bond), then the cleavage will occur via an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 or an E1 mechanism.  The E1 mechanism leads to an alcohol and an alkene instead of an alkyl halide. These reactions often take place around 0 degrees C.  On the other hand, if both groups attached to the central oxygen atom are primary or secondary, the reaction takes place via an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 mechanism.  These reactions are often conducted at 100 degrees C.

==Cyclic ethers==

Two common cyclic ethers are [[w:epoxide|epoxide]], which has two carbons each bonded to the oxygen atom; and [[w:tetrahydrofuran|tetrahydrofuran]], known by its abbreviation THF, which has four carbons and an oxygen atom.

==Species Diversity Introduction==

[[Wikipedia:en:Species Richness|Species Richness]] ('''s''') is a relative term that refers to the number of species in a community, and is directly associated with measuring the diversity of species in a given area. A related term, evenness (E), is another dimension of diversity that defines the number of individuals from each species in the same area. Together, these terms have been used to describe species diversity patterns on Earth.  

There are several hypotheses that have been proposed to explain species diversity patterns. Many of these hypotheses are based upon the idea that species are more diverse near the equator than near the poles.  In other words, there is a recognized latitudinal gradient of species diversity on Earth.  The hypotheses that support this latitudinal gradient can be divided into two groups: abiotic and biotic. The [[Wikipedia:en:biotic|biotic]] hypotheses are those that explain species diversity patterns with relation to living organisms.  The [[Wikipedia:en:abiotic|abiotic]] hypotheses, on the other hand, explain species diversity patterns with relation to non-living chemical and physical environmental factors.

==Abiotic Species Diversity Hypotheses==


Four commonly recognized abiotic hypotheses include:(1) '''The Time/Stability Hypothesis''', (2) '''The Area Hypothesis''', (3) '''The Productivity Hypothesis''', and (4) '''The Metabolic Hypothesis'''.

The '''Time/Stability Hypothesis''' suggests that diversity is directly related to the length of time that an area of land has been around. Specifically, land that has been around for a long time, undisturbed, tends to have more diversity, and is therefore more stable when compared to land that has been around for a short period of time.  For example, the land underneath a glacier that has just receded will be less diverse than land that never had a glacier.

'''The Area Hypothesis''' explains species diversity relative to land area. According to this hypothesis, the larger an area is, the more organisms it can support, which results in larger populations. Larger populations are characterized by fewer extinctions and more prevalent mutation events and are, consequently, more diverse.

'''The Productivity Hypothesis''' says that the more energy there is in a system, the more biomass there will be in that system. More biomass supports greater species diversity.

''' The Metabolic Hypothesis''' states that temperature has an impact on the metabolic rates of organisms. This expands on the idea that every population has a net energy flow that acts upon it. The main idea behind this hypothesis is that larger animals have relatively slower metabolic rates when compared to smaller animals . For example, a mouse must eat half of its body weight to keep from starving, while a human only needs to eat two percent of its body mass to live. 

This phenomenon is explained by several ideas. One idea is that larger animals have proportionately less surface area and lose heat more slowly. So, pound for pound, they need less food. The other idea is that larger animals and plants must transport nutrients further and, as a result, use them up more slowly than their smaller counterparts. 

'''The Metabolic Hypothesis''', however, suggests that '''Temperature''' may also have an impact on an animal’s metabolic rate. Research shows that a 5˚C rise in body temperature is roughly equal to a 150% increase in metabolic rate. This is true for a large range of organisms, including aerobic microbes, plants, multicellular invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Gillooly (2001) claims that the metabolic rates of these organisms are all derived from a general function using body size and temperature. [[Image:Paradisaea_raggiana.png|thumb|right|Body size, altitude, and diet account for 99.0% of the variation in the metabolic rates of birds of paradise.]]

According to '''The Metabolic Hypothesis''', organisms with faster metabolic rates have faster mutation rates. This is because they will change quicker and get through more generations more rapidly. Therefore, you would expect to see new species created in small organisms and warm environments.It has also been suggested that body size and temperature predict the density and growth rates of a population. This means that individuals in warmer environments consume resources more quickly, which results in fewer available resources and lower population densities. 
  

The Metabolic Hypothesis has broad implications. According to Brown (2004), the hypothesis is said to be able to predict anything from life history attributes, development rates, mortality rates, and life spans, to rates of competition and predation, populaion interactions, and patterns of species diversity. In addition, this hypothesis offers an explanation for the peak of biodiversity near the equator.[[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=535575]]


==Biotic Species Diversity Hypotheses==

There are three commonly recognized biotic species diversity hypotheses. They include: (1) '''The Heterogeneity Hypothesis''', (2) '''The Competition Hypothesis''', and (3) ''' The Predation Hypothesis'''.

'''The Heterogeneity Hypothesis''' suggests that the more spatially diverse the community is, the greater the species richness.

''' The Competition Hypothesis''' introduces the concept of '''r''' and '''k''' selection.  '''r-selected organisms''' are described as rapid growing organisms that have broad resource requirements and '''k-selected organisms''' are described as slow growing organisms that have narrow resource requirements.

'''The Predation Hypothesis''' says that predation opens up niches and reduces prey. Fewer prey lead to liberated resources which, if used by other species, leads to an increase in species richness.  The concept of a '''keystone species''' is important to this theory.  The keystone species is the species that a community is dependent upon and is often a predator.  The keystone species maintains stability of the community which will increase species richness.[[Image:Hawk eating prey edit.jpg|thumb|right|A hawk is an example of a keystone species as it eats its prey, the mouse]]


In evolutionary ecology there are many questions regarding variation in species diversity among different areas. In addition to the preeceding abiotic a biotic hypotheses, Emerson (2005){{ref|Emerson 2005}} predicts that species diversity can drive speciation and the prediction is supported strongly by the biogeographic theory. By controlling several physical features of the Canary and Hawaiian Islands, Emerson showed that the probability of extinction and speciation for each species on an island increased as the number of species increased.  Based on this analysis, species number was positively related to diversification and species richness. 

Hutchinson (1959){{ref|Hutchinson1959}} reports that there are so many animals on the planet because of three reasons: '''(1)'''The greater the length of food chain (greater species diversity), the more stable the environment is, '''(2)''' Smaller organisms undergo more evolutionary change due to large populations in which more mutations occur, '''(3)''' The greater number of [[Wikipedia:en:Ecological niche|niches]] available, the more species that can occupy them without competition. Communities of greater organism diversity and species richness will persist longer and outlast many communities that are less diverse, and have a shorter food chain.

==Rapoport's Rule==

[[Wikipedia:en:Rapoport's Rule|Rapoport's Rule]], named after [[Wikipedia:en:Eduardo H. Rapoport|Eduardo H. Rapoport]], was proposed by George C. Stevens in 1989 as an additional explanation for the already widely accepted notion that species richness has an inverse relationship with latitude. Rapoport's rule introduced the idea that the length of the geographical range of a species, relative to the north and south axis of the earth, plays an important role in the already acknowledged latitudinal gradient of species richness. Specifically, species at higher latitudes have a wider geographical range than species at lower latitudes{{ref|stevens1989}}.


The geographical range of a species refers to the range in latitudes, from north to south, in which a species can be found. This range is largely dependant upon climatic stresses in a given region. Accordingly, species in high latitudes have evolved to tolerate extreme and highly variable climatic conditions (i.e. temperature and precipitation) and therefore have a wider geographical range. Species in low-latitudes do not gain a competitive advantage by having such broad climatic tolerances and therefore occupy narrower geographical ranges{{ref|stevens1989}}. This distinction forms the premise behind Rapoport's rule.[[Image:Pejzaz_zimowy1.jpg‎|thumb|left|Species in higher latitudes evolve to tolerate extreme climatic conditions, resulting in a wider geographical ranges.]]


Assuming equal dispersal abilities of high and low latitude species, more low latitude species are randomly placed outside of their narrow geographic range than high latitude species.  As a result, more low latitude species are placed in environments that they are not well suited for.  These species, termed &quot;accidentals&quot;, &quot;artificially inflate species numbers and inhibit competitive exclusion.{{ref|stevens1989}}&quot;  In other words, &quot;accidentals&quot;  would normally be competitively excluded by the better adapted individuals in the same area, but due to the unique nature of narrow tropical geographic ranges, the success of the &quot;accidentals&quot; is only dependant upon their proximity to the areas in which they do well. Therefore, in lower latitudes, more species exist in habitats that they would normally not survive in. In accordance with Rapoport's rule,this phenomenon, called the &quot;rescue effect&quot;, accounts for the higher species diversity in the lower latitudes as compared to the higher latitudes{{ref|stevens1989}}.


Rapoport's rule, although widely acknowledged, faces criticism from related studies. There is considerable doubt that Rapoport's rule is actually a causatory agent of the latitudinal species richness gradient but is, rather, an artifact of the  phenomenon{{ref|kerr1999}}{{ref|gaston1998}}.  The methods and logic used by Stevens are especially scrutinized, every possible error drawn out{{ref|gaston1998}}{{ref|kerr1999}}. For example, it has been suggested that Stevens over-emphasized species richness patterns in higher-latitudes in comparison to lower latitudes, resulting in conclusions that are only applicable to local, rather than regional, patterns. Such gaps in Stevens' methodology and evidence leave Rapoport's rule open to inquiry. Also, many exceptions to the rule have been demonstrated. However, whether or not Stevens' conclusions are completely accurate, Rapoport's rule plays a significant role in the study of species richness patterns and raises questions that promote further studies.

  
==Diversity Measurements==
[[Image:Plants diversity.jpg|thumb|right|plant diversity, measure of the different plants in the community.]]
Diversity is measured for three main reasons: '''(1)''' to measure stability to determine if an environment is degrading, '''(2)''' to compare two or more environments, and '''(3)''' to eliminate the need for extensive lists.  Diversity indices provide important information about the composition of a community. These indices not only measure species richness, but also take into account the relative abundance of species, or evenness. When measuring species diversity, species richness and evenness must always both be considered. In addition, indices provide important information about species rarity and commonness in a population. These are important and common tools used by biologists in order to understand community structure.

There are many indicies that can be used to calculate diversity.  Some of the more valuable indicies that calculate diversity include the following: (1) &lt;u&gt;'''Berger Index'''&lt;/u&gt;, (2) &lt;u&gt;'''Simpson's Index,'''&lt;/u&gt; [[http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/simpsons.htm]]which calculates the probability that two organisms sampled from a community of will belong to different species, (3)&lt;u&gt; '''Shannon-Weiner Index,'''&lt;/u&gt; [[http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/shannonDI.html]]which accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present,  and (4) &lt;u&gt;'''Species Evenness Index'''&lt;/u&gt;.
Each of the indicies uses different mathematical approaches/calculations to test/calculate diversity between two or more communities. These tools for measuring diversity are often used when determining community similarity, ethnic diversity, and biological diversity.   

To learn more about the diversity indices, read [[Wikipedia:en:Diversity index|Diversity index]].


In addition to the previous indices, ecologists employ rank abundance curves, which are graphs ranking the most abundant species to the least abundant. They can be shown as a plot of number of species vs. number of individuals on a logarithmic scale that usually yields a normal distribution.  This is because environments are usually undersampled, resulting in many singlets,especially in high diversity systems. Singlets make up the middle peak of the distribution, and the more sampling that is performed, the more the curve will shift to the right. [[Image:Timor Coral Reef.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Coral reefs are the home to so many species that undersampling is likely to occur. Estimators can help make up for species that are underrepresented.]]The number of unsampled species in cases of undersampling can be roughly estimated using the Chao estimator, in which S&lt;sub&gt;estimate&lt;/sub&gt; = S&lt;sub&gt;observed&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 2F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of singletons sampled, and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of doublets. There is also a method of estimating what percent of the total species is represented in a sample, called Good's coverage estimator, in which Coverage = 1 - (number of individuals in species / total number of individuals).  These estimator equations allow researchers to have a good idea of how their limited sampling relates to the entire sampled population.

Measurements of species diversity are constantly being improved and/or critiqued by ecologists. Hurlbert (1971){{ref|6}} argued that species diversity itself is a &quot;nonconcept&quot; and that theoretic results are not dependable.  His view is that ecologists should abandon the &quot;poorly defined&quot; idea of diversity completely, as well as diversity indices, and rely more on direct observation.  He came up with alternate equations called &quot;species composition parameters&quot; that are more direct than diversity indices.  Although he thought these equations are more reliable than diversity indices, he still stated that they shouldn't be strongly depended upon in research.  Soetaert and Heip (1990){{ref|9}}  also argued that species indices are not always accurate, but worked on finding a way to improve results.  They approached the issue of sample-size dependence of diversity indices.  They found that this dependence is highest for more diverse communities and those with more rare species.  This is something that can be taken into account during sampling and utilization of the indices.  Such endeavors to improve measurements of diversity have and will continue to improve ecological research methods as a whole.

== How To Install ==

{{User:Whiteknight/Gadget Instructions|graph.js|ff=yes|ie7=maybe|safari=no}}

== About This Gadget ==

This gadget uses javascript to automatically create and display simple line graphs. It currently only works in firefox, and there is no easy method for me to expand compatibility to IE. This is because IE does not contain functions for graphing or drawing like FireFox does.

== To Do ==

*try to fix IE support.

== Version History ==

*1.1 Partial IE support. It isn't pretty, and it's very fragile, but it basically works for some display settings. 
*1.0 First stable version

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

SDL Trados strangelys lack a global find and replace function. With recent versions, the unsupported Glue program can be used to merge and then unmerge files for a similar effect, though this may not be the best environment for some situations. If there are only a few files, this is not a problem, but when there are hundreds of files, such as for a large Website, a replace function is essential. This describes using Macromedia Dreamweaver 2004 MX for Tag Editor files.

Rainbow offers a find and replace function, but it is not very user friendly and does not show you each instance of the item being replaced. It's often the case that you need to look at each instance of a word before replacing it.

Because ttx (SDL Trados) is based on XML, Macromedia Dreamweaver works to search and replace. Like MS Word, it unfortunately does not allow you to look at what happens when you do a replacement, but it has a powerful &quot;Find all&quot; function that will generate a hyperlinked list of all instances of the expression being searched for.

Dreamweaver also includes match case (i.e., capitalization vs. small letters), match whole word, ignore white space, and regular expression (wildcard) options. Dreamweaver is Unicode compatible. This article was based on files translated from Japanese to English.

[http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/ Dreamweaver] currently sells for US $399, which is obviously quite expensive for merely a search and replace tool. It is an excellent tool for creating and editing Websites. This page was written based on version MX 2004. The latest version is CS4.

== Using Dreamweaver ==
''Change extensions''

Before Dreamweaver can be used on ttx files, the extension must be changed to xml. If there are many files, a program like Extension Renamer ([http://www.softplatz.com/Soft/Utilities/File-Disk/Extension-renamer.html SoftPlatz download page]) can be used to rename all the files in a directory. When doing this, back up the files first because Extension Renamer does not have an undo function.

Tip: Extension Renamer can be confusing to use. To change htm.ttx files to htm.ttx.xml, type *.htm.ttx in the &quot;From&quot; field and htm.ttx.xml in the &quot;To&quot; field. To reverse this process, type *.htm.ttx.xml in the &quot;From&quot; field and htm.ttx in the &quot;To&quot; field.

''Create local site''

In Dreamweaver, create a new site. Use the advanced tab to identify the location of the files (select the folder, not the files) and give a name. That's all that is needed.

'''Warning: Tagged files are complex documents, filled with a lot of formatting information and a small amount of actual text. If you have never used Microsoft Notepad or a similar basic text editor to edit html files, it is recommended you take an online course in html to become familiar with how tags work. Even after doing so, it is recommended you edit one or two files in Dreamweaver and check your work to ensure you do not corrupt a file. Always create backup files before editing.'''

''Search and replace''

The search and replace has to be done both in the source code and the text. It is unusual to have relevant hits in the text, but they do occur on occasion. Also, note that the find and replace box has an irritating habit of changing from &quot;Text&quot; back to &quot;Source code&quot;. This can become confusing, so it may be more efficient to do all replacements in the source code and then do them in the text.

When double-clicking on a link in the Find window after a Find All command, sometimes the selection does not appear. Double-click on the link again and it will appear, highlighted.

Tag Editor has a bug (or perhaps a feature) that sometimes changes the font in the middle of a target segment. This may happen between words or in the middle of a word. This font change is included in the xml file, so in many cases you will be unable to find target words for search and replace. This error does not appear to occur in source segments, so it is recommended that search and replace be performed using the source.

Doing search and replace can be very dangerous because you are working with the source code, and if you change part of the ttx code, you can damage the file. It is a good idea to view the source of your files and compare them to the text in Dreamweaver a few times so you become familiar with the tags used.

''Headings''

Searching for headings: Headings are written in html as &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;, etc. In the files used to write this article, it was found that these are displayed as DisplayText=&quot;h1&quot;, DisplayText=&quot;h2&quot;, DisplayText=&quot;h3&quot;, etc. Searching for DisplayText=&quot;h1&quot; will result in two hits, one for the open and one for the close of each pair of h1 tags. Note that the &quot;match case&quot; option should not be used for heading and other tags because html ignores case in headings, so some might be &quot;H1&quot; and others &quot;h1&quot;.

''Restore files''

After all your edits are complete, use the extension renaming utility to eliminate the &quot;xml&quot; extension. Then view the files in Tag Editor to ensure all the files have been edited correctly. Clean up as normal.

# Use the Phillips head to remove the screw holding the ashtray to the dash and unplug its light.
# Remove the four Phillips head screws holding the center console and leaf it up and out.  There are two screws on the back sides, you will need to put the seats all the way forward.  The other two are in the front were the dashboard meets the center console.
# Now remove the four Phillips head screws holding the shifter information panel in place (but don't try to remove it).
# Now while the car engine is off and e-brake engaged, put the shifter into Drive. Now remove the two Phillips head screws on the back side of it.
# Now look that the base were the shifter goes into the shifter rod, there are two wires there.  Cut them wile leaving some slack to twist the new shifter wires.
# Pull the shifter out, the button should pop out so be ready to catch it.
# Drop the new shifter onto the shifter rod
# Now lift the shifter up off of the rod about and inch and push the shifter button with the spring into its hole and put the shifter all the way down the road.
# Now put the two screw back in the back of the shifter.

::Hmm... I see you have st up a few already. Are you sure you want all the various Reading room subpages archived into one common archive? Just checking up if it's really what you want, plus I'll have to generate the secret keys mentioned in the instructions.

:::That's the way we've always done it. The &quot;Reading Room&quot; used to be a single page instead of multiple discussion pages, so when we made sub-pages, we kept all the archives together. I think that the important thing is that links to the various archives are kept at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives]] for reference, but those links can be easily updated no matter where the actual pages are located. If it's easier to use sub-page archiving, we can probably do it that way instead. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:58, 16 October 2007 (UTC)
::::The bot just had a test run. However, I noticed that archives created were both date-based as well as counter-based. [[Special:Contributions/MiszaBot]] - was this intended?

:::::We're still working out the details, so everything is fine on your end. We will figure out how we want the archives to be done. Everything looks good, as far as I can tell.

== bot template ==

There's no reason we can't have 2. I like the old one better, so I spruced it up a bit with the fancy linkage, and restored [[User:Mike's bot account]] to use {{tlx|User bot|Mike.lifeguard}}. Thanks for your effort though. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:10, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

== Regarding &quot;Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance&quot; bot activities ==

In regard to the recent history of &quot;Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance&quot;, I have noticed that the bot removed threads but never archived them and is removing pending actions (actions expecting closure from administrators) if the bot can't comply with this distinction (it will be hard to make a exclusion for the rules), the best approach will be restraining it from acting on pages were closing issues must require human intervention (like it is done on the VfD page), I haven't checked any other edits the bot has made on this page but it is possible that the archive is corrupted (missing some posts).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:03, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

:Ok problem partially solved (found the archives and added them to the archives menu), what is the pont of archiving if the pages aren't made known to Wikibookians ? Anyway is there an option to prevent a thread from being archived ? Txs --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:16, 4 October 2008 (UTC)
:Moved some non archived threads to November 2007 archive page also... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:43, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

== Key needed ==

Please provide us with a key for [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals]], as it appears that someone copied it from the general reading room.  It should be archiving to the same location as the other reading rooms, so we won't be archiving to a subpage and therefore need a key. Thanks. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:04, 12 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you have read classics or other older stories aimed at an adult audience, you have probably seen physical descriptions like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jack was a lanky, spindly old fellow, with arms like twigs. His feet resembled shovels. He had buck teeth that stuck out and smiled contently at you like a grinning bunny, and a tongue like a Popsicle stick. Jack had crows'-feet above his cabbage green currant-like eyes that peered out at you from above his pipe. His snipe nose seemed to sneer at you. There was a rick in Jack's spine as he walked. A white beard of fog billowed around his mouth, right below his double chin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is something Dickensian about this kind of description. The writer has almost succeeded at making Jack look like a cartoon character. This style of writing gives the entire story, in fact, a timelessly rustic feel. It does not go well with the contemporary, cosmopolitan, unexaggerated feel of the world of adolescent fiction. Not every character will be beautiful of course, but to fit the timbre of the genre the characters should have about the same number of quirks as ordinary real people have.

When you are writing your stories, you will come to develop your own style, whether your descriptions read something like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stacy's tresses of silky blonde hair were fit neatly into a stunning chignon. Her deep-set chocolate brown eyes looked at you like a puppy dog. The girl had a pixie-like nose that dropped daintily down from its peak. Her Cupid's-bow red lips surrounded her small mouth with perfect alabaster teeth. Dimples were pressed under Stacy's high cheekbones. Her soft hands with long fingers terminated in painted, polished mauve nails. She stood at 5'5&quot; and had a voluptuous figure that poured into a nice hourglass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

or like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jim had messy brown hair, blue eyes, freckles and braces. He was 5'8&quot; tall and weighed 160 pounds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two styles have different flavors to them. The first description has a more soap-opera-y feel and sounds written by a feminine writer. The second description gives the picture of a more masculine writer.

==Putting physical traits into action==

If you first meet a character in Chapter 3, describing her physical traits presents no problem, as you can just tell the reader as soon as she appears that she has curly black hair, brown eyes, a big nose, braces, a triangular chin and a stocky figure.

But what about the central character or a second character who is introduced right at the beginning of the story? If you began your story with the paragraph &quot;Janet Myers had red hair in a ponytail and hazel eyes . . .&quot;, you would sort of be giving the impression that this was the most important thing about the character or a central theme in the story. And it would sound odd if five chapters into your story, you suddenly started going into a complete lowdown on the central character's facial features, coloring, height and weight.

You can still find a way to get the physical traits of a person covered one at a time. Just describe the person's body parts when a mention of the body part comes up. If your character has to rub dirt off her nose, you could write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rashida vigorously rubbed all the dirt off of her broken nose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If your character is freeing his leg that got jambed in a closed door, you could write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mike pulled his big hands out of his sleeves to free his stocky leg from the door.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some writers do find a time and place to describe their character in the middle of their short story, novella or novel, however. In ''The Escape'' by Logan Feys, for instance, Feys writes, 1,000 words into the story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At first glance, Mitch would seem to the casual observer to be a rather normal fifteen-year-old. Nothing in particular about his physical appearance was striking. His facial features were smooth, rounded, and unassuming. In subtle ways, however, he looked a bit unusual. He was a little shorter than average. His hair was dark and soft. He didn't cut it as short as most boys did. Instead, he allowed it to grow thick enough to develop natural waves and curls. He  wore plain, solid-colored shirts and pants — nothing “loud,” nothing “hip,” nothing bearing popular sports team logos or name-brand insignias.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Avoiding the easel gesture==

The easel gesture is a gesture or tic that the character does to give the writer a convenient excuse to add some physical description. Suppose you began a novel and it started out with this sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beth looked again into the mirror, scrunched up her bob nose, and walked away towards the shower.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why did the writer have Beth scrunch up her nose? Is it to tell the reader that she has a bob nose? Eager writers often fall into this trap, eager young writers among them. One particular easel gesture that is common in teen-written fiction is having a character run her fingers through her hair just so you can tell the reader what color her hair is.

There are ways you can write a character's gestures and make sure that his gestures are genuine. Facial expressions are with us every moment of our lives. Even when we feel no emotion at all or are sleeping, we wear the neutral expression on our faces. When your character makes a facial expression that represents the appropriate emotion, you may describe the parts of the face that are moving. If your character has bushy eyebrows, you could write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Brian listened to Whitney repeat what she had said, and his face looked truly puzzled. His bushy eyebrows arched high up above his eyes. Could she have possibly meant what he heard her say?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many gestures are used to communicate, in place of words. We nod our heads when we want to answer a question yes. When we circle our hands around one side of our heads, we are saying someone is crazy. We put our faces in our hands when we feel like breaking down. If you have a character use body language in a natural way, you get an opportunity for physical description:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Laura Ann pointed with the stubby index finger of her right hand to the sushi bar. The stranger thanked her for giving him directions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Everyone has bad habits of some sort, be it pulling at hangnails, interrupting people or reading in the bathroom for hours on end. If you give your character a bad habit that involves some part of his body, you can describe the body part when you have your character do it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously nervous, Greg began twirling his shoulder-length brown hair around again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Describing by associations==

Physical traits can also be mentioned when a character (either the character whose physical traits are being described or another character) reflects on the traits and their aesthetic and social significance. Consider the following paragraph:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mercedes shook her head as Aleeciah and Ashley walked off with their faux leopard purses. While they were tall at 5'6&quot; and 5'8&quot; respectively, she stood at only 5'1&quot;. While they had bouncy, blonde hair and blue eyes, her hair was greasy and dark brown and her eyes hazel. Those two girls wore ribbed baby tees in pink and white, while Mercedes was decked out in a choker necklace, black leggings and a black peasant dress that left everything to the imagination. She thought about the way they could find an endless well of idle chat for any situation, while she always felt as if the cat had her tongue when she needed something to talk about. They drove a Jeep Wrangler and a Jeep Cherokee, while her parents never even bought her her own car on her sixteenth birthday.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You've managed to work in Mercedes' height, her eye color and a description of her hair, all in one paragraph in the middle of the story. Pretty good!

Similar is when you reflect on the ramifications of a character's height and/or weight:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Miranda stood with her mouth wide open and her face frozen as she watched Jeff do his phys ed assignment. She didn't understand how a boy who weighed 95 pounds could be lifting the 30-pound weights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Having another character describe==

In real life, we sometimes tell another person what someone looks like. If your character goes missing and someone files a missing person report, or if one of his friends needs to point him out to one of her friends in a crowd, or if a girl is describing that hot new guy she met to her female friends, you can get a chance to have a character describe even your central characters and let the reader know how they look:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Sandy, Ashley, I've got to introduce you to Joey while we're here,&quot; Loelia said as her two friends' eyes glossed over the mass of partygoers standing around. &quot;He's the boy with the blonde ducktail, blue eyes and goatee wearing the blue ski jacket, torn jeans, flip-flops and green visor&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Disagreements among characters can also give you a picture of what the character may look like:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Lindsay's the thin girl with a blonde ponytail, green eyes and big hands wearing the black tank top, shorts and moccasins with yin-yang earrings,&quot; Karen explained to Dave..&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Lindsay's hair isn't blonde,&quot; said Laqueisha with a this-is-absurd tone in her voice, &quot;It's brown.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Style==

You may or may not want to include things like the size of your character's hands or the shape of her ears. But you should definitely make a mention of such things as facial hair, jewelry, piercings, tattoos, nail paint, face paint or bindis if your character has them. Things like the firmness of a character's chin or how close together his eyes are don't tell you anything about your character's personality, except through stereotypes that may not have any basis in reality. But a person consciously chooses to grow a goatee, or to wear an ankh necklace, or to get a tattoo (and chooses what the tattoo should be of). If nothing else, points of style will always tell you about a character's taste.

If you have a character who is not the central character, you should definitely describe these things when a character comes up (unless he has tattoos or a navel ring or nipple ring that are hidden from view, in which case you can have the other character find out about them later).

If this is the character who appears at the beginning of the story, there are other ways to tell the reader about it. You can have your character cleaning out her navel ring (and her navel after she's taken it out of it). When your character with a beard gets up in the morning, have him trim his red beard. When she gets dressed, have her put on her puka necklace.

Accessories (as well as clothes) can also come up with discrimination. If a restaurateur refuses to let Stephanie in because of her septum ring, that gives you an opportunity to let the reader know she is pierced. Max could brush up against the high school principal if the latter tells him that the school dress code forbids him to wear that gothic face paint.

==Sartorial description==

With sartorial description, you have a lot of leeway in how much and how often to describe. You can describe what a character is wearing in every scene, in full detail. Or you can just describe your character's clothes in the first scene in which she or he appears, and imply that that is typical.

Consider describing the color of each garment: a black T-shirt, a white T-shirt and a yellow T-shirt have three distinct feelings to them. Your readers might even be curious to know whether Mark is wearing a green-and-blue-striped polo shirt or a green-and-white-striped polo shirt. Colors all have different associations, pink being bubbly and girly, beige being suave, orange being earthy with a 70's vibe to it, teal being grungy, but older writers be informed: black clothes are no longer the exclusive domain of morbid or &quot;loner&quot; type youth. Go to any high school that doesn't have uniforms today and black is as basic as blue or white. That brings up another point: less common colors, such as yellow or purple, will be connected with the kids who really stand out.

Perhaps a character has a favorite army jacket or baseball cap that she or he wears in every scene. That can be her or his trademark. If so, you can mention it the first few times the character pops up, then stop mentioning it. Some people wear the same thing every day -- if so, you can just mention in the first scene that that Justin always wears khakis and a black turtleneck, or that Liisa appears in her usual leather jacket, jeans with the knees torn and Birkenstocks. Other people dress differently on different days -- if so, you can describe what Tiffany is wearing each day to exposit her full variety of moods. Or maybe you have a character who appears in a dress shirt to school, but wears tie-dye T-shirts on the week-ends. Contrasting the two scenes can tell you something about his chameleonic attitude.

Maybe your character always wears preppy clothes, or consistently dresses like a punk, or is perpetually decked out in hip-hop garb. You might simply say that the character is &quot;wearing preppy clothes&quot; (or whatever), rather than listing the specific items of clothing. 

If it's been a while since you attended high school, drive up to your local high school around lunchtime when the students are out and around, and check out the clothes. Find out what articles of clothing are the most common, what percentage of the teens are wearing different colors, and what brand names show up (for you Gen Xers out there, Nike has taken a hit in popularity since you went to school). Then if you want to write a story set in the present day, the assortment and distribution of different clothing styles will sound authentic. (Of course, if you're zeroing in on a select group of gothic students or your story revolves around the &quot;mean girls&quot;, you'll want to overrepresent one particular style, but if you want your characters to represent a cross-section, you better be prepared to observe how the whole student body looks.)

I was going to revert the verbiage -- but I actually like it!  &quot;Unless they are undead beginners,...&quot;  I love it.  Adds character.  Much better than Nunn's.  [[User:ThreeE|ThreeE]] 02:33, 9 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Foreword ==

The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) has calculated that of
the 5,210 disasters recorded in the world between 1991 and 2005, 2,029 (approximately 40
percent) have occurred in the Asia-Pacific region. Several other reports have stated that in the last
three years alone, the region has been prone to more natural disasters than in the last three
decades. Earthquakes across Indonesia and other countries in the region have now become
annual occurrences for the last three years, particularly in areas along the Sumatra fault, the origin
of the earthquake that spawned the 2004 tsunami. The year 2006 was also notable in that the
Pacific typhoon season ran year-round, causing considerable physical damage and loss of life in
many Asian countries, including China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Philippines,
the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam.
The consequences of natural and man-made disasters and the vulnerabilities to which
populations are exposed can be mitigated if they are targeted proactively. Though one must
always remember that it is not always possible to completely eliminate a risk,extensive experience
and practice in the past few decades have demonstrated that the damage caused by any disaster
can be minimized largely by careful planning, mitigation and prompt action.
In this context, information and communications technology (ICT) can potentially play a pivotal
role in disaster prevention, mitigation and management. Remote sensing for early warning is
made possible by various available technologies, including telecommunication satellites, radar,
telemetry and meteorology. ICT encompasses both traditional media (radio, television) as well as
new media (cell broadcasting, Internet, satellite radio), all of which can play a major role in
educating the public on the risks of a potential or impending disaster. Before disasters strike, ICTs
are used as a conduit for disseminating information on an impending danger, thereby making it
possible to take the necessary precautions to mitigate the impact of these disasters. In order for
this to be possible, it is critical that there be consistency in the application of ICT and the
dissemination of warning messages to at-risk areas. Such warning dissemination must be
widespread and should educate the public on the potential risks to the local area.No matter how
expensive or sophisticated, a warning system can never be totally effective without an education
component.
Furthermore, ICT plays a critical role in facilitating the reconstruction process and in
coordinating the return of those displaced by disasters to their original homes and communities.
Disaster management activities, in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, can be made more
effective by the use of appropriate ICT tools. These include tools for resource management and
tracking, communication under emergency situations (e.g. use of Internet communications),
collecting essential items for the victims, and national and international fundraising.
Since the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC)
together with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) have taken initiatives to study the
current situation of emergency communications in the Asia-Pacific countries and to give
recommendation on national emergency telecommunication and national early warning system
setups. Assessments were conducted in Bangladesh,Maldives and Sri Lanka on these emergency
communication systems. To enhance early warning systems, ADPC, under the Indian Ocean
Early-Warning System programme, also introduced the Tsunami Alert Rapid Notification System
Programme with emphasis on robust ICT systems to disseminate information and warnings from
the national to the community level.
In line with this, I am pleased to introduce this e-Primer brought to you by the United Nations
Development Programme’s Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) and
the Asian and Pacific Training Centre for Information and Communication Technology for
Development (APCICT). I am confident that this e-Primer will play an effective role in enhancing
and propagating awareness of various ICT tools and will serve as a guide to policy makers,
disaster management practitioners and media personnel on how best to use ICT tools to
successfully counter the threat of disaster.

== Introduction ==

The term ‘disaster’, meaning ‘bad star’ in Latin, is defined as an impact of a natural or man-made hazard that causes human suffering or creates human needs that the victims cannot alleviate
without assistance.The word’s root is from astrology and implies that when the stars are in a bad position, a bad event is about to happen. In a recent document published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the Americas, a disaster is defined as ’a social crisis
situation occurring when a physical phenomenon of natural, socio-natural or anthropogenic
origin negatively impacts vulnerable populations ... causing intense, serious and widespread
disruption of the normal functioning of the affected social unit.'{{ictdmcite|1}}
According to another widespread definition, disasters occur when hazards strike in vulnerable areas.{{ictdmcite|2}}

In development circles today, disaster management is often treated holistically rather than as a
single issue. It is an essential component of any development framework. Proper disaster
management has been recognized as a key requirement towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) by the specified target of 2015, as illustrated in Figure 1.Meanwhile,
information and communications technology for development (ICT4D).{{ictdmcite|3}} has been recognized as one of the key enablers for achieving the MDGs.

Recent events have shown that there is no country that does not stand the threat of a disaster,
though they may be threatened at different levels.Therefore, disaster preparedness is no longer
a choice; it is mandatory irrespective of where one lives. As shown in Figure 2, the Asia-Pacific region is one of the most risk-prone areas for disasters, based on disaster occurrences
since 1995.

Risk types vary and increase depending on a country’s geographic location. For instance,
countries like China, Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan are prone to earthquakes. Small island states
in the Pacific region and countries like the Maldives are prone to various types of threats from
the sea. Bangladesh and parts of China and India experience floods each year. Figure 3 shows
how different types of disasters are distributed across regions, while Figure 4 highlights some of
the worst disasters mankind has faced over the past 30 years.

Louvain – Brussels-Belgium, 2004.

Some countries have also encountered man-made hazards recently (e.g. river pollution in
China). Environmental pollution taking place today could be the origin of many man-made
disasters in the coming years. In addition, with the increased mobility of people, there is always the danger of a serious outbreak of a fatal disease (e.g. avian flu, mad cow disease and SARS). This too may lead to disastrous situations.</text>

== Disaster Management ==

There are no standardized rules defining the different phases of the disaster management cycle.
Different agencies use different cycles depending upon their objectives. However, while
approaches vary, it is agreed that disaster management activities should be carried out in a
cycle. Figure 5 illustrates the phases of the disaster management cycle, which are described as
follows:
* Mitigation: any activity that reduces either the chance of a hazard taking place or a hazard
turning into disaster.
* Risk reduction: anticipatory measures and actions that seek to avoid future risks as a result
of a disaster.
* Prevention: avoiding a disaster even at the eleventh hour.
* Preparedness: plans or preparations made to save lives or property, and help the response
and rescue service operations. This phase covers implementation/operation, early warning
systems and capacity building so the population will react appropriately when an early
warning is issued.
* Response: includes actions taken to save lives and prevent property damage, and to
preserve the environment during emergencies or disasters. The response phase is the
implementation of action plans.
* Recovery: includes actions that assist a community to return to a sense of normalcy after
a disaster.

'''Figure 5: The Disaster Management Cycle'''
{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[File:The Disaster Management Cycle.jpg|600px]]
|}

These six phases usually overlap. ICT is used in all the phases, but the usage is more apparent in some phases than in others.

==Why Disaster Management==
Disaster mBold textanagement (also called disaster risk management) is the discipline that involves preparing, warning, supporting and rebuilding societies when natural or man-made disasters occur. It is the continuous process by which all individuals, groups and communities manage hazards in an effort to avoid or minimize the impact of disasters resulting from hazards. Effective disaster management relies on thorough integration of emergency plans at all levels of government and non-government involvement. Activities at each level (individual, group, community) affect the other levels.

Events over the last two years have shown that there is no country that does not stand the threat of a disaster. Countries like China, Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan are prone to earthquakes. Small Islands States in the Pacific region and countries like Maldives are prone to various types of threats from the sea. Bangladesh and parts of China and India experience floods each year. Therefore, disaster preparedness is no longer a choice; it is mandatory irrespective of where one lives.

==Disaster Management and the MDGs==
It is somewhat surprising that no Millennium Development Goal1 (MDG) directly addresses the issues related to disaster management. Perhaps it is because it is so obvious that building a safer world is a prerequisite for the achievement of all the eight MDGs. Poverty eradication, freedom from hunger, primary education, freedom from disasters, and building a sustainable world etc. are all key aspects of the disaster management process. It has been shown that any nation should have effective disaster reduction and recovery processes in place to achieve the MDGs by the expected deadline of year 2015.

==ICT for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Preparedness==

The first important steps towards reducing disaster impact are to correctly analyse the
potential risk and identify measures that can prevent, mitigate or prepare for emergencies.
ICT can play a significant role in highlighting risk areas, vulnerabilities and potentially affected
populations by producing geographically referenced analysis through, for example, a
geographic information system (GIS). The importance of timely disaster warning in mitigating
negative impacts can never be underestimated. For example, although damage to property
cannot be avoided, developed countries have been able to reduce loss of life due to disasters
much more effectively than their counterparts in the developing world (see Table 1). A key
reason for this is the implementation of effective disaster warning systems and evacuation
procedures used by the developed countries, and the absence of such measures in the
developing world.

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:landslip.jpg|600px]]

''A major landslip after the earthquake in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan''

'''Table 1: Comparison of Damage Caused by Three Recent Disasters'''
{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:table1dm.jpg|600px]]
|}
''Sources: BBC: http://news.bbc.co.uk; Central Bank of Sri Lanka: http://www.cbsl.lk; http://www.pakquake.com; US National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov''

All the figures reported in Table 1 are rough estimates as it is impossible to have exact figures in
such situations. However, Table 1 clearly shows that in the case of Hurricane Katrina, although
the economic loss and damage to property were much higher, the number of deaths was
remarkably less than that resulting from the Indian Ocean tsunami in Sri Lanka and the Pakistan
earthquake. This is largely because in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the victims were mainly
communities living below the poverty line – a factor that significantly contributed to their
vulnerability – and because effective disaster warning systems were not in place. In New
Orleans, official warnings were dispatched in advance and many in the affected areas were
evacuated in time. In addition, the disaster management process was much better than what it
had been in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, despite the heavy criticism it received.

A warning can be defined as the communication of information about a hazard or threat to a
population at risk, in order for them to take appropriate actions to mitigate any potentially
negative impacts on themselves, those in their care and their property (Samarajiva et al., 2005).

The occurrence of a hazard does not necessarily result in a disaster.While hazards cannot be
avoided, their negative impacts can be mitigated. The goal of early public warning is to ensure
to the greatest extent possible that the hazard does not become a disaster. Such warnings must
be unambiguous, communicate the risks succinctly and provide necessary guidance.

The success of a warning can be measured by the actions that it causes people to take, such as
evacuation or avoiding at-risk areas. In a disaster situation, there is no doubt that timely
warnings allow people to take actions that save lives, reduce damage to property and minimize
human suffering. To facilitate an effective warning system, there is a major need for better
coordination among the early warning providers as well as those handling logistics and raising
awareness about disaster preparedness and management.

While disaster warnings are meant to be a public good, they are often most effectively delivered
through privately-owned communication networks and devices. There are many new
communication technologies that allow warning providers not only to reach the people at risk
but also to personalize their warning message to a particular situation. Opportunities are
available right now to significantly reduce loss of life and potential economic hardship if
disaster warning systems can be improved.

It is important to note that disaster warning is indeed a system, not a singular technology,
constituting the identification, detection and risk assessment of the hazard, the accurate
identification of the vulnerability of a population at risk, and finally, the communication of information about the threat to the vulnerable population in sufficient time and clarity so that
they can take action to avert negative consequences. This final component underscores the
importance of education and creating awareness in the population so that they may respond
with the appropriate actions (Samarajiva et al., 2005).

===Key Players in Disaster Warning===

The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) identifies several
key parties that play major roles in the disaster management process, especially in disaster
warning (UN/ISDR, 2006).

'''Communities''', particularly those most vulnerable, are vital to people-centred early warning
systems. Their input into system design and their ability to respond ultimately determine the
extent of risk associated with natural hazards. Communities should be aware of hazards and
potential negative impacts to which they are exposed and be able to take specific actions to
minimize the threat of loss or damage. As such, the geographic location of a community is an
essential determinant in the selection of disasters on which the system should focus their
community education.For example, coastal communities need to be educated and prepared for
the possibility of a tsunami, while a mountain community can be educated to respond to an
early warning system for landslides.

'''Local governments''' should have considerable knowledge of the hazards to which their
communities are exposed. They must be actively involved in the design and maintenance of
early warning systems, and understand information received to be able to advise, instruct or
engage the local population in a manner that increases their safety and reduces the potential
loss of resources on which the community depends.

'''National governments''' are responsible for policies and frameworks that facilitate early
warning, in addition to the technical systems necessary for the preparation and issuance of
timely and effective hazard warnings for their respective countries. They should ensure that
warnings and related responses are directed towards the most vulnerable populations through
the design of holistic disaster response and early warning frameworks that address the specific
needs of the related micro- and macro-level actors. The provision of support to local
communities and local governments to develop operational capabilities is an essential function
to translate early warning knowledge into risk reduction practices.

'''Regional institutions''' and organizations should provide specialized knowledge and advice in
support of national efforts to develop or sustain the operational capabilities of countries that
share a common geographical environment. Regional organizations are crucial to linking
international capabilities to the particular needs of individual countries and in facilitating
effective early warning practices among adjacent countries.

'''International bodies''' should provide support for national early warning activities and foster
the exchange of data and knowledge between individual countries. Support may include the
provision of advisory information, technical assistance, and policy and organizational support
necessary to ensure the development and operational capabilities of national authorities or
agencies responsible for early warning practice.

'''Non-governmental organizations''' (NGOs) play a critical role in raising awareness among
individuals and organizations involved in early warning and in the implementation of early
warning systems, particularly at the community level. In addition, they play an important
advocacy role to help ensure that early warning stays on the agenda of government policy
makers.

'''The private sector''' has a diverse role to play in early warning, including developing early
warning capabilities in their own organizations. The private sector is also essential as they are
usually better equipped to implement ICT-based solutions. The private sector has a large
untapped potential to help provide skilled services in the form of technical manpower,
know-how, or donations of goods or services (in-kind and cash), especially for the
communication, dissemination and response elements of early warning.

'''The media''' plays an important role in improving the disaster consciousness of the general
population and in disseminating early warnings.The media can be the critical link between the
agency providing the warning and the general public.

'''The scientific community''' has a critical role in providing specialized scientific and technical
input to assist governments and communities in developing early warning systems. Their
expertise is critical to analysing the risks communities face from natural hazards, supporting the
design of scientific and systematic monitoring and warning services, fostering data exchange,
translating scientific or technical information into comprehensible messages, and disseminating
understandable warnings to those at risk.

===Channels Used for Disaster Warning===
The following are some of the media – both traditional and new – that can be effectively used
for disaster warning purposes. Some may be more effective than the rest, depending on the
nature of the disaster, the regions affected, the socio-economic status of the affected
communities and their political architecture. However, it is not a question of one medium
against another. All are means to a common goal of passing along disaster warnings as quickly
and as accurately as possible. Any one or combination of the following media can be used for
that purpose.

====''Radio and Television''====
Considered the most traditional electronic media used for disaster warning, radio and television
have a valid use. The effectiveness of these two media is high because even in developing
countries and rural environments where the tele-density is relatively low, they can be used to
spread a warning quickly to a broad population.The only possible drawback of these two media
is that their effectiveness is significantly reduced at night, when they are normally switched off.
A study on media, perception and disaster-related behaviour in Bangladesh revealed that early,
easily understandable and language-appropriate warning dissemination through radio can
reduce the potential death toll of catastrophic cyclone and tidal bore. The study, conducted by
the Forum for Development, Journalism and Communication Studies, recommended that
relevant authorities develop innovative warning signal systems and take necessary steps to
disseminate the warning in easily understood language through radio at least two days before
a cyclone hits, hence mitigating the loss of lives and property every year in Bangladesh.
Mohammad Sahid Ullah, the Chittagong University professor who led the study, suggests that
part of the process is increasing public confidence in broadcast media since self-evacuation and
the poor quality of shelters are the major causes of death (Sahid Ullah, 2003).
After the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004,many radio manufacturers considered introducing new
digital radio alert systems that react even if the set is switched off. In order to trigger this alarm,
a special flag integrated into the received signal from a terrestrial transmitter or a satellite would
be used and the set would automatically tune to the emergency broadcast channel. The only
disadvantage of this system is that to introduce a new generation of receivers in analogue
environment generally takes 5 to 10 years. With digital receivers, this would be somewhat
easier (Dunnette, 2006).

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:box1dm.jpg|500px]]
|}

====''Telephone (Fixed and Mobile)''====
Telephones can play an important role in warning communities about the impending danger of
a disaster.There were many examples of how simple phone warnings saved many lives in South
Asian countries during the 2004 tsunami.
Perhaps the most famous was an incident that occurred in one small coastal village of Nallavadu
in Pondicherry, India. A timely telephone call – warning about the impending tsunami – was said
to have saved the village’s entire population of 3,600 inhabitants, as well as those of three
neighbouring villages.
Villagers of Nallavadu were involved in the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation’s
Information Village Research Project. Vijayakumar, a former project volunteer, was working in
Singapore and heard a tsunami alert issued there. He immediately phoned the research centre
in Nallavadu, which issued an alert. His quick thinking, followed by swift and coordinated action,
led to the evacuation of the four villages before the tsunami hit the coast (Subramanian, 2005).
In some countries, mechanisms called ‘telephone trees’ are used to warn communities of
impending dangers. An individual represents a ‘node’ in a telephone tree.When that individual
receives a warning message (either through phone or by other means), s/he is supposed to
make a pre-determined number of phone calls (usually four or five) to others in a pre-prepared list. This arrangement not only ensures the timely delivery of the warning message, but also
ensures the minimum duplication of efforts.
However, there are two drawbacks to using telephones for disaster warning. Telephone
penetration in many areas is still not satisfactory – particularly in rural and coastal areas most at
risk. Even with the exponential increase in the number of phones that has occurred in recent
years, there are still many regions in the Asia-Pacific region, where a telephone is considered a
luxury. The other drawback is the congestion of phone lines that usually occurs immediately
before and during a disaster, resulting in many phone calls in that vital period that cannot
be completed.

====''Short Message Service''====
Short message service (SMS) is a service available on most digital mobile phones that permits
the sending of short messages (also known as ‘text messages’, ‘SMSes’, ‘texts’ or ‘txts’) between
mobile phones, other handheld devices and even landline telephones.
During the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster in the US, many residents of affected coastal areas
were unable to make contact with relatives and friends using traditional landline phones.
However, they could communicate with each other via SMS more easily when the network was
functional. This is because SMS works on a different band and can be sent or received even
when phone lines are congested. SMS also has another advantage over voice calls in that one
message can be sent to a group simultaneously.

====''Cell Broadcasting''====
Most of today's wireless systems support a feature called cell broadcasting. A public warning
message in text can be sent to the screens of all mobile devices with such capability in any
group of cells of any size, ranging from one single cell (about 8 kilometres across) to the whole
country if necessary. CDMA, D-AMPS, GSM and UMTS{{ictdmcite|4}} phones have this capability.
There are four important points to recall about the use of cell broadcasting for emergency
purposes:
* There is no additional cost to implement cell broadcasting. It is already resident in most
network infrastructure and in the phones, so there is no need to build any towers, lay any
cable, write any software or replace handsets.
* It is not affected by traffic load; therefore it will be of use during a disaster, when load spikes
tend to crash networks, as the London bombings in 2005 showed. Also, cell broadcasting
does not cause any significant load of its own, so it would not add to congestion.
* Cell broadcasting is geo-scalable, so a message can reach hundreds of millions of people
across continents within a minute.
* It is geo-specific, so that government disaster managers can avoid panic and road jamming
by telling each neighbourhood specifically if they should evacuate or stay put.

The only possible disadvantage to cell broadcasting is that not every user may be able to read
a text message when they receive it. In many Asia-Pacific countries, a sizeable population of the
phone users cannot read and understand a message sent in English.Thus, it is essential to send
warning messages in local languages. However, these messages would still be inaccessible to
those who cannot read, even in their own language. The Dutch Government plans to start using cell broadcasting for emergency warnings.
The infrastructure is already in operation with the operators KPN, Telfort and Vodafone. It is
believed to be the first multi-operator warning system in the world, based on cell broadcasting
with government use (Clothier, 2005).

====''Satellite Radio''====
A satellite radio or subscription radio is a digital radio that receives signals broadcast by
communications satellite, which covers a much wider geographical range than terrestrial radio
signals.
Satellite radio functions anywhere there is line of sight between the antenna and the satellite,
given there are no major obstructions such as tunnels or buildings.Satellite radio audiences can
follow a single channel regardless of location within a given range.
Satellite radio can play a key role during both disaster warning and disaster recovery phases.
Its key advantage is the ability to work even outside of areas not covered by normal radio
channels. Satellite radios can also be of help when the transmission towers of the normal radio
station are damaged in a disaster.

'''Table 2: Radio Communication Media Used in Disaster Warning and Management'''
{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:table2dm.jpg|600px]]
|}


The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has identified various radio communication
media that can be used in disaster-related situations (see Table 2).

====''Internet/Email''====
The role Internet, email and instant messages can play in disaster warning entirely depends on
their penetration within a community and usage by professionals such as first responders,
coordinating bodies, etc.While these media can play a prominent role in a developed country,
where nearly half of all homes and almost all offices have Internet connections, this is not the
case in the developing world. In many developing countries, less than 5 percent of the
population uses the Internet and even those who are users do not use it on a regular basis. In
such a situation, it is difficult to expect Internet and email to play any critical role.
In spite of that drawback, many disaster-related activities are already underway within the
Internet community. For example, a new proposal for using the Internet to quickly warn large
numbers of people of impending emergencies is currently being drafted by the Internet
Engineering Task Force.

At a 1997 international conference on ‘Harnessing the Internet for Disasters and Epidemics’,
participants raised issues affecting their ability to use the Internet for improving crisis
management. Concerns included the high cost of technology, a lack of content in local
languages, and governmental controls on information exchange.“The most significant obstacle
impeding widespread Internet usage was the widening gap between those with unlimited
access and those, whose access to information and new technologies was restricted by
economic, linguistic, cultural or administrative constraints”, highlights the Pan American Health
Organization’s report on the conference. Without direct communication between decision
makers and without a free flow of reliable information among all involved, effective contingency
planning and emergency response are at risk (Putnam, 2002).

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:box2contdm.jpg|400px]]
|}

====''Amateur and Community Radio''====
For almost a century, amateur radio (also known as ‘ham radio’) operators have assisted their
communities and countries during disasters by providing reliable communications to disaster
relief organizations at a moment’s notice – especially when traditional communications
infrastructure breaks down. In such a situation, amateur radio operators transmit emergency
messages on voice mode about the well-being of survivors and information on casualties to
friends and relatives. As was evident during the Indian Ocean tsunami that destroyed
electricity and communications infrastructure in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, amateur
radio operators were the critical link between the islands and the Indian mainland and helped
in the coordination of rescue and relief operations.

Besides disseminating voice-based messages, some amateur radio operators can also transmit
in digital modes that include technologies such as radio teletype, tele-printing over radio,
packet radio transmission and the recent Phase Shift Keying, 31 Baud – a type of modulation.
Amateur radio broadcasters are authorized to communicate on high frequency (HF), very high
frequency (VHF), ultra high frequency (UHF) or all three bands of the radio spectrum. They
require a license from the licensing authority to ensure that only competent operators use their skills. However, depending on the country, obtaining a license can be a long process.

The most effective mode to exchange messages in an email-style is pactor using Airmail as email client and Winlink2000 as network on shortwave. A very valuable advantage is that the user can address any valid emailaddress worldwide through hf-radio and winlink. Destroyed internetinfrastructure can be bridged by this technology until a gateway (more than 150 worldwide RMS) with working internetaccess can be reached. More information about  [http://www.winlink.org Winlink2000].

Messages can be disseminated using one or more of the available bands. HF waves travel long
distances, while VHF and UHF waves travel very short distances as these are line-of-sight
propagation. However, repeaters increase the communications range and temporary repeaters
can be set up in an emergency so that messages can reach the nearest town or city (Acharya,
2005).

There are no well-known case studies where community radio has been successfully used for
disaster warning purposes. The main reason can be because this is not a widespread media
channel in many countries. Even where there are community radio systems, they operate
within limited areas. Nevertheless, community radio is a medium that can be very effectively
used for disaster warning purposes.The effectiveness of this medium is being tested through a
disaster warning system implemented by Sarvodaya, the most widespread NGO in Sri Lanka
(Daily News, 2006).

====''Sirens''====
Though not necessarily an ICT-based solution, sirens can be used in tandem with other ICT
media for final, localized delivery.
The strengths of each medium and the challenges in using them are summarized in Table 3.

===GIS and Remote Sensing in Disaster Management{{ictdmcite|5}}===

GIS can be loosely defined as a system of hardware and software used for storage, retrieval,
mapping and analysis of geographic data. Spatial features are stored in a coordinate system
(latitude, longitude, state, plane, etc.) that references a particular place on the earth.Descriptive
attributes in tabular form are associated with spatial features. Spatial data and
associated attributes in the same coordinate system can then be layered together for mapping
and analysis. GIS can be used for scientific investigations, resource management and
development planning.

Remote sensing is the measurement or acquisition of information about an object or
phenomenon by a recording device that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object.
In practice, remote sensing is the remote utilization (as from aircraft, spacecraft, satellite or ship)
of any device for gathering information about the environment. Thus, an aircraft taking
photographs, earth observation and weather satellites, monitoring of a foetus in the womb via
ultrasound, and space probes are all examples of remote sensing. In modern usage, the term
generally refers to techniques involving the use of instruments aboard aircraft and spacecraft.
As disaster management work usually involves a large number of different agencies
working in different areas, the need for detailed geographical information in order to make
critical decisions is high. By utilizing a GIS, agencies involved in the response can share information through databases on computer-generated maps in one location. Without this
capability, disaster management workers have to access a number of department managers,
their unique maps and their unique data. Most disasters do not allow time to gather these
resources. GIS thus provides a mechanism to centralize and visually display critical information
during an emergency.
There is an obvious advantage to using a map with remote sensing or GIS inputs instead
of a static geographical map. A static map is mostly analogous and is not interactive. On
the other hand, a vulnerability map with GIS input provides dynamic information with
cause and effect relationship. As shown in Figure 6, the visualization effect is much more
effective in the latter case.

GIS-based space technology solutions have become an integral part of disaster management
activities in many developed and some developing countries. The United Nations Office for
Outer Space Affairs has been implementing a Space Technology and Disaster Management
Programme to support developing countries in incorporating space-based solutions in disaster
management activities.
The use of GIS in different phases can be illustrated as follows:

====''Planning''====
Locating and identifying potential problems is a core requirement in disaster management. GIS
can be used effectively to achieve this objective. Using a GIS, it is possible to pinpoint hazard
trends and start to evaluate the consequences of potential emergencies or disasters. When
hazards are viewed with other map data, such as buildings, residential areas, rivers and
waterways, streets, pipelines, power lines, storage facilities, forests, etc., disaster management
officials can formulate mitigation, preparedness, response and possible recovery needs.
Information derived from remote sensing and satellite imagery plays an important role in
disaster management and crisis prevention. Their effective application depends not solely on
technical specifications, but is influenced by factors such as data collection, processing and
distribution, capacity building, institutional development and information sharing. Earth
observation satellites could be used to view the same area over long periods of time and, as a
result, make it possible to monitor environmental change, human impact and natural
processes. This would facilitate scientists and planners in creating models that would simulate
trends observed in the past, present and also assist with projections for the future.

====''Mitigation''====
After potential emergency situations are identified, mitigation needs can be addressed.
This process involves analysing the developments in the immediate aftermath of a disaster,
evaluating the damage and determining what facilities are required to be reinforced for
construction or relocation purposes.Mitigation may also include implementing legislation that
prevents building structures in areas prone to earthquake, flood or tsunami. Other mitigation
approaches may target fire-safe roofing materials in wildfire hazard areas. Utilizing existing
databases linked to geographic features in GIS makes the task of monitoring these possible.

====''Preparedness''====
During the preparedness and response phases, GIS can accurately support better response
planning in areas such as determining evacuation routes or locating vulnerable infrastructure
and vital lifelines, etc. It also supports logistical planning to be able to provide relief supplies by
displaying previously available information on roads, bridges, airports, railway and port
conditions and limitations.Apart from this, activities such as evacuee camp planning can also be
done using GIS.

GIS can also provide answers to some of the questions important to disaster management
officers, such as the exact location of the fire stations if a five-minute response time is expected
or the number and locations of paramedic units required in a specific emergency. Based on the
information provided by GIS, it is also possible to estimate what quantity of food supplies, bed
space, clothes and medicine will be required at each shelter based on the number of expected
evacuees.
In addition, GIS can display real-time monitoring for emergency early warning. Remote weather
stations can provide current weather indexes based on location and surrounding areas.Wind
direction, temperature and relative humidity can be displayed by the reporting weather station.
Wind information is vital in predicting the movement of a chemical cloud release or
anticipating the direction of wildfire spread upon early report. Earth movements (earthquake),
reservoir level at dam sights, radiation monitors, etc. can all be monitored and displayed by
location in GIS. If necessary, this type of information and geographic display can be delivered
over the Internet to the public.

===Case Study:The Tsunami Early Warning System (TEWS) for South-East Asia===
The Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 took many Asian countries by surprise.There was
virtually no warning until thousands of people suddenly found themselves in the middle of
giant killer waves.
In the aftermath of the tsunami, several international meetings have been held among
countries in the Indian Ocean rim to concertedly address threats from similar disasters. It was
agreed that arrangements for a Tsunami Early Warning System (TEWS) in the Indian Ocean and
South-East Asia should build on existing institutions, strengthen national capacities, integrate
early warning with preparedness, mitigation and response (end-to-end), and must furthermore
be integrated into existing warning systems to promote a multi-hazard approach.
The partner countries in this effort were Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Philippines,
Singapore,Thailand and Viet Nam.
The Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) is a non-profit organization supporting the
advancement of safer communities and sustainable development through implementing
programmes and projects that reduce the impact of disasters upon countries and communities
in Asia and the Pacific, by:

* Developing and enhancing sustainable institutional disaster risk management capacities,
frameworks and mechanisms, and supporting the development and implementation of
government policies;
* Facilitating the dissemination and exchange of disaster risk management expertise,
experience and information; and
* Raising awareness and enhancing disaster risk management knowledge and skills.

In March 2005, ADPC, in partnership with the Royal Thai Government and in collaboration with
the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, organized a
Regional Meeting of the above countries to assess the feasibility of implementing a
Multi-Hazard Early Warning System in South-East Asia.

In April 2005, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka indicated interest in receiving similar support to
enhance their national early warning capacity and capabilities. Consequently, ADPC has been
working with these governments and in the Maldives to enhance emergency communication
systems through an ITU-funded project. ADPC furthermore completed an assessment of Sri
Lanka’s early warning systems through a separate UNDP-funded project.

The donor agencies for the implementation of TEWS are UNDP, The Danish National
Development Agency and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
This warning system is designed to be end-to-end, encompassing both technological
components and the training of both affected and at-risk communities in preparedness and
response measures. Each component is important and should be given equal development
focus. The non-technical components of hazard mapping and risk assessment, risk reduction
and preparedness activities, and efficient warning dissemination reaching vulnerable local
coastal communities are the most challenging to develop in a comprehensive early warning
system, as these involve societal dimensions.

'''Figure 7: Implementation Plan of the Tsunami Early Warning System'''
{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:figure7dm.jpg|600px]]
|}

Some of the existing early warning systems in the region address recurrent hazards such as
cyclones/typhoons, floods and drought. Investing in hazard monitoring and forecasting for a
rare event such as a tsunami is costly in terms of capital and the required investment of human
resources.

Hence, in the face of low tsunami frequency, but the prevalence of high-risk coastal zones
(due to population growth and development), resources to undertake hazard monitoring and
forecasting are pooled in a regional monitoring system and forecasting centre in order to
provide an economically sustainable system.
The technical components are comprised of a network of seismographic stations, sea-level
gauges and deep-sea pressure sensors, a data-processing and tsunami forecasting centre, and
communication links to regional tsunami warning centres. These are in turn linked to national
disaster management and warning systems.
The network will utilize relevant facilities already available in the countries (assessed by the
Inter-Governmental Oceanographic Commission and in national workshops arranged by ADPC)
and consider the establishment of new ones.

The network of accelerographs, to be located in islands close to the coastlines of Indonesia and
the Nicobar and Andaman Islands, will provide rapid estimation of the tsunamagenic potential
of an earthquake. Deep-ocean pressure sensors detect the early passage of a tsunami before it
reaches shallow waters and the coast. Sea-level gauges, to be strategically located close to
tsunami sources and in areas that would provide sufficient lead-time for response, are essential
in determining the passage of a tsunami wave following an earthquake, to monitor its progress,
estimate the severity of the hazard along the coast, and provide a basis for declaring the end of
a hazard.
The sea-level gauge stations are designed for long-term sea-level monitoring, but are capable
of monitoring tsunami and storm surges. High-frequency sea-level data will be transmitted via
the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Meteosat-5 and the
Japanese Meteorological Agency’s Geostationary Meteorological Satellites, and are connected
to the Global Sea-Level Observation System Core Network.

Risk assessments and training will be conducted with the relevant national authority. Utilizing
satellite imagery, GIS and further applicable technologies, ADPC will support bathymetric
surveys and national training workshops on risk mapping, conduct a pilot risk-mapping survey
(to be replicated in other vulnerable locations by the national authorities), and support
regional workshops on numerical prediction models facilitated by the acquisition of the
modelling tools.
Community preparedness activities are the most critical component of this system.
The technological capacity of a system is obsolete without a prepared or fully aware public.
Despite the dissemination of a warning, communities that lack sufficient preparedness and
training in effective responses to both the warning and the event remain acutely vulnerable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ICT for Disaster Management}}

The most difficult period of a disaster is the immediate aftermath. This period calls for prompt
action within an exceptionally short period of time. In the aftermath of any disaster, a significant
number of individuals will be injured and/or displaced.Many of them may still be living with the
trauma they have encountered, including loss of loved ones. Affected individuals may also be
without food or other essential items.They might be waiting in temporary shelters, with no idea
what to do next. Some might need immediate medical attention, while the disaster aftermath
environment also creates ideal breeding grounds for possible epidemics.
Charged with leading the response, authorities may find themselves with limited resources and
without any comprehensive plans to use them or to find more. They often need the help of a
third party, which can include donors, both institutions and individuals. These institutions may
have assistance to offer, but know no means in which they can provide it as they may not have
any link with those who are working in the field.
The following case studies illustrate how ICT can be used effectively to address such problems
in the immediate post-disaster period.

==Case Study 1: Sahana Disaster Management System in the Aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 and Pakistani Earthquake in 2005==

Sahana, a free and open source software (FOSS)-based system developed by Lanka Software
Foundation, is a suite of web-based applications that provides solutions to the problems arising
in a post-disaster situation. The following examples show how Sahana assisted disaster victims
during the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and the Pakistani earthquake the following year.

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:sahanadm.jpg|600px]]
|}


====''Example 1: Tracing Missing Persons''====
After a disaster, there are often a large number of individuals missing. It is common to find
families scattered and children separated from their parents. Outside relatives and friends,
especially those living overseas, naturally want to know the latest information about the
condition of their loved ones. The psychological strain on children can be severe and it is
essential that they be reunited with their families as soon as possible.
One objective of Sahana is to assist victims in connecting with their families and friends as soon
as possible. Sahana’s Missing Person Registry is an electronic version of a bulletin board of
missing and found people. It can capture information not only on the people missing, but also
about those who seek details about the missing, thus increasing their chance of reuniting. Even
if the victims or families do not have access to this information themselves, it is quite easy for
any authorized NGO or civil society group to connect to the central portal and provide that
service in the areas they are working.

====''Example 2: Coordinating Donor Groups''====
In the immediate aftermath of the 2004 tsunami in Sri Lanka, there was a massive outpouring of
support from international NGOs, local NGOs and community groups. There were at least 300
NGOs working on the same goals, though they used different approaches. In an environment
where resources are in short supply, it is essential that response efforts should not be
duplicated. Otherwise, such duplication can result in issues such as congested supply routes,
competition between organizations, double vaccinations and saturation of support provided to
some areas while other affected areas are neglected. Consequently, goodwill can be lost.
This coordination task is too much for an authorized emergency controller to handle manually.
An ICT solution can thus be the ideal solution. For instance, an electronic organization registry
can help immensely. It can effectively track who is doing what, where, when and, more
importantly, whether there are areas in which services are not adequate. This awareness can
enable volunteers and organizations to distribute themselves evenly across affected regions.
Sahana has developed such an organization registry. It keeps track of all the relief organizations
and civil society groups working in the disaster region. It captures information on both the
places where they are active and the range of services they are providing in each area to ensure
that there is no overlap.

====''Example 3: Recording the Locations of Temporary Camps and Shelters''====
In a disaster situation, there are usually no pre-planned locations for camps and shelters.
A temporary shelter or camp can be anywhere and can range in size from a large
government-maintained camp to an individual house. Due to these differences, it is necessary
to record the locations and populations of all camps. This is paramount to distributing aid
effectively and ensuring that no affected areas are inadvertently ignored. A sub-application of
the Sahana system keeps track of the location of all the camps in the region. It also records basic
data on the facilities they might have and the number of people in them. If necessary it can
provide a GIS view to plot the location of the camps in the affected area (De Silva, undated).

==Case Study : Use of Internet in the Aftermath of the 1999 Earthquake in Turkey==
On 17 August 1999, a major earthquake caught people off guard in Izmit, Turkey, resulting in
15,000 deaths. A second earthquake occurred on 12 November of the same year in Duzce,
claiming 1,000 lives. In addition to these casualties, almost twice as many people were displaced
as a result of both events. A total of 120,000 houses were damaged beyond repair while 50,000
houses were partially damaged.
During the Izmit earthquake, telecommunications infrastructure was so extensively damaged
that it was impossible to access emergency services. The use of public phones was almost
impossible, while mobile phone networks were operating with reduced bandwidth. In addition,
many of the microwave repeaters mounted on apartment buildings had been damaged during
the quake. In this situation, Internet was the only possible medium that could connect the
affected areas to the outside world. Several Internet applications were used in the post-disaster
response, mainly in two key areas: coordination of aid disbursement and finding information
about missing people.
Due to system disruption, donors often found themselves acting as the distributors of aid as
well, thus, the Internet proved a valuable resource. NGOs played a central role in the provision of
discussion lists for the coordination of donations so that donors could find the most in need,
identify what they were in need of, and in some cases, determine how to get there. Internet was
also used to provide information regarding the whereabouts of missing family members. For
example, many organizations formed ‘message lines’, which acted as a database of people
found, their condition or the degree of damage to the region in which relatives lived
(Zincir-Heywood &amp; Heywood, 2000).
The importance of information security and privacy can never be underestimated in ICT-based
humanitarian systems. In these cases, data privacy is not just a matter of encryption, it can also
be a matter of life and death. If data falls into the wrong hands, it can result in rape and sexual
harassment, child and female trafficking, child soldier recruits, prostitution and even ethnic
cleansing. This is especially the case when a disaster occurs in an ethno-politically volatile
region, where the technology and frameworks conceptualized and implemented need to be
deeply cognizant of ground realities and tensions between ethnic groups, factions and
non-state actors.

==Case Study 3: UNOSAT’s Role in Disaster Response During the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami{{ictdmcite|6}}==
The United Nations Institute for Training and Research Operational Satellite Applications
Programme (UNOSAT) provides the international community and developing countries with
enhanced access to satellite imagery and GIS services. These tools are used mainly in
humanitarian relief, disaster prevention and post-crisis reconstruction. UNOSAT also acquires
satellite images from all commercial providers.

UNOSAT provides services on:
* Image processing;
* Map production;
* Methodological guidance;
* Technical assistance; and
* Training.

The UNOSAT core team consists of UN fieldworkers as well as satellite imagery experts,
geographers, database programmers and Internet communication specialists. This unique
combination gives UNOSAT the ability to understand the needs of the users and to provide
them with suitable, tailored solutions.
UNOSAT has been active during many recent disasters.When the Indian Ocean tsunami struck
on 26 December 2004, UNOSAT provided an immediate overview of the situation prior to
triggering the International Charter Space and Major Disasters the day after. UNOSAT
immediately created regional maps of potential impact and more focused maps of the areas
reported to be heavily affected in the first days after the disaster. The first UNOSAT map was
on-line and distributed to field users on 29 December 2004. Satellite image analyses and map production provided UN colleagues and the international
humanitarian community with regional and local damage assessment maps using a wide range
of satellite sensors.The Imagery Bank was on-line as of 14 January 2005 with a large amount of
free satellite data obtained through the Charter and the US Government.Currently,over 670 raw
satellite images and over 200,000 tsunami maps are available on its website at
http://unosat.web.cern.ch/unosat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mahabharatha''' is the longest epic in the world. In the present form, it contains 1 lakh verses. It was originally called ''Jaya'', meaning victory. By common consent it's author is recognised as [[Vedavyasa]]. 

==The storyline==
Mahabharata is centered around an epic war between cousins in a royal family for the throne. The story, told briefly, is given below: (A complete book about Mahabharata on wikibooks is planned for near future).

The story happens in the kingdom of ''Hastinapura''. The eldest son of the late king, Dhrutarashtra, is born blind, so his younger brother, Paandu, takes up the throne. But due to a curse by a scholar, or Rushi, he dies in a forest along with his second wife, Maadri. The throne is held by Dhrutarashtra. Paandu's first wife, Kunti, brings their five children, '''Pandavas''', back to the city, where they are taken care of by their great-grandfather '''Bhishma'''. 
Pandava brothers are: '''Yudhishtira''', '''Bhima''', '''Arjuna''', '''Nakula''', '''Sahadeva'''.
Dhrutarashtra has one hundred sons, eldest of whom is '''Duryodhana'''. '''Dushasana''' is his second son.
''Duryodhana'', is ambitious of becoming king himself. But he learns that as long as the Pandava brothers survive, he can not be made a king according to the laws. He and the strongest of the pandava brothers, ''Bhima'', become mortal enemies. 

Duryodhana forms a close friendship with a great archer, '''Karna'''. Karna is the equal of '''Arjuna''', the younger brother of Bhima, in archery. Together with Karna, Duryodhana plans to win pandavas in war. Duryodhana's maternal uncle, '''Shakuni''', poisons his mind and encourages him to employ devious tactics. As a result of these teachings, Duryodhana tries to kill the pandavas and kunti by setting fire to a wax house he had made for the pandavas. But the pandavas escape and live in exile for an year. At the end of the year, they come back, now having married '''Draupadi'''. All five brothers are married to the same woman.

Shakuni continues to poison Duryodhana's mind, and this culminates in a cheating game of dice where Yudhishtira loses everything he owns, including his kingdom, to Duryodhana. Yudhishtira plays his own brothers, himself, and his wife in the hope of winning everything back, but loses. Draupadi is humiliated and Dushasana tries to disrobe her in public, but lord '''Krishna''' intervenes and saves Draupadi. Bhima vows to kill both Duryodhana and Dushasana, while Arjuna vows to kill Karna, who had humiliated Draupadi during the dice game. As a result of their loss in the dice game, the pandavas are exiled from their kingdom for a total 13 years: 12 years of forest living and 1 year of hidden living.

At the end of 13 years, Duryodhana refuses to give back the kingdom, and takes the stance that his final aim in life is to kill the pandavas, Bhima in perticular, no matter how much harm the war might bring. This leads to the great war.

In the great war, lord Krishna becomes the charioteer of Arjuna, and helps the pandavas to win. All the great warriors of Duryodhana's side are killed one after the other, and Bhishma, who fights alongside Duryodhana, falls awaits his death amidst the raging war. On the day before the final day, Bhima kills Dushasana, and Arjuna, in what is perhaps the most famous war-story told in the history of Sanksrit literature, kills Karna. But after the war Arjuna discovers that Karna was his eldest brother, born to Kunti before marriage. Krishna reveals that he had known this all along, and had arranged Kunti to talk to Karna before the war so that Karna won't kill any of the pandavas. He himself talks Karna into not killing any of his younger brothers except Arjuna, whom Karna vows to kill, or be dead himself.

On the final day of the battle, an epic battle ensues between Bhima and Duryodhana, and finally Duryodhana falls. 

The story contnues to talk about pandavas rule after the war, and ends with all the eldest of the pandavas, Yudhisthira, entering the heaven alive.

'''Irrigation''' is the artificial application of water to the soil in order ensure an adequate supply of water for plants. In crop production it is mainly used to replace missing rainfall in periods of drought, but also to protect plants against frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is sometimes referred to as dryland farming or as rain fed farming. 

== History of irrigation ==

Irrigation is an ancient practice, with archaeological evidence of irrigation in Mesopotamia and Egypt as far back as the 6th millennium BCE, where barley was grown in areas where the natural rainfall was insufficient to support such a crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =The History of Technology – Irrigation | publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica, 1994 edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the western hemisphere archaeologists have found irrigation canals in the Zana Valley of the Andes Mountains in Peru from as far back as the 4th millennium BCE. The Indus Valley Civilization in Pakistan and northern India (from circa 2600 BCE) also had an early canal irrigation system (from circa 2600 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Ancient India Indus Valley Civilization | publisher =Minnesota State University &quot;e-museum&quot; | url =http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/india/indus/elements.html | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale agriculture was practiced and an extensive network of canals was used for the purpose of irrigation. Sophisticated irrigation and storage systems were developed, including the reservoirs built at Girnar in 3000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, J. C. and Ubertini, Lucio (2004). ''The Basis of Civilization - Water Science?'' pg 161. International Association of Hydrological Sciences (International Association of Hydrological Sciences Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet III in the twelfth dynasty (about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Faiyum Oasis as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons, as the lake swelled annually as caused by the annual flooding of the Nile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Amenemhet III | publisher =Britannica Concise | url =http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9006076/Amenemhet-III | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qanats, developed in ancient Persia in about 800 BCE, are among the oldest known irrigation methods still in use today. They are now found in Asia, the middle east and north Africa. The system comprises a network of vertical wells and gently sloping tunnels driven into the sides of cliffs and steep hills to tap groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Qanat Irrigation Systems and Homegardens (Iran) | work =Globally Important Agriculture Heritage Systems | publisher =UN Food and Agriculture Organization | url =http://www.fao.org/sd/giahs/other_iran1_desc.asp | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The noria, a water wheel with clay pots around the rim powered by the flow of the stream (or by animals where the water source was still), was first brought into use at about this time, by Roman settlers in North Africa. By 150 BCE the pots were fitted with valves to allow smoother filling as they were forced into the water.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911 and 1989 editions&lt;/ref&gt;

The irrigation works of ancient Sri Lanka, the earliest dating from about 300 BCE, in the reign of King Pandukabhaya and under continuous development for the next thousand years, were one of the most complex irrigation systems of the ancient world. In addition to underground canals, the Sinhalese were the first to build completely artificial reservoirs to store water. The system was extensively restored and further extended during the reign of King Parakrama Bahu (1153 – 1186 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =de Silva | first =Sena | title =Reservoirs of Sri Lanka and their fisheries | publisher =UN Food and Agriculture Organization | date =1998 | url =http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/T0028E/T0028E03.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known hydraulic engineers of China were Sunshu Ao (6th century BCE) of the Spring and Autumn Period and Ximen Bao (5th century BCE) of the Warring States period, both of whom worked on large irrigation projects. In the Szechwan region belonging to the State of Qin of ancient China, the Dujiangyan Irrigation System was built in 256 BCE to irrigate an enormous area of farmland that today still supplies water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =China – history
 | publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica,1994 edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century AD, during the Han Dynasty, the Chinese also used chain pumps that lifted water from lower elevation to higher elevation.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 344 346&quot;&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. Pages 344-346.&lt;/ref&gt; These were powered by manual foot pedal, hydraulic waterwheels, or rotating mechanical wheels pulled by oxen.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 340 343&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 340-343.&lt;/ref&gt; The water was used for public works of providing water for urban residential quarters and palace gardens, but mostly for irrigation of farmland canals and channels in the fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 33 110&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 33, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fifteenth century Korea the world's first water gauge, ''woo ryang gyae'' (Korean: 우량계), was discovered in 1441 CE. The inventor was Jang Young Sil, a Korean engineer of the Choson Dynasty, under the active direction of the King, Se Jong. It was installed in irrigation tanks as part of a nationwide system to measure and collect rainfall for agricultural applications. With this instrument, planners and farmers could make better use of the information gathered in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Baek Sauk Gi | title =Jang Young Sil | publisher =Woong-Jin-Wee-In-Jun-Gi: &quot;Woongjin Publishing Co., Ltd&quot; | date =1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 20th century, the advent of diesel and electric motors led for the first time to systems that could pump groundwater out of major aquifers faster than it was recharged. This can lead to permanent loss of aquifer capacity, decreased water quality, ground subsidence, and other problems. The future of food production in such areas as the North China Plain, the Punjab, and the Great Plains of the US is threatened.

== Types of irrigation ==
[[Image:LevelBasinFloodIrrigation.JPG|thumb|Basin flood irrigation of wheat]]
[[Image:Sprinkler.gif|thumb|Sprinkler]]
Various types of irrigation techniques differ in how the water obtained from the source is distributed within the field. In general, the goal is to supply the entire field uniformly with water, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little.

=== Surface irrigation ===
In surface irrigation systems water moves over and across the land by simple gravity flow in order to wet it and to infiltrate into the soil. Surface irrigation can be subdivided into furrow, borderstrip or basin irrigation. It is often called '''flood irrigation''' when the irrigation results in flooding or near flooding of the cultivated land. Historically, this has been the most common method of irrigating agricultural land. 

Where water levels from the irrigation source permit, the levels are controlled by dikes, usually plugged by soil. This is often seen in terraced rice fields (rice paddies), where the method is used to flood or control the level of water in each distinct field. In some cases, the water is pumped, or lifted by human or animal power to the level of the land.

=== Localized irrigation ===
Localized irrigation is a system where water is distributed under low pressure through a piped network, in a pre-determined pattern, and applied as a small discharge to each plant or adjacent to it. Drip irrigation, spray or micro-sprinkler irrigation and bubbler irrigation belong to this category of irrigation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==== Drip, or trickle irrigation ====
[[Image:dripperwithdrop.gif|thumb|Drip Irrigation - A dripper in action]]
[[Image:dripirrigation.gif|thumb|Drip Irrigation Layout and its parts]]
Water is delivered at or near the root zone of plants, drop by drop. This type of system can be the most water-efficient method of irrigation, if managed properly, since evaporation and runoff are minimized. In modern agriculture, drip irrigation is often combined with plastic mulch, further reducing evaporation, and is also the means of delivery of fertilizer. The process is known as [[w:fertigation]]. 

Deep percolation, where water moves below the root zone, can occur if a drip system is operated for too long of a duration or if the delivery rate is too high. Drip irrigation methods range from very high-tech and computerized to low-tech and relatively labor-intensive. Lower water pressures are usually needed than for most other types of systems, with the exception of low energy center pivot systems and surface irrigation systems, and the system can be designed for uniformity throughout a field or for precise water delivery to individual plants in a landscape containing a mix of plant species. Although it is difficult to regulate pressure on steep slopes, pressure compensating emitters are available, so the field does not have to be level. High-tech solutions involve precisely calibrated emitters located along lines of tubing that extend from a computerized set of valves. Both pressure regulation and filtration to remove particles are important. The tubes are usually black (or buried under soil or mulch) to prevent the growth of algae and to protect the polyethylene from degradation due to ultraviolet light. But drip irrigation can also be as low-tech as a porous clay vessel sunk into the soil and occasionally filled from a hose or bucket. Subsurface drip irrigation has been used successfully on lawns, but it is more expensive than a more traditional sprinkler system. Surface drip systems are not cost-effective (or aesthetically pleasing) for lawns and golf courses. Netafim,Jain Irrigation Systems, Chapin Watermatics, Eurodrip, Plastro Irrigation Systems are major manufacturer of Drip Irrigation Systems. In the past one of the main disadvantages of the subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems, when used for turf, was the fact of having to install the plastic lines very close to each other in the ground, therefore disrupting the turfgrass area. Recent technology developments on drip installers like the drip installer at New Mexico State University Arrow Head Center, places the line underground and covers the slit leaving no soil exposed.

=== Sprinkler irrigation ===
[[Image:TravellingSprinkler.JPG|thumb|A travelling sprinkler at Millets Farm Centre, Oxfordshire, UK]]
In sprinkler or overhead irrigation, water is piped to one or more central locations within the field and distributed by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or guns. A system utilizing sprinklers, sprays, or guns mounted overhead on permanently installed risers is often referred to as a ''solid-set'' irrigation system. Higher pressure sprinklers that rotate are called ''rotors'' and are driven by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism. Rotors can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle. Guns are similar to rotors, except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 40 to 130 lbf/in² (275 to 900 kPa) and flows of 50 to 1200 US gal/min (3 to 76 L/s), usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 0.5 to 1.9 inches (10 to 50 mm). Guns are used not only for irrigation, but also for industrial applications such as dust suppression and logging.

[[Image:Irrigated blueberries4046.jpg|left|thumb|Sprinkler irrigation of [[../Vaccinium|blueberries]] in Plainville, New York]]
Sprinklers may also be mounted on moving platforms connected to the water source by a hose. Automatically moving wheeled systems known as ''traveling sprinklers'' may irrigate areas such as small farms, sports fields, parks, pastures, and cemeteries unattended. Most of these utilize a length of polyethylene tubing wound on a steel drum. As the tubing is wound on the drum powered by the irrigation water or a small gas engine, the sprinkler is pulled across the field. When the sprinkler arrives back at the reel the system shuts off. This type of system is known to most people as a &quot;waterreel&quot; traveling irrigation sprinkler and they are used extensively for dust suppression, irrigation, and land application of waste water.
Other travelers use a flat rubber hose that is dragged along behind while the sprinkler platform is pulled by a cable. These cable-type travelers are definitely old technology and their use is limited in today's modern irrigation projects.

==== Center pivot irrigation ====
[[Image:Center-pivot irrigation.jpg|thumb|The hub of a center-pivot irrigation system.]]
Center pivot irrigation is a form of sprinkler irrigation consisting of several segments of pipe (usually galvanized steel or aluminum) joined together and supported by trusses, mounted on wheeled towers with sprinklers positioned along its length. The system moves in a circular pattern and is fed with water from the pivot point at the center of the arc. These systems are common in parts of the United States where terrain is flat.

[[Image:PivotWithDrops.JPG|left|thumb|Center pivot with drop sprinklers. Photo by Gene Alexander, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.]]
Most center pivot systems now have drops hanging from a u-shaped pipe called a ''gooseneck'' attached at the top of the pipe with sprinkler heads that are positioned a few feet (at most) above the crop, thus limiting evaporative losses. Drops can also be used with drag hoses or bubbler's that deposit the water directly on the ground between crops. The crops are planted in a circle to conform to the center pivot. This type of system is known as LEPA (Low Energy Precision Application). Originally, most center pivots were water powered. These were replaced by hydraulic systems (''T-L Irrigation'') and electric motor driven systems (''Lindsay'', ''Reinke'', ''Valley'', ''Zimmatic''). Most systems today are driven by an electric motor mounted low on each span. This drives a reduction gearbox and transverse driveshafts transmit power to another reduction gearbox mounted behind each wheel. Precision controls, some with GPS location and remote computer monitoring, are now available.

==== Lateral move (side roll, wheel line) irrigation ====
[[Image:WheelLineIrrigation.JPG|thumb|Wheel line irrigation system in Idaho. 2001. Photo by Joel McNee, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.]]
A series of pipes, each with a wheel of about 1.5 m diameter permanently affixed to its midpoint and sprinklers along its length, are coupled together at one edge of a field. Water is supplied at one end using a large hose. After sufficient water has been applied, the hose is removed and the remaining assembly rotated either by hand or with a purpose-built mechanism, so that the sprinklers move 10 m across the field. The hose is reconnected. The process is repeated until the opposite edge of the field is reached.
This system is less expensive to install than a center pivot, but much more labor intensive to operate, and it is limited in the amount of water it can carry. Most systems utilize 4 or 5 inch diameter aluminum pipe. One feature of a lateral move system is that it consists of sections that can be easily disconnected. They are most often used for small or oddly-shaped fields, such as those found in hilly or mountainous regions, or in regions where labor is inexpensive.

=== Sub-irrigation ===
Sub-irrigation also sometimes called ''seepage irrigation'' has been used for many years in field crops in areas with high water tables. It is a method of artificially raising the water table to allow the soil to be moistened from below the plants' root zone. Often those systems are located on permanent grasslands in lowlands or river valleys and combined with drainage infrastructure. A system of pumping stations, canals, weirs and gates allows it to increase or decrease the water level in a network of ditches and the control the water table thereby.

Sub-irrigation is also used in commercial greenhouse production, usually for potted plants. Water is delivered from below, absorbed upwards, and the excess collected for recycling. Typically, a solution of water and nutrients floods a container or flows through a trough for a short period of time, 10-20 minutes, and is then pumped back into a holding tank for reuse. Sub-irrigation in greenhouses requires fairly sophisticated, expensive equipment and management. Advantages are water and nutrient conservation, and labor-saving through lowered system maintenance and automation. It is similar in principle and action to subsurface drip irrigation.

=== Manual irrigation using buckets or watering cans ===
These systems have low requirements for infrastructure and technical equipment but need high labor inputs. Irrigation using watering cans is to be found for example in peri-urban agriculture around large cities in some African countries.

== Sources of irrigation water ==
Sources of irrigation water can be groundwater extracted from springs or by using wells, surface water withdrawn from rivers, lakes or reservoirs or non-conventional sources like treated wastewater, desalinated water or drainage water. A special form of irrigation using surface water is spate irrigation, also called floodwater harvesting. In case of a flood (spate) water is diverted to normally dry river beds (wadi’s) using a network of dams, gates and channels and spread over large areas. The moisture stored in the soil will be used thereafter to grow crops. Spate irrigation areas are in particular located in semi-arid or arid, mountainous regions. While floodwater harvesting belongs to the accepted irrigation methods, rainwater harvesting is usually not considered as a form of irrigation. Rainwater harvesting is the collection of runoff water from roofs or unused land and the concentration of this water on cultivated land. Therefore this method is considered as a water concentration method.

== How an in-ground irrigation system works ==
Most commercial and residential irrigation systems are &quot;in ground&quot; systems, which means that everything is buried in the ground. With the pipes, sprinklers, and irrigation valves being hidden, it makes for a cleaner, more presentable landscape without garden hoses or other items having to be moved around manually.

=== Water source and piping ===
The beginning of a sprinkler system is the water source. This is usually a tap into an existing (city) water line or a pump that pulls water out of a well or a pond. The water travels through pipes from the water source through the valves to the sprinklers. The pipes from the water source up to the irrigation valves are called &quot;mainlines&quot;, and the lines from the valves to the sprinklers are called &quot;lateral lines&quot;. Most piping used in irrigation systems today are HDPE and MDPE or PVC or PEX plastic pressure pipes due to their ease of installation and resistance to corrosion. After the water source, the water usually travels through a back flow prevention device. This prevents water in the irrigation lines from being pulled back into and contaminating the clean water supply.

=== Controllers, zones, and valves ===
Most Irrigation systems are divided into zones. A zone is a single Irrigation Valve and one or a group of sprinklers that are connected by pipes. Irrigation Systems are divided into zones because there is usually not enough pressure and available flow to run sprinklers for an entire yard or sports field at once. Each zone has a solenoid valve on it that is controlled via wire by an Irrigation Controller. The Irrigation Controller is either a mechanical or electrical device that signals a zone to turn on at a specific time and keeps it on for a specified amount of time. &quot;Smart Controller&quot; is a recent term used to describe a controller that is capable of adjusting the watering time by itself in response to current environmental conditions. The smart controller determines current conditions by means of historic weather data for the local area, a moisture sensor (water potential or water content), weather station, or a combination of these.

===Sprinklers===
When a zone comes on, the water flows through the lateral lines and ultimately ends up at the irrigation sprinkler heads. Most sprinklers have pipe thread inlets on the bottom of them which allows a fitting and the pipe to be attached to them. The sprinklers are usually installed with the top of the head flush with the ground surface. When the water is pressurized, the head will pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and shuts off that zone. Once there is no more water pressure in the lateral line, the sprinkler head will retract back into the ground.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ramayana''' is the second largest Indian epic, after Mahabharatha. 

==Story outline==
Ramayana is the story of one of the incarnations of lord Vishnu, that of Rama.
Rama is born as the eldest son of the king Dasharatha, and is heir to the kingdom. During his childhood, he travels with his teacher, Vishwamitra, and learns the art of war and righthood. 
He marries Sita, who is depicted as the human incarnation of the goddess Lakshmi. 
Later, when time comes for him to be the king, his step-mother intervenes and claims the throne for her son, Bharatha, who is a brother to Rama. Rama gladly gives up the throne and goes into exile for 14 years with his wife and brother Lakshmana. 
During his exile, the evil king of ''Lanka'', Ravana, falls in love with Seetha, and kidnaps her.
Rama and Lakshmana team up with the king of apes, Sugreeva, and storm the island of Lanka. A fierce battle ensues, in which Lakshmana kills Ravana's son, Indrajit, and in the final part, Rama kills Ravana. For generations, Hindus believe Rama as 'Purushotham', means best amongst humans.

'''The square rooth of 2 is irrational''', &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q} &lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==

This is a proof by contradiction, so we assumes that  &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q} &lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} = a/b &lt;/math&gt; for some ''a'', ''b'' that are coprime.

This implies that &lt;math&gt;2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;. Rewriting this gives &lt;math&gt;2b^2 = a^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 2, then so must the right-hand side, i.e., &lt;math&gt;2 | a^2 &lt;/math&gt;.
Since 2 is prime, we must have that &lt;math&gt;2 | a &lt;/math&gt;.

So we may substitute ''a'' with &lt;math&gt;2a'&lt;/math&gt;, and we have that &lt;math&gt;2b^2 = 4a^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Dividing both sides with 2 yields  &lt;math&gt;b^2 = 2a^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and using similar arguments as above, we conclude that  &lt;math&gt;2 | b &lt;/math&gt;.

Here we have a contradiction; we assumed that ''a'' and ''b'' were coprime, but we have that &lt;math&gt;2 | a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 | b &lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, the assumption were false, and &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt; cannot be written as a rational number. Hence, it is irrational.


==History==

Some nice history about the one that first proved this theorem.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of a &quot;rag doll&quot; test is to determine the percentage of seeds in a given lot that will successfully germinate.  This information can then used for calculating seeding rates.

A simple way to get an idea of the actual field germination prior to planting is to conduct a “ragdoll” test. A “ragdoll” consists of a rolled tube of moistened paper containing the seeds to be tested for germination, placed in plastic bag and stored in a warm place for several days.  seedlings are counted as they germinate and are removed, giving the percentage of actual germination.

To conduct a ragdoll test, moisten a brown paper hand towel and squeeze out as much excess water as possible.  Do not use a &quot;soft&quot; paper towel as are typically found in a home kitchen - seeds can send roots and tops through these complicating the count.  Excess water in the towel will cut off oxygen and ruin the test.

Spread the paper towel out on a flat surface, count out 100 seeds and place them in a line (diagonally works well) across the towel.  Roll the towel up and place it in a plastic bag.  Seal the bag, and place it in a warm place, such as on the top of a refrigerator.  A temperature of {{units|30°C|85°F}} is ideal.

After four days, remove the towel from the plastic bag, unroll it, and count and remove any seeds that have germinated.  Roll the towel back up, return it to the plastic bag, reseal, and return it to the top of the refrigerator.

After three or four more days, repeat the count.  The total number of seeds from both counts will equal the germination rate, assuming 100 seeds were used.  If a different number of seeds were used, you can calculate the germination rate as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Germination\ Rate = \frac{Germinated\ Seeds}{Germinated\ Seeds + Ungerminated\ Seeds} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* The MINC version of hello world. */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The MINC version of hello world. ==

Any introduction to a programming language worth its salt will start with a hello world example. MINC, of course, is not its own programming language; it is a C library. So this tutorial will assume some basic knowledge of C, and will guide the reader through opening and reading MINC volumes and then move on to more advanced topics, discussing some of the peculiarities of the MINC file format along the way.

All code examples will work with the MINC library version 2.x (tested on 2.0.13). There are two other libraries for accessing data in MINC files: the MINC version 1.x library, and volume_io. The vast majority of currently existing code uses either of those two; MINC2 is a new library recently introduced. One important difference is that MINC2 can only read version 2.x files; older files have to be converted using the mincconvert command.

The code will be split up and commented upon in pieces for all these tutorials. The unadulterated source code can be found at the end of each tutorial.

The code compiles in the following way (assuming that the minc2 library is installed in /usr/local/minc2):

 gcc -g -o minc2_tutorial1 -I/usr/local/minc2/include -L/usr/local/minc2/lib -lminc2 -lhdf5 -lnetcdf minc2_tutorial1.c

=== Hello World ===

So on to the hello world example. Here we open a MINC2 volume and get the value of the first voxel. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;minc2.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The include files - only ''minc2.h'' is needed for getting all the minc2 functionality.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  mihandle_t    minc_volume;
  double        voxel;
  int           result;
  unsigned long location[3];
&lt;/source&gt;
  
The data types: the only non-standard one here is ''mihandle_t'', a struct which will be needed by almost all minc2 functions that need to do something or other on a minc2 volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* open the volume - first and only command line argument */
  result = miopen_volume(argv[1], MI2_OPEN_READ, &amp;minc_volume);
  /* check for error on opening */
  if (result != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening input file: %d.\n&quot;, result);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;


And here is the first minc2 command: ''miopen_volume'', which you guessed it, opens a minc2 volume specified by a C string, an indicator of whether the file should be open for reading or writing (reading in this case), and the address of the mihandle_t struct which, if the operation succeeded, will then hold important information about the volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* get the first voxel in the image */
  location[0] = location[1] = location[2] = 0;
  miget_real_value(minc_volume, location, 3, &amp;voxel);
  printf(&quot;Hello MINC2 - first voxel was: %f\n&quot;, voxel);

  return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we get the first voxel, specified by volume coordinates 0,0,0. We are just looking at three-dimensional volumes here, so we created an ''unsigned long'' array of three elements, and assigned them all to be 0. We then call the ''miget_real_value'' function, specifying the volume handle to get the voxel from, the location (the ''unsigned long'' array), the number of dimensions in the file, and the address of the ''double'' to which to assign the voxel value. And then we print it to the terminal.

And that was it - the first and quite simple MINC2 program, really just needing two library calls: opening the volume and getting the voxel.

== code ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;minc2.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  mihandle_t    minc_volume;
  double        voxel;
  int           result;
  unsigned long location[3];
  
  /* open the volume - first and only command line argument */
  result = miopen_volume(argv[1], MI2_OPEN_READ, &amp;minc_volume);
  /* check for error on opening */
  if (result != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening input file: %d.\n&quot;, result);
  }

  /* get the first voxel in the image */
  location[0] = location[1] = location[2] = 0;
  miget_real_value(minc_volume, location, 3, &amp;voxel);
  printf(&quot;Hello MINC2 - first voxel was: %f\n&quot;, voxel);

  return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Program Standard 16: Using Technology to Support Student Learning

http://www.btsasacramento.org/pdf/QSTAND.pdf

Each participating teacher builds upon the knowledge, skills, and abilities acquired during
preliminary preparation for the delivery of comprehensive, specialized use of appropriate
computer-based technology to facilitate the teaching and learning processes. Each participating
teacher is a fluent, critical user of technology, able to provide a relevant education and to
prepare his/her students to be life-long learners in an information-based, interactive society.
Each participating teacher makes appropriate and efficient use of software applications and
related media to access and evaluate information, analyze and solve problems, and communicate
ideas in order to maximize the instructional process. This use of technology supports teaching
and learning regardless of individual learning style, socioeconomic background, culture,
ethnicity, or geographic location. Each participating teacher integrates these technology-related
tools into the educational experience of students, including those with special needs.


Standard 16: Using Technology to Support Student Learning
* Standard 16a: Communicate using electronic media
* Standard 16b: Collaborate using electronic and other tools
* Standard 16c: Curriculum-aligned electronic learning resources
* Standard 16d: Lessons to develop lifelong learning skills
* Standard 16e: Technology to teach curriculum and learning skills
* Standard 16f: Computers for analysis, assessment and feedback

These are K-12 credentialing requirements. The Technology Enhanced Instruction course was initially designed for community college faculty based on the best practices for higher education. Reviewing the Standard 16 requirements against the objectives and curriculum for Technology Enhanced Instruction, it became clear that the overall practices and concepts are closely aligned and each can benefit from the important elements of the other. 

Implementation and demonstration of these standards is required for K-12 teaching credentialing. Although there is no longer an equivalent requirement for higher education (13-14) instruction, faculty can extend their instructional practices knowledge and professional development through reference to these standards. To that end, the following is a list of the standards and some examples of how participants might apply and demonstrate their use. 


Program Standard 16: Using Technology to Support Student Learning

* a. Communications through a variety of media - email, discussion forums, chat
* b. Communications with other professionals using a variety of methods - forums, collaboration
* c. Uses technology resources: classroom, library - web references, graphics, images, audio, video
* d. Students develop information literacy and problem solving - assignments, discussion forums
* e. Technology in lessons - lesson plan, profile of pratice, framework, unit design
* f. Application of data to inform students learning to their parents - electronic grading, grading reports
* g. Reflects and monitors the results of using technology in instruction / student assessment - observation, data analysis, reflection

'''&lt;big&gt;Pineal Gland Tumors&lt;/big&gt;'''


==Epidemiology==
*1% adult CNS tumors
*5% pediatric CNS tumors
*Three separate tumor types:
**Pineal parenchyma tumors
**Glial parenchyma tumors
**Germ cell tumors
*Dramatic variation geographically in distribution (germinoma ~50% in Japan, &lt;30% in Europe)


==Clinical Presentation==
*Determined by the spatial anatomy and direction of growth
**Obstruction of aquaduct: hydrocephalus presenting as headaches, nausea, vomiting
**Compromise of superior colliculus: vertical gaze palsy, pupillary and oculomotor nerve paresis ([[w:Parinaud%27s_syndrome|Parinaud syndrome]])
**Progressive growth: cranial nerve neuropathies, hypothalamic dysfunction
*Metastatic disease rare, but leptomeningeal spread in ~20% pineoblastomas and ~10% germ cell tumors


==[[w:Pineal Gland|Pineal Gland]] Histology==
*Principle cell in the pineal gland is the [[w:pinealocyte|pinealocyte]] 
**Specialized neuron related to retinal cones &amp; rods 
**Takes sympathetic input from retina via the suprachiasmatic nucleus
**Converts the stimulation into hormonal output by producing melatonin, which impacts LH and FSH
**Relationship between light-dark cycle, pineal gland, and circadian rhythm
**Stain for neuron specific enolase ([[w:Neuron-specific_enolase|NSE]]) and [[w:Synaptophysin|Synaptophysin]]
*Surrounding stroma is made of astrocytes
**Stain for [[w:GFAP|GFAP]], [[w:S-100_protein|S-100]], and [[w:Vimentin|Vimentin]]
*Germ cells are embryonal remnants, typically presenting in midline structures

==[[Radiation_Oncology/CNS/Introduction#2007_WHO_Classification|Pathology]]==
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Peds/Germ_cell|Germ cell tumors]]
**Germinoma (30-40%)
**Non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (10-20%)
*Pineal parenchymal tumors (15-30%)
**[[w:Pineocytoma|Pineocytoma]] (WHO Grade II): 
***Well-differentiated low grade tumor
***Characteristic pineocytomatous rosettes
***May have neuronal, astrocytic, or mixed (ganglioglioma) differentiation
**Pineal parenchymal tumour of intermediate differentiation (WHO Grade III)
***Intermediate grade tumor, between pineocytoma and pineoblastoma. 
***Reasonably rare, constituting only 10% of pineal parenchyma tumors
**[[w:Pineoblastoma|Pineoblastoma]] (WHO Grade IV):
***Primitive high grade tumor
***Believed to arise from an immature neural progenitor cells; may have pineal, neuronal, glial, or retinoblastic differentiation
***May be part of bilateral retinoblastoma with pineoblastoma syndrome (&quot;[[Radiation_Oncology/Retinoblastoma|trilateral retinoblastoma syndrome]]&quot;), and may be associated with the [[w:Retinoblastoma_protein|Rb mutation]]
***Necrosis is common
***Histologically indistinguishable from  [[Radiation_Oncology/Peds/CNS_PNET|Supratentorial PNET]] and infratentorial PNET ([[Radiation_Oncology/Medulloblastoma|medulloblastoma]]) 
***Similarly has a significant propensity for leptomeningeal spread
**Papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR)
***Rare, recently described entity
***Histologically similar to ependymoma, and thought to arise from specialized ependymocytes
*Glial tumors 
**[[w:Astrocytoma|Astrocytomas]] (10-30%)
*Benign lesions
**[[w:Pineal gland cyst|Pineal gland cysts]], vascular malformations, vein of Galen aneurysms

==Treatment Overview==
*Work-up includes MRI, CSF, serum markers for bHCG and AFP
*Tissue diagnosis is critical, since management varies significantly based on pathology
**Stereotactic pineal gland biopsy
**Open surgery (typically not favored since only few tumors are amenable to complete resection, many are chemo-RT sensitive, and there is a real risk of worsening visual deficits)
*CSF diversion may be necessary in patients symptomatic from obstructing hydrocephalus, although if open surgery is done, may not be necessary
*Germ cell tumors are treated with definitive RT or chemo-RT as with other [[Radiation_Oncology/Peds/Germ_cell|Germ cell tumors]] 
*Pineoblastoma is treated with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation like other [[Radiation_Oncology/Peds/CNS_PNET|CNS PNETs]]). More detail below
*to be continued ...

*Most reports are small series; largest has 9 patients
*Age difference: Pediatric pineocytomas behave more aggresively, with high rate of recurrence; adult cases appear more benign
*Barrow Neurological Institute:
**If symptomatic, attempt resection. Adjuvant GKS for subtotal resection
**If small and asymptomatic, stereotactic biopsy, and primary GKS
*Pittsburgh data suggests primary GKS as well
*Mayo data suggests adjuvant RT for subtotal resection to 50-55 Gy


*'''Barrow Neurological Institute; 2004''' (Arizona)(1990-2003) PMID 15271241 -- &quot;Diagnosis and management of pineocytomas.&quot; (Deshmukh VR, Neurosurgery. 2004 Aug;55(2):349-55; discussion 355-7.)
**Retrospective. 9 patients. Mean age 44 years. Surgery: 3 GTR, 6 subtotal or bx. Adjuvant RT in 5/9 patients (n=2 IMRT 54/30, n=3 GKS)
**Outcome: 4/9 local recurrences (3 clinical, 1 radiographic). Mean time to recurrence 3.5 years
**Radiosurgery: all stable or decreased at 3 years
**Treatment recommendations: If symptomatic, attempt resection. For subtotally resected, adjuvant GKS. For small asymptomatic tumors, stereotactic biopsy and primary GKS. Need close follow-up

*'''Mayo; 1996''' PMID 8952565 -- &quot;Histologically confirmed pineal tumors and other germ cell tumors of the brain.&quot; (Schild SE, Cancer. 1996 Dec 15;78(12):2564-71.)
**Retrospective. 135 patients with pineal tumors (pineoblastoma 15, intermediate/mixed PPT 6, pineocytoma 9). Median F/U 5.3 years
**Outcome: 5-year OS pineocytoma 86%, intermediate/mixed PPT/pineoblastoma 49%
**Predictor of survival: RT &gt;50 Gy
**Conclusion: Prognosis depends on tumor type; survival depends on dose of RT

*'''University of Pennsylvania; 1987''' (1975-1985) PMID 3815306 -- &quot;Pineocytomas of childhood. A reappraisal of natural history and response to therapy.&quot; (D'Andrea AD, Cancer. 1987 Apr 1;59(7):1353-7.)
**Retrospective. 4 children (11% of all pineal region tumors). Surgery + CSI+boost (n=3) or local RT (n=2) or chemo-RT (n=1). 
**Outcome: 4/6 recurrences, median 2 years after diagnosis. 3 leptomeningeal dissemination
**Conclusion: Aggressive tumors in pediatric population; RT alone inadequate

==Pineoblastoma==
*Pathology as above; histologically similar to other CNS PNETs. Many older trials grouped pineoblastoma together with [[Radiation_Oncology/Peds/CNS_PNET|supratentorial PNETs]]
*Mainly occurs in young children (estimated 40-50% in age &lt;1 year) . Children &lt;3 years appear to have particularly aggressive disease, with frequent advanced presentation
*Rare in adults (&lt;10%), largest series is from Japan national Brain Tumor Registry spanning 30 years, with 34 patients
*Strong tendency to invade surrounding tissue and disseminate through CSF
*Typical approach is surgery, followed by chemotherapy and CSI
**Older children can have a reasonable survival
**Efforts to eliminate RT in young children have resulted in poor outcomes (POG, CCG, and German trials). However, long-term CSI toxicity is severe, so efforts are under way for dose intensification with stem cell transplant


'''Children'''
*'''German HIT-SKK87, HIT 91, and HIT-SKK92''' (1987-1992, 1992-1997)
**''Please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Peds/CNS_PNET|Supratentorial PNET]] for more detailed protocol information
**Subset of 11 patients with PB. If &lt;3 years, surgery + chemo with RT deferred until &gt;3 years or progression (n=5). If &gt;3 years, surgery + chemo + CSI (35.2/22 + 20/10 boost) +/- maintenance chemo (n=6)

***Older children (&gt;3): 5/6 alive with median OS/PFS 7.9 years after chemo and RT. All had M0 disease
***Younger children (&lt;3): 0/5 alive with median OS 0.9 years and PFS 0.6 years. All had M1 disease and/or postop residual disease. Response to chemo lower, only 1/5 received RT
***Role of RT: all older children received it, and benefited (PR-&gt;CR or stayed in CR). One younger child received who, after progressing on chemo, and showed PR to it 
***Conclusion: Combined chemo and RT feasible and effective if &gt;3 years. More intensified regimens necessary for &lt;3 years
**Subsequent HIT trial for young children with supratentorial PNET investigates short dose-intense induction, followed by high-dose chemo and CSI

**''Please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Peds/CNS_PNET|Supratentorial PNET]] for more detailed protocol information
**Older children (&gt;1.5 years) treated with surgery + CSI + chemo; infants (&lt;1.5 years) treated with surgery + chemo (8-in-1) only

***Pineoblastoma subset of 25 patients, 17 age &gt;1.5, 8 infants
****Infants: all infants developed progressive disease, median PFS 4 months
****Older children: 3-year PFS 61% (better than ST-PNET, SS). After RT, 70% had residual pineal region mass, which persisted as long as 5 years before resolving
***Conclusion: Chemo alone (8-in-1) ineffective for infants. CSI + chemo effective for older children

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cells and Microscope lab==

I am hesitant even to write this lab, because it is so dependent on the materials available to the instructor. What should happen in this laboratory is the instructor should show cells to the students. One of the best places to get cells is any stagnant water, stream, or pond nearby which is likely to have microscopic protists in it. 


Learn to identify the parts of the microscope and observe cells from as many of the kingdoms of life as you can.


Some easy cells to see include:&lt;br&gt;
Human cheek cells &lt;br&gt;
Onion cells &lt;br&gt;
Algae cells ( if the temperature is favorable). &lt;br&gt;


Things to point out to students.
*Bacterial cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells, and size should be a clue used in kingdom identification.
*Different cells have different appearances due to their functions.
*Cells are three dimensional and you may need to focus up and down to really see the structure.


Students may be hesitant to draw, but insist that they draw what they see. Look out to make sure that the students do not try to copy an image from the textbook instead.  The point is that they make their own observations without second guessing or fudging data. Get the students to label as much as they can, and to record the proper magnification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The two MINC coordinate systems. ==

MINC has two coordinate systems: a ''voxel'' and a ''world'' coordinate system. Voxel coordinates are like arrays, with the origin fixed in one corner of the image and incrementing to the length - 1 of that dimension. World coordinates, on the other hand, reflect the position in real world units of each voxel. Within a particular space, such as ''Talairach space'', each particular coordinate thus has a meaning and is often shared across volumes.

The previous example just obtained a voxel using voxel coordinates - below is the same code modified to obtain a voxel at the origin of the world coordinate system.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;minc2.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  mihandle_t    minc_volume;
  double        voxel;
  int           result, i;
  double        world_location[3];
  double        dvoxel_location[3];
  unsigned long voxel_location[3];
  
  /* open the volume - first and only command line argument */
  result = miopen_volume(argv[1], MI2_OPEN_READ, &amp;minc_volume);
  /* check for error on opening */
  if (result != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening input file: %d.\n&quot;, result);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

So far, so good - this is almost the same code as in the first example with the addition of some extra variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* convert world coordinates to voxel coordinates */
  world_location[0] = world_location[1] = world_location[2] = 0.0;
  miconvert_world_to_voxel(minc_volume, world_location, dvoxel_location);
&lt;/source&gt;

This is where the actual conversion happens, taken care of by the ''miconvert_world_to_voxel'' function. There are three arguments: the volume struct (initialized by ''miopen_volume''), an array of doubles containing the world coordinates that are to be converted (initialized to be zeros across the board in the line above), and an array of doubles which will hold the corresponding voxel coordinates.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* miconvert_world_to_voxel needs an array of doubles     *
   * but miget_real_value needs unsigned longs - so we cast */
  for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++) { 
    voxel_location[i] = (unsigned long) dvoxel_location[i];
  }

  printf(&quot;Voxel location of xyz 0 0 0: %lu %lu %lu\n&quot;, 
         voxel_location[0], voxel_location[1], voxel_location[2]);

  /* print the value at that location */
  miget_real_value(minc_volume, voxel_location, 3, &amp;voxel);
  printf(&quot;Voxel at xyz 0 0 0 was: %f\n&quot;, voxel);

  return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The rest of the code should once again seem fairly familiar. There is one slightly awkward cast in there, as ''miconvert_world_to_voxel'' assigns the converted voxel coordinates to an array of doubles, but ''miget_real_value'' needs an array of unsigned longs. We could do some real interpolation, but we'll be lazy and just cast the double back to the unsigned long.

== code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;minc2.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  mihandle_t    minc_volume;
  double        voxel;
  int           result, i;
  double        world_location[3];
  double        dvoxel_location[3];
  unsigned long voxel_location[3];
  
  /* open the volume - first and only command line argument */
  result = miopen_volume(argv[1], MI2_OPEN_READ, &amp;minc_volume);
  /* check for error on opening */
  if (result != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening input file: %d.\n&quot;, result);
  }

  /* convert world coordinates to voxel coordinates */
  world_location[0] = world_location[1] = world_location[2] = 0.0;
  miconvert_world_to_voxel(minc_volume, world_location, dvoxel_location);

  /* miconvert_world_to_voxel needs an array of doubles     *
   * but miget_real_value needs unsigned longs - so we cast */
  for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++) { 
    voxel_location[i] = (unsigned long) dvoxel_location[i];
  }

  printf(&quot;Voxel location of xyz 0 0 0: %lu %lu %lu\n&quot;, 
	 voxel_location[0], voxel_location[1], voxel_location[2]);

  /* print the value at that location */
  miget_real_value(minc_volume, voxel_location, 3, &amp;voxel);
  printf(&quot;Voxel at xyz 0 0 0 was: %f\n&quot;, voxel);

  return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=How do we see things that are very small?=
[[Image:Phase_contrast_microscope_labelled1.jpg|left|thumb|300px| A compound microscope with phase contrast condenser.]]
In order to see things that are smaller than the eye can see, we use tools called '''microscopes'''. Light can be bent by pieces of glass called lenses, and this is how magnifying glasses are made that make images look bigger.

A magnifying glass is a ''simple microscope''. If you place one magnifying glass over another one, you can make an image appear larger than it appears with only one magnifying glass. A microscope that uses two or more lenses to magnify an image is called a ''compound microscope''.

===Types of Microscopes===

====Compound light microscopes====
Biologists today have many types of microscopes that they use to observe cells, but the most commonly used is the compound light microscope. A ''compound light microscope'' uses light bent by glass lenses to magnify a thin sample of something. Living cells can be observed with a compound light microscope.


====Electron microscopes====
[[Image:Elektronenmikroskop.jpg|right|thumb|100px|An electron microscope.]]
An ''electron microscope'' can see objects smaller than cells such as details inside bacterial cells, and the structures of large proteins and viruses. Most samples must be killed (fixed) before they can be observed by an electron microscope. An electron microscope uses electrons instead of light to view an image. This gives an image with a higher resolution.

A ''transmission electron microscope'' shines electrons straight through a sample just as a compound light microscope shines light through a sample. A ''scanning electron microscope'' bounces electrons off of the surface of sample. Both types of microscope view the image projected on a surface like a television screen.

====Proximity probe microscopes====
[[Image:Atomic_Force_Microscope_Science_Museum_London.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Atomic force microscope]]

A ''proximity probe microscope'' uses a very sharp probe that glides across the surface of a sample. The image is composited by a computer. Proximity probe microscopes vary by the type of probe, and by what it measures. Some proximity probe microscopes can detect individual atoms and molecules.

An ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy atomic force microscope]'' is a type of proximity probe microscope that moves across the surface of an object like a blind person reading in braille. It tilts up and down due to the atomic forces of the surface below, and this can be measured to make an image.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is intended for use in an undergraduate teacher education course that focuses on teaching and learning in multicultural ways.  It contains an overview of the history of antiracist activism in the U.S. and information about who activists are and the type of work they do or have done.  Sample curricula provide teachers with reliable lesson plans they can use in K-12 settings so that students will be able to learn about the activists and the projects with which they were involved.  The book will also highlight the ways in which students have become involved in school and community projects that challenge the inequities they see. Contemporary student-generated social action projects originating in K-12 settings will also be explored.

== Overview ==

'''''Thorfinn Rowle''''' is a large, blond man. He is a Death Eater.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] follows [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] down from the Astronomy Tower after the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], he finds a large, blond Death Eater in the hallway firing off curses indiscriminately. It seems that one of his curses was the cause of one of the two Death Eater casualties; he had tried to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|curse]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and missed. At the word from Snape, he breaks off the fight and runs, along with the others; apparently he follows Snape, who is using various short cuts, because he is ahead of Harry when they reach the front door of the school, while the Carrows and Greyback are behind Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When the two Death Eaters attack [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] in the cafe on the Tottenham Court Road, Harry recalls that the &quot;large blond&quot; Death Eater was one of the ones at Hogwarts, and recognizes the other is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Antonin Dolohov]]. Ron tells Harry that he thinks the large one's name is Thorfinn Rowle.

After the Trio have returned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], Harry has an episode where he sees into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s mind. Thorfinn Rowle is being tortured for having let Ron and Hermione escape. Harry is sickened to find that Voldemort is ordering Draco Malfoy to do the actual torturing.

Rowle is one of the Death Eaters gathered around Voldemort in the clearing in the forest when Harry goes to meet Voldemort.

== Overview ==

'''''Selwyn''''' (first name unknown) is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] are escaping from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]], the pursuing Death Eaters determine that he is the real Harry Potter, out of the six sets of protector and Potter there. Having discovered this, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] gathers his Death Eaters and attacks Harry personally. Harry's wand destroys the wand Voldemort is using (which he had taken from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]), so Voldemort demands a fresh wand from Selwyn. Before he can use it, though, Harry is through the protective spells surrounding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]' house.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], in disguise as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mafalda Hopkirk|Mafalda Hopkirk]] in the Ministry, catches sight of the Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] is wearing, and comments that it is lovely. Umbridge says that the S is for Selwyn, and she wears it because she is related to the Selwyn family, one of the last remaining bastions of pureblood wizardry.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]], in hopes of winning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|his daughter's]] freedom, summons the Death Eaters, telling them that Harry is in his house, Selwyn is one of the two Death Eaters who respond to the summons. He seems annoyed at the summons, saying that this is the third time Xeno has called, and also because he had apparently tried to blow them up as they arrived. While he accuses Xeno of making things up again, he is also repeatedly jinxing him. Hermione engineers their escape by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|disapparating]] the Trio in midair as they fall through the hole she makes in the ceiling, allowing the Death Eaters to see her and Harry so that they know Xeno isn't lying this time, but hiding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] as he is supposed to be ill with Spattergroit at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]].

[[image:Phase_contrast_microscope_labelled1.jpg|right|thumb|400px]]

All living organisms are made up of subunits called cells. Most cells are too small for the human eye to see, so we must use '''microscopes''' to see them.

The most common type of microscope used in biological labs is the ''compound light microscope''. In this laboratory we will look at different types of cells under the light microscope.

In this laboratory we will learn to use the microscope. We will look at prepared slides and make &quot;wet mounts&quot;. We will observe the differences in appearance between cells of different Kingdoms, and we will identify organelles visible with the light microscope.

'''GOALS'''
# Identify the parts of the microscope.
# Learn to use microscope.
# Learn to make a wet mount.
# Draw and identify cells belonging to: Bacteria, Protists, Fungi, plants, and Animals.
# Learn to identify plant organelles in the microscope.
# Observe Osmosis in plant cells. 

''To Do:''

A. Identify the parts of the microscope

B. Animal cells
	Follow instructions. 
	Draw cheek cell / list total magnification on all drawings

C. Onion epidermis cells
	Prepare slide following instructions
	Draw cells

D. Cell Plasmolysis
	Draw plant cell before and after plasmolysis
	
E. Observe cells from the different kingdoms
	Draw a cell of each type excluding archea

==USE OF THE MICROSCOPE==

1. Moving and carrying
Always carry the microscope by holding the arm with one hand while the other firmly supports the base. Do not tilt the microscope or the eyepieces may fall off and be damaged.

2. Cleaning
Wipe the stage after each use with absorbant paper. Use ONLY Lens paper to clean the eyepiece, objective lenses, and condenser lens. Any other type of paper may make permanent scratches.

If you use immersion oil, always completely clean the oil from the lens before moving to a lower lens, or storing the microscope. Otherwise, you will make a big mess. Use only lens paper to clean the lens glass.

3.Binocular eyepieces
Binocular eyepieces can be adjusted to each individuals eye distance. If the image is not a full circle, or there is more than one image, adjust the distance by pushing the eyepieces together or pulling apart.

4. Objective lenses
Always start and end your microscope session by placing the lowest power objective lens in position. This will make it easier to prevent crashing the objective lens into the slide.

5. Coarse and fine adjustment
The coarse adjustment knob should only be used with the lowest power objective lens. Once it is in focus, you will only need to use the fine focus. Using the coarse focus with higher lenses may result in crashing the lens into the slide.

6. Stage controls
The slide is placed on the stage between clamps. The dial on the right side contains two sets of controls. One that moves the stage up and down, and one that moves the stage side to side. The image viewed through the eyepiece is often inverted, so you may need to move the slide left for the image to move right, or move the slide up for the image to move down.

7. The condenser
The condenser is a lens that focuses the light on the stage. Always start by setting the condenser diaphram to the smallest size possible and open it slowly until the slide is illuminated correctly. The condenser can help prevent the image from appearing washed out.

==Directions for microscope use==

1. Plug in and turn on the lamp. Turn the light to a medium high power.

2. Make sure that the lowest powered objective lens is down. Lower the stage to its lowest setting.

3. Position the slide in the clamps. Use the stage controls to make sure that the image is centered. It should be positioned below the objective and in the path of the light.

4. If a condenser is present, set the aperature dial on the lowest setting. (smallest opening).

5. Looking in the eyepiece, slowly move the coarse adjustment knob to find the specimen. If you are unsure that you are looking at the slide, move the slide from side to side. If the specimen is thick, begin by focusing on the side of the specimen and then moving the slide to the center.

6. Adjust the light for the best viewing using the condensor knob, and the light level controls.

7. To use a higher powered objective, click the new objective into position, and then refocus using the fine adjustment knobs. Always look when turning objectives to prevent crashing the lens into the slide.

8. When you are in focus, use the stage controls to scan the field and find a good example to observe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">African American Vernacular English is a dialect or sociolect spoken in the United States. It is sometimes considered as a creole or sometimes even a separate language. It is spoken by many African Americans, Caucasians, and even some Hispanics or Asians are able to speak it. Another name for African American Vernacular English is Ebonics, AAVE, or Black American English.

AAVE has been spoken since the arrival of African slaves, it has used in the Hip-Hop culture. African American Vernacular English gets some of its grammar and words from many African words such as the Wolof word &quot;Dig&quot; which means understand. The Wolof word &quot;Dig&quot; derives from the Serer word &quot;Ndigil&quot; which means truth in the Serer language. Some of its grammar comes from Southern American English and Gullah. There is also Black American Language. Like AAVE, it has some differences from Standard English. The spelling of AAVE could be confusing, but it is a very easy to learn this creole, dialect, language, or sociolect.

:Some Wikibookians that have works target in a RfD normally see it (and the comments), as personal critics. Making them extremely demoralizing in an environment that works &lt;s&gt;based&lt;/s&gt; in a volunteering basis. Comments on RfD tend also to work as political displays and normal bad-wagoning, especially when adding nothing to the argumentation presented, it is not uncommon to see new Wikibookians taking actions on the RfD as a way to mark their presence on the project, other situations involve larger political stances where an issue is not clearly defined on the project (gay areas), an RfD can even be a covert attack but in any case we have also historically felt that there should be some restrains in using the RfD (this is way we do protect stubs and give to most projects a grace period). In any case most editors will not ever be involved in the political side of the Wikibooks project but that isn't to say that it doesn't exist, even if some of us see that RfD are a lousy way to go about it.
:In any case I'm glad that you do not feel demoralized, and hope my actions helped to make clear that the RfD in not personal and why the proposal for deletion was raised.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:39, 25 July 2011 (UTC)

:::The Wikibooks policy is clear. If you are attempting to redefine the concept of textbook, that is not the forum for it. Policy change requires a policy discussion.

==  This code has nothing to do with the phase vocoder ==

Hi there,

the basic principle of the phase vocoder is to determine phase relations between frames from the observed phase difference in adjacent frames. For this to work the encoder needs to store the observed phase difference. AS the encoder here is calculating only the amplitude spectrum and the phases/frequencies that are used are the nominal frequencies of the spectral bins and not the phases of the observed signal this code does not produce anything that remotely resembles even the very first algorithm 
proposed by Flanagan in 1966 see [[w:Phase vocoder]] even less the work by Laroche or the transient processing proposed by Roebel. This code should be removed because nearly all statements that are made are fundamentally wrong.

[[User:Raebolex|Raebolex]] ([[User talk:Raebolex|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Raebolex|contribs]]) 13:01, 2 July 2011 (UTC)

: Are there any reasons that maintaining phase coherence during resynthesis after time- and/or frequency-scale modification is not more central to the basic principle of the phase vocoder?  That is precisely what the code here does.  Any means to maintain phase coherence during resynthesis after modification can not preserve most of the original phase information, and must discard all of it for heavily polyphonic sounds.  If you have counterexamples, please share them.  When the STFT bins and frames are small enough, what benefit is there in using any of the initial signal's phase information?
: Instead of deleting the code in its entirety, why not provide an alternative improved implementation, and improve the specific statements you believe to be flawed? [[User:Jsalsman|Jsalsman]] ([[User talk:Jsalsman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsalsman|contribs]]) 14:16, 2 July 2011 (UTC)

Sorry, I'm afraid you misunderstand the terms &quot;maintain phase coherence&quot;. maintain means&quot; preserve as it was&quot;. In your code you throw away the phase during the analysis. Therefore, during synthesis you cannot maintain them! I already said so: please read the papers you mention. Notably the paper from Laroche. You will see all is about the phase relations as they are in the original sound. Constructing phases from amplitudes is a completley different story and has nothing to do with the phase vocoder.
Here you construct phases from nominal bin frequencies. But in the real sounds phases are only weakly related to bin frequencies. If you want to keep the code, then either you have to rewrite it completely to make it reflect the phase vocoder, or you rename the section to not make people believe this has anything to do with the phase vocoder.

The first thing I would propose is that you remove all the comments about what your code does in the introduction.
I can assure you that you are not having a single bit in your code that reflects the ideas of Laroche and you are even further away from the other paper. I am really sorry but if you have read these papers then you have misunderstood everything.

:I'm willing to change as much commentary and code comments as we need to reach an agreement, but I'm reluctant to modify the actual code because it's been used successfully in audio editors for pitch modification and time scaling, and (along with a pitch tracker) a software autotune process. &quot;Coherence&quot; usually denotes self-consistency.  In the resynthesis process, maintaining phase coherence is a very local task working horizontally across frames after selecting peaks vertically across bins, at least since Puckette's work.  If we accept that any phase vocoder will have to discard most if not all of the original signal's phase information when pitch- or time-scaling a signal as simple as a single human voice, then does it make any sense if &quot;coherence&quot; refers to preservation of the original signal's phase?  So, is it still appropriate to refer to the resynthesis portion as a phase vocoder?  Is there any reason to believe that preservation of any of the original signal's phase is an essential or necessary aspect of phase vocoders in general?  The fact that it must be discarded in many if not most cases leads me to the opposite conclusion.
:Alternatively, if the code here was modified to record and start with the original signal's phases, would that satisfy your concerns?
:I've changed the commentary about the 1999 and 2003 sources; please let me know what you think. [[User:Jsalsman|Jsalsman]] ([[User talk:Jsalsman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsalsman|contribs]]) 20:52, 2 July 2011 (UTC)
:...Another possibility might be to call this a &quot;Phase-Locked Vocoder&quot; after Puckette (1995) who pioneered the basic idea. Would that be preferable? [[User:Jsalsman|Jsalsman]] ([[User talk:Jsalsman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsalsman|contribs]]) 23:03, 2 July 2011 (UTC)

Your code indeed ensures phase coherence in some sense. Not in the phase vocoder sense though. Look for example into 
the paper from Puckette where he generates the synthesis spectrum Y(u_i, k). The phases are clearly derived from the input spectrum. Yours aren't. The most central idea of the phase vocoder is the equation w(k)=... on page 1 high in column 2 of the puckette paper. This equation was introduced by Flanagan when he established the term phase vocoder in 1966. 
See here for a very brief summary [https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Phase_Vocoder.html] of what the basic phase vocoder principle is supposed to be. So as long as you don't use that equation you cannot call your code phase vocoder!

So what are you doing and why does it somehow work? As far as I understand your code you use the FFT maximum bins as estimate of the sinusoidal frequency and synthesize the phase according to this frequency assuming the sinusoid is stationary. For that you use an idea introduced by Miller Puckette in his 1995 paper. So this is a sort of a sinusoidal model that generates sinusoids directly in the spectral domain. It is very common for sinusoidal models to not respect phase relations in the original signal and to consider only phase coherence on the synthesis side. BTW, after having studied your code I come to the conclusion that it  resembles the ideas presented in US patent 5401897!! But I think your implementation is making so many errors and approximations that nobody will consider this a copyright issue.

With respect to correctness. An example for a problem is the alternating phase principle that Puckette introduced. 
This is correct only if window size == fft size (variable N in the paper). 
In your code this relation is not ensured. There are other inconsistencies but I won't go any further here. 
If you would fix them all you would indeed have something useful.

&gt;:Alternatively, if the code here was modified to record and start with the original signal's phases, would that satisfy your concerns?

No, this doesn't make much of a difference. See my comment on what is essential for a phase vocoder above.
I suggest calling this code an (approximate) spectral domain analysis/resynthesis 
with an additive sinusoidal model.

:On one hand you say that deriving phases from the input spectrum is part of the most central idea of a phase vocoder, but on the other hand you say if I changed the code to use those input phases it wouldn't make much of a difference.  I've had detailed discussions about this algorithm and its properties with engineers from CCRMA, where you cite that summary.  I propose that we try to get a third opinion about this from a DSP email list or similar. [[User:Jsalsman|Jsalsman]] ([[User talk:Jsalsman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsalsman|contribs]]) 19:50, 3 July 2011 (UTC)

You need to derive the phases over time from the input signal not only the start phase. If you want to you  code to be an exemple of the phase vocoder  then you have to establish the bin frequency from the phase differences using the equation provided by Flanagan. This equation has been used in all the papers about the phase vocoder you have cited above and is the central idea of the phase vocoder. Now you have said first you don't want to change your code (because it worked here and there) and then that you may change the starting phase. But changing the starting phase only, does not introduce the principle idea of the phase vocoder into the implementation and is therefore not solving the issue. So please change the title and the first phrase of the wiki page.

Note that the fact that you discussed things with ccrma engineers does not qualify the code to be a phase vocoder example. Please provide a convincing argumentation why a phase vocoder code example should not use the fundamental phase vocoder equation. 
If you cannot provide it yourself then you may ask a third party to provide it. Once again, I am not claiming that your code does not work, but, I am claiming that it cannot be called phase vocoder.

Please don't remove the dispute indication because the dispute is not resolved! 
[[User:Raebolex|Raebolex]] ([[User talk:Raebolex|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Raebolex|contribs]]) 07:14, 7 July 2011 (UTC)

:Okay, how about renaming this &quot;Phase-locked vocoder&quot;? [[User:Jsalsman|Jsalsman]] ([[User talk:Jsalsman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsalsman|contribs]]) 17:34, 8 July 2011 (UTC)

If you look into the Phase-Locked vocoder from Puckette then you have only a part of it. I'd think you can say &quot;Phase-Locked vocoder&quot; if in the introduction you explain that this implementation is not exactly following the paper from Puckette but incorporates some of the central ideas. For further information reader should then look into the paper.

:This algorithm is far more efficient than Puckette's or Dolson et al's. Perhaps it might be useful to provide a comparison table of execution times for resynthesis.  Are there any reliable sources supporting your assertion that a phase vocoder must satisfy Flanagan's original equation? [[User:Jsalsman|Jsalsman]] ([[User talk:Jsalsman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsalsman|contribs]]) 17:31, 9 July 2011 (UTC)
:How long do you need to find such reliable sources, if they exist, before the dispute can be considered resolved? [[User:Jsalsman|Jsalsman]] ([[User talk:Jsalsman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsalsman|contribs]]) 03:27, 19 July 2011 (UTC)

Is this a joke? Please read my posts above. All papers that you cite use this equation. The term phase vocoder has been introduced based on this equation. I've given you a link to the page of Julius smith from CCRMA, one of the major authorities for audio signal processing. If you understand what is written in all the references I have given then you have reliable sources. Your question seems to indicate that you don't understand what is written in the papers! Then please read Dolsons tutorial article in the computer music journal. It is written much less mathematically. 

Please note that increased efficiency is no valid argument. And compared to the algorithm proposed by Dolson and Laroche I have strong doubts that your code is more efficient. You have to do a sort of all bins. This
is most likely less efficient then what Dolson and Laroche have proposed. Anyway, by removing parts from an algorithm you can always make it more efficient. For example you can remove perceptual masking from MP3 compression, it becomes more efficient, but it wont work as good, and it should not be called MP3.

I won't discuss here anymore. If you don't understand the arguments I have given then I think the discussion is useless. I therefore I will then add an official deletion request to make other contributors aware of this wrong and misleading content. 
[[User:Raebolex|Raebolex]] ([[User talk:Raebolex|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Raebolex|contribs]]) 17:20, 19 July 2011 (UTC)

:Where has Julius Smith claimed that the algorithm described here doesn't conform to Flanagan's phase vocoder equation? If he has said or implied such a thing, he is mistaken. For example, consider low frequencies: any phase-locked vocoder satisfies Flanagan's equation at low enough frequencies even if it doesn't satisfy it at higher frequencies. Also, can you please explain what you mean about partial order alternatives to a full sort? I can't think of any partial orders which would be more useful than a full sort in the average case. [[User:Jsalsman|Jsalsman]] ([[User talk:Jsalsman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsalsman|contribs]]) 19:23, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

Ok, here we go. More discussion. The basic equation that Flanagan introduced is equation 10 in the ref given by Julius Smith. You don't have this equation. Smith writes that the phase vocoder is based on an analysis of instantaneous phases and a phase difference to frequency at different points of the text:

 The digital computer made it possible for the phase vocoder to easily support phase modulation of 
 the synthesis oscillators as well as implementing their amplitude envelopes. Thus, in addition to 
 computing the instantaneous amplitude at the output of each (complex) band-pass filter, the 
 instantaneous phase was also computed. (Phase could be converted to frequency by taking a time derivative.)
 ...
 The phase vocoder also relaxed the requirement of pitch-following (needed in the vocoder), because the 
 phase modulation computed by the analysis stage automatically fine-tuned each sinusoidal 
 component within its filter-bank channel.

Since Flanagans paper all papers about the phase vocoder use Flanagans  eq. 10 in one form or another, notably all papers you have mentioned in your example. You don't use it. That's the problem.
With respect to the equation that your code satisfies: You probably mean the eq 5 in Flanagan 1966. This equation is not specific for the phase vocoder, it's simply a sinusoidal model (See X. Serra paper on SMS). This is exactly what you do in your implementation: a sinusoidal model. Now the phase vocoder is a means to implement a sinusoidal model but not every implementation of a sinusoidal model should be called phase vocoder.

With respect to the sort. A standard phase vocoder algorithm does not require a sort it processes every bin independently of all the others. Dolson/Laroche don't even need to calculate phase for all bins, only for a small subset. That's why I don't think your implementation is efficient.
[[User:Raebolex|Raebolex]] ([[User talk:Raebolex|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Raebolex|contribs]]) 17:16, 27 July 2011 (UTC)

:I admit I haven't cited Flanagan's paper or equation, and I agree it would be instructive to do so.  If you have measurements of the efficiency of sorting bins by amplitude when deciding which order in which to propagate phases, please share them. If you wanted to only start propagating from the top-N amplitude bins, I think you would still need to perform a full sort, but it might be possible to optimize the inner loop of that sort.

If you want to know how to do a very efficient and rather high quality phase vocoder

==Island Biogeography==
Biogeography is the study of the geographic location of a species.  Island biogeography is the study of the species composition and species richness on islands.
Island biogeography is a study aimed at establishing and explaining the factors that affect species diversity of a specific community.  An island in this context, is not just a segment of land surrounded by water.  It is any area of habitat surrounded by areas unsuitable for the species on the island. Other examples of ''&quot;islands&quot;'' include dung piles, game preserves, mountain tops, and lakes. [[File: Kitcarsonmtn.jpg|118KB|right|thumb|Mountain tops are considered islands.]]

In 1967, ecologists Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson, coined the '''Theory of Island Biogeography'''.  This theory attempted to predict the number of species that would exist on a newly created island.  It also explained how distance and area combine to regulate the balance between immigration and extinction in an island population.  Immigration is the appearance of a new species in a community.  Extinction is then the disappearance of a species from a community. This relationship is known as &quot;species turnover&quot;, states that the equilibrium value for the island is proportional to the number of immigrants that come to the island, and the loss of individuals due to emigration and extinction. 

E.O. Wilson and R. MacArthur did several experiments and made several predictions about the Theory of Island Biogeography.  Some of their predictions included (1)species richness tends toward an equilibrium value and (2) the equilibrium value is the result of immigration, but emigration and extinction may also occur.

The equilibrium value (equilibrium diversity value) of an island depends on the area of the island- the larger the area the more resources there are on the island.  Smaller islands support smaller populations, and smaller populations are more likely to become extinct.  Here is where the '''Target Effect''' comes in play.  The Target Effect says that larger islands have higher immigration rates because they are a bigger target.

Three basic types of species-area relationships have been well defined and demonstrated through various experiments within the field of ecology: &quot;type-1&quot; investigates species richness vs. sample area in nested samples (within a defined habitat or region), &quot;type-2&quot; is defined by examining the total species richness vs. total area among habitats or regions differing in area, and &quot;type-3&quot; examines local species richness in a sample of defined size among habitats or regions differing in area {{ref|Holt1999}}.

Another factor that determines the equilibrium diversity value is the distance from the source as discussed below.  For example, the immigration rate is higher at closer islands than on islands that are further away from the mainland.  Here is where the '''Rescue Effect''' comes in mind. The rescue effect decreases the rate of extinction due to recolonization and immigration. Immigration is a major contributor due to increasing population size and the size of the genetic pool. These two factors can reduce the probability that any particular species will become extinct {{ref|Brown1977}}. Recolonization happens through two occurrences: Immigration and invasion; immigration is the arrival of a new species to an area, while invasion is the arrival of a species that already inhabits an area {{ref|Simberloff1968}}.

The last factor that contributes and/or determines the equilibrium diversity value is the species richness of the source.  Species richness is the number of species in a community.  Although islands are considered relatively new land, they can still have a great deal of diversity on them over a few years.  This concept comes from the '''Time/Stability Hypothesis''' and to the '''Species-Area Effect''' which both say that the older the land is/the longer the land has been around, the more diversity and the more stable that land will contain.  For example, islands may not be diverse right away because they have not been around long enough for species to migrate onto that particular land mass. The Species-Area Effect states that increased area results in increase species equilibrium. However, this relationship is not linear. The following equation describes this relationship: S=cA&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;, where S is the number of species, c is a constant, A is the area, and z is the slope of the line (varies).

Islands may be colonized several different ways:(1) by hitchhiking on other species, (2)flying, (3) rafting, (4) swimming, (5) wind, (6) and speciation.  It takes time for the new islands to gain several different species of animals due to several different aspects, but given enough time the islands will obtain life on them and become more and more diverse.  

===Theory of Island Biogeography===

The Theory of Island Biogeography is determined by two factors.  The first is the effect of distance from the '''mainland'''.  The mainland is where new immigrant species originally inhabited.  The second is the effect of island size. 

These two factors establish how many species an island can hold at equilibrium.  '''The equilibrium species number''' is the species richness of an island at which immigration balances extinction and which remains roughly constant. [[File:Species Equilibrium.gif|right|800px]]

In previous chapters numerous hypotheses have been explored concerning biodiversity. Productivity hypothesis and Rapoport's Rule are major players in the world of ecological biodiversity. These hypotheses have been measured on a continental scale and oceanic scale but how well can they explore the biodiversity of islands? Earlier in this chapter colonization of islands was explained with the effect of size and distance from the mainland. How is diversity affected by the species richness gradient for island geography? Do the same patterns, or lack of, follow islands as they extend from lower latitudes to higher latitudes?

In this section three sets of islands in varying latitudes will be examined. The tropical islands of Kiribata are situated 1&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;33&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt; north of the equator. The Canary Islands in the North Atlantic are located 28&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;06&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt; north of the equator and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic at 51&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;40&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt; south of the equator. The biodiversity explored included fauna and flora.

The islands of Kiribata are Gilbert Islands, Phoenix Islands and the Line Islands. Phoenix Islands will be used for this survey. The biodiversity of the islands include numerous fish, birds and wildlife. The Phoenix Islands are the third largest marine biodiversity in the world and in 2006 were protected by the Kiribata government. The island's land biodiversity is not  equivalent to the biodiversity of a tropical forest but the diversity in the surrounding water is expansive. Coral Reefs and the distance from any populous country leave Phoenix Islands undisturbed by tourists. The Phoenix Islands are susceptible to periods of drought which affect the biodiversity of plants and animals. These islands sitting almost directly on the equator support Productivity hypothesis in the water but on land it is not supported due to erratic rainfall. The Canary Islands biodiversity are one of the most expansive in the temperate regions of the world. Scientists studying Canary Islands over the past decades have been discovering a new species or subspecies about every six days. The discovery of new species at this rate makes the Canary Islands an extraordinary example of biodiversity. Twenty-Eight degrees above the equator seems like the ideal place for biomass. The European Union removed internal border checkpoints about ten years ago. Invasive species (chapter 6) have started to take control since the removal of internal borders and have decreased native plant populations by an estimated fifty percent.

The Falkland Islands are the furthest away from the equator at fifty-one degrees south of the equator. The flora on the Falkland Islands are very limited and no trees grow naturally on the islands. The fauna is more diverse than the flora with over sixty types of birds breeding on the islands. Mammals on the island are also limited with three types of seals and smaller mammals and dolphins offshore. The Falkland Islands support the Productivity hypothesis. Moving farther away from the equator diversity is limited. Biodiversity seems to be the greatest not at the equator but approximately thirty degrees north and south of the equator.

==Endemism==
[[File:Fynbos.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The [[Wikipedia:en:Fynbos|Fynbos]] of South Africa are a great example of Endemism.]]

[[Wikipedia:en:Endemism|Endemism]] comes from the word endemic which means it is unique to its own place or region and not found naturally anywhere else.  The place must be a discrete geographical unit, often an island or island group, but sometimes a country, habitat type, or other defined area or zone.  Endemic regions often include large bodies of water, or mountain ranges but mostly islands due to their isolation. Older islands usually have a higher degree of endemism.

Endemic Species can often become endangered or extinct due to their limited habitats and vulnerability to the actions of humans, such as large scale logging and slash and burn techniques.  Some ecosystems with high endimism include, the Hawaiian forests, the [[Wikipedia:en:Fynbos|Fynbos]] in South Africa, and many other rainforests and dry forests.

Endemic species are also affected greatly by invasive or alien species. Such is the case for the Hawaiian tree snail. The Hawaiian tree snail's existence is being threatened by the loss of habitat via deforestation (an anthropogenic impact) and by the grazing of ungulates, predation by rats, and an intentionally introduced snail, ''Euglandina rosea'' {{ref|Holland2004}}.

==Habitat Fragmentation==

“[Habitat] fragmentation ''per se'' is a landscape-level phenomenon in which species that survive in habitat remnants are confronted with a modified environment of reduced area, increased isolation and novel ecological boundaries {{ref|Ewers2005}}.” '''Habitat Fragmentation''' is one of the largest causes of species extinctions, along with invasive species. We know that an ecosystem requires land and resources to maintain its diversity, but how much is enough? And when an ecosystem becomes isolated, will the edges of that isolated area remain the same kind of ecosystem as the center?

These questions are studied and answers are inferred through the study of truly isolated habitats: islands.
[[File:Coyote.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The coyote is a predator that increases with fragmented landscapes.]]
Islands have less diverse populations than large continents, especially those far from mainlands. Such islands have less opportunity for colonization. In order to apply what we know about islands to fragmented habitats, we must recognize colonization and extinction as constantly occurring within populations.


Anthropogenic or human-derived habitat modification is the largest cause of fragmentation. However, naturally fragmented systems are found all over the world {{ref|Ewers2005}}. Habitat fragmentation often results in lack of food and other resources for species that need them. It also eliminates habitat for species that need large unbroken blocks of habitat, examples of species that have this problem as a result of fragmentation are bobcats and upland sandpipers. This results in a increased risk of death by predation because the animal might be forced to venture outside it's patch to find food in order to avoid starvation. Certain predators like raccoons, foxes, coyotes, house cats, and crows tend to increase in fragmented landscapes. This is do to them being highly adaptable and being able to take advantage of the resources available to them. high predation in small patches makes death by predation more common for certain species. This is one of the factors that is contributing to the decline of neotropic songbirds in eastern temperate forest.

==Metapopulation Theory==

'''Metapopulation Theory''' states that several distinct “Patches” are stabilized by their proximity to other patches. A '''Patch''' is an area inhabited or potentially inhabited by a member of a metapopulation. Patches are usually small areas of land that consist of small populations. The probability of species occurrence in patches is related to the following two factors: habitat destruction and fragmentation{{ref|Prugh2008}}. Because the number of individuals in these patches is small, they can very easily become extinct. This results in '''demographic stochasticity''', which are fluctuations in population size due to random demographic events. [[Image:View from the top of Sulphur Mountain 03.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Mountain tops are an example of a patch in a metapopulation.]] The rate at which re-colonization can occur is proportional to the distance between the patches. The further the distance between two patches, the longer it will take for the patch to become colonized again. When one patch has a jump in the number of individuals that inhabit it, the surrounding patches will also be stabilized by the immigration from the species rich patch. The change in a patches inhabitants can be determined by the equation '''(dp/dt) =mp (1-p)-µp'''; where '''P''' is fraction of colonized patches, '''M''' is the average recolonization rate, '''µ''' is the extinction rate, and '''1-p''' is the uncolonized patches. The metapopulation is stable when the rate at which recolonization is equal the rate of extinction.

The classic concept of metapopulation was first mathematically formulated by [[Wikipedia:Richard_Levins|R. Levin]] in 1969, but received minute attention until the 1990s when ecologists realized fragmentation of continuous populations into discrete subpopulations was occurring at a high rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ICT for Disaster Management}}

Disaster reconstruction has to start as soon as the initial disaster cleanup has taken place.This is
a very complex endeavour, requiring a huge array of skill sets and a thorough knowledge of an
ever-increasing variety of techniques and equipment. A range of software tools are being used
for these purposes. Thus, while the role of ICT in the long-term disaster recovery process is not
as apparent as it is in disaster warning, there is no doubt that ICT is being used widely to
expedite these activities.

===Specific Disaster Management Software===
Different types of software tools are being used to gather, store and analyse data related to
disasters, not only in post-disaster conditions, but also as a long-term measure to mitigate the
risk of the disasters. One such approach is known as DesInventar.
DesInventar is a methodical way to gather and store information about characteristics and
effects of different types of disasters, particularly the ones not visible from global or national
scales. This allows for the observation and analysis of accumulated data regarding these
‘invisible’ disasters at a global or national scale.
The DesInventar system can also be used to simulate disasters and study their impact.
For example, it is possible to trigger an earthquake in the virtual environment and analyse its
impact on a geographical area ranging from a municipality to a group of countries.The system
forecasts information on the possible loss of human lives, impact on the economy and damage
to infrastructure, etc.
DesInventar is also a tool that facilitates the analysis of disaster-related information for
applications in planning, risk mitigation and disaster recovery purposes. It can be used not just
by government agencies, but by NGOs as well in their disaster management work.
The following are some case studies where DesInventar and similar software are being used in
the disaster preparedness process.

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:highwaydm.jpg|600px]]
|}

===''Case Study 1: Latin America''===

This was the first time DesInventar was used in disaster preparedness activities.The project was
initiated by the Network for Social Studies on Disaster Prevention in Latin America in 1994.
National-level DesInventar disaster databases, with up to 30 years of data, have been developed
to date in 17 countries in North and South America.
Localized disasters with very limited direct impact (e.g. the destruction of a single house, or a
household affected by the loss of their harvest as a result of a frost) are also covered. However,
the focus was on major disasters that can affect a large number of people. The databases have
been developed by national governments, international organizations, universities,
scientific organizations and NGOs. Data is obtained from the media and government agencies,
and existing databases. Once collected, data is verified nationally for consistency. Shared
definitions are used for some key hazards, while for others, local specificity is more important.
The challenge of uniformity between the databases remains, limiting the capacity for
international comparisons.

===''Case Study 2: Orissa, India''===

In 2002, UNDP set up a database including an inventory of disaster events with a natural trigger
for the state of Orissa in India. The aim of the project was to develop a tool to help decision
makers prioritize expenditure in an objective manner. The Orissa project is to act as a pilot for
the next stage, including replication in an additional four Indian states and integration into a
national government of India integrated disaster resource network.
The methodology was modified from the experience of the Latin America initiative.News media
and government sources of information were used to build up the disaster events database. A
historical database going back to 1970 has been collated and is being updated on a weekly basis.

===''Case Study 3: South Africa''===
The programme for Monitoring, Mapping and Analysis of Disaster Incidents in South Africa
(MANDISA) is a core activity for the Disaster Mitigation for Sustainable Livelihoods Programme
of the University of Cape Town. MANDISA was initiated as a pilot study in the Cape Town
metropolitan area in the Western Province of South Africa from 1990 to 1999.The methodology
was inspired by DesInventar but has been adapted for the South African context.
MANDISA focuses on hazards relevant to South Africa, including large urban ‘non-drainage’
floods, wildfires and extreme wind events, as well as highly frequent ‘small’ and ‘medium’ fires.
Socio-economic and environmental risk factors that affect disaster impact are included where
possible, allowing the potential for tracking developmental conditions that prefigure disaster.
While newspapers formed one source of information for tracking disaster events, the South
African experience indicated that these provided limited insight into the highly recurrent
relatively small events that occur in informal settlements. Such newspaper coverage reflected
only 649 of the 12,300 total incidents tracked through a thorough review of 12 different data
sources, including incident reports from Fire Services, Social Services, the South African Red
Cross Society and disaster management agencies.

===Other Software===
Many other software applications, though they are not specifically meant for disaster
management purposes, are being used by disaster management practitioners.The following are
some examples.

===''Groove, http://www.groove.net''===
Groove was initially developed by a small technology start-up established by Ray Ozzie, creator
of Lotus Notes and former CEO of Iris Associates. Groove has recently been acquired by
Microsoft.
On its most basic level, Groove is a desktop software designed to facilitate collaboration and
communication among small groups. A key concept of the Groove paradigm is the shared
workspace. A Groove user creates a workspace and then invites other people into it. Each
person who responds to an invitation becomes a member of that workspace and is sent a copy
of the workspace that is installed on his/her hard drive. All data is encrypted both on disk and
over the network, with each workspace having a unique set of cryptographic keys. This local
copy avoids the physical distance between the user and his/her data. In other words, a
workspace is a private virtual location where members interact and collaborate. Once a
workspace is established, Groove keeps all the copies synchronized via the Internet or the
corporate network.When any one member makes a change to the space, that change is sent to
all copies for update. If that member is offline at the time the change is made, the change is
queued and synchronized to other workspace members when that member comes back
on-line. Using the shared workspace, one or more members (peers) now have a context for
collaboration.
Groove is being used widely by disaster management practitioners. It has been used in Iraq, the
Indian Ocean tsunami response and in other emergencies.

===''Voxiva, http://www.voxiva.net''===
Voxiva is another technology start-up with a specific philanthropic intent. It originally provided
only reporting services, especially in the health sector, to governments in developing countries.
Now, it targets NGOs as well as UN agencies. Voxiva offers an integrated monitoring and
reporting function through an on-line platform. Another application meant to provide
programme management in the field is currently being developed.
Voxiva’s Pyramid Platform is designed to bring technology to the so-called ‘bottom of the
pyramid’, such as rural and poor communities. By leveraging phones, mobile phones, personal
digital assistants (PDAs), faxes and radios as well as the Internet, applications built and deployed
on Voxiva’s multi-channel Pyramid Platform have much broader reach. Solutions built on the
Pyramid Platform allow organizations to collect information from and communicate with
distributed networks of people in a timely and systematic way.Voxiva also provides the tools to
organize maps and analyse the data collected and make the right decisions.Voxiva systems are
deployed to track diseases, monitor patients, report crime, and respond to disasters across Latin
America, Africa, Asia and the US.
Voxiva is currently being used by organizations such as the US Department of Defense, USAID,
the Rwanda Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Health of Tamil Nadu (India), the International
Rescue Committee and the Ministry of Health of Peru.

===''FACTS''===
The Food and Commodity Tracking System (FACTS) is an easy-to-use Internet-based application
that is capable of managing multiple relief operations simultaneously. Mercy Corps, a
humanitarian aid organization, based in Portland, USA has worked with Microsoft to develop
this tracking system that can help humanitarian aid agencies deliver supplies in disaster
situations.
According to Microsoft, FACTS represents the first significant step towards creating a standard
framework for improving humanitarian assistance on a global level. During crisis, coordinating
and distributing the millions of metric tonnes of food and other commodities from donors is a
challenge to even the most seasoned relief agencies. FACTS is an effort to address these
challenges.The FACTS design team, which also includes the American Red Cross, Catholic Relief
Services, Food Aid Management, Food for the Hungry International, Project Concern
International and Save the Children, has worked to standardize logistics operations and to
streamline reporting. This allows material aid programme managers to focus on the actual
delivery of needed supplies while maintaining high standards of commodity tracking.
Mercy Corps has already implemented FACTS pilot programmes in Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan.
Three additional agencies are using FACTS in their Bolivia and Guatemala operations, and one
agency soon plans to extend the solution to Ethiopia.
Apart from these specific software applications, there are many international and regional
organizations that use ICT effectively in the disaster management process. For example, the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has set up a secure extranet,
FedNet, https://fednet.ifrc.org, to share multilingual information among its staff, national
societies, field delegations, etc. Additionally, FedNet serves as an interactive forum for on-line collaboration.

===Disaster Information Networks===
National and regional networks are useful for effective information sharing and coordination.
Here are two examples.

===''UNDP’s Tsunami Resources and Results Tracking System''===
The High Level Coordination Meeting hosted by the Asian Development Bank in March 2005
emphasized the need for more effective tracing of tsunami aid resources and project results.
UNDP presented a package of capacity development support for aid coordination, including
staff, training and a customized Development Assistance Database (DAD), to help align aid
inflows with priority needs. The Government of Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand
have, with UNDP support, established nationally-owned aid information management systems.
A regional information portal and DAD system has been developed as a resource for
coordination at the regional level.This brings together results and resource allocation data from
each country and makes it available in one place at http://tsunamitracking.org.
By accessing DAD, users can find out real-time information on who is doing what and where.The
portal also provides access to various maps, reports, charts, documents and other information
giving donors, implementers, governments and the general public better insight into funding
flows and projects’ progress. A Private Sector DAD has also been developed to record private
sector flows, particularly those from transnational firms that may not have reported their
assistance to the individual government-owned systems in the tsunami-affected countries.

===''India Disaster Resource Network''===
The India Disaster Resource Network (IDRN) is a web-enabled and GIS-based national database
of resources essential for effective emergency response.The project, initiated by the Ministry of Home Affairs and UNDP, collects and stores information such as individual and organizational
expertise, and details of equipment and supplies required during emergencies, available at
government departments, military units, NGOs and private companies in different districts.
Accessible from http://www.idrn.gov.in, this inventory is being used by disaster managers at the
national, state and district levels to make informed decisions and mobilize resources quickly
during emergencies.

===GIS in Disaster Recovery===
In addition to its usage during the prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response phases of
disaster management, GIS can also play a role in disaster recovery, in both the immediate and
long-term phases.

===''Immediate Aftermath''===
In the aftermath of any disaster, it is essential to restore vital services and systems. This may
include providing temporary food, water and shelter to those who have lost homes in the
disaster.Medical services are needed for those who are injured. GIS can play several roles in this
process. It can identify the damage and begin to establish priorities for action (triage). GIS can
also ensure uniformity in the distribution of supplies (medicine, food, water, clothing, etc.) to
emergency distribution centres. They can be assigned in proper amounts based on the extent
and type of damage in each area.
Earth observation satellites could also be used in emergency situations where on-the-ground
resources are often not available. Satellites can provide data rapidly when there are
earthquakes, landslides, floods and other natural disasters that often prevent assessment by
ground or aerial services.They also provide accurate global coverage and operability no matter
what the weather or conditions are on the ground.They can also be used for a large number of
activities during their lifetime.

===''Long Term''===
Long-term recovery is to restore all services to normal or better than they were prior to the
disaster. It involves replacement of homes,water systems, streets, hospitals, bridges, schools, etc.
and returning life to normal. This can take several years. GIS tools can be used to track the
progress of these activities. It is also possible to prioritize restoration investments with the help
of GIS. A GIS can ease the burden of accounting for recovery activities.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Community Medicine is a new branch of medicine. It is often considered synonymous with Preventive and Social Medicine(PSM) , Public Health, and Community Health. All these share common ground, i.e., prevention of disease and promotion of health. In short, Community Medicine provides comprehensive health services ranging from preventive, promotive, curative to rehabilitative services. The importance of the speciality of Community Medicine has been very well recognised and emphasized repeatedly from grass root to international levels, not only in health sector but in other related sectors too. The scope of medicine has expanded during the last few decades to include not only health problems of individuals, but those of communities as well. If we want to achieve Health For All, Community Medicine will definitely be the key factor during the next millennium.

== Evolution and Development ==
a branch of medicine that is concerned with the health of the members of a community, municipality, or region. The emphasis in community medicine is on the early diagnosis of disease, the recognition of environmental and occupational hazards to good health, and the prevention of disease in the community
The industrial revolution of the 18th century while bringing affluence also brought new problems - slums, accumulation of refuse and human excreta, overcrowding and a variety of social problems. Frequent outbreaks of cholera added to the woes Chadwick’s report on ‘The Sanitary Conditions of Labouring Population (1842)’ focussed the attention of the people and Government on the urgent need to improve public health. Filth and garbage were recognised as man’s greatest enemies and it lead to great sanitary awakening bringing Public Health Act of 1848 in England, in acceptance of the principle that the state is responsible for the health of the people. The act was made more comprehensive in 1875 when Public Health Act 1875 was enacted. The public health movement in USA followed closely the English pattern. The organised professional body, American Public Health Association was formed in 1872.

Public Health is defined as the process of mobilising local, state, national and international resources to solve the major health problems affecting communities and to achieve Health For All by 2000 AD.

While Public Health made rapid strides in the western world, its progress has been slow in the developing countries where the main health problems continue to be those faced by the western world 100 years ago. The establishment of the World Health Organisation (WHO) providing a Health Charter for all people provided a great help to the public health movement in these countries.

Many different disciplines contributed to the growth of Public Health; physicians diagnosed diseases; sanitary engineers built water and sewerage systems; epidemiologists traced the sources of disease outbreaks and their modes of transmission; vital statisticians provided quantitative measures of births and deaths; lawyers wrote sanitary codes and regulations; public health nurses provided care and advice to the sick in their home; sanitary inspectors visited factories and markets to enforce compliance with public health ordinances; and administrators tried to organise everyone within the limits of the health departments budgets. Public Health thus involved Economics, Sociology, Psychology, Law, Statistics, and Engineering as well as biological and clinical sciences. Soon another important and emerging branch of medicine i.e., Microbiology became an integral part of Public Health. Public Health during the 19th Century was around sanitary regulations and the same underwent changes. 

Community Medicine developed as a branch of medicine distinct from Public Health. By definition, Community medicine is applied to ‘healthy’ people, customarily by actions affecting large numbers or populations. Its primary objective is prevention of disease and promotion of health. The development of laboratory methods for the early detection of disease was a further advance. 
 
Community Medicine has been defined as that speciality which deals with populations, and comprises those doctors who try to measure the needs of the population, both sick and well, who plan and administer services to meet those needs, and those who are engaged in research and teaching in the field. 

Decades old concept of health care approach has experienced a dramatic change. Today health is not merely an absence of disease; it is related to quality of life instead. Health is considered a means of productivity. Thus health development is essential to socio-economic development as a whole. Since health is an integral part of development, all sectors of society have an effect on health. Scope of medicine has extended from individual to community. Study of health and disease in population is replacing study of disease in man. Germ theory of disease gave place to newer concepts - multi-factorial causation. Social and behavioural aspects of the disease have been accorded a new priority. Contemporary medicine is no longer solely an art and science for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. It is also the science for the prevention of disease and promotion of health. Today technical sophistication of modern medicine is not an answer to everyday common ailments of the vast poor in the country. Appropriate technology and cheaper interventions like Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), immunisation, etc., are increasingly being applied as life saving measures and for disease prevention in community health care. Physicians’ role is no longer confined to diagnosing and treating those who come to the clinic. He is also responsible for those who need his service but can not come to the clinic. Health of the people is not only the concern of health care providers. It is the responsibility of the community also to identify and solve their own health problems through their active participation.

All these changes in concept and ideas of health and health care system are embodied in community health care. The spate of new ideas and concepts, for example, increasing importance given to social justice and equity, recognition of crucial role of community participation called for the new approaches to make medicine in the service of humanity more effective. 

Alma-Ata declaration in 1978 specified that Primary Health Care approach was the way of achieving the goal of Health For All by 2000 AD. Primary Health Care approach stressed that “essential health care should be made universally accessible to individuals and acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost the community and the country can afford”.

The eXist Database stores binary files as well as XML files.  Binary files include the XQuery scripts themselves.  This allows XQuery scripts to manipulate the XQuery scripts themselves - viewing, searching, analyzing, modifying and creating scripts, all the operations required of a development environment.

== Viewing the XQuery script ==

The eXist util module includes functions to read binary documents and convert to text.  Here they are used to view a script.  In this public interface,  a configuration file is used to control access to those scripts.

    &lt;publicScripts&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;listQueryText.xq&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/publicScripts&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

The script checks that a requested script name is present in the list of public scripts before retrieving the script.

      <text xml:space="preserve">All human societies have medical beliefs that provide explanations for, and responses to birth, death, and disease. Throughout the world, illness has often been attributed to witchcraft, demons, averse astral influence, or the will of the gods, ideas that retain some power, with faith healing and shrines still common, although the rise of scientific medicine in the past two centuries has altered or replaced many historic health practices.

== Ancient Egyptian Medicine == 
The Ancient Egyptians, like the Ancient Greeks and Romans, have provided modern historians with a great deal of knowledge and evidence about their attitude towards medicine and the medical knowledge that they had. This evidence has come from the numerous papyrus found in archaeological searches.

Like prehistoric man, some of the beliefs of the Egyptians were based on myths and legend. However, their knowledge was also based on an increasing knowledge of the human anatomy and plain common sense.

In Ancient Egypt, the treatment of illnesses was no longer carried out only by magicians and medicine men.Archaeological digs have also found evidence of men titled physicians. 

Physicians lived even earlier in Ancient Egypt. Imphotep was the physician to King Zozer and lived in about 2600 BC. Imphotep was considered so important that he was, after his death, was worshipped as a god of healing.

Almost all of our knowledge about Ancient Egyptian medical knowledge comes from the discoveries of papyrus documents. The very dry atmosphere in Egypt has meant that many of these documents have been very well preserved despite their age. Numerous papyrus documents have come from the era 1900 BC to 1500 BC. It is from these documents that we know that the Ancient Egyptians still believed that the supernatural caused some disease.

When there was no obvious reason for an illness, many Ancient Egypt doctors and priests believed that disease was caused by spiritual beings. When no-one could explain why someone had a disease, spells and magical potions were used to drive out the spirits.The Ancient Egyptians also had a god who would frighten away evil spirits – Bes.

Despite this use of remedies that come from a lack of knowledge, the Ancient Egyptians also developed their knowledge as a result of education. Ancient papyrus inform us that the Ancient Egyptians were discovering things about how the human body worked and they knew that the heart, pulse rates, blood and air were important to the workings of the human body. A heart that beat feebly told doctors that the patient had problems.The document actually gives names to organs such as the spleen, the heart, the anus, the lungs etc., so they must have known that these exist. One papyrus, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, has a detailed description of the brain in it so this organ was also well researched by the standards of the time. It is probable that this knowledge came as a result of the practice the Ancient Egyptians had of embalming dead bodies.

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

I saw the page at [[x86 Assembly/Machine Language Conversion]], and I agree that the XOR conversion example does not look correct. The W and D bits appear to be swapped, in addition to the errors you pointed out. I don't have time this week to research the topic and fix it myself. I may have time early next week. Any changes or additions that you want to make are welcome, feel free to ask if you have questions or if you want me to double-check your work. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:43, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

:WhiteKnight is correct, a lot of that page was wrong. I could see that right away, and I had the iAPX86 manual available, so I pulled that to check facts and corrected it to match reality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Relationships=
A relationship is a reference from one object to another.  In Java, relationships are defined through object references (pointers) from a source object to the target object.  Technically, in Java there is no difference between a relationship to another object and a &quot;relationship&quot; to a data attribute such as a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; (primitives are different), as both are pointers; however, logically and for the sake of persistence, data attributes are considered part of the object, and references to other persistent objects are considered relationships.

In a relational database relationships are defined through foreign keys.  The source row contains the primary key of the target row to define the relationship (and sometimes the inverse).  A query must be performed to read the target objects of the relationship using the foreign key and primary key information.

In Java, if a relationship is to a collection of other objects, a &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; or array type is used in Java to hold the contents of the relationship.  In a relational database, collection relations are either defined by the target objects having a foreign key back to the source object's primary key, or by having an intermediate join table to store the relationship (both objects' primary keys).

All relationships in Java and JPA are unidirectional, in that if a source object references a target object there is no guarantee that the target object also has a relationship to the source object. This is different than a relational database, in which relationships are defined through foreign keys and querying such that the inverse query always exists.

===JPA Relationship Types===
* [[Java Persistence/OneToOne|OneToOne]] - A unique reference from one object to another, inverse of a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[Java Persistence/ManyToOne|ManyToOne]] - A reference from one object to another, inverse of a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[Java Persistence/OneToMany|OneToMany]] - A &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; of objects, inverse of a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[Java Persistence/ManyToMany|ManyToMany]] - A &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; of objects, inverse of a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[Java Persistence/Embeddables|Embedded]] - A reference to a object that shares the same table of the parent.
* [[Java Persistence/ElementCollection|ElementCollection]] - JPA 2.0, a &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Embedable&lt;/code&gt; objects, stored in a separate table.

This covers the majority of types of relationships that exist in most object models.  Each type of relationship also covers multiple different implementations, such as OneToMany allowing either a join table, or foreign key in the target, and collection mappings also allow &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; types and &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; types.  There are also other possible complex relationship types, see [[#Advanced Relationships|Advanced Relationships]].

== Lazy Fetching ==
The cost of retrieving and building an object's relationships, far exceeds the cost of selecting the object.  This is especially true for relationships such as &lt;code&gt;manager&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;managedEmployees&lt;/code&gt; such that if any employee were selected it would trigger the loading of every employee through the relationship hierarchy.  Obviously this is a bad thing, and yet having relationships in objects is very desirable.

The solution to this issue is lazy fetching (lazy loading).  Lazy fetching allows the fetching of a relationship to be deferred until it is accessed.  This is important not only to avoid the database access, but also to avoid the cost of building the objects if they are not needed.

In JPA lazy fetching can be set on any relationship using the &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; attribute.  The &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; can be set to either &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; as defined in the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/FetchType.html FetchType] enum.  The default fetch type is &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; for all relationships except for &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt;, but in general it is a good idea to make every relationship &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; default for &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; is for implementation reasons (more difficult to implement), not because it is a good idea.  Technically in JPA &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; is just a hint, and a JPA provider is not required to support it, however in reality all main JPA providers support it, and they would be pretty useless if they did not.

===Example of a lazy one to one relationship annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @OneToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
  @JoinColumn(name=&quot;ADDR_ID&quot;)
  private Address address;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of a lazy one to one relationship XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;one-to-one name=&quot;address&quot; fetch=&quot;LAZY&quot;&gt;
            &lt;join-column name=&quot;ADDR_ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/one-to-one&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Magic===
Lazy fetching normally involves some sort of &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt; in the JPA provider to transparently fault in the relationships as they are accessed.  The typical magic for collection relationships is for the JPA provider to set the relationships to its own &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; implementation.  When any (or most) method is accessed on this collection proxy, it loads the real collection and forwards the method.  This is why JPA requires that all collection relationships use one of the collection interfaces (although some JPA providers support collection implementations too).

For &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationships the magic normally involves some sort of byte code manipulation of the entity class, or creation of a subclass.  This allows the access to the field or get/set methods to be intercepted, and for the relationships to be first retrieved before allowing access to the value.  Some JPA providers use different methods, such as wrapping the reference in a proxy object, although this can have issues with &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; values and primitive methods.  To perform the byte code magic normally an agent or post-processor is required.  Ensure that you correctly use your providers agent or post-processor otherwise lazy may not work.  You may also notice additional variables when in a debugger, but in general debugging will still work as normal.

===Basics===
A &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; attribute can also be made &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt;, but this is normally a different mechanism than lazy relationships, and should normally be avoided unless the attribute is rarely accessed.

See [[Java_Persistence/Basic_Attributes#Lazy_Fetching|Basic Attributes : Lazy Fetching]].

===Serialization, and Detaching===
A major issue with lazy relationships, is ensuring that the relationship is still available after the object has been detached, or serialized.  For most JPA providers, after serialization any lazy relationship that was not instantiated will be broken, and either throw an error when accessed, or return null.

The naive solution is to make every relationship eager.  Serialization suffers from the same issue as persistence, in that you can very easily serialize your entire database if you have no lazy relationships.  So lazy relationships are just as necessary for serialization, as they are for database access, however you need to ensure you have everything you will need after serialization instantiated upfront.  You may mark only the relationships that you think you will need after serialization as &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt;, this will work, however there are probably many cases when you do not need these relationships.

A second solution is to access any relationship you will need before returning the object for serialization.  This has the advantage of being use case specific, so different use cases can instantiate different relationships.  For collection relationships sending &lt;code&gt;size()&lt;/code&gt; is normally the best way to ensure a lazy relationship is instantiated.  For &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationships, normally just accessing the relationship is enough (i.e. &lt;code&gt;employee.getAddress()&lt;/code&gt;), although for some JPA providers that use proxies you may need to send the object a message (i.e.&lt;code&gt;employee.getAddress().hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;).

A third solution is to use the JPQL &lt;code&gt;JOIN FETCH&lt;/code&gt; for the relationship when querying the objects.  A join fetch will normally ensure the relationship has been instantiated.  Some caution should be used with join fetch however, as it can become inefficient if used on collection relationships, especially multiple collection relationships as it requires an n^2 join on the database.

Some JPA providers may also provide certain query hints, or other such serialization options.

The same issue can occur without serialization, if a detached object is accessed after the end of the transaction.  Some JPA providers allow lazy relationship access after the end of the transaction, or after the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; has been closed, however some do not.  If your JPA provider does not, then you may require that you ensure you have instantiated all the lazy relationships that you will need before ending the transaction.

===Eager Join Fetching===
One common misconception is that &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; means that the relationship should be join fetched, i.e. retrieved in the same SQL &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statement as the source object.  Some JPA providers do implement eager this way.  However, just because something is desired to be loaded, does not mean that it should be join fetched.  Consider &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;Phone&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;Phone&lt;/code&gt;'s employee reference is made &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; as the employee is almost always loaded before the phone.  However when loading the phone, you do not want to join the employee, the employee has already been read and is already in the cache or persistence context.  Also just because you want two collection relationships loaded, does not mean you want them join fetch which would result in a very inefficient join that would return n^2 data.

Join fetching is something that JPA currently only provides through JPQL, which is normally the correct place for it, as each use case has different relationship requirements.  Some JPA providers also provider a join fetch option at the mapping level to always join fetch a relationship, but this is normally not the same thing as &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt;.  Join fetching is not normally the most efficient way to load a relationship anyway, normally batch reading a relationship is much more efficient when supported by your JPA provider.

See [[#Join Fetching|Join Fetching]]

See [[#Batch_Fetching|Batch Reading]]

== Cascading ==
Relationship mappings have a &lt;code&gt;cascade&lt;/code&gt; option that allows the relationship to be cascaded for common operations.  &lt;code&gt;cascade&lt;/code&gt; is normally used to model dependent relationships, such as &lt;code&gt;Order&lt;/code&gt; -&gt; &lt;code&gt;OrderLine&lt;/code&gt;.  Cascading the &lt;code&gt;orderLines&lt;/code&gt; relationship allows for the &lt;code&gt;Order&lt;/code&gt;'s -&gt; &lt;code&gt;OrderLine&lt;/code&gt;s to be persisted, removed, merged along with their parent.

The following operations can be cascaded, as defined in the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/CascadeType.html CascadeType] enum:
* &lt;code&gt;PERSIST&lt;/code&gt; - Cascaded the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager.persist()&lt;/code&gt; operation.  If &lt;code&gt;persist()&lt;/code&gt; is called on the parent, and the child is also new, it will also be persisted.  If it is existing, nothing will occur, although calling &lt;code&gt;persist()&lt;/code&gt; on an existing object will still cascade the persist operation to its dependents.  If you persist an object, and it is related to a new object, and the relationship does not cascade persist, then an exception will occur.  This may require that you first call persist on the related object before relating it to the parent.  General it may seem odd, or be desirable to always cascade the persist operation, if a new object is related to another object, then it should probably be persisted.  There is most likely not a major issue with always cascading persist on every relationship, although it may have an impact on performance.  Calling persist on a related object is not required, on commit any related object whose relationship is cascade persist will automatically be persisted.  The advantage of calling persist up front is that any generated ids will (unless using identity) be assigned, and the &lt;code&gt;prePersist&lt;/code&gt; event will be raised.
* &lt;code&gt;REMOVE&lt;/code&gt; - Cascaded the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager.remove()&lt;/code&gt; operation.  If &lt;code&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt; is called on the parent then the child will also be removed.  This should only be used for dependent relationships.  Note that only the &lt;code&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt; operation is cascaded, if you remove a dependent object from a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; collection it will not be deleted, JPA requires that you explicitly call &lt;code&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt; on it.  Some JPA providers may support an option to have objects removed from dependent collection deleted, JPA 2.0 also defines an option for this.
* &lt;code&gt;MERGE&lt;/code&gt; - Cascaded the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager.merge()&lt;/code&gt; operation.  If &lt;code&gt;merge()&lt;/code&gt; is called on the parent, then the child will also be merged.  This should normally be used for dependent relationships.  Note that this only affects the cascading of the merge, the relationship reference itself will always be merged.  This can be a major issue if you use &lt;code&gt;transient&lt;/code&gt; variables to limit serialization, you may need to manually merge, or reset transient relationships in this case.  Some JPA providers provide additional &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; operations.
* &lt;code&gt;REFRESH&lt;/code&gt; - Cascaded the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager.refresh()&lt;/code&gt; operation.  If &lt;code&gt;refresh()&lt;/code&gt; is called on the parent then the child will also be refreshed.  This should normally be used for dependent relationships.  Be careful enabling this for all relationships, as it could cause changes made to other objects to be reset.
* &lt;code&gt;ALL&lt;/code&gt; - Cascaded all the above operations.

===Example of a cascaded one to one relationship annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @OneToOne(cascade={CascadeType.ALL})
  @JoinColumn(name=&quot;ADDR_ID&quot;)
  private Address address;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of a cascaded one to one relationship XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;one-to-one name=&quot;address&quot;&gt;
            &lt;join-column name=&quot;ADDR_ID&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;cascade&gt;
                &lt;cascade-all/&gt;
            &lt;/cascade&gt;
        &lt;/one-to-one&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Orphan Removal (JPA 2.0)==
Cascading of the &lt;code&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt; operation only occurs when the remove is called on the object.  This is not normally what is desired on a dependent relationship.  If the related objects cannot exist without the source, then it is normally desired to have them deleted when the source is deleted, but also have them deleted when they are no longer referenced from the source.  JPA 1.0 did not provide an option for this, so when a dependent object was removed from the source relationship, it had to be explicitly removed from the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt;.  JPA 2.0 provides a &lt;code&gt;orphanRemoval&lt;/code&gt; option on the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/OneToMany.html OneToMany] and [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/OneToMany.html OneToOne] annotations and XML.  Orphan removal will ensure that any object no longer referenced from the relationship is deleted from the database.

===Example of an orphan removal one to many relationship annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @OneToMany(orphanRemoval=true, cascade={CascadeType.ALL})
  private List&lt;PhoneNumbers&gt; phones;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of an orphan removal one to many relationship XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;one-to-many name=&quot;phones&quot; orphan-removal=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
            &lt;cascade&gt;
                &lt;cascade-all/&gt;
            &lt;/cascade&gt;
        &lt;/one-to-many&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Target Entity ==
Relationship mappings have a &lt;code&gt;targetEntity&lt;/code&gt; attribute that allows the reference class (target) of the relationship to be specified.  This is normally not required to be set as it is defaulted from the field type, get method return type, or collection's generic type.

This can also be used if your field uses a public interface type, for example field is interface &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt;, but the mapping needs to be to implementation class &lt;code&gt;AddressImpl&lt;/code&gt;.  Another usage is if your field is a superclass type, but you want to map the relationship to a subclass.

===Example of a target entity relationship annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @OneToMany(targetEntity=Phone.class)
  @JoinColumn(name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot;)
  private List phones;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of a target entity relationship XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;one-to-many name=&quot;phones&quot; target-entity=&quot;org.acme.Phone&quot;&gt;
            &lt;join-column name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/one-to-many&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Collections==
Collection mappings include [[Java Persistence/OneToMany|OneToMany]], [[Java Persistence/ManyToMany|ManyToMany]], and in JPA 2.0 [[Java Persistence/ElementCollection|ElementCollection]].  JPA requires that the type of the collection field or get/set methods be one of the Java collection interfaces, &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;.

===Collection Implementations===
Your field should not be of a collection implementation type, such as &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt;.  Some JPA providers may support using collection implementations, many support &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; collection relationships to use the implementation class.  You can set any implementation as the instance value of the collection, but when reading an object from the database, if it is &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; the JPA provider will normally put in a special &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; collection.

===Duplicates===
A &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; in Java supports duplicate entries, and a &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; does not.  In the database, duplicates are generally not supported.  Technically it could be possible if a &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt; is used, but JPA does not require duplicates to be supported, and most providers do not.

If you require duplicate support, you may need to create an object that represents and maps to the join table.  This object would still require a unique &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;, such as a &lt;code&gt;GeneratedValue&lt;/code&gt;.  See [[Java Persistence/ManyToMany#Mapping a Join Table with Additional Columns|Mapping a Join Table with Additional Columns]].

===Ordering===
JPA allows the collection values to be ordered by the database when retrieved.  This is done through the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/OrderBy.html &lt;code&gt;@OrderBy&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;order-by&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.

The value of the &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt; is a JPQL [[Java_Persistence/JPQL_BNF#Order_By|&lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt;]] string.  The can be an attribute name followed by &lt;code&gt;ASC&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DESC&lt;/code&gt; for ascending or descending ordering.  You could also use a path or nested attribute, or a &quot;,&quot; for multiple attributes.  If no &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt; value is given it is assumed to be the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; of the target object.

The &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt; value must be a mapped attribute of the target object.  If you want to have an ordered &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; you need to add an &lt;i&gt;index&lt;/i&gt; attribute to your target object and an &lt;i&gt;index&lt;/i&gt; column to it's table.  You will also have to ensure you set the index values.  JPA 2.0 will have extended support for an ordered &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; using an &lt;code&gt;OrderColumn&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that using an &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt; does not ensure the collection is ordered in memory.  You are responsible for adding to the collection in the correct order.  Java does define a &lt;code&gt;SortedSet&lt;/code&gt; interface and &lt;code&gt;TreeSet&lt;/code&gt; collection implementation that does maintain an order.  JPA does not specifically support &lt;code&gt;SortedSet&lt;/code&gt;, but some JPA providers may allow you to use a &lt;code&gt;SortedSet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TreeSet&lt;/code&gt; for your collection type, and maintain the correct ordering.  By default these require your target object to implement the &lt;code&gt;Comparable&lt;/code&gt; interface, or set a &lt;code&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt;.  You can also use the &lt;code&gt;Collections.sort()&lt;/code&gt; method to sort a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; when required.  One option to sort in memory is to use property access and in your set and add methods call &lt;code&gt;Collections.sort()&lt;/code&gt;.

====Example of a collection order by annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @OneToMany
  @OrderBy(&quot;areaCode&quot;)
  private List&lt;Phone&gt; phones;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example of a collection order by XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;one-to-many name=&quot;phones&quot;&gt;
            &lt;order-by&gt;areaCode&lt;/order-by&gt;
        &lt;/one-to-many&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Order Column (JPA 2.0)===
JPA 2.0 adds support for an &lt;code&gt;OrderColumn&lt;/code&gt;.  An &lt;code&gt;OrderColumn&lt;/code&gt; can be used to define an order &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; on any collection mapping.  It is defined through the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/OrderColumn.html &lt;code&gt;@OrderColumn&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;order-column&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.

The &lt;code&gt;OrderColumn&lt;/code&gt; is maintained by the mapping and should not be an attribute of the target object.  The table for the &lt;code&gt;OrderColumn&lt;/code&gt; depends on the mapping.  For a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; mapping it will be in the target object's table.  For a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; mapping or a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; using a &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt; it will be in the join table.  For an &lt;code&gt;ElementCollection&lt;/code&gt; mapping it will be in the target table.

====Example of a collection order column database====
EMPLOYEE (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;FIRSTNAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;LASTNAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;SALARY&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Bob&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Way&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;50000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Sarah&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Smith&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;60000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

EMPLOYEE_PHONE (table)

  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

PHONE(table)

        &lt;/one-to-many&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Common Problems==
====&lt;i&gt;Object corruption, one side of the relationship is not updated after updating the other side&lt;/i&gt;====
A common problem with bi-directional relationships is the application updates one side of the relationship, but the other side does not get updated, and becomes out of sync.  In JPA, as in Java in general it is the responsibility of the application, or the object model to maintain relationships.  If your application adds to one side of a relationship, then it must add to the other side.

This is commonly resolved through &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; methods in the object model that handle both sides of the relationships, so the application code does not need to worry about it.  There are two ways to go about this, you can either only add the relationship maintenance code to one side of the relationship, and only use the setter from one side (such as making the other side protected), or add it to both sides and ensure you avoid a infinite loop.

For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Employee {
    private List phones;
    ...
    public void addPhone(Phone phone) {
        this.phones.add(phone);
        if (phone.getOwner() != this) {
            phone.setOwner(this);
        }
    }
    ...
}

public class Phone {
    private Employee owner;
    ...
    public void setOwner(Employee employee) {
        this.owner = employee;
        if (!employee.getPhones().contains(this)) {
            employee.getPhones().add(this);
        }
    }
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The code is similar for bi-directional &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationships.

Some expect the JPA provider to have magic that automatically maintains relationships.  This was actually part of the EJB CMP 2 specification.  However the issue is if the objects are detached or serialized to another VM, or new objects are related before being managed, or the object model is used outside the scope of JPA, then the magic is gone, and the application is left figuring things out, so in general it may be better to add the code to the object model.  However some JPA providers do have support for automatically maintaining relationships.

In some cases it is undesirable to instantiate a large collection when adding a child object.  One solution is to not map the bi-directional relationship, and instead query for it as required.  Also some JPA providers optimize their lazy collection objects to handle this case, so you can still add to the collection without instantiating it.

====&lt;i&gt;Poor performance, excessive queries&lt;/i&gt;====
This most common issue leading to poor performance is the usage of &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; relationships.  This requires the related objects to be read when the source objects are read.  So for example reading the president of the company with &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;managedEmployees&lt;/code&gt; will cause every &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; in the company to be read.  The solution is to always make all relationships &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt;.  By default &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; but &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; are not, so make sure you configure them to be.  See, [[#Lazy Fetching|Lazy Fetching]].  Sometimes you have &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; configured but it does not work, see [[#Lazy is not working|Lazy is not working]]

Another common problems is the &lt;i&gt;n+1&lt;/i&gt; issue.  For example consider that you read all &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; objects then access their &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt;.  Since each &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; is accessed separately this will cause n+1 queries, which can be a major performance problem.  This can be solved through [[#Join Fetching|Join Fetching]] and [[#Batch Fetching|Batch Reading]].

====&lt;i&gt;Lazy is not working&lt;/i&gt;====
Lazy &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationships typically require some form of weaving or byte-code generation.  Normally when running in JSE an &lt;code&gt;agent&lt;/code&gt; option is required to allow the byte-code weaving, so ensure you have the agent configured correctly.  Some JPA providers perform dynamic subclass generation, so do not require an agent.

&lt;b&gt;Example agent&lt;/b&gt;
    java -javaagent:eclipselink.jar ...

Some JPA providers also provide static weaving instead, or in addition to dynamic weaving.  For static weaving some preprocessor must be run on your JPA classes.

When running in JEE lazy should normally work, as the class loader hook is required by the EJB specification.  However some JEE providers may not support this, so static weaving may be required.

Also ensure that you are not accessing the relationship when you shouldn't be.  For example if you use property access, and in your set method access the related lazy value, this will cause it to be loaded.  Either remove the set method side-effects, or use field access.

====&lt;i&gt;Broken relationships after serialization&lt;/i&gt;====
If your relationship is marked as &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; then if it has not been instantiated before the object is serialized, then it may not get serialized.  This may cause an error, or return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if it is accessed after deserialization.

See, [[#Serialization, and Detaching|Serialization, and Detaching]]

====&lt;i&gt;Dependent object removed from OneToMany collection is not deleted&lt;/i&gt;====
When you remove an object from a collection, if you also want the object deleted from the database you must call &lt;code&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt; on the object.  In JPA 1.0 even if your relationship is &lt;code&gt;cascade REMOVE&lt;/code&gt;, you still must call &lt;code&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt;, only the remove of the parent object is cascaded, not removal from the collection.

JPA 2.0 will provide an option for having removes from the collection trigger deletion.  Some JPA providers support an option for this in JPA 1.0.

See, [[#Cascading|Cascading]]

====&lt;i&gt;My relationship target is an interface&lt;/i&gt;====
If your relationship field's type is a public interface of your class, and only has a single implementer, then this is simple to solve, you just need to set a &lt;code&gt;targetEntity&lt;/code&gt; on your mapping.  See, [[#Target Entity|Target Entity]].

If your interface has multiple implementers, then this is more complex.  JPA does not directly support mapping interfaces.  One solution is to convert the interface to an abstract class and use inheritance to map it.  You could also keep the interface, create the abstract class and make sure each implementer extends it, and set the &lt;code&gt;targetEntity&lt;/code&gt; to be the abstract class.

Another solution is to define virtual attributes using get/set methods for each possible implementer, and map these separately, and mark the interface get/set as &lt;code&gt;transient&lt;/code&gt;.  You could also not map the attribute, and instead query for it as required.

See, [[#Variable and Heterogeneous Relationships|Variable and Heterogeneous Relationships]]

Some JPA providers have support for interfaces and variable relationships.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support variable relationships through their &lt;code&gt;@VariableOneToOne&lt;/code&gt; annotation and XML.  Mapping to and querying interfaces are also supported through their &lt;code&gt;ClassDescriptor&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;InterfacePolicy&lt;/code&gt; API.

* [[Java_Persistence/Advanced_Topics#XML_Data_Types|XML relationships]] - Relationships stored as XML documents.

==Maps==
Java defines the &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; interface to represent collections whose values are indexed on a key.  There are several &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; implementations, the most common is &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt;, but also &lt;code&gt;Hashtable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TreeMap&lt;/code&gt;.

JPA allows a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; to be used for any collection mapping including, &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ElementCollection&lt;/code&gt;.  JPA requires that the &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; interface be used as the attribute type, although some JPA providers may also support using &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; implementations.

In JPA 1.0 the map key must be a mapped attribute of the collection values.  The [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/MapKey.html &lt;code&gt;@MapKey&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;map-key&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element is used to define a map relationship.  If the &lt;code&gt;MapKey&lt;/code&gt; is not specified it defaults to the target object's &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;.

====Example of a map key relationship annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @OneToMany(mappedBy=&quot;owner&quot;)
  @MapKey(name=&quot;type&quot;)
  private Map&lt;String, PhoneNumber&gt; phoneNumbers;
  ...
}

@Entity
public class PhoneNumber {
  @Id
  private long id;
  @Basic
  private String type;  // Either &quot;home&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, or &quot;fax&quot;.
  ...
  @ManyToOne
  private Employee owner;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example of a map key relationship XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;one-to-many name=&quot;phoneNumbers&quot; mapped-by=&quot;owner&quot;&gt;
            &lt;map-key name=&quot;type&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/one-to-many&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;PhoneNumber&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.PhoneNumber&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;type&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;many-to-one name=&quot;owner&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Map Key Columns (JPA 2.0)===
JPA 2.0 allows for a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; where the key is not part of the target object to be persisted.
The &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; key can be any of the following:
* A &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; value, stored in the target's table or join table.
* An &lt;code&gt;Embedded&lt;/code&gt; object, stored in the target's table or join table.
* A foreign key to another &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt;, stored in the target's table or join table.

Map columns can be used for any collection mapping including, &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ElementCollection&lt;/code&gt;.

This allows for great flexibility and complexity in the number of different models that can be mapped.  The type of mapping used is always determined by the value of the &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;, not the key.  So if the key is a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; but the value is an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; mapping is still used.  But if the value is a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; but the key is an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;ElementCollection&lt;/code&gt; mapping is used.

This allows some very sophisticated database schemas to be mapped.  Such as a three way join table, can be mapped using a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;MapKeyJoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; for the third foreign key.  For a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; the key is always stored in the &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt;.  For a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; it is stored in the &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt; if defined, otherwise it is stored in the target &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt;'s table, even though the target &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; does not map this column.  For an &lt;code&gt;ElementCollection&lt;/code&gt; the key is stored in the element's table.

The [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/MapKeyColumn.html &lt;code&gt;@MapKeyColumn&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;map-key-column&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element is used to define a map relationship where the key is a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; value, the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/MapKeyEnumerated.html &lt;code&gt;@MapKeyEnumerated&lt;/code&gt;] and [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/MapKeyTemporal.html &lt;code&gt;@MapKeyTemporal&lt;/code&gt;] can also be used with this for &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; types.  The [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/MapKeyJoinColumn.html &lt;code&gt;@MapKeyJoinColumn&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;map-key-join-column&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element is used to define a map relationship where the key is an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; value, the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/MapKeyJoinColumns.html &lt;code&gt;@MapKeyJoinColumns&lt;/code&gt;] can also be used with this for composite foreign keys.  The annotation [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/MapKeyClass.html &lt;code&gt;@MapKeyClass&lt;/code&gt;] or &lt;code&gt;&lt;map-key-class&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element can be used when the key is an &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt; or to specify the target class or type if generics are not used.

==Join Fetching==
Join fetching is a query optimization technique for reading multiple objects in a single database query.  It involves joining the two object's tables in SQL and selecting both object's data.  Join fetching is commonly used for &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationships, but also can be used for any relationship including &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt;.

Join fetching is one solution to the classic ORM &lt;i&gt;n+1&lt;/i&gt; performance problem.  The issue is if you select &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; objects, and access each of their addresses, in basic ORM (including JPA) you will get &lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt; database select for the &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; objects, and then &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; database selects, one for each &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; object.  Join fetching solves this issue by only requiring one select, and selecting both the &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and its &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt;.

JPA supports join fetching through JPQL using the &lt;code&gt;JOIN FETCH&lt;/code&gt; syntax.

====Example of JPQL Join Fetch====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT emp FROM Employee emp JOIN FETCH emp.address
&lt;/source&gt;

This causes both the &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; data to be selected in a single query.

===Outer Joins===
Using the JPQL &lt;code&gt;JOIN FETCH&lt;/code&gt; syntax a normal &lt;code&gt;INNER&lt;/code&gt; join is performed.  This has the side effect of filtering any &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; from the result set that did not have an address.  An &lt;code&gt;OUTER&lt;/code&gt; join in SQL is one that does not filter absent rows on the join, but instead joins a row of all &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; values.  If your relationship allows &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; or an empty collection for collection relationships, then you can use an &lt;code&gt;OUTER&lt;/code&gt; join fetch, this is done in JPQL using the &lt;code&gt;LEFT&lt;/code&gt; syntax.

Note that &lt;code&gt;OUTER&lt;/code&gt; joins can be less efficient on some databases, so avoid using an &lt;code&gt;OUTER&lt;/code&gt; if it is not required.

====Example of JPQL Outer Join Fetch====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT emp FROM Employee emp LEFT JOIN FETCH emp.address
&lt;/source&gt;

===Mapping Level Join Fetch and EAGER===
JPA has no way to specify that a join fetch always be used for a relationship.  Normally it is better to specify the join fetch at the query level, as some use cases may require the related objects, and other use cases may not.  JPA does support an &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; option on mappings, but this means that the relationship will be loaded, not that it will be joined.  It may be desirable to mark all relationships as &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; as everything is desired to be loaded, but join fetching everything in one huge select could result in a inefficient, overly complex, or invalid join on the database.

Some JPA providers do interpret &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt; as join fetch, so this may work on some JPA providers.
Some JPA providers support a separate option for always join fetching a relationship.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support a &lt;code&gt;@JoinFetch&lt;/code&gt; annotation and XML on a mapping to define that the relationship always be join fetched.

===Nested Joins===
JPA 1.0 does not allow nested join fetches in JPQL, although this may be supported by some JPA providers.  You can join fetch multiple relationships, but not nested relationships.

====Example of Multiple JPQL Join Fetch====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT emp FROM Employee emp LEFT JOIN FETCH emp.address LEFT JOIN FETCH emp.phoneNumbers
&lt;/source&gt;

===Duplicate Data and Huge Joins===
One issue with join fetching is that duplicate data can be returned.  For example consider join fetching an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt;'s phoneNumbers relationship.  If each &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; has 3 &lt;code&gt;Phone&lt;/code&gt; objects in its phoneNumbers collection, the join will require to bring back &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;*3 rows.  As there are 3 phone rows for each employee row, the employee row will be duplicated 3 times.  So you are reading more data than if you have selected the objects in &lt;i&gt;n+1&lt;/i&gt; queries.  Normally the fact that your executing fewer queries makes up for the fact that you may be reading duplicate data, but if you consider joining multiple collection relationships you can start to get back &lt;i&gt;j*i&lt;/i&gt; duplicate data which can start to become an issue.  Even with &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationships you can be selecting duplicate data.  Consider join fetching an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt;'s manager: if all or most employee's have the same manager, you will end up selecting this manager's data many times.  In this case you would be better off not using join fetch, and allowing a single query for the manager.

If you start join fetching every relationship, you can start to get some pretty huge joins.  This can sometimes be an issue for the database, especially with huge outer joins.

One alternative solution to join fetch that does not suffer from duplicate data is using [[#Batch Fetching|Batch Fetching]].

==Batch Fetching==
Batch fetching is a query optimization technique for reading multiple related objects in a finite set of database queries.  It involves executing the query for the root objects as normal.  But for the related objects the original query is joined with the query for the related objects, allowing all of the related objects to be read in a single database query.  Batch fetching can be used for any type of relationship.

Batch fetching is one solution to the classic ORM &lt;i&gt;n+1&lt;/i&gt; performance problem.  The issue is if you select &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; objects, and access each of their addresses, in basic ORM (including JPA) you will get &lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt; database select for the &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; objects, and then &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; database selects, one for each &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; object.  Batch fetching solves this issue by requiring one select for the &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; objects and one select for the &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; objects.

Batch fetching is more optimal for reading collection relationships and multiple relationships as it does not require selecting duplicate data as in join fetching.

JPA does not support batch reading, but some JPA providers do.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support a &lt;code&gt;@BatchFetch&lt;/code&gt; annotation and xml element and a &lt;code&gt;&quot;eclipselink.batch&quot;&lt;/code&gt; query hint to enable batch reading.  Three forms of batch fetching are supported, &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EXISTS&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt;.

==Filtering, Complex Joins==
Normally a relationship is based on a foreign key in the database, but on occasion it is always based on other conditions.  Such as &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; having many &lt;code&gt;PhoneNumber&lt;/code&gt;s but also a single home phone, or one of his phones that has the &lt;code&gt;&quot;home&quot;&lt;/code&gt; type, or a collection of &quot;active&quot; projects, or other such condition.

JPA does not support mapping these types of relationships, as it only supports mappings defined by foreign keys, not based on other columns, constant values, or functions.  Some JPA providers may support this.  Workarounds include, mapping the foreign key part of the relationship, then filtering the results in your get/set methods of your object.  You could also query for the results, instead of defining a relationship.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support filtering and complex relationships through several mechanisms.  You can use a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; to define a &lt;code&gt;selectionCriteria&lt;/code&gt; on any mapping using the &lt;code&gt;Expression&lt;/code&gt; criteria API.  This allows for any condition to be applied including constants, functions, or complex joins.  You can also use a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; to define the SQL or define a &lt;code&gt;StoredProcedureCall&lt;/code&gt; for the mapping's &lt;code&gt;selectionQuery&lt;/code&gt;.

==Variable and Heterogeneous Relationships==
It is sometimes desirable to define a relationship where the type of the relationship can be one of several unrelated, heterogeneous values.  This could either be a OneToOne, ManyToOne, OneToMany or ManyToMany relationship.  The related values may share a common interface, or may share nothing in common other than subclassing &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.  It is also possible to conceive of a relationship that could also be any &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; value, or even an &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt;.

In general JPA does not support variable, interface, or heterogeneous relationships.  JPA does support relationships to inheritance classes, so the easiest workaround is normally to define a common superclass for the related values.

Another solution is to define virtual attributes using get/set methods for each possible implementer, and map these separately, and mark the heterogeneous get/set as &lt;code&gt;transient&lt;/code&gt;.  You could also not map the attribute, and instead query for it as required.

For heterogeneous &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt; relationships one solution is to serialize the value to a binary field.  You could also convert the value to a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; representation that you can restore the value from, or store the value to two columns, one storing the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; value and the other the class name or type.

Some JPA providers have support for interfaces, variable relationships, and/or heterogeneous relationships.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support variable relationships through their &lt;code&gt;@VariableOneToOne&lt;/code&gt; annotation and XML.  Mapping to and querying interfaces are also supported through their &lt;code&gt;ClassDescriptor&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;InterfacePolicy&lt;/code&gt; API.

==Nested Collections, Maps and Matrices==
It is somewhat common in an object model to have complex collection relationships such as a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;s (i.e. a matrix), or a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;s, or a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;s, and so on.  Unfortunately these types of collections map very poorly to a relational database.

JPA does not support nested collection relationships, and normally it is best to change your object model to avoid them to make persistence and querying easier.  One solution is to create an object that wraps the nested collection.

For example if an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; had a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt;s keyed by a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; project-type and the value a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt;s.  To map this a new &lt;code&gt;ProjectType&lt;/code&gt; class could be created to store the project-type and a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt;.

====Example nested collection model (original)====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Employee {
  private long id;
  private Map&lt;String, List&lt;Project&gt;&gt; projects;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example nested collection model (modified)====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Employee {
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue
  private long id;
  ...
  @OneToMany(mappedBy=&quot;employee&quot;)
  @MapKey(name=&quot;type&quot;)
  private Map&lt;String, ProjectType&gt; projects;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class ProjectType {
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue
  private long id;
  @ManyToOne
  private Employee employee;
  @Column(name=&quot;PROJ_TYPE&quot;)
  private String type;
  @ManyToMany
  private List&lt;Project&gt; projects;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example nested collection database====

&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;FIRSTNAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;LASTNAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;SALARY&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Bob&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Way&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;50000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Sarah&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Smith&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;60000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;small&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;medium&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;large&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

PROJECTTYPE_PROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;PROJECTTYPE_ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;PROJECT_ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

[[Image:ObjectRelational-ManyToOne2.jpg]]

A &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship in Java is where the source object has an attribute that references another target object and (if) that target object had the inverse relationship back to the source object it would be a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship.  All relationships in Java and JPA are unidirectional, in that if a source object references a target object there is no guarantee that the target object also has a relationship to the source object.  This is different than a relational database, in which relationships are defined through foreign keys and querying such that the inverse query always exists.

JPA also defines a &lt;code&gt;[[Java Persistence/OneToOne|OneToOne]]&lt;/code&gt; relationship, which is similar to a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship except that the inverse relationship (if it were defined) is a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship.  The main difference between a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship in JPA is that a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; always contains a foreign key from the source object's table to the target object's table, where as a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship the foreign key may either be in the source object's table or the target object's table.

In JPA a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship is defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/ManyToOne.html @ManyToOne]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or the &lt;code&gt;&lt;many-to-one&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.

In JPA a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship is always (well almost always) required to define a &lt;code&gt;[[Java Persistence/OneToMany|OneToMany]]&lt;/code&gt; relationship, the &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; always defines the foreign key (&lt;code&gt;JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt;) and the &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; must use a &lt;code&gt;mappedBy&lt;/code&gt; to define its inverse &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt;.

====Example of a ManyToOne relationship database====
EMPLOYEE (table)

=====&lt;i&gt;Foreign key is also part of the primary key.&lt;/i&gt;=====

:This typically occurs because you have incorrectly mapped the foreign key in a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship.
:: See [[#Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys|Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys]].

:It can also occur if your JPA provider does not support referential integrity, or does not resolve bi-directional constraints.  In this case you may either need to remove the constraint, or use &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;flush()&lt;/code&gt; to ensure the order your objects are written in.

:Also check that you defined the &lt;code&gt;JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; correctly, ensure you did not set &lt;code&gt;insertable, updateable = false&lt;/code&gt; or use a &lt;code&gt;PrimaryKeyJoinColumn&lt;/code&gt;.

==Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys==
In complex data models it may be required to use a target foreign key, or read-only &lt;code&gt;JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; in mapping a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; if the foreign key/&lt;code&gt;JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; is shared with other &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mappings.

      <comment>/* Example of an inverse ManyToMany relationship annotation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=ManyToMany=

A &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship in Java is where the source object has an attribute that stores a collection of target objects and (if) those target objects had the inverse relationship back to the source object it would also be a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship.  All relationships in Java and JPA are unidirectional, in that if a source object references a target object there is no guarantee that the target object also has a relationship to the source object.  This is different than a relational database, in which relationships are defined through foreign keys and querying such that the inverse query always exists.

JPA also defines a &lt;code&gt;[[Java Persistence/OneToMany|OneToMany]]&lt;/code&gt; relationship, which is similar to a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship except that the inverse relationship (if it were defined) is a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship.  The main difference between a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship in JPA is that a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; always makes use of a intermediate relational join table to store the relationship, where as a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; can either use a join table, or a foreign key in target object's table referencing the source object table's primary key.

In JPA a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship is defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/ManyToMany.html @ManyToMany]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or the &lt;code&gt;&lt;many-to-many&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.

All &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationships require a &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt; is defined using the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/JoinTable.html @JoinTable]&lt;/code&gt; annotation and &lt;code&gt;&lt;join-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.  The &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt; defines a foreign key to the source object's primary key (&lt;code&gt;joinColumns&lt;/code&gt;), and a foreign key to the target object's primary key (&lt;code&gt;inverseJoinColumns&lt;/code&gt;).  Normally the primary key of the &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt; is the combination of both foreign keys.

===Example of a ManyToMany relationship database===

  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;FIRSTNAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;LASTNAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Bob&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Way&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Sarah&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Smith&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

EMP_PROJ (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;EMP_ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;PROJ_ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

PROJECT (table)
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;NAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;GIS&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;SIG&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

===Example of a ManyToMany relationship annotation===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  @Column(name=&quot;ID&quot;)
  private long id;
  ...
  @ManyToMany
  @JoinTable(
      name=&quot;EMP_PROJ&quot;,
      joinColumns={@JoinColumn(name=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;ID&quot;)},
      inverseJoinColumns={@JoinColumn(name=&quot;PROJ_ID&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;ID&quot;)})
  private List&lt;Project&gt; projects;
  .....
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of a ManyToMany relationship XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
&lt;set name=&quot;projects&quot; table=&quot;EMP_PROJ&quot; lazy=&quot;true&quot;
			cascade=&quot;none&quot; sort=&quot;natural&quot; optimistic-lock=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
			&lt;key column=&quot;EMP_ID&quot; not-null=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;many-to-many class=&quot;com.flipswap.domain.Company&quot;
				column=&quot;PROJ_ID&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/set&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Bi-directional Many to Many==
Although a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship is always bi-directional on the database, the object model can choose if it will be mapped in both directions, and in which direction it will be mapped in.  If you choose to map the relationship in both directions, then one direction must be defined as the &lt;i&gt;owner&lt;/i&gt; and the other must use the &lt;code&gt;mappedBy&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define its mapping.  This also avoids having to duplicate the &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt; information in both places.

If the &lt;code&gt;mappedBy&lt;/code&gt; is not used, then the persistence provider will assume there are two independent relationships, and you will end up getting duplicate rows inserted into the join table.  If you have a conceptual bi-directional relationship, but have two different join tables in the database, then you must not use the &lt;code&gt;mappedBy&lt;/code&gt;, as you need to maintain two independent tables.

As with all bi-directional relationships it is your object model's and application's responsibility to maintain the relationship in both direction.  There is no &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt; in JPA, if you add or remove to one side of the collection, you must also add or remove from the other side, see [[Java_Persistence/Relationships#Object_corruption.2C_one_side_of_the_relationship_is_not_updated_after_updating_the_other_side|object corruption]].  Technically the database will be updated correctly if you only add/remove from the &lt;i&gt;owning&lt;/i&gt; side of the relationship, but then your object model will be out of synch, which can cause issues.

===Example of an inverse ManyToMany relationship annotation===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Project {
  @Id
  @Column(name=&quot;ID&quot;)
  private long id;
  ...
  @ManyToMany(mappedBy=&quot;projects&quot;)
  private List&lt;Employee&gt; employees;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Common Problems==

=====&lt;i&gt;Object not in collection after refresh.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: If you have a bi-directional &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship, ensure that you add to both sides of the relationship.
: See [[Java Persistence/Relationships#Object corruption, one side of the relationship is not updated after updating the other side|Object corruption]].

=====&lt;i&gt;Additional columns in join table.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: See [[#Mapping a Join Table with Additional Columns|Mapping a Join Table with Additional Columns]]

=====&lt;i&gt;Duplicate rows inserted into the join table.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: If you have a bidirectional &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship, you must use &lt;code&gt;mappedBy&lt;/code&gt; on one side of the relationship, otherwise it will be assumed to be two difference relationships and you will get duplicate rows inserted into the join table.

=Advanced=

==Mapping a Join Table with Additional Columns==
A frequent problem is that two classes have a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship, but the relational join table has additional data.  For example if &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt; but the PROJ_EMP join table also has an &lt;code&gt;IS_PROJECT_LEAD&lt;/code&gt; column.  In this case the best solution is to create a class that models the join table.  So a &lt;code&gt;ProjectAssociation&lt;/code&gt; class would be created.  It would have a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt;, and attributes for the additional data.  &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt; would have a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;ProjectAssociation&lt;/code&gt;.  Some JPA providers also provide additional support for mapping to join tables with additional data.

Unfortunately mapping this type of model becomes more [[Java_Persistence/Identity and Sequencing#Primary Keys through OneToOne and ManyToOne Relationships|complicated]] in JPA because it requires a composite primary key.  The association object's &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; is composed of the &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt; ids.  The JPA 1.0 spec does not allow an &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; to be used on a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; so the association class must have two duplicate attributes to also store the ids, and use an &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt;, these duplicate attributes must be kept in synch with the &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; attributes.  Some JPA providers may allow a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; to be part of an &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;, so this may be simpler with some JPA providers.  To make your life simpler, I would recommend adding a generated &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; attribute to the association class.  This will give the object a simpler &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; and not require duplicating the &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt; ids.

This same pattern can be used no matter what the additional data in the join table is.  Another usage is if you have a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; relationship between two objects, with a third unrelated object or data representing the &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; key.  The JPA spec requires that the &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; key be an attribute of the &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; value, so the &lt;i&gt;association object&lt;/i&gt; pattern can be used to model the relationship.

If the additional data in the join table is only required on the database and not used in Java, such as auditing information, it may also be possible to use database triggers to automatically set the data.

===Example join table association object database===

&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ID&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;FIRSTNAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;LASTNAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Bob&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Way&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Sarah&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Smith&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ICT for Disaster Management}}

It is essential that we look at disaster management from the development angle. It is no longer
either a one-off or stand-alone activity.Despite the fact that disaster preparedness has not been
identified as one of the MDGs, it is apparent that proper mechanisms for disaster awareness and
means of disaster recovery are essential to achieving the MDGs. In particular, the MDG targets
such as integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and
programmes, and reversing the loss of environmental resources can never be achieved without
giving due emphasis to effective disaster management strategies.

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;

The key priorities for the future, as illustrated by the UN/ISDR report ‘Living with Risk’(2004), can
be extremely useful to help understand the prospects of ICT in disaster risk reduction.
&lt;br&gt;

First, as the report points out, there is a need for disaster and risk reduction to be an essential
part of the broader concerns of sustainable development,and hence the need to make sure that
risk assessments and vulnerability reduction measures are taken into account in different fields,
such as environmental management, poverty reduction and financial management.
Second, it is essential to note that current development practices do not necessarily reduce
community vulnerability to disasters – indeed, ill-advised and misdirected development
practices may actually increase disaster risks. A considerable challenge remains in raising
awareness of this concern and to influence and enhance existing development projects,
poverty reduction strategies and other programmes to systematically reduce disaster risk.

Third, political commitment by public and private policy makers and local community leaders,
based on an understanding of risks and disaster reduction concepts, is fundamental to
achieving change.
Finally, even though national and local authorities bear the main responsibility for the safety of
their people, it is the international community’s duty to advocate policies and actions in
developing countries that pursue informed and well-designed disaster risk reduction strategies,
and to ensure that their own programmes reduce disaster risks.
The challenge is to determine the role of ICT in addressing these priorities. ICT is only a tool and
it should not be treated as a panacea for all issues arising in disaster management.As is the case
with any other tool, the effectiveness of ICT in reducing disaster risk depends on how it is used.
The use of ICT for disaster management should not be a choice between this medium/
technology against that medium/technology. The very reason for the existence of so many
channels is that none of them is suitable for every situation. One medium that might fit best
under a certain set of circumstances might be of little use under another.Thus, what is required
is not a competition between different media and technologies, but instead, using the best
combination depending upon the circumstances.
One obvious challenge facing the Asia-Pacific region is the low ICT penetration level in most of
the region’s developing countries.According to the UNDP Human Development Report of 2005,
in 2003, the tele-densities of Cambodia, Nepal and Bangladesh were 38, 18 and 15 per 1,000
people, respectively. The situation is the same for radio and television. The irony is that while a
small selection of households might have all of these media, the majority does not have any of
them. With such low penetration levels, it is extremely difficult to establish any effective
ICT-based disaster warning system. For such communities, it is essential to think of other means
(such as community radio or public address systems). Unless the levels of telephone, radio and
television penetration can be reasonably increased, it is difficult to guarantee that such a
community can be free from disaster risks, irrespective of the efficiency of the disaster
monitoring systems.
Another significant challenge to be recognized is the reluctance of some national governments
to implement ICT-friendly policies. Many governments do not see investment in ICT or even
building up ICT-enabling infrastructure as priorities. The result invariably will be that ICT and
technology in general take a backseat to presumed priorities such as ensuring good
governance practices, providing healthcare facilities and addressing gender barriers. The
examples provided in this e-Primer make it obvious that as far as disaster management is
concerned, there is no reason why ICT should take such a secondary role.
ICTs, in this context, are not just commercial tools that are being used for the sole purpose of
increasing profits in a business; they play a much larger role in protecting the well-being of the
general population. It should therefore be the responsibility of all concerned stakeholders, from
governments to donor organizations, to give the right priority to ICT development and
adoption. Only that will ultimately guarantee disaster risk reduction for all.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Locking=

Locking is perhaps the most ignored persistence consideration.  Most applications tend to ignore thinking about concurrency issues during development, and then smush in a locking mechanism before going into production.  Considering the large percentage of software projects that fail or are canceled, or never achieve a large user base, perhaps this is logical.  However, locking and concurrency is a critical or at least a very important issue for most applications, so probably should be something considered earlier in the development cycle.

If the application will have concurrent writers to the same objects, then a locking strategy is critical so that data corruption can be prevented. There are two strategies for preventing concurrent modification of the same object/row; [[#Optimistic Locking|optimistic]] and [[#Pessimistic Locking|pessimistic]] locking.  Technically there is a third strategy, [[#No Locking a.k.a Ostrich Locking|&lt;i&gt;ostrich&lt;/i&gt;]] locking, or no locking, which means put your head in the sand and ignore the issue.

There are various ways to implement both optimistic and pessimistic locking. JPA has support for version optimistic locking, but some JPA providers support other methods of optimistic locking, as well as pessimistic locking.

Locking and concurrency can be a confusing thing to consider, and there are a lot of misconcepts out there.  Correctly implementing locking in your application typically involves more than setting some JPA or database configuration option (although that is all many applications that [[#Common Locking Mistakes, Questions and Problems|&lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt;]] they are using locking do).  Locking may also involve application level changes, and ensuring other applications accessing the database also do so correctly for the locking policy being used.

==Optimistic Locking==

Optimistic locking assumes that the data will not be modified between when you read the data until you write the data. This is the most common style of locking used and recommended in today's persistence solutions. The strategy involves checking that one or more values from the original object read, are still the same when updating it.  This verifies that the object has not changed by another user in between the read and the write.

JPA supports using an optimistic locking version field that gets updated on each update.  The field can either be numeric or a timestamp value.  A numeric value is recommended as a numeric value is more precise, portable, performant and easier to deal with than a timestamp.

The [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Version.html &lt;code&gt;@Version&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;version&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is used to define the optimistic lock version field.  The annotation is defined on the version field or property for the object, similar to an &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; mapping.  The object must contain an attribute to store the version field.

The object's version attribute is automatically updated by the JPA provider, and should not normally be modified by the application.  The one exception is if the application reads the object in one transaction, sends the object to a client, and updates/merges the object in another transaction.  In this case the application must ensure that the original object version is used, otherwise any changes in between the read and write will not be detected.  The &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;merge()&lt;/code&gt; API will always merge the version, so the application is only responsible for this if manually merging.

When a locking contention is detected an [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/OptimisticLockException.html &lt;code&gt;OptimisticLockException&lt;/code&gt;] will be thrown.  This could be wrapped insider a RollbackException, or other exceptions if using JTA, but it should be set as the &lt;code&gt;cause&lt;/code&gt; of the exception.  The application can handle the exception, but should normally report the error to the user, and let them determine what to do.

====Example of Version annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public abstract class Employee{
  @Id
  private long id;
  @Version
  private long version;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example of Version XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;version name=&quot;version&quot;/&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Common Locking Mistakes, Questions and Problems&lt;/i&gt;===
====&lt;i&gt;Not sending version to client, only locking on the server&lt;/i&gt;====
:Probably the most common mistake in locking in general is locking the wrong section of code.  This is true no matter what form of locking is used, whether it be optimistic or pessimistic.  The basic scenario is:
:# User requests some data, the server reads the data from the database and sends it to the user in their client (doesn't matter if the client is html, rmi, web service).
:# The user edits the data in the client.
:# The user submits the data back to the server.
:# The server begins a transaction, reads the object, merges the data and commits the transaction.
:The issues is that the original data was read in step 1, but the lock was not obtained until step 4, so any changes made to the object in between steps 1 and 4 would not result in a conflict.  This means there is little point to using any locking.

:A key point is that when using database pessimistic locking or database transaction isolation, this will always be the case, the database locks will only occur in step 4, and any conflicts will not be detected.  This is the main reason why using database locking does not scale to web applications, for the locking to be valid, the database transaction must be started at step 1 and not committed until step 4.  This means that a live database connection and transaction must be held open while waiting for the web client, as well as locks, since there is no guarantee that the web client will not sit on the data for hours, go to lunch, or disappear of the face of the earth, holding database resources and locking data for all other users can be very undesirable.

:For optimistic locking the solution is relatively simple, the object's version must be sent to the client along with the data (or kept in the http session).  When the user submits the data back, the original version must be merged into the object read from the database, to ensure that any changes made between step 1 and 4 will be detected.

====&lt;i&gt;Handling optimistic lock exceptions&lt;/i&gt;====
:Unfortunately programmers can frequently be too clever for their own good.  The first issue that comes up when using optimistic locking is what to do when an OptimisticLockException occurs.  The typical response of the friendly neighborhood super programmer, is to automatically handle the exception.  They will just create a new transaction, refresh the object to reset its version, and merge the data back into the object and re-commit it.  Presto problem solved, or is it?

:This actually defeats the whole point of locking in the first place.  If this is what you desire, you may as well use no locking.  Unfortunately, the OptimisticLockException should rarely be automatically handled, and you really need to bother the user about the issue.  You should report the conflict to the user, and either say &quot;your sorry but an edit conflict occurred and they are going to have to redo their work&quot;, or in the best case, refresh the object and present the user with the current data and the data that they submitted and help them merge the two if appropriate.

:Some automated merge tools will compare the two conflicting versions of the data and if none of the individual fields conflict, then the data will just be automatically merged without the user's aid.  This is what most software version control systems do.  Unfortunately the user is typically better able to decide when something is a conflict than the program, just because two versions of the .java file did not change the same line of code does not mean there was no conflict, the first user could have deleted a method that the other user added a method to reference, and several other possible issues that cause the typically nightly build to break every so often.

====&lt;i&gt;Paranoid Delusionment&lt;/i&gt;====
:Locking can prevent most concurrency issues, but be careful of going overboard in over analyzing to death every possible hypothetical occurrence.  Sometimes in an concurrent application (or any software application) bad stuff can happen.  Users are pretty used to this by now, and I don't think anyone out there thinks computers are perfect.

:A good example is a source code control system.  Allowing users to overwrite each other changes is a bad thing; so most systems avoid this through versioning the source files.  If a user submits changes to a file that originated from a older version than the current version, the source code control system will raise a conflict and make the user merge the two files.  This is essentially optimistic locking.  But what if one user removes, or renames a method in one file, then another user adds a new method or call in another file to that old method.  No source code control system that I know of will detect this issue, it is a conflict and will cause the build to break.  The solution to this is to start locking or checking the lock on every file in the system (or at least every possible related file).  Similar to using optimistic read locking on every possible related object, or pessimistically locking every possible related object.  This could be done, but would probably be very expensive, and more importantly would now raise possible conflicts every time a user checked in, so would be entirely useless.

:So, in general be careful of being too paranoid, such that you sacrifice the usability of your system.

====&lt;i&gt;Other applications accessing same data&lt;/i&gt;====
:Any form of locking that is going to work requires that all applications accessing the same data follow the same rules.  If you use optimistic locking in one application, but no locking in another accessing the same data, they will still conflict.  One fake solution is to configure an update trigger to always increment the version value (unless incremented in the update).  This will allow the new application to avoid overwriting the old application's changes, but the old application will still be able to overwrite the new application's changes.  This still may be better than no locking at all, and perhaps the old application will eventually go away.

:One common misconception is that if you use pessimistic locking, instead of adding a version field, you will be ok.  Again pessimistic locking requires that all applications accessing the same data use the same form of locking.  The old application can still read data (without locking), then update the data after the new application reads, locks, and updates the same data, overwriting its changes.

====&lt;i&gt;Isn't database transaction isolation all I need?&lt;/i&gt;====
:Possibly, but most likely not.  Most databases default to &lt;i&gt;read committed&lt;/i&gt; transaction isolation.  This means that you will never see uncommitted data, but this does not prevent concurrent transactions from overwriting the same data.

:# Transaction A reads row x.
:# Transaction B reads row x.
:# Transaction A writes row x.
:# Transaction B writes row x (and overwrites A's changes).
:# Both commit successfully.

:This is the case with &lt;i&gt;read committed&lt;/i&gt;, but with &lt;i&gt;serializable&lt;/i&gt; this conflict would not occur.  With serializable either Transaction B would lock on the select for B and wait (perhaps a long time) until Transaction A commits.  In some databases Transaction A may not wait, but would fail on commit.  However, even with serializable isolation the typical web application would still have a conflict.  This is because each server request operates in a different database transaction.  The web client reads the data in one transaction, then updates it in another transaction.  So optimistic locking is really the only viable locking option for the typical web application.  Even if the read and write occurs in the same transaction, serializable is normally not the solution because of concurrency implications and deadlock potential.

:See [[#Serializable Transaction Isolation|Serializable Transaction Isolation]]

====&lt;i&gt;What happens if I merge an object that was deleted by another user?&lt;/i&gt;====
:What &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; happen is the merge should trigger an &lt;code&gt;OptimisticLockException&lt;/code&gt; because the object has a version that is not null and greater than 0, and the object does not exist.  But this is probably JPA provider specific, some may re-insert the object (this would occur without locking), or throw a different exception.

:If you called &lt;code&gt;persist&lt;/code&gt; instead of merge, then the object would be re-inserted.

====&lt;i&gt;What if my table doesn't have a version column?&lt;/i&gt;====
:The best solution is probably just to add one.  Field locking is another solution, as well as pessimistic locking in some cases.
:See [[#Field Locking|Field Locking]]

====&lt;i&gt;What about relationships?&lt;/i&gt;====
:See [[#Cascaded Locking|Cascaded Locking]]

====&lt;i&gt;Can I use a timestamp?&lt;/i&gt;====
:See [[#Timestamp Locking|Timestamp Locking]]

====&lt;i&gt;Do I need a version in each table for inheritance or multiple tables?&lt;/i&gt;====
:The short answer is no, only in the root table.
:See [[#Multiple Versions|Multiple Versions]]

==Advanced==

===Timestamp Locking===
Timestamp version locking is supported by JPA and is configured the same as numeric version locking, except the attribute type will be a &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Timestamp&lt;/code&gt; or other date/time type.  Be cautious in using timestamp locking as timestamps have different levels of precision in different databases, and some database do not store a timestamp's milliseconds, or do not store them precisely.  In general timestamp locking is less efficient than numeric version locking, so numeric version locking is recommended.

Timestamp locking is frequently used if the table already has a &lt;i&gt;last updated&lt;/i&gt; timestamp column, and is also a convenient way to auto update a &lt;i&gt;last updated&lt;/i&gt; column.  The timestamp version value can be more useful than a numeric version, as it includes the relevant information on when the object was last updated.

The timestamp value in timestamp version locking can either come from the database, or from Java (mid-tier).  JPA does not allow this to be configured, however some JPA providers may provide this option.  Using the database's current timestamp can be very expensive, as it requires a database call to the server.

===Multiple Versions===
An object can only have one version in JPA.  Even if the object maps to multiple tables, only the primary table will have the version.  If any fields in any of the tables changes, the version will be updated.  If you desire multiple versions, you may need to map multiple version attributes in your object and manually maintain the duplicate versions, perhaps through events.  Technically there is nothing preventing your from annotating multiple attributes with &lt;code&gt;@Version&lt;/code&gt;, and potentially some JPA providers may support this.

===Cascaded Locking===
Locking objects is different than locking rows in the database.  An object can be more complex than a simple row; an object can span multiple tables, have inheritance, have relationships, and have dependent objects.  So determining when an object has &lt;i&gt;changed&lt;/i&gt; and needs to update its' version can be more difficult than determining when a row has changed.

JPA does define that when any of the object's tables changes the version is updated.  However it is less clear on relationships.  If &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Embedded&lt;/code&gt;, or a foreign key relationship (&lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt;) changes, the version will be updated.  But what about &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt;, and a target foreign key &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt;?  For changes to these relationships the update to the version may depend on the JPA provider.

What about changes made to dependent objects?  JPA does not have a cascade option for locking, and has no direct concept of dependent objects, so this is not an option.  Some JPA providers may support this.  One way to simulate this is to use [[#Read and Write Locking | write locking]].  JPA defines the EntityManager [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html#lock(java.lang.Object,%20javax.persistence.LockModeType) lock()] API.  You can define a version only in your root parent objects, and when a child (or relationship) is changed, you can call the lock API with the parent to cause a &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; lock.  This will cause the parent version to be updated.  You may also be able to automate this through persistence events.

Usage of cascaded locking depends on your application.  If in your application you consider one user updating one dependent part of an object, and another user updating another part of the object to be a locking contention, then this is what you want.  If your application does not consider this to be a problem, then you do not want cascaded locking.  One of the advantages of cascaded locking is you have fewer version fields to maintain, and only the update to the root object needs to check the version.  This can make a difference in optimizations such as batch writing, as the dependent objects may not be able to be batched if they have their own version that must be checked.

: [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support cascaded locking through their &lt;code&gt;@OptimisticLocking&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@PrivateOwned&lt;/code&gt; annotations and XML.

===Field Locking===
If you do not have a version field in your table, optimistic field locking is another solution.  Field locking involves comparing certain fields in the object when updating.  If those fields have changed, then the update will fail.  JPA does not support field locking, but some JPA providers do support it.

Field locking can also be used when a finer level of locking is desired. For example if one user changes the object's name and another changes the objects address, you may desire for these updates to not conflict, and only desire optimistic lock errors when users change the same fields.  You may also only be concerned about conflicts in changes to certain fields, and not desire lock errors from conflicts in the other fields.

Field locking can also be used on legacy schemas, where you cannot add a version column, or to integrate with other applications accessing the same data which are not using optimistic locking (note if the other applications are not also using field locking, you can only detect conflicts in one direction).

There are several types of field locking:
* All fields compared in the update - This can lead to a very big where clause, but will detect any conflicts.
* Selected fields compared in the update - This is useful if conflicts in only certain fields are desired.
* Changed fields compared in the update - This is useful if only changes to the same fields are considered to be conflicts.

If your JPA provider does not support field locking, it is difficult to simulate, as it requires changes to the update SQL.  Your JPA provider may allow overriding the update SQL, in which case, &lt;code&gt;All&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Selected&lt;/code&gt; field locking may be possible (if you have access to the original values), but &lt;code&gt;Changed&lt;/code&gt; field locking is more difficult because the update must be dynamic.  Another way to simulate field locking is to &lt;code&gt;flush&lt;/code&gt; you changes, then refresh the object using a separate &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; and connection and compare the current values with your original object.

When using field locking it is important to keep the original object that was read.  If you read the object in one transaction and send it to a client, then update in another, you are not really locking.  Any changes made between the read and write will not be detected.  You must keep the original object read managed in an &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; for your locking to have any effect.

: [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support field locking through their &lt;code&gt;@OptimisticLocking&lt;/code&gt; annotation and XML.

===Read and Write Locking===
It is sometimes desirable to lock something that you did not change.  Normally this is done when making a change to one object, that is based on the state of another object, and you wish to ensure that the other object represents the current state of the database at the point of the commit.  This is what serializable transaction isolation gives you, but optimistic read and write locking allow this requirement to be met declaratively and optimistically (and without deadlock, concurrency, and open transaction issues).

JPA supports read and write locks through the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html#lock(java.lang.Object,%20javax.persistence.LockModeType) &lt;code&gt;EntityManager.lock()&lt;/code&gt;] API.  The [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/LockModeType.html &lt;code&gt;LockModeType&lt;/code&gt;] argument can either be &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt;.  A &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; lock will ensure that the state of the object does not change on commit.  A &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; lock will ensure that this transaction conflicts with any other transaction changing or locking the object.  Essentially the &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; lock check the optimistic version field, and the &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; checks and increments it.

====Example of Using the Lock API====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, id);
employee.setSalary(employee.getManager().getSalary() / 2);
entityManager.lock(employee.getManager(), LockModeType.READ);
&lt;/source&gt;

Write locking can also be used to provide object-level locks.  If you desire for a change to a dependent object to conflict with any change to the parent object, or any other of its dependent objects, this can be done through write locking.  This can also be used to lock relationships, when you change a OneToMany or ManyToMany relationship you can also force the parent's version to be incremented.

====Example of Using the Lock API for Cascaded Locks====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, id);
employee.getAddress().setCity(&quot;Ottawa&quot;);
entityManager.lock(employee, LockModeType.WRITE);
&lt;/source&gt;

===No Locking a.k.a &lt;i&gt;Ostrich Locking&lt;/i&gt;===
Conceptually people may scoff and be alarmed at the thought of no locking, but it is probably the most common form of locking in use.  Some call it Ostrich locking as the strategy is to stick your head in the sand and ignore the issue.  Most prototypes or small applications frequently do not have the requirement or in most cases the need for locking, and handling what to do when a locking contention does occur is beyond the scope of the application, so best to just ignore the issue.

In general it is probably best in JPA to enable optimistic locking always, as it is fairly simple to do, as least in concept, but what does occur on a conflict without any form of locking?  Essentially it is last in wins, so if two users edit the same object, at the same time, the last one to commit will have their changes reflected in the database.  This is true, at least for users editing the same fields, but if two users edit different fields in the same object, it depends on the JPA implementation.  Some JPA providers only update exactly the fields that were changed, where as other update all fields in the object.  So in one case the first user's changes would be overridden, but in the second they would not.

===Pessimistic Locking===
Pessimistic locking means acquiring a lock on the object before you begin to edit the object, to ensure that no other users are editing the object.  Pessimistic locking is typically implemented through using database row locks, such as through the &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; SQL syntax.  The data is read and locked, the changes are made and the transaction is committed, releasing the locks.

JPA 1.0 did not support pessimistic locking, but some JPA 1.0 providers do.  [[#JPA 2.0 Locking|JPA 2.0]] supports pessimistic locking. It is also possible to use JPA native SQL queries to issue &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; and use pessimistic locking.  When using pessimistic locking you must ensure that the object is refreshed when it is locked, locking a potentially stale object is of no use.  The SQL syntax for pessimistic locking is database specific, and different databases have different syntax and levels of support, so ensure your database properly supports your locking requirements.

:[[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] (as of 1.2) : Supports JPA 2.0 pessimistic locking.
:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support pessimistic locking through the &lt;code&gt;&quot;eclipselink.pessimistic-lock&quot;&lt;/code&gt; query hint.

The main issues with pessimistic locking is they use database resources, so require a database transaction and connection to be held open for the duration of the edit.  This is typically not desirable for interactive web applications.  Pessimistic locking can also have concurrency issues and cause deadlocks.  The main advantages of pessimistic locking is that once the lock is obtained, it is fairly certain that the edit will be successful.  This can be desirable in highly concurrent applications, where optimistic locking may cause too many optimistic locking errors.

There are other ways to implement pessimistic locking, it could be implemented at the application level, or through [[#Serializable Transaction Isolation|serializable transaction]] isolation.

Application level pessimistic locking can be implemented through adding a &lt;i&gt;locked&lt;/i&gt; field to your object.  Before an edit you must update the field to locked (and commit the change).  Then you can edit the object, and set the locked field back to false.  To avoid conflicts in acquiring the lock, you should also use optimistic locking, to ensure the lock field is not updated to true by another user at the same time.

===JPA 2.0 Locking===
JPA 2.0 adds support for pessimistic locking, as well as other locking options.  A lock can be acquired using the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html#lock(java.lang.Object,%20javax.persistence.LockModeType) &lt;code&gt;EntityManager.lock()&lt;/code&gt;] API, or passing a &lt;code&gt;LockModeType&lt;/code&gt; to an &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;refresh()&lt;/code&gt; operation, or setting the &lt;code&gt;lockMode&lt;/code&gt; of a &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NamedQuery&lt;/code&gt;.

The JPA 2.0 lock modes are defined in the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/LockModeType.html LockModeType] enum:
* OPTIMISTIC (was READ in JPA 1.0) - The Entity will have its optimistic lock version checked on commit, to ensure no other transaction updated the object.
* OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT (was WRITE in JPA 1.0) - The Entity will have its optimistic lock version incremented on commit, to ensure no other transaction updated (or READ locked) the object.
* PESSIMISTIC_READ - The Entity is locked on the database, prevents any other transaction from acquiring a PESSIMISTIC_WRITE lock.
* PESSIMISTIC_WRITE - The Entity is locked on the database, prevents any other transaction from acquiring a PESSIMISTIC_READ or PESSIMISTIC_WRITE lock.
* PESSIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT - The Entity is locked on the database, prevents any other transaction from acquiring a PESSIMISTIC_READ or PESSIMISTIC_WRITE lock, and the Entity will have its optimistic lock version incremented on commit.  This is unusual as it does both an optimistic and pessimistic lock, normally an application would only use one locking model.
* NONE - No lock is acquired, this is the default to any find, refresh or query operation.

JPA 2.0 also adds two new standard query hints.  These can be passed to any &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NamedQuery&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lock()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;refresh()&lt;/code&gt; operation.
* &quot;javax.persistence.lock.timeout&quot; - Number of milliseconds to wait on the lock before giving up and throwing a &lt;code&gt;PessimisticLockException&lt;/code&gt;.
* &quot;javax.persistence.lock.scope&quot; - The valid scopes are defined in [https://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/PessimisticLockScope.html PessimisticLockScope], either NORMAL or EXTENDED. EXTENDED will also lock the object's owned join tables and element collection tables.

===Serializable Transaction Isolation ===
Serializable transaction isolation guarantees that anything read in the transaction will not be updated by any other user.  Through using serializable transaction isolation and ensuring the data being edited is read in the same transaction, you can achieve pessimistic locking.  It is important to ensure the objects are refreshed from the database in the transaction, as editing cached or potentially stale data defeats the point of locking.

Serializable transaction isolation can typically be enabled on the database, some databases even have this as the default.  It can also be set on the JDBC &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt;, or through native SQL, but this is database specific and different databases have different levels of support.  The main issues with serializable transaction isolation are the same as using &lt;code&gt;SELECT ... FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; (see above for the gory details), in addition everything read is locked, so you cannot decide to only lock certain objects at certain times, but lock everything all the time.  This can be a major concurrency issue for transactions with common read-only data, and can lead to deadlocks.

How database implement serializable transaction isolation differs between databases.  Some databases (such as Oracle) can perform serializable transaction isolation in more of an optimistic sense, than the typically pessimistic implementation.  Instead of each transaction requiring locks on all the data as it is read, the row versions are not checked until the transaction is committed, if any of the data changed an exception is thrown and the transaction is not allowed to commit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A fully functional and useful example ==

There are two programs that can be found inside the ''conglomerate'' package: ''print_volume_value'' and ''print_world_value''. To use them you specify a minc volume and xyz coordinates in either voxel (volume) or world space, and it returns the real value at that location. Here we will combine that functionality into a single minc2 program. 

The code is presented in its entirety below, with commentary at the end of this page. The usage is the following:
 &gt; minc2_tutorial3 input.mnc v|w c1 c2 c3

Where v or w specify whether world or voxel coordinates are specified inside c1 c2 c3. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;minc2.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  mihandle_t    minc_volume;
  midimhandle_t dimensions[3];
  double        voxel;
  int           result, i;
  double        world_location[3];
  double        dvoxel_location[3];
  unsigned long voxel_location[3];
  unsigned int  sizes[3];
  char          *usage;
  char          voxel_or_world;
  
  usage = &quot;minc2_tutorial3 input.mnc v|w x y z&quot;;
  
  if (argc != 6) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;USAGE: %s\n&quot;, usage);
    return(1);
  }

  /* open the volume - first command line argument */
  result = miopen_volume(argv[1], MI2_OPEN_READ, &amp;minc_volume);
  /* check for error on opening */
  if (result != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening input file: %d.\n&quot;, result);
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s&quot;, usage);
    return(1);
  }

  /* check for whether voxel or world coordinates are specified */
  voxel_or_world = argv[2][0];

  /* handle the case of world coordinates */
  if (strcmp(&amp;voxel_or_world, &quot;w&quot;) == 0) {
    /* get the world coordinates from the command line */
    world_location[0] = atof(argv[3]);
    world_location[1] = atof(argv[4]);
    world_location[2] = atof(argv[5]);

    /* convert world coordinates to voxel coordinates */
    result = miconvert_world_to_voxel(minc_volume, world_location, 
				      dvoxel_location);
    if (result != MI_NOERROR) {
      fprintf(stderr, 
	      &quot;Error converting world coordinates to voxel coordinates\n&quot;);
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s&quot;, usage);
      return(1);
    }

  }
  /* handle the case of voxel coordinates */
  else if (strcmp(&amp;voxel_or_world, &quot;v&quot;) == 0) {
    dvoxel_location[0] = atof(argv[3]);
    dvoxel_location[1] = atof(argv[4]);
    dvoxel_location[2] = atof(argv[5]);
    /* convert the voxel coordinates to world coordinates */
    miconvert_voxel_to_world(minc_volume, dvoxel_location,
			     world_location);
  }
  /* only v and w are allowed for this argument */
  else {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Must specify v or w for voxel or world\n&quot;);
    return(1);
  }

  /* miconvert_world_to_voxel needs an array of doubles     *
   * but miget_real_value needs unsigned longs - so we cast */
  for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++) { 
    voxel_location[i] = (unsigned long) dvoxel_location[i];
  }


  /* get the dimension sizes and make sure that  *
   * we are using legal coordinates              */
  miget_volume_dimensions(minc_volume, MI_DIMCLASS_SPATIAL,
			  MI_DIMATTR_ALL, MI_DIMORDER_FILE,
			  3, dimensions);
  result = miget_dimension_sizes(dimensions, 3, sizes);
  printf(&quot;Volume sizes: %u %u %u\n&quot;, sizes[0], sizes[1], sizes[2]);

  /* die with an error if voxel coordinates are out of bounds */
  for(i=0; i&lt;3; i++) {
    assert(voxel_location[i] &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; voxel_location[i] &lt; sizes[i]);
  }

  /* print the world to voxel mapping */
  printf(&quot;Voxel location of xyz %f %f %f: %lu %lu %lu\n&quot;, 
	 world_location[0], world_location[1], world_location[2],
	 voxel_location[0], voxel_location[1], voxel_location[2]);

  /* print the value at that location */
  miget_real_value(minc_volume, voxel_location, 3, &amp;voxel);
  printf(&quot;Voxel at xyz %f %f %f was: %f\n&quot;, 
	 world_location[0], world_location[1], world_location[2], voxel);

  return(0);
}

&lt;/source&gt;

Most of this code you've seen in the two previous examples. There are a few additional minc library calls - the first is ''miconvert_voxel_to_world'', which does the reverse of ''miconvert_world_to_voxel''. There are also two functions that deal with dimensions. The first, ''miget_volume_dimensions'', places the dimensions associated with  the specified minc volume into a ''midimhandle_t'' variable. There are several arguments to this function; for the moment it is sufficient to note that the defaults used above will be fine for most cases (and the details will be discussed in a later tutorial). The next function is crucial - ''miget_dimension_sizes'' returns the number of elements in each dimension. This is crucial information for looping over voxels as will be illustrated later.

As stated above this code reproduces functionality that exists in print_volume_value and print_world_value. It does, however, illustrate one advantage of minc2 over volume_io (the older library used by those two programs): it  is much faster, by as much as an order of magnitude for this example.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or login in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

% Note: sometimes this produces data outside the (1,-1) range, even when 
% run with input from that smaller domain given to af.m.  It is safe to 
% clamp outlying values to the extrema of the corresponding input domain.
% If the resulting signal sounds clipped, it is NOT because of clamping 
% domain outliers of the range (e.g., 1.2, -1.3) to the domain edges (1,-1). 

% To improve the quality, try increasing the length of the fft; if that
% doesn't work, then try increasing the sampling rate.  To improve the speed,

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Disp==
{{bCommand|Disp|I/O(F3):2}} is a command which will display a number, string, equation or other type of variable/literal given as arguments. &lt;tt&gt;Disp&lt;/tt&gt; can accept an unlimited number of arguments seperated by commas (although it recommended to keep the number of arguments under 7 because after seven, for each consecutive argument the screen pushes everything else up passed the top of the screen, even the seventh pushes the first line up a slight amount), and will display each argument following the previous line.

===Syntax: Disp===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:Disp [''arg''][,''arg2''][,''arg3''][,''arg4''][,…''argN'']
|
*Where ''arg'',''arg2'',''arg3'',''arg4'' and all other arguments through ''argN'' are optional parameters.  The number of arguments is only limited by the calculator memory.  The arguments can be either a literal or variable of any type.
*For each argument, &lt;tt&gt;Disp&lt;/tt&gt; displays the argument on the next line, starting from where the the cursor initially was located.  If the display reaches the seventh line, the display will 'scroll' the rest of the screen up so that the argument can be displayed.
*&lt;tt&gt;Disp&lt;/tt&gt; displays all arguments left-aligned
**if what is being displayed contains more than 26 characters string will &quot;run off the screen&quot;, resulting in a display of only a part of the 27th character and none of the ones beyond that being shown.
*If no argument is specified, the command does nothing.
}}

===Ex: Display Lines===
Assuming you have stored the value 5 into x (via &lt;tt&gt;5→x&lt;/tt&gt;) and a blank I/O screen and you executed this program,
{{bcode:Example|
:Disp &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;,52,x+1
}}
you would have the following on your I/O screen:
{{bcode:Output|
HELLO WORLD
52
6
}}
===Ex: Empty Lines===
{{bcode:Example|
:Disp &quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;
}}
{{bcode:Output|


HELLO WORLD
}}
===Ex: Truncated===
{{bcode:Example|
:Disp &quot;This line too long for one line&quot;
}}
{{bcode:Output|
This line too long for one
}}

==Pause==
{{bCommand|Pause|Control(F2):Transfers(8):1}} displays an argument, then pauses execution afterwards.
===Syntax: Pause===

{{bcode:Syntax|
:Pause [''arg'']
|
*Where ''arg'' is either a literal or any variable type which &lt;tt&gt;Pause&lt;/tt&gt; will display then pause execution of the rest of the program until the enter key is pressed
**&lt;tt&gt;Pause&lt;/tt&gt; will display ''arg'' on the next line, starting from where the the cursor initially was located.  If the display reaches the seventh line, the display will 'scroll' the rest of the screen up so that the argument can be displayed
**&lt;tt&gt;Pause&lt;/tt&gt; will always display ''arg'' left-aligned
**If an argument is too long to be displayed, the argument will be truncated and an arrow will be displayed indicating you may scroll left/right to read the entirety of the line.
*If no argument is specified, the command merely pauses the execution until enter is pressed without displaying anything}}

===Ex: Hello===
{{bcode:Example|
:Pause &quot;Hello World!&quot;
|It should be noted that the program execution would pause until enter is pressed.
|You may get the &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; symbol by pressing &lt;strong&gt;2nd+Math(5):Probability(7):1&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Diamond+Divide(÷)&lt;/strong&gt; on the TI-89 or &lt;strong&gt;2nd+W&lt;/strong&gt; on the TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200.
}}

===Ex: Pause===
{{bcode:Example|
:Pause
|It should be noted that the program execution would pause until enter is pressed.
}}

==Output==
{{bCommand|Output|I/O(F3):6}} allows the display of an argument in a location other than the next line. The item to be displayed is outputted to the specified coordinates supplied to the function. It is useful for formatted display.

===Syntax: Output===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:Output ''row'',''col'',''arg''
|
*Where ''row'' is a number (can be positive or negative) which determines the row location (vertically, in pixels) ''arg'' is to be displayed.
*Where ''col'' is a number (can be positive or negative) which determines the column location (horizontally, in pixels) ''arg'' is to be displayed
*Where ''arg'' is the argument to be displayed.  This can be a number, string or list.
**''arg'' is displayed from left to right
**if ''arg'' doesn't fit on one line, the parts that don't fit are cut out.
**Each new &lt;tt&gt;Output&lt;/tt&gt; command used overwrites the previous ones. 
}}

===Ex: Basic===
{{bcode:Example|
:Output 24,0,&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;
}}
{{bcode:Output|


HELLO WORLD
|HELLO WORLD is moved down two rows (24 pixels is the equivalent of two rows).
}}

===Ex: Too Long===
{{bcode:Example|
:Output 0,100,&quot;This is too long&quot;
}}
{{bcode:Output|
                This is to
}}

==Return==
{{bCommand|Return|Control(F2):Transfers(8):2}} displays an argument on the home screen, or just returns to the home screen if no argument is supplied.

===Syntax: Return===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:Return [''arg'']
|
*Where ''arg'' is any literal or variable.
*This command will return the argument to the home screen only if used in a Function.
**You can check to see whether you have a program or a function by the line under the title. If it says &lt;tt&gt;Prgm&lt;/tt&gt;, then it is a program. If it says &lt;tt&gt;Func&lt;/tt&gt;, then it is a function.
*''arg'' will always be right-aligned
*When used without ''arg'', whether in a Program or a Function, it will terminate the running of the code.
}}

===Ex: Return===
Let's say you stored the value 5 in x (using &lt;tt&gt;5→x&lt;/tt&gt;) before executing the function. For the sake that this can only be used in a function, the appropriate tags and a name are supplied for this example.
{{bcode:Example|
temp()
:Func
:Return 2x+1
:EndFunc
}}
{{bcode:Output|
▪temp()                 11
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Training manuals are particularly useful in the following situations:
*Trainees can use the manuals for reviewing the subject after training.
*It lets the trainee concentrate on and partake in the training during the training session instead of taking detailed notes.
*It can serve as a reference document in the work place.

 
Developing a training manual is an important part in designing a formal training program. A formal training manual ensures consistency in the presentation of the training program. Another major advantage is that all the training information on skills, processes, and other information necessary to perform the tasks is together in one place. Training manuals should support the training objectives.

Manuals should be developed according to one of two or three instructional design processes. One of the most useful - and common - of these is called the &quot;ADDIE&quot; manual.  
*&quot;A&quot; stands for  Analysis of the audience, and of training needs; 
*&quot;D&quot; stands for Design of training, its objectives, sequencing of tasks, etc. 
*&quot;D&quot; represents Development of training/instructional materials, that are consistent with the design requirements. 
*&quot;I&quot; means Implementation of the training, and 
*&quot;E&quot; is evaluating the training. 

Training manuals can be designed to be used as:
*Work books &amp;#8211; often used in training sessions. It provides basic information, examples and exercises.
*Self-paced guides: designed for trainees to work through on their own.
*Reference manuals: for containing detailed information on processes and procedures.
*Handouts: provide general information to support training done during the session.
*Job aids: provide step-by-step instructions to be used in the work place.


==Designing the manual==
A well designed training manual, that is kept up to date, can become a valuable source of information to the organization. An effective manual:
*Is easy to read and has easy to follow instructions;
*Has an attractive design;
*Uses illustrations to enhance understanding;
*Can be used for future reference.


The following should be taken in consideration when designing the manual:
*Content &amp;#8211; topics, tasks, procedures and other information arranged in a logical sequence and broken down into small units;
*Audience &amp;#8211; their reading skills, previous work experience;
*How the manual is to be used during the training session, afterwards (for revision) and/or as a reference in the work place.


The training manual can have different versions for the trainer/presenter and the trainees. The version for the trainer would include the basic text, prompts for discussions and demonstrations or other activities. It could also include information or checklists on preparation for the session. The trainee&amp;#8217;s version will have the basic text, examples and exercises, as well as space for making further notes.

==Writing the manual==
Once the purpose for the manual has been established and attention has been given to the preliminary design, the main task of writing is the next step. First, organize the contents into a logical sequence of topics. Break down the topics into smaller segments that describe a task, procedure or concept. Include an overview on how to use the manual. As preparation for the training session  give a list of key points or a summary of what is going to be covered at the start of each chapter. 

==What are the key elements of a Training Manual==

The Training Manual may contain the following elements

* A Cover page with plain or graphic with Title clearly written
* A Blank page after the cover page
* Table of contents
* An Introduction page on What-How-Who -  &quot;What the Manual is about&quot;, &quot;How to use the Manual&quot; &amp; &quot;For whom the Manual is meant&quot;
* A Navigational Tips page with visually catchy icons which will be used throughout the manual
* Expanding the Table of contents - Objectives / Description of each topic / Section Summary
* Placeholders for graphics
* Placeholders for work sheets
* Page for Conclusion
* Page for Further Reading
* Page for Bibliography / References / Citations
* A Blank page prior to closure
* Closing Cover page


The following advice has been given by many authors:
*Write in plain English: Avoid using technical terms, unless it is part of the work place vocabulary. In that case make sure technical terms are explained in simple language/terms. Spell out or explain acronyms and abbreviations.
*Use the active voice: It is concise. 
*Be consistent in the use of terminology, tone and style of writing.
*Long sentences and paragraphs can be confusing. Use short sentences and phrases. Numbered steps are easier to follow than long paragraphs.
*Include illustrations (graphs, flow charts, tables, pictures, screen displays, examples of finished tasks) where appropriate to clarify concepts and enhance understanding. It also adds visual interest. Illustrations should be in proper proportion to nearby text.
*Write a detailed table of contents that include chapter headings as well as the next level of subheadings.
*Write a detailed index, including cross-references, to make it easy to find information. A good index makes the manual usable as a reference work for future use.
*Check spelling and grammar.


After the completion of the first draft get feedback from trainers/presenters and other key personnel. Implement any suggestions if appropriate. 


The title page, table of contents, a glossary of terms (if used) and the index are prepared last. On the title page the following should appear: Name of the manual, author(s), company name, publishing date. A copyright notice can be included, as well as acknowledgement of contributors if appropriate.

==Presentation==
An attractive appearance and ease of use can motivate the trainees to use the manual and thus reinforce learning. Good page layout increase readability and make the information more accessible. The organization of the material on the page guides the eye of the reader &amp;#8211; which areas get attention and in what order.

===Graphic design principles:===
*Proximity: Group related pieces of information and other items together to form a cohesive unit, e.g. illustrations should appear on the same page as the related text. That is part of organizing the content in a logical order. Avoid too many separate elements on the page. Use close proximity to indicate unity between items. Use white space to separate unrelated items.
*Alignment: The alignment of text and graphics is another technique in organising the page. All the elements (text and graphics) should appear unified and interrelated by their placement on the page.
*Repetition/Consistency: Consistency in the style of the elements (headings, graphics, arrangement) gives visual clues to the reader. It also unifies the different part of the manual and creates visual interest.
*Contrast: Creating contrast between sections visually organise the page, leading the eye in a logical flow from one section to the next. Contrast is created by the use of fonts, line thickness, colours, shapes and space. Create a strong contrast to be effective.
*Fonts (or type): Avoid using more than two or three fonts in a document. Fonts can be in italic, bold, light, heavy, or condensed versions. Avoid all uppercase &amp;#8211; it is difficult to read &amp;#8211; use bold, italic or other versions of the font for emphasis. Titles, headings and subheadings should be in a larger size font than the body of the text. When combining different fonts, use fonts that are clearly distinct to create contrast. It is often recommended to use a sans serif font for headings and a serif font for the body of the text.
*Colour: It could be used in text for emphasizing and in graphics where appropriate. When used judiciously it increases learning and retention. Avoid overuse of colour as it loses its interest value.

===Ease of use:===
Another consideration apart from the page layout is the collation of the manual to make the final product easy to use. The following techniques might be helpful:
*Section dividers that extend beyond the page width make it easy to find sections, especially if it has the topics printed on the tabs. This is especially appropriate for a bulky manual that is to be used over several sessions.
*A detailed table of contents at the beginning of sections, in addition to the main table of contents at the front of the manual makes it more accessible.
*Allow wide enough margins to accommodate the type of binding used, as well as space for users to make key notes.
*When considering binding, use a method that would allow easy replacement of pages. The manual can be updated easily, which adds to its reference value.


Lastly, be aware of copyright and other legal issues before reproducing the manual.

==Training manual examples==

===Example 1: based on the training checklist===
This manual is used during on the job training and is available for reviewing between training sessions. This format is based on the checklist, which consists of a lists of tasks/skills to be taught, with extra columns where the trainer date and signs as the trainee progresses through the checklist.

'''Comment:''' This format works well in the on-the-job training situation where step-by-step instructions are given for fairly simple tasks. As it follows the checklist it makes reviewing easy while training is ongoing. Illustrations are difficult to incorporate in the text, which have been handled as handouts to overcome this restriction. Some of the handouts lend themselves to appendices, such as the 'OSH guidelines' in the example. Since this manual has only three main sections with all the handouts filed after each section, it is still easy to handle, especially with the detailed index in the front of the manual. If it had more sections, then this format would be cumbersome to use. Although a detailed index would enhance its reference value in the workplace, this isn't the ideal format to use for future reference.

===Example 2: Text book style manual===

'''Discharge of returned items'''
##'''Introduction:'''
All returned items are handled at this desk. When borrowers return their items, the items are discharged, resulting in the removing of the items form the borrower's record. Once the discharging is done, the displayed message will indicate what must be done with the discharged item.
##'''Setting screen up for discharging:''' 
Discharging is done in ''Circulation Services'' (no. 2 on the main Circulation menu). To set the system up for discharging type in '2' at the command prompt (indicated by '&gt;&gt;'). Different commands will be displayed on the ''Circulation Services'' screen.

'''Illustration:''' ''Circulation Services'' screen.

 
To display the discharge screen type 'DI' at the command prompt. The date for discharging will be displayed and the system is now ready for discharging items. 

'''Illustration:''' ''Discharge'' screen.

##'''Discharging books''' 
Before discharging check that the settings of the scanner are correct: It must be set on 'discharge' and the sensitiser must be switched on.

Illustration: Scanner set up for discharging books

Stack books face down to a maximum height of 20 cm. Be careful to stack the books in a way that will prevent injuries - see the Occupational Safety &amp; Health (OSH) guidelines (Appendix 1, p--). Slide the book past the scanner to wand in the barcode number of the book. Read the message on the screen and place the discharged book in the appropriate place.


'''Comment:''' This is the more traditional format which most people are familiar with. The illustrations are at the appropriate places which makes it easy to follow the text. The text tend to be 'wordier' than in the succinct bulleted style of the previous example. This format is good for future reference in the work place. It is also suited for describing more complex tasks and concepts. To assist navigation, a detailed index is essential, especially when it contains many sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a simple illustration of a concept using a dynamic graph.  You want to use a range control to change in input and see the impact of that change on an output.

== Screen Image ==

[[Image:XForms-supply-and-demand-range-control.jpg|frame|center|Supply and Demand Dynamic Graph]]

== Sample Program ==

This is not working yet with the range control.  I wrote it with just SVG and JavaScript and I am in the process of porting it to XForms.  I also need to use CSS to clean up the markup.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <comment>/* Sample XForms Template */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
Why are you creating this example?  Should start with &quot;You want to...&quot;

== Screen Image ==
A sample screen image.  Many people do not have the ability to run the examples so this is critical.

Use this format:

[[Image:my-screen-image.jpg|center|frame|This is my caption]]

Make SURE you label all images with a license.  
Please use creative commons share alike with attribution if you can.

== Sample Code ==

* Please make the default namespace '''xhtml'''.
* Please use the '''xf''' as the namespace prefix for all XForms elements.
* Use '''spaces''' to indent, not tabs.  Wikimedia and browsers use different setting for tab-stops.  This can not be changed.
* Wrap your source code using the source element to give the code syntax highlighting:

&lt;pre&gt;
   &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   ...
   &lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Sample XForms Template ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;
   xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;Form Title&lt;/title&gt;
       &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
          @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
          body {font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;}
       &lt;/style&gt;
       &lt;xf:model&gt;
          &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;data&gt;
               &lt;my-element&gt;Hello World&lt;/my-element&gt;
            &lt;/data&gt;
          &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
       &lt;/xf:model&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
         &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;my-element&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Message: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
         &lt;/xf:input&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Auto navigation macro ==
Please place the following macro at the end of each example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{auto navigation|NextExample|PriorExample}}
&lt;/pre&gt;


This allows readers to just page through the examples without using the back button.

== Discussion ==
Some analysis of the more difficult or unusual sections of the example. Any long complex XPath expressions should be explained on a step-by-step basis.

== Credits ==
Make sure you give credits to other examples that people have done.  Our license is Sharealike  '''with Attribution''' so we want to also give other developers attribution if they started some examples.  Give a URL to the original author's code if you can.

== AWB run through what links here pages ==

Could you run AWB through all &quot;what links here&quot; pages of the templates located in [[:Category:User warning templates]] and subst any use of the template on user talk pages? There are a lot of them. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:35, 3 October 2007 (UTC)
:Good idea. In progress. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:37, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

::Not every single template in existence needs to be subst'ed. I rolled back some of your bot's subst of unsigned on pages I got in my watchlist, but there are probably a million other places unsigned is too used. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:04, 4 October 2007 (UTC)
:::I thought it made sense to substitute {{tlx|unsigned}} - should it not be? If there's some functionality that's broken by substituting it, I'll undo all those edits. I apologize if substituting that template was a mistake. Were any others substituted that should not have been? '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:46, 4 October 2007 (UTC)
::::I guess we disagree there. Thats the only one that I saw that I thought didn't need to be done and didn't serve any purpose in doing. I don't think its normally substited. I know I never have. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:35, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

== Bot Flag ==

Just to let you know, i've given your bot an emergency flag for the duration of your job. Let me know when you are finished so I can take it off again. We can start a discussion on RFA about getting you the flag on a more permanent basis, especially now that we've seen a demonstration of what it is capable of. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:29, 4 October 2007 (UTC)
:Sure thing. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:32, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks! you did a good job tonight, you and your bot are a formidable team! When are you going to get back to work? If there is a lot more to do and you intend to get back to it soon, maybe you should keep the flag for a little bit longer. No sense cluttering the logs unnecessarily if you are just going to be getting it back anyway. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:09, 4 October 2007 (UTC)
::I'll probably finish tomorrow afternoon after my tutorial. I'll keep it till after that run than? '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:00, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

Fixed the problem through a little sluthing. On wikiversity, the &quot;metadata&quot; CSS class was defined as &quot;display: none&quot; To solve the problem, i simply removed the metadata class from the template. Should work fine now, but you may want to double-check that all the images used by the template are properly uploaded to wikiversity (or new images be specified). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:56, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Image ==

No, i never was able to get concrete information about this particular image. Here is what I do know: The image was licensed for use in the online ebook. Before being donated to Wikibooks, I told the owners of that ebook to ensure all text and images were released under a suitable license. They told me this has happened, and they uploaded the text and images. However, I have not received any &quot;evidence&quot; that this particular image has been released by it's author for use on Wikibooks (especially since this same image is listed as being copywritten on another website). I dont know what to make of it, we could assume it is properly licensed (which it very well may be), or we can assume it is not licensed because we have no proof of it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:42, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

== Wikimedia How To Book==

Hello Mike.lifeguard!

Thanks for your help, but I think that you misunderstood me.

I was trying to make a clever subtitle to clarify my meaning, but obviously it didn't work.

I was making a request for a wikibook about advanced template usage. Yes I know that you have a [[Help:Advanced_templates|page]] on this topic. I was asking for a book because it is a different format than a wiki and I thought that it would be easier to understand than to surf for content.

However if it isn't in Wikibook's policy to make wikibooks about wikimedia, then forget about it.
Thanks&lt;br&gt;

:::Yes, I saw that. That's why I took a look at the proposed guideline, made 1 minor change and moved to enforce it. I think all the concerns have already been addressed on the talk page, including those in the archive. The only outstanding issue I could envision being a sticking point is that of sock puppets. In that case, there seems to be a consensus that a)this is a guideline, so there's room for leeway and b)blocking would apply to bad faith sockpuppets of the type mentioned - those used for astroturfing, evading blocks, violating policies or guidelines in some other way. As well, the wording on &quot;be bold&quot; seems reasonably clear - blocking is '''not''' a place to be bold. Admins should not change another admin's block with the usual exceptions. Finally, a guideline on cross-wiki vandalism was added, which addresses the issue nicely, IMHO. I'd rather see discussion of the proposal take place on it's talk page instead of here, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Embeddables=
[[Image:embeddable.PNG]]

In an application object model some objects are considered independent, and others are considered dependent parts of other objects.  In UML a relationship to a dependent object is consider an aggregate or composite association.  In a relational database this kind of relationship could be modeled in two ways, the dependent object could have its own table, or its data could be &lt;i&gt;embedded&lt;/i&gt; in the independent objects table.

In JPA a relationship where the target object's data is embedded in the source object's table is considered an embedded relationship, and the target object is considered an Embeddable object.  Embeddable objects have different requirements and restrictions than Entity objects and are defined by the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Embeddable.html @Embeddable]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;embeddable&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.

An embeddable object cannot be directly persisted, or [[#Querying|queried]], it can only be persisted or queried in the context of its parent.  An embeddable object does not have an id or table.  The JPA spec does not support embeddable objects having [[#Inheritance|inheritance]], although some JPA providers may allow this. [[#Relationships|Relationships]] from embeddable objects are supported in JPA 2.0.

Relationships to embeddable objects are defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Embedded.html @Embedded]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;embedded&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.  The JPA 2.0 spec also supports [[#Collections|collection]] relationships to embeddable objects.

===Example of an Embeddable object annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Embeddable 
public class EmploymentPeriod {
  @Column(name=&quot;START_DATE&quot;)
  private java.sql.Date startDate;

  @Column(name=&quot;END_DATE&quot;)
  private java.sql.Date endDate;
  ....
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of an Embeddable object XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;embeddable class=&quot;org.acme.EmploymentPeriod&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;startDate&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/basic&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;endDate&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;END_DATE&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/embeddable&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of an embedded relationship annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @Embedded
  private EmploymentPeriod period;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of an embedded relationship XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;embedded name=&quot;period&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Sharing==
An embeddable object can be shared between multiple classes.  Consider a &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; object, that both an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; contain.  Both &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; have their own tables, with different column names that they desire to store their name in.  Embeddables support this through allowing each embedded mapping to override the columns used in the embeddable.  This is done through the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/AttributeOverride.html @AttributeOverride] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;attribute-override&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.

Note that an embeddable cannot be shared between multiple instances.  If you desire to share an embeddable object instance, then you must make it an independent object with its own table.

===Example shared embeddable annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @Embedded
  @AttributeOverrides({
    @AttributeOverride(name=&quot;startDate&quot;, column=@Column(name=&quot;START_DATE&quot;)),
    @AttributeOverride(name=&quot;endDate&quot;, column=@Column(name=&quot;END_DATE&quot;))
  })
  private Period employmentPeriod;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class User {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @Embedded
  @AttributeOverrides({
    @AttributeOverride(name=&quot;startDate&quot;, column=@Column(name=&quot;SDATE&quot;)),
    @AttributeOverride(name=&quot;endDate&quot;, column=@Column(name=&quot;EDATE&quot;))
  })
  private Period period;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example shared embeddable XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;embedded name=&quot;employmentPeriod&quot;&gt;
            &lt;attribute-override name=&quot;startDate&quot;&gt;
                &lt;column name=&quot;START_DATE&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/attribute-override&gt;
            &lt;attribute-override name=&quot;endDate&quot;&gt;
                &lt;column name=&quot;END_DATE&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/attribute-override&gt;
        &lt;/embedded&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;User&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.User&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;embedded name=&quot;period&quot;&gt;
            &lt;attribute-override name=&quot;startDate&quot;&gt;
                &lt;column name=&quot;SDATE&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/attribute-override&gt;
            &lt;attribute-override name=&quot;endDate&quot;&gt;
                &lt;column name=&quot;EDATE&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/attribute-override&gt;
        &lt;/embedded&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Embedded Ids==
An &lt;code&gt;EmbeddedId&lt;/code&gt; is an embeddable object that contains the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; for an entity.

See: [[Java_Persistence/Identity_and_Sequencing#Embedded_Id|Embedded Id]]

==Nulls==
An embeddable object's data is contained in several columns in its parent's table.  Since there is no single field value, there is no way to know if a parent's reference to the embeddable is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.  One could assume that if every field value of the embeddable is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, then the reference should be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, but then there is no way to represent an embeddable with all &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; values.  JPA does not allow embeddables to be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, but some JPA providers may support this.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support an embedded reference being &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.  This is set through using a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;AggregateObjectMapping&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;setIsNullAllowed&lt;/code&gt; API.

==Nesting==
A nested embeddable is a relationship to an embeddable object from another embeddable.  The JPA 1.0 spec only allows &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; relationships in an embeddable object, so nested embeddables are not supported, however some JPA products may support them.  Technically there is nothing preventing the &lt;code&gt;@Emdedded&lt;/code&gt; annotation being used in an embeddable object, so this may just work depending on your JPA provider (cross your fingers).

JPA 2.0 supports nested embeddable objects.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support embedded mappings from embeddables.  The existing &lt;code&gt;@Embedded&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;embedded&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element can be used.

A workaround to having a nested embeddable, and for embeddables in general is to use property access, and add get/set methods for all of the attributes of the nested embeddable object.

====Example of using properties to define a nested embeddable====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Embeddable
public class EmploymentDetails {
  private EmploymentPeriod period;
  private int yearsOfService;
  private boolean fullTime;
  ....
  public EmploymentDetails() {
    this.period = new EmploymentPeriod();
  }
  @Transient
  public EmploymentPeriod getEmploymentPeriod() {
    return period;
  }
  @Basic
  public Date getStartDate() {
    return getEmploymentPeriod().getStartDate();
  }
  public void setStartDate(Date startDate) {
    getEmploymentPeriod().setStartDate(startDate);
  }
  @Basic
  public Date getEndDate() {
    return getEmploymentPeriod().getEndDate();
  }
  public void setEndDate(Date endDate) {
    getEmploymentPeriod().setEndDate(endDate);
  }
  ....
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Inheritance==
Embeddable inheritance is when one embeddable class subclasses another embeddable class.  The JPA spec does not allow inheritance in embeddable objects, however some JPA products may support this.  Technically there is nothing preventing the &lt;code&gt;@DiscriminatorColumn&lt;/code&gt; annotation being used in an embeddable object, so this may just work depending on your JPA provider (cross your fingers).  Inheritance in embeddables is always &lt;i&gt;single table&lt;/i&gt; as an embeddable must live within its' parent's table.  Generally attempting to mix inheritance between embeddables and entities is not a good idea, but may work in some cases.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support inheritance with embeddables.  This is set through using a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;InheritancePolicy&lt;/code&gt;.

==Relationships==
A relationship is when an embeddable has a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or other such mapping to an entity.  The JPA 1.0 spec only allows &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mappings in an embeddable object, so relationships from embeddables are not supported, however some JPA products may support them.  Technically there is nothing preventing the &lt;code&gt;@OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; annotation or other relationships from being used in an embeddable object, so this may just work depending on your JPA provider (cross your fingers).

JPA 2.0 supports all relationship types from an embeddable object.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support relationship mappings from embeddables.  The existing relationship annotations or XML elements can be used.

Relationships to embeddable objects from entities other than the embeddable's parent are typically not a good idea, as an embeddable is a private dependent part of its parent.  Generally relationships should be to the embeddable's parent, not the embeddable.  Otherwise, it would normally be a good idea to make the embeddable an independent entity with its own table.  If an embeddable has a bi-directional relationship, such as a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; that requires an inverse &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; the inverse relationship should be to the embeddable's parent.

A workaround to having a relationship from an embeddable is to define the relationship in the embeddable's parent, and define property get/set methods for the relationship that set the relationship into the embeddable.

====Example of setting a relationship in an embeddable from its parent====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  ....
  private EmploymentDetails details;
  ....
  @Embedded
  public EmploymentDetails getEmploymentDetails() {
    return details;
  }
  @OneToOne
  public Address getEmploymentAddress() {
    return getEmploymentDetails().getAddress();
  }
  public void setEmploymentAddress(Address address) {
    getEmploymentDetails().setAddress(address);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

One special relationship that is sometimes desired in an embeddable is a relationship to its parent.  JPA does not support this, but some JPA providers may.

:[[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]] : Supports a &lt;code&gt;@Parent&lt;/code&gt; annotation in embeddables to define a relationship to its parent.

A workaround to having a parent relationship from an embeddable is to set the parent in the property set method.

====Example of setting a relationship in an embeddable to its parent====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  ....
  private EmploymentDetails details;
  ....
  @Embedded
  public EmploymentDetails getEmploymentDetails() {
    return details;
  }
  public void setEmploymentDetails(EmploymentDetails details) {
    this.details = details;
    details.setParent(this);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Collections==
A collection of embeddable objects is similar to a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; except the target objects are embeddables and have no &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;.  This allows for a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; to be defined without a inverse &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt;, as the parent is responsible for storing the foreign key in the target object's table.  JPA 1.0 did not support collections of embeddable objects, but some JPA providers support this.

JPA 2.0 does support collections of embeddable objects through the &lt;code&gt;ElementCollection&lt;/code&gt; mapping.
See, [[Java Persistence/ElementCollection|ElementCollection]].

:[[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink ]](as of 1.2) : Supports the JPA 2.0 &lt;code&gt;ElementCollection&lt;/code&gt; mapping.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support collections of embeddables.  This is set through using a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;AggregateCollectionMapping&lt;/code&gt;.

:[[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]] : Supports collections of embeddables through the &lt;code&gt;@CollectionOfElements&lt;/code&gt; annotation.

:[[Java Persistence/DataNucleus|DataNucleus]] : Supports the JPA 2.0 &lt;code&gt;ElementCollection&lt;/code&gt; mapping.

Typically the primary key of the target table will be composed of the parent's primary key, and some unique field in the embeddable object.  The embeddable should have a unique field within its parent's collection, but does not need to be unique for the entire class.  It could still have a unique id and still use sequencing, or if it has no unique fields, its id could be composed of all of its fields.  The embeddable collection object will be different than a typical embeddable object as it will not be stored in the parent's table, but in its own table.  Embeddables are strictly privately owned objects, deletion of the parent will cause deletion of the embeddables, and removal from the embeddable collection should cause the embeddable to be deleted.  Embeddables cannot be queried directly, and are not independent objects as they have no &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;.

==Querying==
Embeddable objects cannot be queried directly, but they can be queried in the context of their parent.  Typically it is best to select the parent, and access the embeddable from the parent.  This will ensure the embeddable is registered with the persistence context.  If the embeddable is selected in a query, the resulting objects will be detached, and changes will not be tracked.

====Example of querying an embeddable====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT employee.period from Employee employee where employee.period.endDate = :param
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Writing a minc volume to file, with an aside on slice scaling ==

The code in this tutorial reads a MINC file, adds 1 to every voxel, and then writes the modified volume back to file. 

Two notes before getting to the code: (1) this will overwrite the file passed as the first argument, so be careful if you actually try the code, and (2) this is a slow way of accomplishing the task - see the next tutorial for a much more sensible way of accomplishing the same goal.

On to the code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;minc2.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  mihandle_t    minc_volume;
  midimhandle_t dimensions[3];
  double        voxel, max;
  int           result;
  unsigned long v[3];
  unsigned int  sizes[3];
  miboolean_t   slice_scaling;

  /* open the volume - first command line argument */
  result = miopen_volume(argv[1], MI2_OPEN_RDWR, &amp;minc_volume);
  /* check for error on opening */
  if (result != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening input file: %d.\n&quot;, result);
    return(1);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Nothing new up to this point - the variables are declared, the volume is read (though note the second argument to ''miopen_volume'' - it now allows for both reading and writing of this volume).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* check whether this volume uses slice scaling */
  miget_slice_scaling_flag(minc_volume, &amp;slice_scaling);
&lt;/source&gt;

Here the first new minc function crops up: ''miget_slice_scaling_flag.'' It performs a very simple operation, asking whether the volume uses slice scaling or global scaling, placing the output into the boolean type ''miboolean_t.'' 

Scaling is one of the key concepts in MINC, and is introduced here: [[MINC/Tutorials/Tutorials01]] (scroll down to the data-types section). Our program needs to know whether slice scaling is being used for the following reason: the range represented in the volume is usually set to follow the actual range of values present in the volume. This means that if we increment all voxels by 1, we have to make sure that the range of values allowed in the volume is updated as well. As you will see below, updating the range is different depending on whether the scaling is set for the global volume or independently for every slice.

On to more source code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* get the dimension sizes */
  miget_volume_dimensions(minc_volume, MI_DIMCLASS_SPATIAL,
			  MI_DIMATTR_ALL, MI_DIMORDER_FILE,
			  3, dimensions);
  result = miget_dimension_sizes(dimensions, 3, sizes);
  printf(&quot;Volume sizes: %u %u %u\n&quot;, sizes[0], sizes[1], sizes[2]);
&lt;/source&gt;

We obtain the dimension sizes once again ...

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* global scaling: increment the maximum by one */
  if (slice_scaling == FALSE) {
    miget_volume_max(minc_volume, &amp;max);
    miset_volume_max(minc_volume, max+1);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

... and then proceed to the first part of the scaling issue. If there is no slice scaling, we just need to change the global scaling, which is done by getting the volume maximum using ''miget_volume_max'', and setting it to the previous max+1 using ''miset_volume_max.'' There are similar functions for volume_min, which we could reasonably have updated here as well.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* loop over all voxels in the volume, add 1 to each voxel */
  for (v[0]=0; v[0] &lt; sizes[0]; v[0]++) {
    /* slice scaling: increment the maximum of each slice by one */
    if(slice_scaling == TRUE) {
      miget_slice_max(minc_volume, v, 3, &amp;max);
      miset_slice_max(minc_volume, v, 3, max+1);
    }
    for (v[1]=0; v[1] &lt; sizes[1]; v[1]++) {
      for (v[2]=0; v[2] &lt; sizes[2]; v[2]++) {
	miget_real_value(minc_volume, v, 3, &amp;voxel);
	voxel += 1;
	miset_real_value(minc_volume, v, 3, voxel);
      }
    }
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

This is the core of the code - we loop over all voxels using dimension size information to know when to terminate each loop, get the real value at each voxel, increment it by one, and write it back to the volume using ''miset_real_value.'' The first dimension is the slice dimension - so if this volume uses slice scaling we get the slice maximum using ''miget_slice_max,'' increment it by one and write it back using ''miset_slice_max.'' 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* closes the volume and makes sure all data is written to file */
  miclose_volume(minc_volume);

  return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Once we've looped over all voxels we close the volume using ''miclose_volume.'' And that's it, we're done. The file read in as the first argument should now have all of its values incremented by one. Keep in mind that this was the slow way of doing it - see the next tutorial for a much more sensible version.

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;

==Deletions==

Your deletion of [[Technology Integration In K12 Education/Technology in Early Childhood]] and similar pages might be worth a second look... I think you'll find these could be class project pages with a stub (&quot;write here&quot;) created by the facilitator or teacher. Just something to watch out for next time.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Working with hyperslabs ==

The previous tutorial stepped through every voxel of a volume, added 1 to it, and wrote the output back to the same volume. Here we will improve on that example: the output will be written to a new volume, and we will use hyperslabs for the data processing.

A hyperslab is a central concept in minc. It allows you to pull an arbitrary (but contiguous) chunk of data out of a volume, do something to it, and write it back to the volume. This is a lot faster than individually getting each voxel; it does, however, require more memory.

So on to the example: this code takes a volume, creates a copy of it the same in every way except for adding 1 to each voxel. The new volume will also always use global scaling, regardless of whether the input had slice scaling or not.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;minc2.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  mihandle_t    minc_volume, new_volume;
  midimhandle_t dimensions[3], *dimensions_new;
  double        min, max;
  int           result, i;
  unsigned long start[3], count[3];
  unsigned int  sizes[3];
  double        *slab;

  if (argc != 3) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: input.mnc output.mnc\n&quot;);
  }

  /* open the volume - first command line argument */
  result = miopen_volume(argv[1], MI2_OPEN_READ, &amp;minc_volume);
  /* check for error on opening */
  if (result != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening input file: %d.\n&quot;, result);
    return(1);
  }

  /* get the dimension sizes */
  miget_volume_dimensions(minc_volume, MI_DIMCLASS_SPATIAL,
			  MI_DIMATTR_ALL, MI_DIMORDER_FILE,
			  3, dimensions);
  miget_dimension_sizes(dimensions, 3, sizes);
  printf(&quot;Volume sizes: %u %u %u\n&quot;, sizes[0], sizes[1], sizes[2]);
&lt;/source&gt;

So far, so good - none of this code should be new to you. Do note the creation of two new variables for the new volume and new dimensions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* allocate new dimensions */
  dimensions_new = malloc(sizeof(midimhandle_t) * 3);

  /* copy the dimensions */
  for(i=0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    micopy_dimension(dimensions[i], &amp;dimensions_new[i]);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we allocate memory for the dimensions of the new volume, and copy the dimension definitions from the old volume.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* allocate memory for the hyperslab - make it size of entire volume */
  slab = malloc(sizeof(double) * sizes[0] * sizes[1] * sizes[2]);

  start[0] = start[1] = start[2] = 0.0;
  if (miget_real_value_hyperslab(minc_volume, MI_TYPE_DOUBLE,
				 start, count, slab) != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error getting hyperslab\n&quot;);
    return(1);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

The memory for the hyperslab is allocated and the hyperslab obtained - in this case the hyperslab is the entire volume. The key function is ''miget_real_value_hyperslab,'' which takes five arguments: the minc volume handle, the type you want the data to be in, an array of starts (all zeroes in this case), an array of counts( the volume sizes), and the address of where to write the data.


&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* set min and max to the first voxel plus 1 
   *  (since we add one to everything anyway) */
  min = slab[0]+1;
  max = slab[0]+1;

  /* loop over all voxels */
  for (i=0; i &lt; sizes[0] * sizes[1] * sizes[2]; i++) {
    /* increment voxel by 1 */
    slab[i] += 1;
    
    /* check if min or max should be changed */
    if (slab[i]+1 &lt; min) {
      min = slab[i]+1;
    }
    else if (slab[i]+1 &gt; max) {
      max = slab[i]+1;
    }
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

And now we loop over every voxel in the hyperslab (note how it is dealt with as a one-dimensional array), making sure to keep the modified image min and max.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* create the new volume */
  if (micreate_volume(argv[2], 3, dimensions_new, MI_TYPE_UBYTE,
		      MI_CLASS_REAL, NULL, &amp;new_volume) != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error creating new volume\n&quot;);
    return(1);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

We then create the actual volume using ''micreate_volume''. It takes seven arguments: the filename, the number of dimensions, an array of the actual dimensions (created through the copy operation above), the data type (set to unsigned byte here), the data class, special volume properties (set to NULL here), and the address of the volume handle.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* create the data for the new volume */
  if (micreate_volume_image(new_volume) != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error creating volume data\n&quot;);
    return(1);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we make sure that the data is created inside the minc volume handle using ''micreate_volume_image''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* set valid and real range */
  miset_volume_valid_range(new_volume, 255, 0);
  miset_volume_range(new_volume, max, min);

  if (miset_real_value_hyperslab(new_volume, MI_TYPE_DOUBLE,
				 start, count, slab) != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error setting hyperslab\n&quot;);
    return(1);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

We then set the valid range - from 0 to 255 since this is unsigned byte data - and the volume range, which was determined by keeping track of the min and max when looping over voxels. The hyperslab is the placed back into the volume using ''miset_real_value_hyperslab'', which takes the exact same arguments as ''miget_real_value_hyperslab''. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* closes the volume and makes sure all data is written to file */
  miclose_volume(minc_volume);
  miclose_volume(new_volume);

  /* free memory */
  free(dimensions_new);
  free(slab);

  return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

And finally we close the volumes, free the allocated memory, and exit.

'''Lemon rice''' is a speciality of the South Indian coastal state of Tamil Nadu.

== Ingredients ==

*4 cups cooked white rice (add a little oil to the raw rice before cooking it. This gives rice a better texture) 
*1 tsp mustard seeds
*3 tbsp sesame or gingely oil (&quot;Til&quot; oil in Hindi, &quot;NaLEnnai&quot; in Tamil, sesame oil)
*2 tbsp split-peas
*2 tbsp groundnuts (peanuts)
*1/2 tsp asafoetida (&quot;Heengh&quot; in Hindi, &quot;Perungayum&quot; in Tamil)
*3-4 dry red chillies
*4-5 curry leaves
*2 lemons squeezed or 4 tbsp lemon concentrate
*1 tsp turmeric powder
*3/4 tbsp salt

==Procedure==

#Heat the oil in a pan.
#Add groundnuts and split-peas, fry until golden brown.
#Add mustard seeds, asafoetida, curry leaves and red chillies (broken into pieces). Wait till the mustard seeds sputter.
#Mix a little salt, turmeric powder and lemon concentrate.
#Let it boil and reduce.
#Remove pan from stove, add to the rice and mix well.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

*Serve with potato chips or pickle
*1 tsp sesame seeds can be roasted and added for more taste

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hyperslabs part 2 ==

Onto more hyperslabs: we will once again do the same trick of adding one to every voxel. We'll do it slightly differently: this time we will get and set the hyperslab at every slice, using much less memory. And, for even more mincy goodness, we will use slice scaling for the output.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;minc2.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  mihandle_t    minc_volume, new_volume;
  midimhandle_t dimensions[3], *dimensions_new;
  double        min, max;
  int           result, i, slice;
  unsigned long start[3], count[3];
  unsigned int  sizes[3];
  double        *slab;

  if (argc != 3) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: input.mnc output.mnc\n&quot;);
  }

  /* open the volume - first command line argument */
  result = miopen_volume(argv[1], MI2_OPEN_READ, &amp;minc_volume);
  /* check for error on opening */
  if (result != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening input file: %d.\n&quot;, result);
    return(1);
  }

  /* get the dimension sizes */
  miget_volume_dimensions(minc_volume, MI_DIMCLASS_SPATIAL,
			  MI_DIMATTR_ALL, MI_DIMORDER_FILE,
			  3, dimensions);
  miget_dimension_sizes(dimensions, 3, sizes);
  printf(&quot;Volume sizes: %u %u %u\n&quot;, sizes[0], sizes[1], sizes[2]);

  /* allocate new dimensions */
  dimensions_new = malloc(sizeof(midimhandle_t) * 3);

  /* copy the dimensions */
  for(i=0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    micopy_dimension(dimensions[i], &amp;dimensions_new[i]);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

This code is unchanged from the last tutorial.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* create the new volume */
  if (micreate_volume(argv[2], 3, dimensions_new, MI_TYPE_UBYTE,
		      MI_CLASS_REAL, NULL, &amp;new_volume) != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error creating new volume\n&quot;);
    return(1);
  }
  /* indicate that we will be using slice scaling */
  miset_slice_scaling_flag(new_volume, TRUE);

  /* set valid range */
  miset_volume_valid_range(new_volume, 255, 0);
  
  /* create the data for the new volume */
  if (micreate_volume_image(new_volume) != MI_NOERROR) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error creating volume data\n&quot;);
    return(1);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

This time we create the volume before we start messing with the actual data. We also set slice scaling using ''miset_slice_scaling_flag'' - note that this has to come before ''micreate_volume_image''. The rest is the same as before.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* now go into a slice loop - get each slice as a hyperslab. *
   * First allocate enough memory to hold one slice of data */
  slab = malloc(sizeof(double) * sizes[1] * sizes[2]);

  /* the start and counts */
  start[0] = start[1] = start[2] = 0;

  /* always one slice */
  count[0] = 1;
  count[1] = (unsigned long) sizes[1];
  count[2] = (unsigned long) sizes[2];

  /* start the loop itself */
  for (slice=0; slice &lt; sizes[0]; slice++) {
    /* set the slice start */
    start[0] = (unsigned long) slice;
    if (miget_real_value_hyperslab(minc_volume, MI_TYPE_DOUBLE,
				   start, count, slab) != MI_NOERROR) {
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error getting hyperslab for slice %d\n&quot;, slice);
      return(1);
    }
    
    /* set min and max to the first voxel of the slice plus 1 
     *  (since we add one to everything anyway) */
    min = slab[0]+1;
    max = slab[0]+1;
    
    /* loop over all voxels in slice */
    for (i=0; i &lt; sizes[1] * sizes[2]; i++) {
      /* increment voxel by 1 */
      slab[i] += 1;
    
      /* check if min or max should be changed */
      if (slab[i]+1 &lt; min) {
	min = slab[i]+1;
      }
      else if (slab[i]+1 &gt; max) {
	max = slab[i]+1;
      }
    }
    /* set the slice scaling */
    miset_slice_range(new_volume, start, 3, max, min);

    /* put the hyperslab into the new volume */
    if (miset_real_value_hyperslab(new_volume, MI_TYPE_DOUBLE,
				   start, count, slab) != MI_NOERROR) {
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error setting hyperslab\n&quot;);
      return(1);
    }
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

The loop over the data has become more complicated. We now allocate data for a hyperslab big enough to hold one slice, and we reuse the same array for every slice. We then get the hyperslab for every slice, do the same manipulation of the voxels while keeping track of slice specific min and max, and set the slice range. Then we put the modified hyperslab into the new volume, and move on to the next slice.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* closes the volume and makes sure all data is written to file */
  miclose_volume(minc_volume);
  miclose_volume(new_volume);

  /* free memory */
  free(dimensions_new);
  free(slab);

  return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

And we finish up in the same way as before.

Another one is needed for definitions and axioms.

== Irrationality of the square root of 2 ==
&lt;div class=&quot;NavFrame&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;NavFrame&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;NavHead&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left;border:1px solid black; border-spacing:0px; padding:0px; margin:0px; width:45%;background:#ddddff;&quot;&gt;
This result uses the following:

&lt;div class=&quot;NavContent&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left;border:1px solid black; border-spacing:0px; padding:0px; margin:0px; width:45%;background:#eeeeff;display:none;&quot;&gt;
* Definition of rational number.
* Definition of prime and coprime.
* Definition of square root.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''The square root of 2 is irrational''', &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q} &lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
This is a proof by contradiction, so we assume that  &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q} &lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b} &lt;/math&gt; for some ''a'', ''b'' that are coprime.

This implies that &lt;math&gt;2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;. Rewriting this gives &lt;math&gt;2b^2 = a^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 2, then so must the right-hand side, i.e., &lt;math&gt;2 | a^2 &lt;/math&gt;.
Since 2 is prime, we must have that &lt;math&gt;2 | a &lt;/math&gt;.

So we may substitute ''a'' with &lt;math&gt;2a'&lt;/math&gt;, and we have that &lt;math&gt;2b^2 = 4a^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Dividing both sides with 2 yields  &lt;math&gt;b^2 = 2a^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and using similar arguments as above, we conclude that  &lt;math&gt;2 | b &lt;/math&gt;.

Here we have a contradiction; we assumed that ''a'' and ''b'' were coprime, but we have that &lt;math&gt;2 | a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 | b &lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, the assumption were false, and &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt; cannot be written as a rational number. Hence, it is irrational.

== Notes ==
* As a generalization one can show that the square root of every prime number is irrational.

#Learn how to call the name of the page that I am on.&lt;br&gt;Think I got that, {{PAGENAME}}.
# Learn to call the name of the previous page if the pages are in sequence such as Metabolism 1 and metabolism 2.&lt;br&gt;Not sure about that. Need to look up the + and _ features.
# Need a way to define next and previous of the named EASY pages without having to type it into each page. I want a template or something to tell the page which is next and which is previous.
# Make a cover page

==Templates==
Ran out of time trying to read all of these templates. 
This is the one that I stopped on&quot;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_namespace
also
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Variable

It seemed to be the easiest to understand so far. It had simple information that was omitted from other template helps.

Other template pages are:
[[Help:Template]]
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Template
Which is more up to date.

http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Advanced_templates

I still don't understand what {{{1}}} means.

Current thinking is that the thing of value to me is to make variable parameter names, I think.

&quot;Adding a template to a page

To add a template to the page, simply type the name of the template with two braces on each side. For example, to add Template:Wikify to a page, type xxremovedxx.

If a template takes a number of parameters, it is suggested that the template be formatted as the following:

{{TemplateName
|      param = Param value
| parameter2 = Text
|   variable = Variable text
}}

Putting each parameter on a separate line and aligning them by the equals sign make it easier to read the wikicode.

==parser codes==
found a list of parser codes like PAGENAME here:
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Variable


I am also looking at parser functions such as #titleparts
on this page:
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:ParserFunctions

==Found==
{{PAGENAME}} writes the title of this page.&lt;br&gt;
{{NAMESPACE}} writes the title of the top level in this book. &lt;br&gt;
{{{{NAMESPACE}}:{{PAGENAME}}/subpage}}
==Ordering==

If we could make a special template which contains a datastructure , then by editing the datastructure we could order the named pages and then call them next and previous.


Make a list with the names of the pages in order.&lt;br&gt;
Have a template that generates the table of contents from this list.&lt;br&gt;
Then have a template that generates next and previous links based on this master template.&lt;br&gt;

I can also have extra pages in the book that are skipped over.

This template could also define which ones were were in the printable version and might even be able to generate such a thing.

The advantage is that if I feel that I am handling the sequence wrong then I can simply change the sequence.
&lt;p&gt;
For example, I wanted to have a version that showed only the pages marked easy.&lt;br&gt;
This would skip all of the intermediate and advanced pages and put the other ones in order.
I know that you can't use arrow buttons like in HTML, but we could use next and previous buttons and &gt;.

====new thought====
I can define in a page which pages are intermediate and hard and call them within that page with a template that defines their format.

But this takes as much work as adding the links...hmmm.

I will make a new subpage called [[Biology, Answering the Big Questions of Life/pagelist |pagelist]]
Here I will list links to the pages in the book.
Each page will be assigned a unique number.
It would be nice if I could generate it, but instead I will make them by hand.
Then I will have on each page and equation that will add one number to the page.

Different versions would be a problem.
Perhaps I could define the template on the introductory page and make a frame that lists certain pages in it. No, frames won't work here.
====Categories====
I got an idea.

Maybe I can make a category for my book.
Then get the template to read the Category as if it is the list.
A category is automatically generated.

But categories are alphabetical, so although it may make a fine index, it won't make a good page order generator.

I can however make a category for the easy pages.

====Navigation Wiki pages====

DarkLama gave me a [[ Wikibooks:Template_messages/Navigation|link to a page on navagation]].


It gave me a new idea.

Make a unary numbering system. Number each line.

Perhaps this could be done by a template where each page was called once.

It would write the numbers in permanently, but when I added new pages I'd do it again ...wait would that work. I'm not sure it would.

====Updated text====
I just found that the wikipedia template help pages are much more up to date than the wikibook help pages.
Wikipedia had version 1.6 and wikibooks had 1.4.

Even so, I keep getting false leads, and I find it very difficult to find what I am looking for.
I just sifted through a long discussion of transcluding cricket games vs startrek episodes and I am no closer to finding the answer.

I want to catagorize the pages by difficulty.
EASY = green

There should be dots on the index and bars on the page. If only I knew how to do that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==

Yahoo provide a world weather forecast service via a REST API, delivering RSS. It is described in the [http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/ API documentation].

However the key to each feed for UK towns is a Yahoo Location ID such as UKXX0953 and there is no service available to convert from location names to Yahoo codes. Yahoo does provide alphabetical index pages of locations which contain links to the feeds themselves.  
== Yahoo Pipe ==

This task can be accomplished by the [http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=MEY4dst33BGiVWNbOTY80A Yahoo Pipe] written by Paul Daniel. (up to the extraction of the location ID) However the inherent instability of HTML markup leads to the current failure of this pipeline.

== XQuery ==
This script takes a location parameter, extracts the first letter of the location, constructs the URL of the yahoo weather index page for that letter, [http://weather.yahoo.com/regional/UKXX_B.html the index page for the letter B] and fetches the page via the httpclient module in eXist.  The page is not valid XHTML but the ''httpclient:get'' function cleans up the XML so it is well-formed.

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/util/geturi.xq?uri=http://weather.yahoo.com/regional/UKXX_B.html HTML page]

The page structure can be seen in the [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/util/treeview.xq?path=no&amp;uri=http://weather.yahoo.com/regional/UKXX_B.html tree view].

Next this XML is navigated to locate the &lt;b&gt;li&lt;/b&gt; element containing the location and strips out the code for that location. Finally this code is appended to the stem of the URL of the RSS page for this location, created a URL fo rthe RSS feed at that location. 
[http://xml.weather.yahoo.com/forecastrss?p=UKXX0025 RSS feed] and the script then redirects to that URL.

This process can be visualized using a [[../Dataflow diagrams | data flow diagram]] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~cjwallac/apps/services/dot2image.php?format=gif&amp;url=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/DataFlow/xpl2dot.xq?url=/db/Wiki/DataFlow/yahooweatherpl.xml  Diagram]



&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable $yahooIndex := &quot;http://weather.yahoo.com/regional/UKXX&quot;;
declare variable $yahooWeather := &quot;http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?u=c&amp;amp;p=&quot;;

let $location := request:get-parameter(&quot;location&quot;,&quot;Bristol&quot;)
let $letter :=  upper-case(substring($location,1,1))
let $suffix := if($letter eq 'A') then '' else concat('_',$letter)
let $index := xs:anyURI(concat ($yahooIndex,$suffix,&quot;.html&quot;))
let $page := httpclient:get($index,true(),())
let $href := $page//div[@id=&quot;yw-regionalloc&quot;]//li/a[.= $location]/@href
let $code :=  substring-after(substring-before($href,'.'),'forecast/')
let $rss := xs:anyURI(concat($yahooWeather,$code) )

return 
   response:redirect-to ($rss)

&lt;/source&gt;

* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/weather/yahoo.xq?location=Bristol  Bristol RSS feed]
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/weather/yahoo.xq?location=Cardiff  Cardiff RSS feed]

=== Notes ===

# Although the index page is not valid XHTML (why not?) and needs tidying, Yahoo have been helpful to the scapper by using ids on the sections. This allows the XPath expression to pick out the relevant section by id, and then select the &lt;b&gt;li&lt;/b&gt; containing the location.  However such tagging is not stable, and in fact changed recently from an id of '''browse''' to the current '''yw-regionalloc'''.  Note also that there is additional work required because the page for '''A''' has a different URL to the remainder of the letters -a feature not easily seen or tested for.
# eXist is not ideally suited to this task since the page has to be first stored in the database so that XPath expressions can be executed using the structural index.  An in-memory XQuery engine such as Saxon would be expected to perform better on this task.  At present the performance is a bit slow but the new 1.3 release improves this situation.
# Extracting the code from the string would be clearer with a regular expression, but XQuery does not provide a simple matching function to extract  the matched pattern.  An XQuery function which wraps some XSLT to do this is described in [[../String_Analysis | analyse-string]]
# The script uses the eXist function ''response:redirect-to'' to re-direct the browser to the constructed URL for the RSS feed

== XSLT ==

== XPL ==

Another approach is to use [http://www.orbeon.com/ops/doc/reference-xpl-pipelines XPL] developed by Erik Bruchez and Alessandro Vernet at Orbeon to describe the sequence of transformations as a pipeline. Here the pipeline is extended to create a custom HTML page from the RSS feed.

* This is a work in progress - at present this XPL engine is only a very simple, partial prototype, and even this simple sequential example is not conformant with the XPL schema (hence the local namespace).

The pipeline can be  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~cjwallac/apps/services/dot2image.php?url=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/xmlpipes/xpl2dot.xq&amp;format=gif   visualized] using GraphViz.

* The intention is to generate an additional image map to support linking to the underlying processes as well as support the full XPL language

==Vapirware==
What is vapirware, and why is it used here? The term gets 3ghits excluding wikibooks and mirrors. If it is to remind people to include the link, should a more useful message be printed, I assumed it was vandalism! [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad.Irwin]] 22:00, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

::How is PDF vaporware? It's not even software, it's an open standardized document format as long as you use PDF/A and not the Adobe version. Adobe Acrobat/Reader is certainly bloatware and dangerous (closed source, vulnerable, spyware, crash-prone), but not vaporware either.--[[Special:Contributions/88.74.219.203|88.74.219.203]] ([[User talk:88.74.219.203|discuss]]) 14:07, 5 March 2011 (UTC)

==Limiting PDF Access to authenticated users==

In a different wiki, How can I make the pdf files accessible only to authenticated users? &lt;br&gt;

== Link to instructions for creating a new, more up-to-date PDF? ==

PDF versions get out-of-date quickly. In the long run, we want automatic generation of PDFs--is that in the queue? In the meantime, maybe it's worth linking to the [[Help:Print_versions#PDF_versions|instructions]] for creating/updating PDFs?

== Things to fix or look into ==
* PDFs ignore &quot;noprint&quot; class for interwiki templates. This is a big problem.
* Not certain that full consolidate of all [[w:Wikipedia:Citation templates|citation templates]] should be done.
* Change [[Template:Cite web]] to '''not''' require &quot;title&quot;, URL should be sufficient.
* Autofill &quot;accessdate&quot; for citation templates when not provided and substituted.
* Are tabular boxes not showing content when clicked sometimes?&lt;br/&gt;Do tab items with no content need to be disabled or displayed differently?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; width:48%; margin:0px; padding:0.5em 0.25em;&quot;&gt;

== [[Understanding C++]] ==
One of the most fundamental decisions to make when teaching C++ programming is whether to deal with high-level or low-level details first.  My personal leaning, for most beginners, is to start with high-level constructs (e.g., use std::string before talking about arrays and pointers).  No doubt there are many people who like bottom-up approaches (and, when learning, I may be one of them), but my experience is that most of those who start learning C++ from a low-level viewpoint never progress to master its high-level aspects too, whereas a good fraction of those who handle the high-level pieces first can fill in the details later (and many never need to).  Besides, there are many books that try to teach low-level C++, but relatively few that cover the &quot;modern&quot; C++ style.  -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 20:17, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

Obviously not enough. Expand buildings and beliefs if possible. No introduction.

=== Accuracy ===
Someone in the 1690's is not ancient, and she only 'claims' to be a direct descendant.

=== Grammar and tone ===
Fine.

== Others ==
Buildings and clothes should be illustrated.

==Meningeal Melanocytomas==
Rare, benign lesions, with high recurrence rate. Thought to be derived from leptomeningeal melanocytes. Contain melanin pigment. Usually positive for HMB 45, Melan A, vimentin, and S-100. May recur as melanomas and may metastasize.

*'''Review:''' PMID 15160350, 2004 &amp;mdash; &quot;Therapy of meningeal melanocytomas.&quot; Rades D et al. Cancer. 2004 Jun 1;100(11):2442-7.
**Reviewed all published literature since 1972. 89 pts included. 
**Demographics: 46 spinal cord, 43 brain. Median f/u 5 yrs.
**Overall recurrence rate 37%. 24% after complete resection (CTR), 0% after CR + RT, 78% after incomplete resection (ITR), 24% after ITR + RT. For ITR + RT, dose response for local control (86% for 45-55 Gy vs 27% for &lt; 40 Gy)
**Conclusions: complete resection should be performed when possible. Incomplete resection should be followed with RT, approx 45 Gy.</text>

I think it would be a good thing to provide some downloadable journal and ledger (and whatever else) sheets.  Does anyone have such stationery that they could add?

== Indonesia ==
To make plain, Indonesian coconut rice for 4 people, we need:

=== Ingredients ===
* 300 grams of white long-grain [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 400 ml of coconut milk
* 2 red shallots
* 2 slices of fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* a pinpoint of fenugreek seed
* 2 pandan leaves

=== Procedure ===
* Wash the rice.
* Put all ingredients in a frying pan; make sure the rice is 2 cm submerged by the coconut milk.
* Cover the pan and allow to cook.
* Remove the pandan leaves
* Pour the rest of the coconut milk over the rice.
* Allow to rest for 15 minutes at room temperature and serve.

''P.S.: Depending on the thickness of the coconut milk, 2 deciliter coconut milk and 2 deciliter water may also be used. Also, instead of 300 grams of rice, 350 grams may be used depending on the thickness of the milk, whether or not the rice has been soaked a longtime prior to frying, personal preference, ...''

== India ==
In India, coconut rice is made with coconut flakes (or grated or dessicated/dry coconut). One way to make this dish is to make the rice separately (preferably using a rice variety which is light and fluffy when cooked) and then mixing it with the coconut mixture (coconut flakes toasted in sesame/coconut oil and spiced with paprika, nuts, curry powder/leaves and other spices).

=== Ingredients ===
* 5-7 cups of cooked, cooled white long grain [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (light and fluffy)
* 0.5 cup of fresh/frozen [[Cookbook:Coconut|grated coconut or dry coconut flakes]]
* 2 dry [[Cookbook:Chilli Pepper|red chilies]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mustard_Seed|black mustard seed]]
* 7-10 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Chickpea|Chana dhal]]
* 2 teaspoon oil
* salt to taste
* a few cashews

=== Procedure ===
* Wash the rice and cook it (either in rice cooker or over the stove) until light and fluffy.
* Let it cool and firm up a bit. May also use leftover white rice from previous day.
* Heat the oil with the mustard seeds in a covered sauté pan.
* When the mustard seeds have finished popping, add the other ingredients and lightly toast them in the oil till they change to a golden color.
* Then add the seasonings to cooked rice, mix well and serve.
* Serves about 4-6 people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To make Arroz con coco for 4? people, we need:

*1 small jar of concentrado de coco (4.3 oz or 125 gr) or 1 cup of fresh coconut milk
*5 cups water
*2 cups rice
*2 t salt
*2-3 T sugar
*raisins to taste

Put it all in a pot together and cook it up as you normally would. These, by the way, might be high-altitude directions. Four cups of water might be what you want. This rice is generally served on a side plate with a half of avocado. They serve it with grilled meats of all varieties. 

P.S.: Some varient recipes have the coconut meat cooked brown with olive oil before adding the coconut milk and water.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A Brief History of the Homebuilt Teardrop Trailer'''

	“America’s homes are rolling . . Seven years ago, trailers in which you could live as you traveled were virtually unknown .&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;”  This statement was published in 1936.  It establishes the beginning of the travel trailer craze that is still going on today.  As for the start of homebuilt teardrop trailer craze, well, that is a bit hazier.

	In the same article as above it is stated, “the typical trailer of today is a one-room affair with the kitchen usually as part of the combination living-dining room. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;”  This almost sounds like it could be a teardrop trailer, but maybe not quite.  The article goes on to talk about the cost of purchasing a travel trailer and even shows pictures of two teardrops with the following caption: “A ‘teardrop’ trailer designed to accommodate two persons. Below, one of the small units that have cooking facilities at rear. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;” This establishes the existence of teardrop trailers in 1936.  It does not establish whether these teardrops were home built or commercially built.

	Another article published in 1936 specifically addresses the construction of a teardrop trailer. This may be the first article ever written on how to build a teardrop trailer.  It is called “The Ideal Outdoorman’s Trailer &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;” and is the first part of a two part series.  The trailer developed in this article is identical to many of the renovations seen on the road today.

Moving along to 1937 “The Ideal Outdoorman’s Trailer &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;” continues to finishing and equipping the trailer.  “With the chassis and sleeping compartment built according to the instructions and drawings given last month, we are now ready to start on the kitchenette of lightweight trailer.  The general dimensions of the extremely compact and convenient kitchenette are given. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;”  Amazingly, at least to us in the 21st century, the trailer is built out of plywood, calls out for a built-in water tank and ice box yet accommodates for the use of a ready-made ice box.  Do you suppose that ready-made was one of the original Colemans?  Reading on you get the feeling that this trailer was meant to be made today yet the plans were published so many years ago.  

Also in 1937 another article on building a teardrop can be found.  Although technically this is about a utility trailer it is still a teardrop. It proves that people were thinking about building teardrop trailers.  The unique thing about this trailer is that it is a uni, i.e. a one wheel trailer.  “Designed especially for sportsmen and light delivery use this single wheel trailer is well suited for hauling moderate loads simply by clamping it to the rear bumper of the car. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;”

The significance of this article is that it establishes the fact that uni-wheel trailers existed in 1937.  This substantiates the claim made by the ebay seller of the below trailer:

 
Uni-trailer found on ebay

[[Image:1936 Uni-Wheel Teardrop.jpg‎]]

He states, “Here is a really unique and very rare trailer that I bought from a gentleman who is in his eighties. He told me his father built it back during the depression and moved out west here in Oregon in it. It has been awhile since I talked with him about the history of the trailer, but if I remember right he built it from scratch with this very unique and rare design. The trailer has one swivel wheel with very unique and retro rubber covered coiled band springs and two ball hitches that mount to the bumper of the towing vehicle so it becomes part of the vehicle and the whole thing stays straight with the vehicle, the wheel under the trailer turns not the trailer itself, this makes it very easy to back, it can't Jack Knife on you! it sounds like it had quite a history and held everything he needed to camp in while he traveled across the country looking for work, a real Grapes of Wrath story. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;”
 
Another view

Also, Boone states, “Four workmen engaged in constructing a gas line in the Middle West save rent as they move from job to job by ‘hatching’ in their trailer.  Instead of paying rent of sixty dollars or more a month, they live in their trailer for less than five dollars.  Elsewhere, families beat the high cost of living as they follow seasonal occupations. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;”  This corroborates the ebay seller’s story and introduces another use of teardrop trailers that most people may have not have thought of.  Of course if the trailer was going to be used to save money it must have been home built.

	Around 1939 home built teardrop trailer construction started to heat up, as well as for other travel trailers.  Around this time period a designer named Jim Dandy started selling plans for travel trailers.  One of these was a teardrop.  His goal was to make the construction very simple.  He states, “Just an ordinary kit of tools and a little skill in handling them are all you need to build the ‘Cruiser’. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;”  Many of these home built trailers were made.

	Also in 1939 Hi Sibley was at it again with his “Honeymoon House Trailer” article published in Popular Home Craft.  Hi doesn’t take credit for designing the trailer and states, “This trim little trailer, designed by Louis Rogers of Pasadena for his wedding trip, has proved its practicability in long service on the road. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;”  With a second article published in a two year period it can be seen that there was much building activity going on.  One author was certainly taking advantage of it.  This later trailer is very similar to the trailer in the 1937 article.  The theme of the story changed but the design didn’t.  Obviously the public felt that “you don’t need to fix what ain’t broke.”

	More evidence of interest in building teardrop-like trailers at home is shown by the 1940 article in Mechanix Illustrated: “A Model Airplane Trailer.” It exemplifies the theme of a cheap and easy build. “A trailer for the purpose of carrying model airplanes can be built at a considerably lower figure than those commonly used for camping or traveling.  Any old automobile frame from a light or medium weight car will make an excellent chassis. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;”  Obviously this wasn’t the only thing about the design that the airplane model enthusiasts must have liked.  They must have also like the aerodynamic shape and streamlining that they thought about when they built their models.

	From 1940 to 1946 there is no history/articles about building teardrop trailers.  It can be presumed that World War II had an impact on this period where not many people thought about building a teardrop trailer.

However, “Then in October of 1945, C.W. “Bill” Worman and Andy Anderson formed Kit Manufacturing Co. in an abandoned fruit stand on Telegraph Road in Norwalk, California to produce “Kit Kamper” Tear Drop Trailers. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;”  This was the start of commercially produced teardrop trailers.  Kit Manufacturing is still in business today but it doesn’t produce a teardrop trailer. We won’t take this string any further as this article is the history of home built trailers.  

	Other 1946 activity was seen in the March and April issues of Popular Science in a two part article on “Building and Finishing Your Weekend Trailer.”  “Part I covered the construction of the chassis, walls, and chimes.  The next step is to stud the sides. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;” While this is not a teardrop trailer in that it has a kitchen in the back under a separate hatch formed to match the roofline but it does have a teardrop shape.  This trailer has all the amenities inside and provides standing headroom.  It shows a trend on how people were starting build their teardrops just a little bit bigger.  

	Then in 1947 the article that gets credit for starting the teardrop trailer mania was published.  It was called the “Trailer for Two” and was published in the September issue of Mechanix Illustrated.  If you look at the article you will see that Hi Sibley was at it again, this being his third teardrop trailer construction article.  This time he starts, “Getting away from it all doesn’t mean giving up the comforts of home, for with this compact camp trailer you bring them right along with you.  As it’s only a fraction of the size and weight of a full-grown trailer, you can take this 10-ft. tourer wherever a car will go. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;”  Ok, you make your own judgment here as to if this is truly the article that started it all.  I believe that Hi Sibley certainly did his share of starting the fire a few years earlier than this.

	Continuing with the trend towards a bigger teardrop that seemed to start around the time of the 1946 Popular Science article, another larger teardrop was introduced in the Popular Home Craft February 1951 issue.  The “Wander Pup” article was written by John Gartner.  Do you remember this name?  Do you see the similarity with the design from 1946?  This time Mr. Gartner states, “WANDER PUP licks the one big bug-aboo of trailers – excess weight. &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;”  You need to go back and compare the two Gartner trailers.  I think we found another designer that found a way to capitalize on his design.

	With another design very similar to Wander Pup, this March 1951 author, Clinton R. Hull, in Mechanix Illustrated says, “Li’l Guy was made because I could find no factory job light enough, or one that would enter the average garage. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;  In addition to the slightly large size, weight is also emphasized.  So now it seems that what people want to build is a larger and lighter trailer.  We can see that builders are drifting away from the small teardrop with the kitchen in the back.

	Or, perhaps not.  Perhaps the larger trailers were just a trend.  In the April 1953 issue of Popular Mechanics, Vic Goertzen introduces the “Wild Goose.”  Wild Goose is the origins of the Kampmaster, a commercially produced teardrop trailer that opens up via the back, or what would be the kitchen hatch on the smaller teardrops.  Vic describes his trailer, “Overnight campers, hunters, fishermen, and vacationers with limited time can appreciate the convenience, comfort and ready roadability of ‘Wild Goose.’  Hung low to the ground, yet with ample road clearance for the back trails, it tows anywhere your car will go.  Keep it packed with necessary bedding, also canned and dried foods and you can get away for a week-end trip in only a few minutes’ time.  When you arrive at the destination, Wild Goose sets up into a neat outdoor ‘kitchenette’ in less time than it takes to put up a tent. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;” 

	The last article that can be found about building teardrop trailers was published twice.  First in the August 1956 issue of Mechanix Illustrated, next in Volume 4, 1961 issue of Mechanix Illustrated How-To-Do-It Encyclopedia.  Called “Camp Trailer” this was a traditional teardrop except it had a squared off back, very similar to the “Tiny Tears” teardrop.  “Mr. Art Harvey of Brockway, Pa., . . . takes off . . . pulling a camp trailer – one that he has constructed in his spare time. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;”  This trailer was 10’ long and 4’ wide.  The article claims that the whole family can camp inside.  

	After this last article there is an apparent lack of articles or building activity for teardrop trailers.  You can be sure there was activity though, especially in California, but it was minimal and in small pockets of areas.  There was one periodical publication about teardrop trailers being published.  That publication is still being distributed today, to more and more people.  

	Around 1996 though, the World Wide Web was beginning to become very active.  Home builders began to post websites about the trailer they built.  It was this time, in 1998, that “Tiny Tears” had its beginnings.  It posted its original website and started the first teardrop bulletin board.  It was also in this time period that so many others posted their websites and created their bulletin boards.  The history of the homebuilt teardrop trailer now swamped the public.  TV shows were even made.  With all this activity, and information that is easily obtained for free, one doesn’t see articles in national magazines any more.  Building information is found in a growing number of plans distributors and on the World Wide Web.  And, it is there that a person should go to learn the detailed modern history of the homebuilt teardrop trailer.

It has been quite a long time of being inactive, but I am slowly coming back. I am re-learning Chechen and will contribute my time here on Wikibooks in editing the Chechen book that I started and so glad to see Wiki in action and many moer people contributing to it and even using it. It is great too to search &quot;Chechen language&quot; and see our Wikibooks: Chechen book appear. :) 

I am a graduate from the University of Iceland in linguistics and languages. I am helping out in designing the Chechen, Icelandic, Manx, the Rodriguan Creole wikibooks. My main interests are in Caucasian languages (Caucasionology) and Celtic languages (Celticology?) :). ^^

Leave me a message! I love getting Wikimessages on my Discussion page.

== Projects ==
* [[Chechen]] &lt;small&gt;'''25%'''&lt;/small&gt;
* [[Icelandic]] &lt;small&gt;'''17%'''&lt;/small&gt;
* [[Manx]] &lt;small&gt;'''10%'''&lt;/small&gt;
* [[Rodriguan Creole]] &lt;small&gt;'''0%'''&lt;/small&gt;

'''Fantastic Friends'''
 
Health Education Standards

National Health Standards:
•NHES 4: Students will be able to demonstrate the ability to use interpersonal communication skills to enhance health and avoid or reduce health risks. (Through the use of I-messages and active listening in a classroom community circle).
•NHES 8: Students will demonstrate the ability to advocate for personal, family, and community health. (By identifying characteristics that make a good friend and by developing a list of these characteristics).

State Health Standards:
•Describe characteristics needed to be a responsible friend and family member.
•Demonstrate ways to communicate care, consideration, and respect of self and others.

Performance Indicators

•Identify characteristics needed to be a responsible friend.
•Demonstrate ways to communicate care, consideration, and respect of others.

Health Goals

•I will get along with my friends and classmates.
•I will show how to be a good friend and show respect to others.

Materials

Chart paper; Markers; Notebook paper (for students); Pencil (for students); Variety of fresh fruit; 1 very old rotten banana; Cool Whip; Large bowl; Large spoon (for mixing); Small bowls (one for each student); Plastic spoons (one for each student)

Motivation

1.Set up the chart paper and create a community circle.  In the community circle, the students will be using I-messages to communicate their feelings clearly.  Explain to the class that only the person holding the selected item is aloud to speak.  Everyone else must show active listening.  
2.Model the prompt “I feel a good friend is someone who is”, have each students take a turn finishing the prompt.  As a characteristic is listed, write it on the chart paper for all the students to see.
3.After the community circle is finished, make friendship salad.  
4.Directions for Friendship Salad
•Take the big mixing bowl and explain to the class that the bowl represents the class as a whole.
•As the fruit is added, explain that the fruit represents all of the positive characteristics listed on the chart paper from the community circle.
•Add the cool whip explaining that it is the “glue” holding the classroom together.
•Talk about how yummy the fruit salad will be.
•Take out the very old rotten banana.  Ask class if the banana should be added. (Take a class vote to NOT add the banana).
•Explain that the rotten banana represents the put downs and the negativity in the classroom, that is why it is not be added into the friendship salad.
•Dish out the friendship salad into bowls to pass out to students and enjoy!
5.While students are enjoying friendship salad, have them write a friendly note to a neighbor (in the classroom).  Have the students write to the recipient either a compliment or how they have been a good friend.  
6.As a wrap-up, call the students back into a community circle.  Model, then have each student finish the prompt “I can be a good friend by…”  Write this prompt and characteristics on another piece of chart paper for all the students to see. 
  
Evaluation

Have each student write on a piece of notebook paper two sentences.  The first sentence explaining what it means to be a good friend.  The second sentence should explain how to be a good friend to others.  Have the children draw a picture to correspond with the sentences.  Have the children hand in the paper for the teacher to review that they understood the health goal and met the performance indicators.

To make churri for 4 people we need:

==Ingredients==
* 3 deciliter of natural yoghurt
* 3 deciliter of buttermilk
* 2 cm of fresh ginger root
* 2 fresh green chilli-peppers
* 1 teaspoon of cumin seed
* 10 grams of fresh mint
* 15 grams of fresh coriander leaves
* 1 chopped onion
* a pinch of salt

==Procedure==
# Put 1 teaspoon of cumin seed into a pan and roast them.
# Grind the roasted cumin seeds with a mortar. 
# Chop 10 grams of fresh mint, 15 grams of fresh coriander leaves, 2 cm of peeled ginger and the 2 fresh chilli pepper. Grind into a paste.
#Add the yoghurt, butter milk and salt and make sure everything gets mixed up well. 
#Add the onion and the roasted and ground cumin seeds.

== Vegetarian Churri ==
Please look at [[Cookbook:Substitutions]] on how to replace the animal sourced ingredients (yoghurt made from cow milk and buttermilk) with vegetarian replacements.

== Knots ==

Hi KVDP,

I just noticed your page [[Simplified list of knots]], and thought you might like to know about some [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Knot_Tying|related work]] I have done on Wikibooks.  I have subpages for each knot that get transcluded into many chapters of [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] (Adventist Youth is a scouting organization affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church).  Right now these sub-pages are organized and stored under the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Knot]] hierarchy, but we could move them into something more generic (such as [[Knots]]) if you think that would be useful.  I also developed [[Template:Knot]] that you might want to check out. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:54, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

==Original Research==

Hello KVDP,

I just wanted to check that you had read [[WB:WIW |what is wikibooks]]?  Specifically the section on [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks_is_not_a_place_to_publish_original_works | original research]].  Some of the books you have created seem to be original designs for things which you have craeted.  These are not suitable for wikibooks which is a place for textbooks.  Thanks. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:00, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
:The problem is that the designs are original work rather than a textbook about a already established subject.  You may find that wikiversity is a better place for these (though you would need to check with somebody there first as I am no expert on what is allowed there).  I'm afraid I'm not sure how we could turn these into a textbook so they could remain here as they are very much your own original ideas.  On one page you state &lt;i&gt;&quot;One must keep in mind that this document (atleast at present: August 2008) only reflects my own research and beliefs&quot;&lt;/i&gt;.  So I am sorry but I think that these particular pages will be deleted.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:20, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
::What about the &quot;Juridical national measures on climate change&quot; and Juridical national measures on transport, ... pages ? Those are not models. Don't they suffice ? If so, please remove the template.

PS: I already tried one of my models at wikiversity. I'll see whether that 'll work. If the national measures book is also no good, perhaps I can upload it there too ?[[User:KVDP|KVDP]] ([[User talk:KVDP|talk]]) 09:31, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
:Sorry but those pages are still original research. You even say so on the top of them. &lt;i&gt;&quot;only reflects my own research&quot;&lt;/i&gt; --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 11:27, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
:OK, no problem. I just heard it can be put at wikiversity so that's solved anyhow. Can you tell me the template for deletion of the page ?
[[User:KVDP|KVDP]] ([[User talk:KVDP|talk]]) 06:14, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
::Looks like you worked it out.  I've deleted those pages now.  Glad you have found a home for them at Wikiversity, they do look interesting, just not suiatble for here.  Thanks for sorting this out.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 07:36, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
::Don't mention it, I am as happy about it as you are, i'm now able to share my work with others better (more widely available now) :-)

[[Image:Garammasalaphoto.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Garam masala]]
'''Garam masala''', literally &quot;hot spice&quot; in Hindi, is a term for a mixture of spices used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cooking]]. Many commercial brands are available, but keen cooks can grind and blend their own. This ensures freshness and means you have control over the quality and quantities of the individual spices. There is no one 'official' recipe and many Indian families have their own variety. Make your choice from the list of spices below, and grind them together with a pestle and mortar, spice mill (or pepper mill), or electric coffee grinder. Make small quantities, and store in an airtight container for no more than six months.

Traditional ingredients:
*[[Cookbook:Cardamom|Black or green cardamom]]
*[[Cookbook:Cinnamon|Cinnamon]] sticks
*[[Cookbook:Clove|Whole cloves]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Black peppercorns]] 
*[[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin]] seeds, toasted
*[[Cookbook:Nutmeg|Nutmeg]]

Other common ingredients:
*Bay leaves  
*[[Cookbook:Fennel|Fennel]] seeds
*[[Cookbook:Coriander|Coriander]] seed, toasted

==Recipe==
Yield: 460 grams (ca. 1 lb.)

===Ingredients===

* 15 grams dried [[Cookbook:Bay leaf|bay leaves]]
* 75 grams [[Cookbook:Cardamom|black cardamom seeds]]
* 40 grams [[Cookbook:Cardamom|green cardamom seeds]]
* 20 sticks [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], 2.5 [[Cookbook:Centimeter|cm.]] in length
* 20 grams [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* 35 grams [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seeds]]
* 20 grams [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
* 90 grams [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
* 25 grams [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel seeds]]
* 15 grams [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger powder]]
* 20 grams [[Cookbook:Mace|mace]]
* 70 grams [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
* 15 grams rose leaves

===Procedure===

*Keep in an airtight jar in a cool, dark, place and grind prior to use.
*Note that all ingredients can be roasted except the dry ginger, till they turn a few shades darker. Leave the cardamom in their pods until later.
*Do not be tempted to speed up the process by turning up the heat as the spices will burn on the outside and remain raw on the inside. 
*When the spices are roasted turn off the flame and allow them to cool. 
*After the cardamom pods have cooled, crack them open and remove the cardamom seeds and mix them with the other roasted spices.

Paneer is a fresh curd cheese of Indian origin made by curdling milk with an acid and pressing out the water and whey. 

To make paneer for 4 people, we need:
==Ingredients==
* 3 liters of milk
* 6 tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar
==Procedure==
#Bring 3 liters of milk to a boil in a large pan.
#Add, just before the milk starts to boil, the lemon juice or vinegar to coagulate the milk.
#Pour the coagulated milk through a cheese cloth to discard most of the water within.
#Press the water out firmly and place a weight on top of the paneer.
#Allow to rest and harden for 2-3 hours in the refrigerator.

Sometimes the hardening in the refrigerator may not work. You may find that the paneer may breakdown into small granules while cooking. The alternate way to make it firm is by steaming it for about 15 minutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|Active Server Pages|Functions and Subroutines|Server-Side Includes}}

= Objectives =

This describes database '''connectivity''' with ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) and how you can use this to communicate and manage a database server.  You will learn how to open a connection to a database, run '''INSERT''', '''UPDATE''', '''DELETE''', and '''SELECT''' statements as well as execute a stored procedure.

= Content =

Active Server Pages, being a scripted language, is a stateless language.  By this, we mean that it doesn't preserve the state of the application between page loads.  Nearly all ASP hosting solutions will include some sort of database hosting.  Most common is MySQL, followed by Microsoft SQL Server.  No matter what database you are using, ADO will allow you to manage the database through Active Server Pages.

While it's true that you can store persistant data in the &lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; object.  This is basically just stored in a memory cache that will be flushed whenever IIS or the server is restarted.  It also causes problems when trying to create an application which will be used in a server cluster (where each cluster has its own version of the Application cache.)

== Connecting to a Database ==

Here is a sample showing how to open a connection to a database.  To do this, we call the '''Server.CreateObject''' to create an instance of the built-in ADODB Connection object.  Not only is this used to create the initial connection to the database, it will also be used to create the '''Recordset''' and '''Command Objects''' later.

You will need to replace the text '''mysqluser''', '''mysqlpass''', and '''mysqldbname''' with the correct values for your database.  Note that this is accessing a MySQL server on the local server ('''localhost''') using ODBC.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
' create a connection object
Set oConnection = Server.CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;)

' open a connection to a data source
oConnection.Open &quot;Driver={MySQL ODBC 3.51 Driver};server=localhost;port=3306;uid=mysqluser;pwd=mysqlpass;database=mysqldbname;Option=16384&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that you could wrap this statement with an '''On Error''' block to trap any exceptions that may occur.

== INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE ==

The following will use the '''ADODB.Connection''' object to run an '''INSERT''' query on the database.  The code is the same whether you are doing '''INSERT''', '''UPDATE''', or '''DELETE'''.  You only need to change the ''sQuery'' variable with your modified query.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
' build the query to run
sQuery =&quot;INSERT INTO Company VALUES (&quot;Microsoft&quot;)&quot;

' execute the insert statement
oConnection.Execute sQuery, nRecordsAffected, adCmdText + adExecuteNoRecords

Response.Write &quot;Records Affected: &quot; &amp; nRecordsAffected
&lt;/source&gt;

The constants '''adCmdText''' and '''adExecuteNoRecords''' are described in the section '''ADO Constants'''.

== SELECT ==

The following code can be used to run a '''SELECT''' statement against a database. You must first open a connection to a database using the code described in the section '''Connecting to a Database'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
sQuery = &quot;SELECT companyid, companyname FROM tblCompany&quot;

' create the recordset object to hold the result sets
Set rs = Server.CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Recordset&quot;)

' set the number of records to fetch into memory at once (performance)
rs.CacheSize = 256

' execute the query and populate the recordset 
rs.Open sQuery, oConnection, adOpenKeySet, adLockReadOnly, adCmdText

'More examples of SELECT (based on criteria) are:
'*example 1.
sQuery = &quot;SELECT companyid, companyname FROM tblCompany WHERE companyid = 1&quot; '1. See details below
&lt;/source&gt;
*1. When sQuery in above code snippet is set as example 1. it will fetch records with companyid having value 1, in this SQL statement WHERE clause is used to define that criteria.

The constants '''adOpenKeySet''', '''adLockReadOnly''', and '''adCmdText''' are described in the section '''ADO Constants'''.  Now that you have opened a recordset, what can you do with it?

=== Retrieving the Recordset ===

The following code will show you how to use the recordset object ('''rs''') described in the '''SELECT''' section to retrieve values from your database query.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
' EOF checks for the end of a recordset
If Not rs.EOF Then
	' The Fields collection accesses fields from a single record
	sFirstName = rs.Fields(&quot;firstname&quot;).Value
	
	' You can enumerate all fields in the record
	For Each oFld In rs.fields
		Response.Write &quot;Field = &quot; &amp; oFld.Name &amp; &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;
		Response.Write &quot;Value = &quot; &amp; oFld.Value &amp; &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;
	Next
End If
		
' You can also loop through all records
Do Until rs.EOF
	Response.Write &quot;Name = &quot; &amp; rs.Fields(&quot;firstname&quot;).Value &amp; &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;
	' make sure you don't forget this next step
	' MoveNext will move to the next record in the resultset
	rs.MoveNext
Loop

' following is always a good idea to clean up resources ASAP
rs.Close : rs = 0
&lt;/source&gt;

== Closing a Database Connection ==

You should always close your database connection when you are done accessing the database.  It is not required, but it is always a good idea.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
' it's a good idea to close your recordset first (if necessary)
rs.Close : rs = 0

' this will close the database connection 
oConnection.Close
&lt;/source&gt;

Using ADODB is the ideal way to connect to a database through Active Server Pages.  ADODB utilizes '''ODBC''' or '''OLE DB''' technologies to connect to a database depending on the connection string you use when using the '''ADODB.Connection::Open''' method.  The most efficient method of access is '''OLE DB'''.

You may choose to create a database library code to simplify the task of working with a database.  You can create a database class which manages all the tasks of communicating with a database.  Combine this with database configuration settings stored in a '''global.asa''' file, and you will have a quick yet powerful way of executing database queries.

Make sure to make use of the ADO Constants to make the most efficient use of the ADO methods and your database server.  The examples above should give you everything you need to work with a database.

= Review Questions =

* What does ADO stand for?
* Which object is used to connect to a database?
* What method do you use to connect to a database?
* Which object do you need to retrieve results from '''SELECT'''?
* How do you retrieve the value of a field from the current record?
* How do you enumerate all fields from a record
* How do you close a connection to a database

= Exercises =

* Write the code to run an '''INSERT''', '''UPDATE''', or '''DELETE''' query
* Write the code to execute a stored procedure?
* Write the code to execute a '''SELECT''' statement and read its results

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]

      <comment>/* Mapping the bus stops */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the UK, the XML standard for the exchange of timetable information is [http://www.transxchange.org.uk/   TransXchange].  The location of, for example, bus stops, is expressed in Northings and Easting on the UK National Grid.   To plot these on, say , Google Maps requires these coordinates to be transformed into latitude and longitude using the WGS84 datum.

== TransXChange ==

Here is an extract from the beginning of a typical timetable document showing a single StopPoint definition:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;TransXChange xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xmlns:apd=&quot;http://www.govtalk.gov.uk/people/AddressAndPersonalDetails&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.transxchange.org.uk/&quot; xsi:SchemaLocation=&quot;http://www.transxchange.org.uk/ TransXChange_general.xsd&quot; CreationDateTime=&quot;2006-12-07T14:47:00-00:00&quot; ModificationDateTime=&quot;2006-12-07T14:47:00-00:00&quot; Modification=&quot;new&quot; RevisionNumber=&quot;0&quot; FileName=&quot;SVRSGAO070-20051210-5580.xml&quot; SchemaVersion=&quot;2.1&quot; RegistrationDocument=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    &lt;StopPoints&gt;
        &lt;StopPoint CreationDateTime=&quot;2006-12-07T14:47:00-00:00&quot;&gt;
            &lt;AtcoCode&gt;0100BRP90340&lt;/AtcoCode&gt;
            &lt;NaptanCode&gt;BSTGAJT&lt;/NaptanCode&gt;
            &lt;Descriptor&gt;
                &lt;CommonName&gt;Rupert Street (CA)&lt;/CommonName&gt;
                &lt;Landmark&gt;NONE&lt;/Landmark&gt;
                &lt;Street&gt;Rupert Street&lt;/Street&gt;
                &lt;Crossing&gt;Colston Avenue&lt;/Crossing&gt;
            &lt;/Descriptor&gt;
            &lt;Place&gt;
                &lt;NptgLocalityRef&gt;N0076879&lt;/NptgLocalityRef&gt;
                &lt;Location&gt;
                    &lt;Easting&gt;358664&lt;/Easting&gt;
                    &lt;Northing&gt;173160&lt;/Northing&gt;
                &lt;/Location&gt;
            &lt;/Place&gt;
            &lt;StopClassification&gt;
                &lt;StopType&gt;BCT&lt;/StopType&gt;
                &lt;OnStreet&gt;
                    &lt;Bus&gt;
                        &lt;BusStopType&gt;MKD&lt;/BusStopType&gt;
                        &lt;TimingStatus&gt;OTH&lt;/TimingStatus&gt;
                        &lt;MarkedPoint&gt;
                            &lt;Bearing&gt;
                                &lt;CompassPoint&gt;N&lt;/CompassPoint&gt;
                            &lt;/Bearing&gt;
                        &lt;/MarkedPoint&gt;
                    &lt;/Bus&gt;
                &lt;/OnStreet&gt;
            &lt;/StopClassification&gt;
            &lt;AdministrativeAreaRef&gt;010&lt;/AdministrativeAreaRef&gt;
        &lt;/StopPoint&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Coordinate transformation ==

Transformation from OS National Grid Coordinates to WSG84 latitudes and longitudes used in GoogleMaps requires two kinds of transformation:
* between latitude and longitudes on an ellipsoidal model of the Earth and the Transverse Mercator projection used for the OS 
* between the latitude/longitude coordinates based on on different ellipsoids used in the OS coordinates and the global WGS84 coordinates.

An XQuery module which contains these functions and other utility functions is available in the [http://code.google.com/p/xquery-examples/ XQuery Examples] Google Code project.

==  Conversion from TransXChange ==
As an example of the use of these functions, the following script converts the StopPoints of a TransXChange file to a simpler format with lat/long coordinates.  Here a local correction is required for more accurate local registration.

&lt;pre&gt;
(:  Transforms the Stopcodes in a TransXchange file to a simpler format with National grid references converted to latitude and longitude :)
declare namespace tx=&quot;http://www.transxchange.org.uk/&quot;;

import module namespace geo=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/geo&quot; at &quot;../lib/geo.xqm&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize  &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml highlight-matches=none&quot;;
declare function local:camelCase($s) {
 string-join(
     for $word in tokenize($s,' ')
     return concat(upper-case(substring($word,1,1)), lower-case(substring($word,2))),
     ' ')
};

&lt;StopPointSet&gt; 
    {for $stopCode in distinct-values(//tx:StopPoint/tx:AtcoCode)
     let $stop := (//tx:StopPoint[tx:AtcoCode=$stopCode])[1]
     let $d := $stop/tx:Descriptor
     let $l := $stop/tx:Place/tx:Location
      return 
        &lt;StopPoint&gt;
             &lt;AtcoCode&gt;{string($stop/tx:AtcoCode)}&lt;/AtcoCode&gt;
             &lt;CommonName&gt;{string($d/tx:CommonName)}&lt;/CommonName&gt;
             {if ($d/tx:Landmark ne 'NONE') 
              then &lt;LandMark&gt;{local:camelCase($d/tx:Landmark)}&lt;/LandMark&gt;
              else ()
            }
            &lt;Street&gt;{local:camelCase($d/tx:Street)}&lt;/Street&gt;
            &lt;Crossing&gt;{local:camelCase($d/tx:Crossing)}&lt;/Crossing&gt;
            {geo:round-LatLong(geo:OS-to-LatLong(geo:Mercator($l/tx:Easting, $l/tx:Northing)),6)}
       &lt;/StopPoint&gt;
    }
&lt;/StopPointSet&gt;

=== Output === 

The output of this transformation contains StopPoints  e.g. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
    &lt;StopPoint&gt;
        &lt;AtcoCode&gt;0170SGP90690&lt;/AtcoCode&gt;
        &lt;CommonName&gt;Coldharbour Lane&lt;/CommonName&gt;
        &lt;Street&gt;Coldharbour Lane&lt;/Street&gt;
        &lt;Crossing&gt;Filton Road&lt;/Crossing&gt;

        &lt;geo:LatLong xmlns:geo=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/geo&quot; latitude=&quot;51.503924&quot; longitude=&quot;-2.544798&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/StopPoint&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Mapping the bus stops ==

One application of this data would be to plot the stops within a given range of a location.  This requires a distance calculation which is good enough for small distances :

&lt;pre&gt;

declare function geo:plain-distance ($f, $s as element(geo:LatLong))  as xs:double {
   let $longCorr := math:cos(math:radians(($f/@latitude +$s/@latitude) div 2))
   let $dlat :=  ($f/@latitude - $s/@latitude) * 60
   let $dlong := ($f/@longitude - $s/@longitude) * 60 * $longCorr
   return math:sqrt(($dlat * $dlat) + ($dlong * $dlong))
};
    
&lt;/pre&gt;

To generate the kml file:

&lt;pre&gt;

(: return the StopPoints within $range of $latitude and $longitude :)

import module namespace geo=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/geo&quot; at &quot;../lib/geo.xqm&quot;;
import module namespace gmap = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/gmap&quot; at &quot;../lib/gmap.xqm&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize  &quot;method=xhtml media-type=application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml highlight-matches=none&quot;; 

let $latitude := xs:decimal(request:get-parameter(&quot;latitude&quot;, 51.4771))
let $longitude := xs:decimal(request:get-parameter (&quot;longitude&quot;,-2.5886))
let $range := xs:decimal(request:get-parameter(&quot;range&quot;,0.5))
let $focus := geo:LatLong($latitude,$longitude)
let $x := response:set-header('Content-Disposition','attachment;filename=stops.kml;')

return
&lt;Document&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;Bus Stops  within {$range} miles of   {geo:LatLong-as-string($focus)}&lt;/name&gt; 
   &lt;Style id=&quot;home&quot;&gt;
       &lt;IconStyle&gt;
          &lt;Icon&gt;&lt;href&gt;http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/kml/pal2/icon2.png&lt;/href&gt;
        &lt;/Icon&gt;
       &lt;/IconStyle&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
   &lt;Style id=&quot;stop&quot;&gt;
       &lt;IconStyle&gt;
          &lt;Icon&gt;&lt;href&gt;http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/kml/pal5/icon13.png&lt;/href&gt;
        &lt;/Icon&gt;
       &lt;/IconStyle&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;

    &lt;Placemark&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Home&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;Point&gt;
         &lt;coordinates&gt;{gmap:LatLong-as-kml($focus)}&lt;/coordinates&gt;
         &lt;/Point&gt;
         &lt;styleUrl&gt;#home&lt;/styleUrl&gt;
     &lt;/Placemark&gt;
    {  for $stop in doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/geo/stopPoints.xml&quot;)//StopPoint
       let $dist := geo:plain-distance($focus,$stop/geo:LatLong) * 0.868976242 (: distance is in nautical  miles :)
       where $dist &lt; $range  
       return
     &lt;Placemark&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;{string($stop/CommonName)}&lt;/name&gt;
       &lt;description&gt;
         {concat($stop/CommonName,' ',$stop/Landmark,' on ', $stop/Street, ' near ', $stop/Crossing)}  is {geo:round($dist,2)} miles away.
       &lt;/description&gt;
       &lt;Point&gt; 
        &lt;coordinates&gt;{gmap:LatLong-as-kml($stop/geo:LatLong)}&lt;/coordinates&gt;
       &lt;/Point&gt;
       &lt;styleUrl&gt;#stop&lt;/styleUrl&gt;
     &lt;/Placemark&gt;
   }
&lt;/Document&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Stops within half a mile of my home [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/geo/stopsNearbykml.xq  as KML] [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http:%2F%2Fwww.cems.uwe.ac.uk%2Fxmlwiki%2Fgeo%2FstopsNearbykml.xq rendered by GoogleMap].  On GoogleMaps the stops appear to be closely aligned to the bus stop overlay, presumably generated from the same base locations.

== Icons ==

Selecting Icons for kml is eased if you can easily browse them. Here is a simple browser in XQuery:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare variable  $base := &quot;http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/kml/&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;Google Earth icons&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Base url {$base}&lt;/p&gt;
    {for $pal in (2 to 5)
     return
     &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Palette pal{$pal}&lt;/h2&gt;
        {for $i in (0 to 63)
         let $icon := concat('pal',$pal,'/icon',$i,'.png')
         return 
            &lt;img src=&quot;{$base}{$icon}&quot; title=&quot;{$icon}&quot;/&gt;
      } 
     &lt;/div&gt;
    }
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

To make coconut pudding for 6 people, we need:

==Ingredient==

* 4 eggs
* 425 milliliters of thick coconut milk
* 115 grams of sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon of Jasmin water

==Procedure==

#Put eggs, coconut milk, sugar and Jasmin water in a dish and beat until foamy.
#Pour the mixture into a fireproof dish and place on top of a bamboo steam basket.
#Cover the basket and place above a large wok with boiling water. Steam the pudding for 30-40 minutes, or until no longer fluid. If the pudding is boiled too fast, it becomes rubbery.
#Take the pudding out of the steamer and allow to cool.

'''Hake in herby breadcrumbs''' is a fairly simple way of serving [[Cookbook:hake|hake]], or any other white fish. It has a nice crunchy texture and subtle flavours from the herbs and pine nuts. It's easily scalable. The details here are for two servings.

==Ingredients==
*2 fillets of hake (about 100g each)
*1 beaten [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]
*[[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]] juice

''for the breadcrumb mix:''
*1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:bread crumb|breadcrumbs]]
*half a cup of chopped [[Cookbook:herb|herbs]] (parsley, tarragon etc.)
*1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] of [[Cookbook:pine Nut|pine nuts]]
*2 tablespoons of avocado oil (you can use [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]])
*[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
#Preheat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|gas mark 4]]
#Mix together the breadcrumbs ingredients in a food processor, adding the oil last. It should be a slightly moist mixture.
#Dip each fillet in beaten egg, then in the breadcrumb mix. Try to get the fillet evenly coated.

and it will go out quietly,

thanks for this nice tutorial!!

:I think the &lt;tt&gt;print &quot;&quot;,&lt;/tt&gt; might confuse people, so I changed it to a plain &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; statement. It's a bit of a pity having to handle the &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;/tt&gt; choice case in two places here (&lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;elif&lt;/tt&gt;) because we don't know &lt;tt&gt;break&lt;/tt&gt; yet. Apart from that the &lt;tt&gt;elif&lt;/tt&gt; colon was missing. --[[User:Siebengang|Siebengang]] 09:27, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

== Different or more wording needed ==

&quot;Inside of the function a_var is 15 since the function is called with a_func(b_var). Since at that point in time b_var is 15, the call to the function is a_func(15) This ends up setting a_var to 15 when it is inside of a_func.&quot;
:I think this is important enough to be explained in greater detail. --[[User:Charlesrkiss|Charlesrkiss]] 3 April 2008
::I tried to expand upon it somewhat to try and reinforce the point. --[[User:Tehdrago|Tehdrago]] ([[User talk:Tehdrago|talk]]) 15:15, 16 November 2008 (UTC)
:::I do not consider myself a stupid man, and have understood everything so far, but I have been stuck on this for two days. Why does defining C_VAR define a_var? Why does it &quot;recognize&quot; b_var as 15 while previously totally ignoring a_var? Why is a_func(b_var) a legitimate way to define something while the above a_func(a_var) is totally ignored? This is giving me a nosebleed and I can't for the love of God figure it out. Please help.

&quot;When eliminating repeated code, you often have variables in the repeated code.  
In Python, these are dealt with in a special way.&quot;
:I find the wording here a bit confusing, I'm still not sure what was trying to be stated, even after having re-read it several times. --[[User:Tehdrago|Tehdrago]] ([[User talk:Tehdrago|talk]]) 15:15, 16 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Geographic Information Systems]] are an ever increasing branch of geography, and came about with the move from paper maps or cartography to digital maps or databases of geographic information.  These allowed people to start to analyse geographic information far more quickly, and have developed into an industry in its own right.

== Overview ==

'''''Gregorovitch''''' is a wand-maker, possibly equal in ability to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]], who apparently set up shop in the northern part of Eastern Europe.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

At the Weighing of the Wands ceremony, prior to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], Mr. Ollivander is called in to check that the Champions' wands are functioning correctly and up to full power. He recognizes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]]'s wand instantly as a &quot;Gregorovitch creation&quot;.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

After his escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] has &quot;dreams&quot; in which he shares some of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s thoughts. Voldemort is looking for one Gregorovitch. Harry does not immediately remember this name, though it rings faint bells. It is at the wedding of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]], when a disguised Harry is talking to Viktor Krum, that he remembers that Krum's wand was made by Gregorovitch. Krum says that it was one of the last ones made by him, as he had retired.

Harry continues to have dreams about Voldemort's quest for Gregorovitch, including one in which Voldemort questions, and then kills, a woman who dares to say she doesn't know where he went. Finally, Voldemort reaches Gregorovitch, and questions him regarding some item which he supposedly had. Gregorovitch denies having had it, but Voldemort uses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]] to read Gregorovitch's memory of a blond thief who had stolen it from his workshop. We do not see the item that had been stolen. Harry, seeing this memory, believes it must be very small. Having retrieved this memory, Voldemort then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] Gregorovitch.

At the end of the book, it is revealed that the object that Gregorovitch had owned and which had been stolen from him was the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] or the Deathstick, a legendary wand that could not be defeated in a duel. Ollivander tells Harry that Gregorovitch had spread the rumour that he owned this wand and was examining it to determine its secrets, probably in order to enhance his reputation as a wandmaker. The wand was stolen from him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]].

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

It is telling that Ollivander so quickly recognizes Gregorovitch's work, and that he is so well acquainted with Gregorovitch's history. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] makes a comment in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] that leads us to believe that Ollivander is not the only wandmaker, but certainly the best, though we don't ever learn whether this means the best in the world, the best in Britain, or the best in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]]. It is true that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] both seem to take some pride in having received wands from Ollivander's. Based on that analysis, we can guess that Ollivander is likely at the top of his profession, in London at the very least, and thus his ready knowledge of Gregorovitch and his efforts would indicate that Gregorovitch equally is a master wandmaker for Eastern Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pachycephalosaurus was a dinosaur which lived in the late Cretaceous period in North America.  It gave it's name to a group of dinosaurs called the Pachycephalosauridae.  It is most famous for its oddly-shaped head, which has a very unique look.[[Image:Pachycephalosaurus.jpg|250px|thumb|Pachycephalosaurus Drawing]]

=== Anatomy ===
Pachycephalosaurus was a dome-headed dinosaur. Its huge head housed an incredibly thick skull, a tiny brain, and large eyes. Its rounded skull was up to 10 inches thick (25 cm). 

Pachycephalosaurus grew to be about 15 feet long (4.6 m) and may have weighed roughly 950 pounds (430 kg). Pachycephalosaurus probably had a good sense of smell. It had bumpy knobs on its snout and along the rear of its skull. This plant-eater had short forelimbs and a stiff tail (which had a distinctive mesh of interwoven tendons surrounding its rear portion). 

=== What did they look like? ===
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
The Pachycephalosaurus was 15-16 feet long.  It stood on two legs and had two short arms with five fingers each.  However, the most notable thing about its appearance was the large dome on top of its head.  This skull was almost a foot thick.  It was covered with armor and spikes.

=== What did they eat? ===
The Pachycephalosaurus was a vegetarian, despite its intimidating appearance.  From its teeth, we have been able to get a good idea of the diet it ate.  It is believed to have eaten mostly tough plants, but also sometimes fruit and seeds.

=== When did they live? ===
Pachycephalosaurus lived from about 70 to 65 million years ago (Cretaceous) in the Mezezoic era.  It was among the last of the dinosaurs to evolve.  Like all other dinosaurs that lived at the same time as it, it became extinct about 65 million years ago because of an unknown cause.

=== How did they move? ===
Pachycephalosaurus walked on two legs, and was not a very fast dinosaur. When it walked or ran, it probably held its back level to the ground. It may have gone on all fours to forage for low-lying plants. 

=== What was their habitat? ===
The Pachycephalosaurus was the dinosaur equivalent of many large vegetarians today.  It is believed that they lived in forests and ate there.

=== Where were their fossils found? ===
Pachycephalosaurus was discovered in 1938 by William Winkley on the family ranch outside of Ekalaka, Montana, USA. It was named Pachycephalosaurus in 1943 by Barnum Brown and Erich M. Schlaikjer. Although complete fossils are rare, many thick skull fragments have been found.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction to Heat Transfer'''

This book deals with heat transfer in the engineering context, particularly for chemical and mechanical engineers.  It includes the basic physics and technology which is used for heating and cooling in industry.  Of course, the principles may be applied in other fields if appropriate, and engineers may deal with new technology quite unlike traditional ones.  It is intended as a beginning text for first or second year engineering degree students.

If you add to or amend this (and you are most welcome) please do so either by careful reference to an authoritative textbook, or on the basis of your trustworthy professional experience, if you have this.

Here is a quick run through some basics, which will be covered in more detail in subsequent chapters.

===Basic Concepts===
Heat transfer in engineering consists of the transfer of ''enthalpy'' because of a ''temperature difference''.  ''Enthalpy'' is the name for heat energy, to distinguish it from other sorts, such as kinetic energy, pressure energy, useful work. '''There has to be a temperature difference, or no heat transfer occurs.''' 

(If we insist on moving enthalpy from a cold body to a hotter one, we will have to do extra work, as in the case of a refrigerator.  This invariably involves some other process, such as mechanical work, and cooling by expansion of gases, but within the overall activity heat transfer always goes from the hotter to the cooler.)

The temperature difference is called the ''driving force''.  Other things being equal, a greater temperature difference will give a greater rate of heat transfer.

===Temperature===
Temperature is an ''intensive'' property: that is it does not depend on the amount of substance.  Thus one kilogram of copper at 80 °C and 12 kg of copper at 80 °C both have the same temperature.  
Note that unless we are dealing with radiated heat, it is not normally necessary to change these values to the Absolute Temperature scale.
The Celsius temperature is simply defined as the number of kelvin above 273.15 K.  If we wish to calculate heat transfer from these blocks of copper to water at 20 °C, it is quite adequate to say the temperature difference is 80 °C - 20 °C = 60 K.  We get the same answer with more effort by saying it is 353 – 293 = 60 K.  (As I am working to the nearest degree, I have omitted the 0.15 K).  Temperatures may be given on the Absolute or Celsius temperature scales, but temperature differences should be given in kelvin.Temperature is also defined as the degree of hotness.It plays important role in the subject of thermodynamics and heat transfer (i.e.in Thermal energy).

===Enthalpy===
Enthalpy is a measure of the total energy stored in a thermodynamic system. It includes the internal energy, which is a function of temperature, and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure.

The enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements, because it simplifies certain descriptions of energy transfer. This is because a change in enthalpy takes account of energy transferred to the environment through the expansion of the system under study.

Enthalpy is a state property: the enthalpy of a system depends on measurable properties of the system, but not on the history of the system.

Enthalpy is an ''extensive'' property: it depends on the amount of substance.  Thus 12 kg of copper at 80 °C will have 12 times the enthalpy of one kilogram of the same substance at the same temperature.  However, we generally express enthalpy (more properly specific enthalpy) per unit mass.  The unit of measurement for enthalpy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule, but other historical, conventional units are still in use, such as the British thermal unit and the calorie.  The specific enthalpy hence has units of J/kg, or BTU/lb.

The total enthalpy, H, of a system cannot be measured directly. Thus, change in enthalpy, ΔH, is a more useful quantity than its absolute value.  ΔH of a system is equal to the sum of non-mechanical work done on it and the heat supplied to it.  If a body passes from a thermodynamic state A to a thermodynamic state B at the same pressure as A, the heat transferred to the environment is given by:
&lt;math&gt;Q=\Delta H=H_{end}-H_{start}&lt;/math&gt;
Coupled systems, where heat transfer produces changes in pressure or volume (and vice versa) will be treated later in the text.

Tables and graphs are available listing the specific enthalpy of many materials at various thermodynamic states. 

For each table, a reference state is chosen.  The given enthalpy can be understood as the amount of energy which would have to be put into the system to raise it from a ''reference temperature'' (more precisely, a ''reference state'').  For water, a common reference state is 0 °C, atmospheric pressure, with all the water in the liquid phase.

The standard state for copper is solid.  The standard state for oxygen is gas.  As a guide, the standard state is the phase the material would have at normal laboratory conditions of temperature and pressure.  However, various engineering disciplines have their own conventions. 

At 80 °C, water (at atmospheric pressure) has a specific enthalpy of 391.7 kJ/kg.  Therefore one kilogram of liquid water at 80 °C would have an enthalpy of 391.7 kJ, and 7.3 kg would have an enthalpy of 7.3 x 391.7 = 2584 kJ.

There are two components to enthalpy, one due to the temperature, another to the phase.  For example, from the above table, liquid water at 100 °C has a specific enthalpy of 419.1 kJ/kg, but steam at 100 °C has a specific enthalpy of 2675.4 kJ/kg – quite a lot more!  The difference, 2257.9 kJ/kg is the enthalpy which has to be put into water to change it from a liquid to a vapour.  This quantity is called the ''enthalpy of vaporization'' of water, or the ''latent heat'' of steam.  “Latent” means hidden, because the steam is not hotter than the water, but has all this hidden energy to give up if it condenses.

Note that this phenomenon is not restricted to boiling.  Water at a temperature of 37 °C has a specific enthalpy of vaporization of 2414 kJ/kg: this heat is taken up if it evaporates at that temperature, which is why sweating cools you down.

Similarly, when ice at 0 °C melts to water at 0 °C it requires the input of heat to match its ''latent heat of melting'', or ''enthalpy of crystallization''.

Thus (according to this convention) liquid water at 0 °C has zero enthalpy.  Ice at the same temperature has a negative enthalpy.  Other tables may give enthalpy relative to Absolute Zero, 0.0 K, or to a laboratory temperature of 298 K.

Chemical engineers sometimes use the ambient temperature (i.e. the temperature of the surroundings) as a reference condition – perhaps 10 °C in a cold country, 30 °C in a hot country.  This means that all material stored or added to a system at ambient temperature has zero enthalpy and they only have to worry about things that are hotter or colder. This can simplify the energy balance.

===Heat capacity or specific heat===

If we have to heat something up (without a phase change), for example 12 kg of copper from 20 °C to 80 °C, the amount of enthalpy we have to put in depends on three things.  

(1) The temperature difference to be achieved, in this case 60 K.

(2) The mass, in this case 12 kg.

(3) A property of the substance called specific heat capacity, which is a measure of how much energy is required to raise the temperature of 1 kg by 1 K. 

So, we have:
&lt;math&gt;H=mc_p\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;

The subscript &lt;math&gt;_p&lt;/math&gt; remembers that the value of specific heat capacity is valid only if the transformation takes place at constant pressure. In practice, only for gases there's a relevant difference between constant-pressure specific heat and specific heat for other transformations (e.g. constant volume, polythropics...). Solids and liquids have only one value of specific heat capacity. For example, copper has a specific heat capacity of 0.383 kilojoules per kilogram per kelvin (0.383 kJ kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).
Therefore we have to put in 0.383 x 12 x 60 = 276 kJ.

If on the other hand, we had to heat up 12 kg of water from 20 °C to 80 °C, we would use the specific heat capacity of water, 4.184 kJ kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and our calculation would be:
4.184 x 12 x 60 = 3012 kJ.

Note that these terms tend to be used loosely. What is properly the ''specific heat capacity'' is often referred to as the ''specific heat'' or the ''heat capacity''.  If in doubt, look at the units.
Technically the ''heat capacity'' refers to the whole body, the ''specific heat capacity'' to a mass – in the SI system one kilogram.  In thermodynamic tables, data is sometimes given per mole or kilomole instead of per kilogram, especially for gases. You may also come across older data in which the obsolete unit the calorie (= 4.184 J) is used and the mass is one gram.  Sorry, but you will have to convert.  Always look at the units.

The definition of specific heat capacity allows to write, for a pressure-constant transformation:
&lt;math&gt;Q=\Delta H=mc_p\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;

Pressure-constant transformations in heat transfer problems, are often heat exchanges between a fluid and other fluids or solids, e.g. in a heat exchanger. In these cases, mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is not constant, because it's flowing. So, we have to refer not to mass, but to mass flow rate &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt;, and not to energy &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; but to power &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence:

&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}=\dot{m}c_p\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;

====A simple calculation====

Suppose 15 kg of copper at 80 °C is put into a bath of 25 kg of water at 20 °C, and there are no heat losses to the surrounding.  What will be the final condition?

'''Answer''' Both the copper and the water will have the same temperature, somewhere between 20 °C and 80 °C.  The total enthalpy will be unchanged.

Let us take the reference condition as 20 °C.  Thus the water has zero enthalpy, and the copper has 15 x (80-20) x 0.383 = 344.7 kJ.  This is the enthalpy of the system.  

Now the total heat capacity of the system is
(mass x specific heat capacity of copper) + (mass x specific heat capacity of water)
= (15 x 0.383) + (25 x 4.184) = 5.75 + 104.6 = 110.4 kJ K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

In other words, it would take 110.4 kJ of enthalpy to raise the temperature of the whole system by 1 K (= 1°C).

Therefore adding 344.7 kJ of enthalpy would raise the temperature of the system by
344.7 ÷ 110.4 = 3.1 K, so the final temperature would be 23.1 °C.

Looking at this a different way, we can see that the specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 ÷ 0.383 = 10.92 times greater.  Thus 15 kg of copper has the heat capacity of only 15 ÷ 10.92 = 1.37 kg of water. Thus adding this amount of water to 25 kg would dilute the 60 K temperature difference as 60 x 1.37 ÷ 26.37 = 3.1 K.

===Heat Transfer Mechanisms===

There are three modes of Heat Transfer: Conduction, Convection, and Radiation.  Conduction is concerned with the transfer of thermal energy through a material without bulk motion of the material.  This phenomenon is fundamentally a diffusion process that occurs at the microscopic level.  Convection is concerned with the transfer of thermal energy in a moving fluid (liquid or gas).  Convection is characterized by two physical principles, conduction (diffusion) and bulk fluid motion (advection).  The bulk fluid motion can be caused by an external force, for example, a fan, or may be due to buoyancy effects.  Finally, Radiation is the transfer of thermal energy through electro-magnetic waves (or photons).  It is interesting to note that Radiation requires no medium.

==== Conduction ====
Conduction is the diffusion of [[w:thermal energy|thermal energy]], i.e., the movement of thermal energy from regions of higher temperature to regions of lower temperature. On a microscopic level, this occurs due to the passing energy through [[w:molecule|molecular]] [[w:Oscillation|vibrations]].

Rate of Heat transfer is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.  The units of heat transfer rate are [[w:Watt|watt]]s. It should be noted that heat transfer rate is a [[w:Vector (spatial)|vector]] quantity. It is often convenient to describe heat transfer rate in terms of the geometry being studied.  Thus we define &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}'&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}''&lt;/math&gt;,  and &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}'''&lt;/math&gt; as the heat transfer rate per unit [[w:length|length]], [[w:area|area]] (a.k.a. heat flux), and [[w:volume|volume]], respectively.  It is useful to note that different conventions are often used with notation, and heat flux (heat transfer rate per unit area) is often denoted by &lt;math&gt; \dot{q}&lt;/math&gt;.

The governing rate equation for conduction is given by [[w:Heat conduction|Fourier's Law]].  For one dimension, Fourier's law is expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}=-k\frac{dT}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; 


or 


&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}=-kA\frac{dT}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''x'' is the direction of interest, ''A'' is the cross-sectional area normal to x, ''k'' is a proportionality constant known as [[w:thermal conductivity|thermal conductivity]] and &lt;math&gt;\frac{dT}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature gradient at the location of interest. The negative sign indicates that heat is transferred in the direction of decreasing temperature.

The thermal conductivity is a measure of how readily a material conducts heat. Materials with high conductivity, such as metals, will readily conduct heat even at low temperature gradients. Materials with low conductivity, such as [[w:asbestos|asbestos]], will resist heat transfer and are often referred to as [[w:insulator|insulator]]s.

==== Convection ====
Convection is the transfer of thermal energy between a solid and a moving fluid. If the fluid is not in motion (its Nusselt number is 1), the problem can be classified as Conduction.  Convection is governed by two phenomena:  the  movement of energy due to molecular vibrations and the large-scale motion of fluid particles.  In general, Convection is of two types, Forced Convection and Free Convection.

Forced Convection occurs when a fluid is forced to flow.  For example, a fan blowing air over a heat exchanger is an example of Forced Convection.  In Free Convection, the bulk fluid motion is due to buoyancy effects.  For example, a vertical heated plate surrounded by quiescent air causes the air surrounding it to be heated.  Because hot air has a lower density than cold air, the hot air rises.  The void is filled by cold air and the cycle continues.

The governing rate equation for Convection is given by Newton's Law of Cooling:

&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}=hA(T_s-T_\infty),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the heat transfer coefficient, &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; is the surface temperature of the solid, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area and &lt;math&gt;T_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the fluid far from the surface.  This expression, in spite of its name, is not law.  Rather, it is an empirical expression of proportionality of the heat flux and the temperature difference between the solid and the fluid.  The heat transfer coefficient is typically determined by experiment. Correlations for heat transfer coefficient for various kinds of flows have been determined and are documented in literature.

==== Radiation ====
Radiation is the transfer of thermal energy between two objects through electromagnetic waves.
Unlike conduction and convection, radiation does not require a medium; in other words, radiation heat transfer occurs between two bodies without contact between them.  In general, gasses do not take part in radiation heat transfer.

Radiation is based on the fact that all objects of finite temperature, i.e. not absolute zero, emit radiation in the form of electro-magnetic waves.  These waves travel until they impinge another object.  The second object in turn either absorbs, reflects, or transmits the energy.  It should be noted that if the second object is of a finite temperature, it is also emitting radiation.

A basic fact of radiation is that the heat of radiation is proportional to the '''fourth power''' of the temperature of the radiating source. The heat loss is related to the '''emissivity''' ε of the material by the equation:

&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}= A  \epsilon  \sigma  T^4&lt;/math&gt;

An idealized material called a '''black body''' has an emissivity of 1. A is the surface area of the radiating object and sigma, σ, is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant &lt;math&gt; 5.670\cdot10^{-8} W/(m^2 K^4)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Macroscopic Heat Balances'''

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed: doing an energy balance means imposing that the algebraic sum of the following variables is constantly zero in the considered system:

(1) the entering fluxes of heat;

(2) the exiting fluxes of heat;

(3) the electrical and/or mechanical energy generated or consumed by the system;

(4) sources of energy within the system (e.g. dynamite can be considered a source of energy if we analyze the dynamic of an explosion);

(5) sinks of energy within the system (usually the ambient is considered as a sink of energy);

(6) the energy accumulated by the system during time.

When last term is zero, system is called &quot;in steady-state conditions&quot;, or &quot;steady&quot; and its behavior does not depend from time; otherwise, it is called &quot;unstedy&quot; or &quot;transient&quot;.

A macroscopic heat balance is a balance on an entire system, rather than an infinitesimal part of it. The ability to perform a balance on heat comes from the principle of conservation of energy, which tells us that energy is never created or destroyed. Since this is true, we can balance energy in the following manner:

Energy accumulated = Energy in - Energy out

To be completely general, we would have to include all forms of energy and energy changes in this balance: potential energy, kinetic energy, and internal energy, as well as all forms of heat and work. However, if there are heat effects present, and no shaft work is done, heat effects will usually be considerably larger than the effects of volumetric expansion, potential energy and kinetic energy changes, or electrical effects. In this case, the equation simplifies to:

Energy accumulated = Heat in - Heat out

Heat can come into a system either through the enthalpy of a mass stream or through conduction, convection, or radiation from an outside source. Heat leaves a system in the same manner. All accumulated energy will be in the form of internal energy, since potential and kinetic energy are neglected. Hence, the overall heat balance becomes:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dU}{dt}=  \sum_{k=1}^M \dot{m}_k\hat{H}_k + \sum_{j=1}^N \dot{Q}_j&lt;/math&gt;

This balance is useful for determining the total heat transfer necessary to accomplish a given temperature change in a system, since the internal energy and the enthalpy of any pure substance or mixture can be estimated as a function of temperature (given some experimental data) using thermodynamics. This approach does not require one to use the microscopic analysis if the inlet, outlet, and system temperatures are known (and preferably constant). The microscopic approach is useful for determining the temperature distribution and its change with time (if present) so that the temperature, and thus the energy requirements, can be evaluated at all time points.

If the system is at steady state, the accumulation term is zero so 

&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^M \dot{m}_k\hat{H}_k + \sum_{j=1}^N \dot{Q}_j = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that a closed system that does not work will only stay at steady state if no heat is transferred (neglecting potential and kinetic energy differences). This is similar in spirit Newton's first law: if an object is left alone, its velocity won't change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Conduction'''

=== The Conduction Equation ===

By using Fourier's Law to perform a heat balance in three dimensions, the following equation can be derived relating the temperature in the system at a given point to the coordinates of that point and the time elapsed:
:&lt;math&gt;{k}\left({\frac{{\partial ^2}T}{\partial {x^2}}+\frac{{\partial ^2}T}{\partial {y^2}} + \frac{{\partial ^2}T}{\partial {z^2}}}\right) = \rho\cdot C_p \cdot\frac{\partial {T}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;


The derivation assumes there is no heat generation (which is a function of x, y, z and t and must be added if present) and that the material properties don't change with time or temperature (in this case they must be incorporated into the derivatives).

=== Steady-state conduction ===

We have steady-state conduction when none of the terms of the Fourier's law depends on time; so, it is obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;{k}\left({\frac{{\partial ^2}T}{\partial {x^2}}+\frac{{\partial ^2}T}{\partial {y^2}} + \frac{{\partial ^2}T}{\partial {z^2}}}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

==== The Plane Wall ====
Heat transfer through a wall is a one dimensional conduction problem where temperature is a function of the distance from one of the wall surfaces. It is assumed that the rest of the surfaces of the walls are at a constant temperature. Heat transfer from the surfaces of the wall takes place through convection by the surrounding air, which causes them to have steady state temperatures of &lt;math&gt; T_{1} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; T_{2} &lt;/math&gt; on their surfaces. Let us assume that the fluid on the side of the wall with temperature &lt;math&gt; T_{1} &lt;/math&gt; is at &lt;math&gt; T_{1 , \infin} &lt;/math&gt; and has a heat transfer coefficient &lt;math&gt;h_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, and that on the side of the wall with temperature &lt;math&gt;T_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is at &lt;math&gt; T_{2 , \infin} &lt;/math&gt; with heat transfer coefficient &lt;math&gt;h_{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt;T_{1 , \infin} \ge T_{2 , \infin}&lt;/math&gt;. The assumption implies that &lt;math&gt;h_{1} \ge h_{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the wall does not store any heat energy, all the heat from the hotter surface is conducted to the cooler surface. Conservation of energy dictates that

:&lt;math&gt;{{\nabla} ^ 2}T = 0&lt;/math&gt; 

for a body which generates no heat nor stores any heat, because in such a case temperature only varies with position, not with time. Applying the same to the 1-D case with the direction of the x-axis normal to the wall surface, we get

:&lt;math&gt;{-k}{\frac{{d^2}T}{d{x^2}}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

On solving and putting the appropriate boundary conditions, (At x=0, &lt;math&gt;T=T_1&lt;/math&gt; and at x=s, &lt;math&gt;T=T_2&lt;/math&gt;) we get a linear variation for T within the wall thickness &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;T(x) = (T_2 - T_1){\frac{x}{s}} + T_1&lt;/math&gt;

It is evident from the equation that the temperature profile within the wall varies linearly with the distance from the surfaces. Since we have the temperature variation, the conduction rate can be calculated from Fourier's Law.

:&lt;math&gt;{q_s} '' = -k \frac{dT}{dx} = \frac{k}{s} (T_1 - T_2)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen from the above equation that the heat flux is independent of x and are constants. This example shows the standard method of solving a conduction problem. First, the temperature profile within the body is found using the equation for conservation of energy and the temperature equation is used to solve for the heat flux by plugging it into the Fourier's Law equation.

In general, we would like to have a material with very low conductivity which is able to withstand great temperatures to build furnaces.
In practice, we find that high temperature materials have relatively high thermal conductivity.
Thus, furnaces are constructed from several layers, each of a different material.
We can use the thermal breakdown temperatures of each material to find the optimum thickness so that the heat loss is minimal.
It is easy to see that each material should receive heat at its thermal breakdown temperature and reject heat at the thermal breakdown temperature of the adjacent material.

==== A hollow cylinder ====

Let us use the same assumptions as used for the plane wall, except this time analyze what happens when we have heat transfer through an infinitely long hollow cylinder. The cylinder has inner radius R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and outer radius R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Under the assumption that the inner temperature remains constant at T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and outer temperature at T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the Laplace equation still holds true:

:&lt;math&gt;{{\nabla} ^ 2}T = 0&lt;/math&gt; 

This time, however, since we are in a cylindrical geometry, it makes most sense to use cylindrical coordinates to expand the Laplacian into the following:

:&lt;math&gt; {{\nabla} ^ 2}T = {1 \over r} {\partial \over \partial r}
  \left( r {\partial T \over \partial r} \right) 
+ {1 \over r^2} {\partial^2 T \over \partial \theta^2}
+ {\partial^2 T \over \partial z^2 }. 
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the cylinder is infinitely long and symmetric, the partials with respect to z and θ are zero so the equation reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt; {1 \over r} {\partial \over \partial r}
  \left( r {\partial T \over \partial r} \right) =-q/k &lt;/math&gt;

when there is heat generation the above equation is valid,when there is no heat generation q becomes zero.
Solving this equation with the boundary conditions that T(R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T(R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)=T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows us that:

:&lt;math&gt; T(r) = \frac{T_2-T_1}{\ln{\frac{R_2}{R_1}}}(\ln(r)-\ln(R_1))+T_1 &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into Fourier's law for conduction gives us:

:&lt;math&gt; Q'' = \frac{-k(T_2-T_1)}{r\ln{\frac{R_2}{R_1}}} = \frac{k(T_1-T_2)}{r\ln{\frac{R_2}{R_1}}}=\frac{2k(T_1-T_2)}{\phi\ln{\frac{\phi_2}{\phi_1}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that, unlike was the case with the flat slab, the heat flux is ''not'' independent of radius for a cylinder, which has important implications when designing a cylindrical heat exchanger, for example.

Now let us express this in terms of a heat flux per unit length, so that we know how to use this as an approximation for cylinders that are not infinitely long. We have the cross-sectional area of the cylinder is &lt;math&gt; A = 2{\pi}rL&lt;/math&gt;, so:

:&lt;math&gt; Q' = \frac{Q}{L} =\frac{2{\pi}k(T_1-T_2)}{\ln{\frac{R_2}{R_1}}}=\frac{2{\pi}k(T_1-T_2)}{\ln{\frac{\phi_2}{\phi_1}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the heat transferred per unit length is closely related to the logarithms of the radii.

==== Multi-layer conduction and electro-thermal analogy ====

Often, conduction takes place not through a single plane wall or a single cylinder, but through multiple plane layers or through coaxial cylinders. For example, the walls of modern houses are composed by several layers for increasing their insulation: so, we can find the following stratification, from internal towards external face:

(1) internal painting

(2) plaster

(3) bricks, e.g. porotherm type

(4) a thermal insulator, such as polysthirene

(5) a hollow space (air is a good insulator)

(6) again bricks, plaster and painting

So, we have 8 layers, and the solution of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;{-k}{\frac{{d^2}T}{d{x^2}}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

becomes more complex, because there are more boundary conditions to be respected. A simplified way for solving the problem is the '''electro-thermal analogy''': if we observe both the expression of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; for plane wall and for hollow cylinder, we note that they can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;Q=G\Delta T=\frac{\Delta T}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, as one prefers), depend on the geometry and contain the conductivity &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. This formula is analogue to Ohm's law:

:&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{\Delta V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

So, the thermal problem of conduction can be modeled with ''thermal resistances'' (or ''thermal conductance'', if one prefers &lt;math&gt;G=1/R&lt;/math&gt;): each thermal resistance is an object which is kept at different temperatures on its nodes, so heat passes through it; in the same way, if we apply a difference of voltage to an electrical resistance, current passes through it. This analogy is useful because it allows to model a multi-layer problem as a scheme of resistances connected in series. In fact, if electrical resistance A is connected in series with B, the end node of A is at the same voltage of the start node of B; if thermal resistance A (a layer of the wall) is connected in series (is adjacent) to the thermal resistance B (the other layer), on the common node (the interface) it cannot be a thermal gradient.
For the i-th plane wall:

:&lt;math&gt;R_i=\frac{s_i}{k_iA_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the wall. So we have:

:&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{T_{ext}-T_{int}}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_i}&lt;/math&gt;

For coaxial hollow cylinders (e.g. insulated pipes), we can use the same formula, but resistance is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{\ln\frac{\phi_2}{\phi_1}}{2\pi kL}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Flux Plots ====

==== Finite Difference Method ====

The '''finite difference method''' attempts to solve a differential equation by estimating the differential terms with algebraic expressions. The method works best for simple geometries which can be broken into rectangles (in cartesian coordinates), cylinders (in cylindrical coordinates), or spheres (in spherical coordinates). Otherwise, the '''finite element method''' should be used. If the finite difference method can be used, it is considerably easier to implement than the finite element method, at the cost of some accuracy. 

The simplest estimate for first-order differentials,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial x}{\partial y} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that the error caused by using this approximation is roughly proportional to &lt;math&gt; {\Delta y}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

To estimate a second derivative, it is treated as the derivative of the first derivative, and the approximation above is applied twice in succession:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 x}{{\partial y}^2} =
\frac{{(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}})_2-(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y})_1}{\Delta y} =
\frac{(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y})_2 - (\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y})_1}{\Delta y}
=\frac{x_3-2x_2+x_1}{{\Delta y}^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is evident that three points are necessary to estimate a second derivative, whereas only two are necessary to estimate a first-order derivative. This particular method can also be shown to be second-order with &lt;math&gt; {\Delta y}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Finite element method ====

== Transient Conduction ==

In problems of transient conduction, the complete Fourier's equation must be solved

:&lt;math&gt;{k}\nabla^2T = \rho\cdot C_p \cdot\frac{\partial {T}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

The solution of this equation is more difficult than steady-state equation, but it's possible in simple cases. Otherwise, numerical methods should be used.

=== The plane wall ===
The sun heating the earth is an example of radiant heat transfer. The sun warms the earth without warming the space between the sun and the earth.

=== The hollow cylinder ===

=== Lumped Capacitance Method ===

=== Finite Difference Method ===

finite difference method is used to find for odd shaped bodies

==== Laminar and Turbulent Flow ====
'''Laminar Flow''':  Smooth uninterrupted flow determined by a low Reynolds number. The Reynolds number for a Newtonian fluid is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; N_{Re} = \frac{Dv\rho}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; 

where D is a characteristic diameter (such as the diameter of a cylindrical pipe), v is the fluid velocity, &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density, and &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is the (dynamic) viscosity. There are several other ways of writing it as well (based on volumetric flow rate, mass flow rate, and the like) depending on what is known. Flow in a cylindrical pipe is laminar if the Reynolds number is less than 2100.

In laminar flow in a pipe, the velocity profile is parabolic; the maximum velocity occurs at the center and the velocity is zero at the wall of the pipe.

'''Turbulent flow''': This is flow characterized by movement in random directions, so that the net result is that all the flows cancel and the velocity on average is approximately constant everywhere in the pipe. Turbulent flow occurs when the Reynolds number is greater than 4000.

'''Transition regime''': In the region between Turbulent and Laminar flow (&lt;math&gt; 2100 &lt; N_{Re} &lt; 4000 &lt;/math&gt;), we cannot say much about the flow, except by emprical experimentation. The pattern is not linear in general but carries no distinct pattern in this region.

==== Dimensionless Parameters ====

In addition to the Reynolds number, &lt;math&gt;N_{Re}&lt;/math&gt;, there are several other dimensionless parameters that are important in correlations involving convection. These include the '''Prandtl number''', the '''Nusselt number''', and the '''Grashof number'''. The Prandtl number is a dimensionless combination of three properties of a material: heat capacity, viscosity, and thermal conductivity:

&lt;math&gt; N_{Pr} = \frac{C_p\mu}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Since it is a material property, the Prandtl number depends only on the conditions (temperature and pressure) that a material is held at, not the system in which it is placed. 

The Nusselt number tells us how important convection is compared to conduction. It is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; N_{Nu} = \frac{hD}{k} &lt;/math&gt;

In contrast to the Prandtl number, the Nusselt number involves a heat transfer coefficient and a characteristic length, both of which depend on the type of system one is using, so this number must be individually evaluated for each system for maximum accuracy (or an estimate for similar systems can be used).

Finally, the Grashof number is a dimensionless parameter generally used to model natural convection (in which the surrounding fluid is relatively still except very close to the object receiving or losing heat by convection). This number is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; N_{Gr} = \frac{L^3{\rho}^2g{\beta}{\Delta}T}{\mu^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It is used instead of the Reynolds number in natural convection modelling, since the surrounding environment is not at a high velocity, unlike in forced convection.

==== External Flow ====
External Flow, means flow over a surface.

==== Internal Flow ====
flow inside a closed,hollow,body.The cross section may be of circular,rectangular, or may be of any shape.

==== Free Convection ====
Also called natural convection. Results from a temperature difference between two media in contact.

==== Mixed Convection ====

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Heat Transfer with Phase Change'''

==== Boiling ====

In general, means heating thus increasing the temperature of the substance to its boiling temperature and above. The heat required to change a mass m of a pure substance from a liquid to a vapor is generally given in terms of a '''latent heat of vaporization''' as:

&lt;math&gt; Q = m{\Delta}H_{vap} &lt;/math&gt;

Latent heats are in general functions of pressure; they are usually given at 1 standard atmosphere (or 1 bar) in standard texts. For many applications the pressure dependence of latent heats is neglected.

==== Condensation ====
Condensation means lowering the temperature of the vapour substance 
to its boiling/vaporising temperature.
For example, water at 120 deg. Celsius, at atmospheric pressure, will be in vapour state. when its temperature is lowered below 100°C, at the same pressure, vapour gets condensed to liquid state.

The heat released when one condenses a liquid is the same magnitude as the amount required to vaporize the same mass of the liquid. It will just have a negative sign rather than a positive one (because when something condenses, it releases heat.

==== Freezing and melting ====

Freezing is the act of lowering the temperature of a system enough to change a substance from a liquid to a solid. Melting is the change from a solid back to a liquid.

The heat required to melt or solidify a pure substance is calculated in the same manner as that required to vaporize or condense that substance, except a different latent heat called the '''latent heat of fusion''' is used. it is used to freeze things

==== Sublimation ====

At a certain range of pressures, rather than melting, a solid will be transformed directly into a gas, and vice versa. The latent heat of sublimation is the sum of the heats of vaporization and fusion, assuming the effect of pressure changes is negligible:

&lt;math&gt; {\Delta}H_{sub} = {\Delta}H_{Vap} + {\Delta}H_{Fus} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Heat Exchangers''' {{Wikipediapar||heat exchanger}}

Heat exchangers are devices designed to transfer heat from one fluid to another without the fluids coming into contact. There are a wide variety of applications for heat exchangers, for example: radiators, air conditioning and power plants.
=== Types of Heat Exchangers ===
Heat exchangers are classified by their flow arrangements. There are two basic types of heat exchangers: ''in line flow'' and ''cross flow''.  In addition so-called ''regenerative'' heat exchangers are used in some industries.
==== In line ====
In in line exchangers, the hot and cold fluids move parallel to each other. Heat exchangers where the fluids move in the same direction are referred to as ''parallel flow'' or ''co-current'', exchangers where fluids move in the opposite direction are referred to as ''counter flow'' or ''counter-current''.

In Parallel flow heat exchangers, the outlet temperature of the &quot;cold&quot; fluid can never exceed the outlet temperature of the &quot;hot&quot; fluid. The exchanger is performing at its best when the outlet temperatures are equal.

Counter flow heat exchangers are inherently more efficient than parallel flow heat exchangers because they create a more uniform temperature difference between the fluids, over the entire length of the fluid path.  Counter flow heat exchangers can allow the &quot;cold&quot; fluid to exit with a higher temperature than the exiting &quot;hot&quot; fluid.

However many industrial heat exchangers are more complex. To save space, fluids may go to the end of a unit then go back again, perhaps several times.  Each time a fluid moves through the length is known as a ''pass''.  For example, one fluid may make 2 passes, the other 4 passes.  Thus parts of the heat exchanger may be co-current, others counter-current, and calculations must take this into account.

==== Cross flow ====
In cross flow exchangers, the hot and cold fluids move perpendicular to each other.  This is often a convenient way to physically locate the inlet and outlet ports in a small package, however, it is less thermally efficient than a purely counter flow design.

Some actual heat exchangers are a mixture of cross flow and counter flow due to design features that force the flow paths to wind back and forth.

==== Regenerative ====
Regenerative heat exchangers store heat and release it later. They contain a large mass of material which does not leave the exchanger but heats up (or in some cases, melts, absorbing latent heat) as hot fluid is passed through.  Thus heat fron one batch operation can be used to warm up the next one.
Alternatively, they can be used in pairs (or more) with one absorbing heat from a hot stream while the other is discharging it to a cold stream.  In some designs the bed of heat absorbing material moves to carry heat from one stream to another.

The term regenerative heat exchanger is also used for counter-flow exchangers in which one side is fluid entering the process and the other side fluid leaving the process.

=== Analysis of Heat Exchangers ===

Imagine a simple heat exchanger in which a pipe containing one fluid (A) is surrounded by a jacket filled with another fluid (B) as shown in the diagram. Each fluid has a steady inlet temperature, and it is desired to know what area is necessary to achieve a given set of outlet temperatures.

[[Image:Heatexchanger.PNG‎| Schematic showing the four temperature variables]]

In order to analyze a heat exchanger like this, one must resort to differential analysis because the temperature drop between fluids A and B is not constant.

To begin, there are three ways to express the total amount of heat that is exchanged between fluids A and B:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{Q} = \dot{m}_B*(C_p)_B*(T_{B2}-T_{B1}) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \dot{Q} = \dot{m}_A*(C_p)_A*(T_{A2}-T_{A1}) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \dot{Q} = U*A_{ex}*\Delta {T?} &lt;/math&gt;

The first two are well-defined, since the quantities &lt;math&gt; (T_{B2}-T_{B1})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(T_{A2}-T_{A1}) &lt;/math&gt; don't change over the course of the heat exchanger. Unfortunately, the third expression's value ''does'' depend on where in the heat exchanger you evaluate it, since the change in temperature there is the difference in temperature ''between the two fluids A and B''. Our goal now is to show how we can use the temperature information we have to calculate the total flow of heat or, more usefully, take the total amount of heat that's flowed and calculate the area of the heat exchanger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A common task is the need to integrate local data with related data on another site.  Although an increasing number of sites provide an RSS feed, it is often necessary to scrape web pages to get the relevant data.


== Delivery Status Reporting ==
One such case is where a company needs to monitor the status of their deliveries which use a courier service.

In this  mock example, a company maintains their own records of all deliveries commissioned, the delivery service used and the service's consignment number..  As an XML file, this might look    like;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;DeliveryList&gt;
  &lt;Delivery&gt;&lt;CustomerName&gt;Fred Flintstone&lt;/CustomerName&gt;&lt;Service&gt;CityLink&lt;/Service&gt; &lt;ConsignmentNo&gt;RZL14823&lt;/ConsignmentNo&gt;&lt;/Delivery&gt;   
  &lt;Delivery&gt;&lt;CustomerName&gt;Bill Bailey&lt;/CustomerName&gt;&lt;Service&gt;CityLink&lt;/Service&gt; &lt;ConsignmentNo&gt;RZL14869&lt;/ConsignmentNo&gt;&lt;/Delivery&gt;   
  &lt;Delivery&gt;&lt;CustomerName&gt;Jack and Jill&lt;/CustomerName&gt;&lt;Service&gt;CityExpress&lt;/Service&gt; &lt;ConsignmentNo&gt;RXL9999&lt;/ConsignmentNo&gt;&lt;/Delivery&gt;   
 &lt;/DeliveryList&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Integrated Report ==

The following script shows how the local delivery data can be combined with the data for this delivery obtained from the delivery company.  In this case, the delivery company City-Line provides a page for each consignment reporting its status. 

The script loops over the relevant deliveries and constructs the appropriate URL to read the page for each delivery. The page is input to an HTML-to-XML conversion (used in the Yahoo Weather feed), and then specific elements are retrieved from the HTML to build an extract in XML of the page.  This XML data is then combined with the local data to create a combined report.

&lt;pre&gt;
import module namespace  fwiki = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki&quot; at &quot;../reports/util.xqm&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

declare variable $citylinkURL := &quot;http://www.city-link.co.uk/pod/podfrm.php?JobNo=ZZZZ&quot;;

declare function  local:get-consignment($consNo) {
let $citylinkURL := replace($citylinkURL,&quot;ZZZZ&quot;,$consNo)
let $page := fwiki:html-to-xml($citylinkURL)
return  
 &lt;Consignment&gt;
     &lt;CustomerReference&gt; 
        {string($page//table[@id=&quot;this_table_holds_the_summary_info&quot;]/tr[1]/td[2])} 
    &lt;/CustomerReference&gt;
    &lt;ScheduledDeliveryDate&gt;
        {string($page//table[@id=&quot;this_table_holds_the_summary_info&quot;]/tr[1]/td[4])}
    &lt;/ScheduledDeliveryDate&gt;
    &lt;DeliveryStatus&gt;
        {string($page//table[@id=&quot;this_table_holds_the_detailed_status_desc&quot;]/tr[1]/td[2])}
    &lt;/DeliveryStatus&gt;
 &lt;/Consignment&gt;
};

let $report := 
&lt;Report&gt;
{for $delivery in //Delivery[Service=&quot;CityLink&quot;]
 let $citylink := local:get-consignment($delivery/ConsignmentNo)
 return  
   &lt;Delivery&gt;
        {$delivery/*}
        {$citylink/*}
    &lt;/Delivery&gt;
}
&lt;/Report&gt;
return
  fwiki:element-seq-to-table($report)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Notes ==
# In production, a simple script to extract and store the delivery data in the database could be scheduled to run every hour to reduce the demands on the sites used in this application.
# The script uses a generic function to convert any simple tabular XML to an HTML table.
# The mapping between HTML elements and XML depends on the stability of this page.  The paths are simplified by the presence of ids for the relevant tables.
# A production system must be able to detect HTTP errors and act accordingly.  This would require more control over the HTTP requests and responses. This facility is provided by the HTTP module in later releases of eXist. The simplistic approach taken here to obtain the XML would need to be replaced.

= Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation =
Moves:1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.Be3

In recent years, the most popular way for white to combat the Najdorf Variation at master level has been 6.Be3. A flexible opening, it has been employed successfully by Grandmasters such as [[wikipedia:Robert Byrne|Robert Byrne]], [[wikipedia:Nigel Short|Nigel Short]] &amp; [[wikipedia:John Nunn|John Nunn]].

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;

Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

=1. Nf3=
===1...Nf6===
1...Nf6, keeping the position symmetrical, is the most flexible reply to 1.Nf3. At Grandmaster level this is a very popular move and has been the preferred response of both Anand and Kasparov.

From here, the game can go in a number of directions and there are plenty of transpositional possibilities into 1.d4 and 1.c4 openings.

== RE: Comment ==

Hmmm, interesting
My fault though is that i only recently (within the last year) have leanred blender, and although I think I have learned a substantial amount of information, the problem comes from that those older concepts, such as bump mapping, were never learned because it is taught as obsolete and, therefore, I have never bothered to learn it.
If you would like to give me a hand moving around the pages and links, I really wouldn't mind you editing any sections I drafted, as long as the info in essence and pronouncement is preserved

[[File:NY Times Armenian genocide.jpg|right|300px|thumbnail|American newspaper reporting on ''Armenian Genocide'']]

This wikibook will look at the situation in which the Armenian Genocide was able to take place. It will look into those involved and where and when important events took place, to try and establish a clear picture of the extent of what has happened. 

The Armenian genocide was an extremely terrible series of acts, which caused the deaths of many Turkish Armenians. Estimates of the death rate stand at about 1.5 million Armenians killed throughout the genocide (Adalian), and 800,000 Armenians killed in 1915 alone, (Balakian, 179). Primarily, these terrible incidents were the work of three treacherous leaders: Abdul Hamid II, Talet Pasha, and Talet Bay.

&lt;big&gt;'''Primary Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphoma (PCBCL)'''&lt;/big&gt;
:''For cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, see [[Radiation Oncology/Mycosis fungoides|Mycosis fungoides]]''

==Pathology==
*B-cell lymphomas 20-25% of all cutaneous lymphomas
*Subtypes: primary cutaneous follicular center-cell lymphoma (PCFCCL), primary cutaneous immunocytoma (PCI), primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma (PCLBCL) of the leg

WHO Classification
*Most common histology: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

EORTC Classification
*Note: in the EORTC, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of non-leg site are classified as follicle center cell (i.e., considered indolent instead of aggressive)

==Epidemiology==
*Overall (data from SEER, PMID 15908651)
**Mean age 64 yrs. Male 54%.
**Incidence increasing
**Histology (WHO): DLBCL in 33%, NOS 24%, follicular 17%, MZL 8%
**Site: head or neck 50%, trunk 19%, arm 12%, leg 11%, disseminated 8%

*PCFCCL
**Localized to skin; rarely disseminate to extracutaneous sites
**Usually involve head or trunk
**5-yr OS &gt; 95%
*PCI
**Usually involve arms and legs
**Excellent prognosis
*PCLBCLs of the leg
**Affects elderly patients
**More often involves extracutaneous sites
**Poor prognosis: 5-yr OS 58%


*'''SEER; 2008''' (1973-2004) PMID 18349400 -- &quot;Analysis of primary CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disease and survival from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.&quot; (Yu JB, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Mar 20;26(9):1483-8.)
**SEER review. 268 cases; 58% males, 87% white. 157 (59%) primary localized PCLPD
**Outcome: 3-year OS 81% vs. population-matched OS 87%; 5-year DSS 92%. H&amp;N worse outcome
**Conclusion: Rare disease, with excellent OS; more common in white men, H&amp;N sites worse survival

==Prognostic Index==
*'''Yale; 2005''' - PMID 15908651 &amp;mdash; &quot;The cutaneous B-cell lymphoma prognostic index: a novel prognostic index derived from a population-based registry.&quot; (Smith BD, J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 20;23(15):3390-5.)
**From SEER registry (1973-2001). 1343 cases. Histology according to WHO classification. Developed prognostic index based on histology and site.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!CBCL-PI Group !! Histology !! Site !! 5-yr OS
|-
| IA || Indolent &lt;br&gt;(follicular, marginal zone, small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic) || Any || 81%
|-
| IB || Diffuse large B-cell || Favorable &lt;br&gt;(head/neck, arm) || 72%
|-
| rowspan=2| II || DLBCL || Unfavorable || rowspan=2| 48%
|-
| Immunoblastic diffuse large B-cell || Favorable
|-
| III || Immunoblastic diffuse large B-cell || Unfavorable || 27%
|}


==Outcomes==
*'''Yale''' (1990-2002)
**Retrospective, 34 pts. Treated with RT as primary treatment; Median dose 40 Gy (range 20-48 Gy). No systemic disease. 
**Comparison of EORTC and WHO pathologic classification systems, which differ in characterizing these lesions, and therefore recommendations for treatment may differ (based on characterization as indolent or aggressive lymphomas)
**'''2004''' PMID 14966086 -- &quot;Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma treated with radiotherapy: a comparison of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the WHO classification systems.&quot; (Smith BD, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Feb 15;22(4):634-9.) -- Median f/u 3.4 yrs
***5-yr OS 96%, RFS 55%, LR-free survival 81%, extracutaneous relapse-free survival 79%. OS and RFS was 67% and 33% for leg-type DLBCL and 100% and 62-73% for other types
***62% (8/13) of initial relapses confined to skin (localregional or distant), 24% (8/34) of all pts. Distant relapse (+/- skin) in 38% (5/13) of all relapses or 15% (5/34) of all pts. 
***''Pathologic:'' 68% of lesions classified as follicle center cell (i.e. indolent) by EORTC criteria are classified as DLBCL (i.e. aggressive) by WHO system, but the biologic behavior is indolent. 
***Increased risk of LR with dose &lt; 36 Gy: 5-yr LR-free survival 50% (&lt; 36 Gy) vs 90% (&gt;= 36 Gy). 
***Conclusion: 40 Gy dose is recommended.  Worse outcome for leg type; however, for the other lesions, DLBCL histology appears more indolent than in nodal lymphomas.


'''''PCLBCL:'''''
*'''European multicenter''' (1979-98) - PMID 11504742, 2001 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prognostic factors in primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphomas: a European multicenter study.&quot; Grange F et al.  J Clin Oncol. 2001 Aug 15;19(16):3602-10.
**Retrospective. 48 pts with PCLBCL of leg; 97 with PCFCCL. 
**On multivariate analysis, worse outcomes for location on leg, multiple lesions, and round cell morphology.

==Treatment==
'''''Solitary lesion:'''''
Most often presents as a solitary lesion (~85%). Radiotherapy is preferred treatment for solitary lesions.  Dose 40 Gy.

'''''Multifocal disease:'''''
*'''Netherlands''' (1985-97) - PMID 10561311, 1999 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of multifocal primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma: a clinical follow-up study of 29 patients.&quot; Bekkenk MW et al. J Clin Oncol. 1999 Aug;17(8):2471-8. 
**Retrospective. Included 29 pts who had involvement of &gt;= 2 nonadjacent skin areas that did not fit into one radiation field without extracutaneous disease (14% of patients seen at this center). Pts treated with either chemotherapy (CHOP in most) or RT.
**16 pts had PCFCCL, 8 PCI, 5 PCLBCL of leg. 
**Excellent results in PCFCCL or PCI for either chemo or RT. All pts with PCLBCL relapsed with extracutaneous disease.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Argentine Tango==

==Introduction to the dance==
===What to forget when learning about Argentine tango===
====Have you come from another dance background?====
If you have never learned a social dance before, feel
free to skip this section.

But if not... perhaps you know very much about the waltz,
or the foxtrot, or, more commonly, American Ballroom Tango,
and you think that many of your skills will translate over;
you will instantly be impressive or capable to a
given extent once you get the basics down! Right?

This is not true. Many European and Western dance styles have
homogenized or been in contact to an extent that there are
recognizable similarities between them; or they have certain
predictable moves. For example, leading a quarter turn in 
Waltz is in many ways similar to leading a quarter turn
in Foxtrot.

You can not expect this same similarity from Argentine Tango,
not only because of a long development isolated from the other
dances, but because of the dance's entirely different cultural background.
It is not like a latin dance. It is not like a western dance.

Much like Samba, Argentine Tango is an entirely different ballgame.
Yet it is one which, if you put the initial effort into learning it,
will reward you with social opportunities (Especially in urban environments),
good exercise, and a chance to have lots of fun.

Expecting to be able to use one's experience with another dance
to dance Argentinian Tango is akin to trying to use one's checkers experience
with chess. Unlike a board game however, certain muscle memory habits
tend to stick around, and you may find yourself reproducing habits
from other dances which do not apply. 

This section will provide a brief review of the most important habits
that must be commonly un-learned by the A.T. beginner. If you 

====Leading with the Arms====

You do not lead with the arms in Argentine Tango.

I repeat: The arms of your body are not used for leading.

One more time: The wrists, elbows, forearm, bicep, and shoulder are not used for leading.

If you want your follow to travel to the left, you do not push her with your arms to the left. You do not pull her over to the left. There is no push and pull, they are not a ragdoll! You do not tug, you do not even use your head to nod her over to where you want her to be. No, the head is not used for leading either. Never.

How do you lead in Argentine Tango? How, then? You've got to be able to give some physical signal, right? They can't just be watching you all the time! (That's correct. Any good Argentine tango lead is able to dance well with a follower who has their eyes closed.)

In Argentine Tango, you lead with your torso. The lower chest. Movement originates from there. Forward, backward, to the side, around in a circle, all of this is communicated by the torso.

Your arms, shoulders, head, form a &quot;frame,&quot; which stays relatively static to the chest. When your torso turns, the rest of your upper body naturally follows, in one, smooth, liquid motion. Nevertheless, the arms and head following your chest around is purely an aesthetic and health and safety measure (we wouldn't want any dancers leaving their heads behind at a ''milonga'' somewhere...). Motion and leading is almost always, 98% of the time, from the torso.

Do not try to tell your partner where to go with the push or pull of your arms. It is rude to them. It is disrespectful. It shows that you aren't trying to lead, and that you're not really concerned about whether they're enjoying themselves or not. If you are concerned with learning how to dance Argentine tango well, you will try to learn to lead without your arms.

===What is a gancha?===
===Practice===
Before we learn a lead-in to a gancha, let us begin an exercise. &lt;br/&gt;
#Stand up straight, your legs beneath you.&lt;br/&gt;
#Lift one leg off the ground. Sway it backward and forward from the hip like a pendulum. Do not exert any effort anywhere but your hip. &lt;br/&gt;Just let your leg swing naturally, back and forth. Get used to this motion. During a Gancha, this is how you move your leg.
#In application, once the back of your thigh comes in contact with your partner's the knee may continue to move independent of the upper leg, resulting in a flicking motion.&lt;br/&gt;This knee movement's momentum should, or should at least appear to, originate from the thigh.&lt;br/&gt;

===5 ... Nxd5!?===
:Immediate recapture of the pawn sometime thought dubious at other times theory considers it quite playable. From a positional point of view it's not considered a good move due to the creation of open lines that White can now use to aggressively attack for this reason it's rarely played at master level. While modern computer analysis suggests that it may be theoretically playable, few doubt that 5...Na5 is a more practical choice in an over the board game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Atoms contain electrons. When an atom is not in an excited state, the electrons have the lowest possible energy. This is known as being in '''ground state'''. Electrons can have an infinite number of discrete energy levels. If one visulises theses levels as concentric circles around a nucleus they begin to converge, as every step between energy levels gets smaller. 

&quot;http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k213/blackcurrent_jelly/rt.jpg&quot; 

The diagram is very basic as electrons can posess many more levels than shown. 

The distance between each energy level corresponds to the amount of energy an electron needs to be given to 'jump' to it. Once an electron has been excited to an energy level is does not remain there unless continually being supplied with the required energy, instead it emits the energy is was given, and jumps back down to ground state. Electrons require a specific frequency of energy to excite up a level. 

Visible light is made up of many different frequencies. If an atom absorbs absorbs its required certain frequency of energy from visible radiation (light) an electron is promoted from ground state to one of several possible levels; the atoms is in an excited state. It does not remain excited for long, as the energy absorbed is re-emitted as the frequency it absorbs, producing light of the colour related to the frequency.

It must be noted that when a molecule becomes excited, it can drop to an intermediate energy level by releasing a smaller packet (quanta) of energy and loosing the rest via vibrational energy in collisions. This vibrational energy is converted into kinetic energy and molecules in a sample will move more vigorously causing the sample to become warm.

=Two Knights Defence:Fritz variation=
5 ... Nd4 The Fritz Variation of the Two Knights. &lt;br&gt;This move put the Knight in a central position   and can lead to a number of tactical possibilities, however the Knight is always vulnerable to being attacked by a c3 pawn and then having few squares to retreat so the Knight is often exchanged or sacrificed.

I've moved the two pages you've created today so far, to comply with Wikibooks' [[WB:NP|naming policy]] and fixed the links on the page you got the names from, since I noticed links where written incorrectly. Hopefully this should make it easier for you to keep the pages part of the book they are intended to be apart of. If you come across any other links in that or any other books, which are disjointed from the book, could you please fix the link to follow Wikibooks' [[WB:NP|naming policy]], before creating a new page? Thank You. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:49, 14 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

Attacking the bishop, yet moving to the side of the board. In theory this is Black's best move, but it's not that clear.

=Two Knights Defence:Morphy Variation= 
6 d3 Morphy Variation. &lt;br&gt; An attempt to fully hang onto the pawn. This variation does not inspire, giving up a good bishop for the currently out of play Knight is not something many players would choose. Therefore this variation is seldom played.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [http://www.soya.be/how-to-make-soy-milk.php this webpage's soy milk instructions], it states that 125g of soy beans make only 1 liter of soy milk. As this is only half of what the wiki-cookbook states, it may be best to place references or adapt the article.

== Transwiki request clarification ==

Hi SunCreator,

Regarding your request on [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]], I just wanted to be sure: Did you start [[Opening theory in chess/Theory table]] by copying the content from Wikipedia and want that page imported so that the edit history can be merged in with the Wikibooks page?

Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:27, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
:Hi Swift. No, the article [[Opening theory in chess/Theory table]] was not copied. An import is not required either as an import request was made from [[w:Chess opening theory table]] and a transwiki did occur and it's now [[Chess/Opening theory table]]. So at present we have two Theory table articles although the intention is to merge them. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 13:57, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

== ECO index pages ==

Hi SunCreator,

I noticed your request for having the ECO index redirects removed. Just in the event that they weren't considered, I wanted to point out that redirects are not a big burden on Wikibooks (in terms of memory or processing) and can be quite useful. They not only to ensure that links don't break (these pages aren't that old, so I wouldn't care to guess how many may have linked to or bookmarked them) but can also help with searches (such as [[Special:Search/ECO_index]]).

I also wanted to note that page titles aren't just links. They are rendered at the top of the page and used in print versions. While [[Chess/ECOA]] is certainly simpler than [[Opening theory in chess/ECO index: A00--A99]] the latter is much more descriptive. The former, furthermore, places the page in the [[Chess]] book which seems to be of a ''much'' lower level.

Should you wish to break the ECO pages off from [[Opening theory in chess]], perhaps it is better to do so in a fresh book. A title like [[Handbook of Chess Openings]] might be an idea (to keep it away from developing into an ecyclopedia, as these are outside the scope of Wikibooks). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:19, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
:Thanks. I was aware that redirects are no issue to be left. Just at this time I'd like to keep things clean as I go along. The name [[Handbook of Chess Openings]] or [[Chess Openings Handbook]] sounds really good although it does not fit the ECO pages, but it does fit the [[Opening theory in chess]] as a whole. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 03:40, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

:: I see. If you plan to use acronyms in your page titles, (deliberately) creating redirects could be a good idea to help with searches. Note also that many wikibooks get a lot of hits even though they are still in development and users may have bookmarked them. As long as everyone is aware of the issues, book contributors are probably the best to judge which redirects should be left, so this is ultimately up to you.
:: I just looked over the ECO pages again. These just seem to exclusively link to [[Opening theory in chess]] pages. How about just placing them on a sub-page of that book, such as &quot;Index A&quot;, &quot;A index&quot; or even just &quot;A&quot;? Also, is the notation you use (e.g. &quot;A01&quot; etc.) specific to the book, or does it exist prior to it? Is there any need for this ECO? I'd be interested to hear how you plan to structure this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:55, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
::: Yep. Will be putting the ECO pages on [[Opening theory in chess]]. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 14:15, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

== Just a note ==

I am in the process of fixing all the links on Wikipedia to point to the [[Chess Opening Theory]] book's new page locations.  That will also correct any links I broke deleting orphans.  I fully intend to remedy the situation. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:27, 22 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

| Cum puero bello praeconem qui videt esse,
| What should one who sees an auctioneer with a fair boy,
|-
| 2
| quid credat, nisi se vendere discupere?
| believe, but that he is intending to sell himself?
|-
|}

=Connotations of The Text=

===Line 1===

'''''praeconem - auctioneer'''''

The joke here is that Juventius is selling himself to an auctioneer. i.e. at the best price he can get for his services.

===Line 2===

'''''vendere - to sell [himself]''''' 

Catullus suspects that his friend Juventius has been eloping with other men, as is mentioned in [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/24|Poem 24]] and [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/81|Poem 81]]. Young boys were permitted to satisfy older men but a boy who sold himself was nothing more than a whore.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fyo.

F stands for Find. 
Y stands for Your.
O stands for Own.
Find your own.You can find your own path in life, find your own meaning of being, you can even find your own friends you can find your own lover, the list is endless.
Fyo does not stand for anything bad, so if you go to someone and say &quot;Fyo&quot; then you are actually complimenting them, you are telling them to find something, find something for which they can live for. 

Fyo is an amazing thing.
Created in the 20th century it has grown to become one of the most nicest things on earth. Fyo coming from the word &quot;Fyodor&quot;
means &quot;gods gift&quot;. Fyo wants to help people.
And yes it is a blessing to have such a thing on this earth, it is a blessing to have such a remaquable thing live rank with humans.

Fyo  is observant and it sees the mistakes people have made and make and he tries to stop people making them.
In other words Fyo claims that it is the most innocent thing on earth.

Fyo can talk to animmals, and he can teleport from one place to another. Fyo can be your boyfriend or be your girlfriend. Fyo can be in your mind or outside it, Fyo can be the muscle in your finger that twitches before you pull the trigger of a gun.
Fyo is that little voice in your head that tells all the stupid people in this planet not to steal, not to do drugs and not to kill.

Fyo is the love between two lovers and Fyo is also the pain you will feel if you commit a crime, lose someone important or fail miserably in your life. 

What is Fyo???
Fyo is the ultimate everythingness that controlls your emotions and your conscience. It is the sexyness in your lovers face.
Fyo is the thing that you love the most in life. Fyo is the will inside you to live.
Fyo is the sun that shines and warms your heart.

So next time you see someone having troubles or you see someone that wants to do something bad just say &quot;Fyo&quot; and That person will feel much better =).

= Two Knights with 8.Qf3 =

===8. Qf3===
Develops the queen and pins the c6 pawn, as cxb5 gives Qxa8.

This variation has become popular in light of the game Nigel Short vs Mark Hebden in which Short won convincingly. Apparently, computer analysis has suggested that Black hasn't enough compensation for the pawn.
Black now faces the prospect of giving up a second pawn or the a8 Rook in order to maintain a development advantage.

This module [[C Programming/Standard libraries]] appears to be a copy-and-paste fork of [[Wikipedia:C standard library]].
So I slapped the &quot;dewikify&quot; template on it, as recommended by [[Wikibooks:Dewikify]].
Anything else I need to do that isn't already mentioned on that page?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thank you for looking at the Muggles' Guide, but I'm afraid that your changes had to be removed: while the writeup was possibly better than our existing one, or would be with some work, by replacing the entire page, including the framework, you had pretty much destroyed the uniform look of the individual pages of the project. If you wish to work on the Muggles' Guide, we would appreciate it; but please do get an ID, so we can credit your work properly, and please do adhere to the project standards, available [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|here]].

==The Basic Grammar Structure==
Like all languages, American Sign Language (ASL) has a well-defined sentence structure.  Similar to English sentences, basic verb clauses in ASL are in Subject-Verb-Object order.  ASL has more flexible word order, though, because it also uses [[w:American Sign Language grammar#Topic and main clauses|topics]] and usually drops pronouns that have been established as topics.  A full sentence in ASL has the following order:

:  [time-context] [topic] [subject] [negative-tag-start] verb [object] [subject-pronoun-tag] [negative-tag-end]

;Time context
:In ASL, the time context (e.g. morning, yesterday) is optional.  If expressed, it occurs at the beginning of the sentence and functions like an adverb for the verb of the main clause that follows.
;Topic
:The topic is also optional.  When expressed, it is usually indicated by raised eyebrows.  The topic is then typically not expressed again in the following sentences, except for emphasis, or to change the topic, or where confusion may otherwise occur.
;Subject
:If the established topic is the subject of the sentence, the subject is typically dropped (not expressed), except for emphasis or where confusion may occur.
;Verb
:Verbs in ASL may express actions (e.g. &quot;to talk&quot;) or states (e.g. &quot;to be happy&quot;).  Aside from the optional time context, ASL grammar does not have [[w:Grammatical tense|tense]].  That is, it does not change the form of a sign to indicate past, present, and future actions or states.  Verb signs in ASL do inflect, though.  For example, they may be signed emphatically by using larger gestures than their standard forms, or repeated to show repeated actions, or interrupted before the end to indicate the &quot;unrealized inceptive&quot; mood (also indicated by holding one's breath).
;Object
:If the established topic is the object of the sentence, the object is typically dropped, except for emphasis or where confusion may occur.
;Subject pronoun tag
:Subject pronoun tags are optional.  If expressed, it refers to the subject of the verb and may suggest emphasis.  In a positive sentence, the subject pronoun tag is usually indicated with a head nod.
;Negative
:Negatives usually are indicated by shaking the head &quot;no&quot; from the beginning of the verb through the end of the sentence, and are optionally also expressed with an explicit negative sign after the verb and its optional object.

===Examples===
SCHOOL ME GO
[topic] [subject] [verb]

EVERYDAY SCHOOL ME GO-GO-GO
[time-adverb] [topic] [subject] [verb]
I attend school everyday

Time phrases are put in front.

I've been kicking around the idea of writing a book about Wikibooks, but not necessarily one that would fit the inclusion criteria here. It would be a book about my experiences here, and the lessons that I've learned about community and collaboration from this project.

== The Plan ==

;Target Audience: readers, likely people not familiar with Wikibooks, Wikipedia, or wiki in general
;Scope: Will cover the history of wikibooks, including my participation in this project, some of the trials and tribulations of the community here, and some of the decisions that we've made that have shaped this project. I would like to offer an insiders perspective to Wikibooks, and a perspective of Wikipedia that is not encountered often in the media.

      <text xml:space="preserve">American Sign Language or ASL (aka Ameslan) is a natural language that is used by many Deaf (being a part of the Deaf culture) and deaf (being physically deaf without necessarily adapting to the Deaf culture) people not only in the United States of America, but some parts of Canada as well.  Other people who may use ASL may include people with speech disorders such as people with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder, people with hearing difficulties, people with mental illness that prohibit their ability to communicate with speech etc.  One may think that British Sign Language(BSL) is very similar to ASL, but this is an incorrect assumption.  In fact, ASL was derived from langue des signes française {Language of French of Signs, LFS, aka French Sign Language FSL.}  Over the many years since LSF was brought to America and taught by Laurent Clerc, ASL has transformed into a natural language capable of communicating complex ideas as well as simplistic ones.  Also, it has a very distinct grammatical structure, which contrary to popular belief is not similar to the English syntax, but is more similar to spoken Japanese.

==Nouns, Pronouns, and Usage==
Nouns and pronouns allow a signer to talk about things and ideas.  They are a key building block to proficiency in ASL and other languages.

===Nouns and Pluralization===
Nouns are a common concept to all languages.  However, unlike many other languages, American Sign Language does not alter the form of nouns to express plurality ( for example: a 'noun' denotes is a single thing. But, if I use the word 'nouns', you know just by looking at the word that I am talking about more than one thing).  In ASL, the noun is understood to be plural or not, depending on what the context suggests it should be.

===Pronouns===
Pronouns in ASL are fairly simple, because ASL is a visual language.  Simply pointing using the index finger or a '''1''' handshape is a normal pronoun.  See the section about contrastive structure for what to do if the subject is not present.  To form a possessive pronoun such as my, your, his, or our one uses an '''extended B''' handshape with an outward palm orientation.  Once again with possessive pronouns you may merely ''point'' to what you wish to speak about, however it's not really pointing in this case.  Finally, reflexive pronouns are made using an '''extended A''' handshape.  As one can see pronouns in ASL are fairly simplistic.  All you do is point and identify the object.

===Contrastive Structure===
Suppose you want to talk to someone about a person who is not physically nearby, you should use contrastive structure.  The rules of contrastive structure are easy.  First, identify the person by fingerspelling his or her name; describing a few key features such as hair color or height also helps.  Second, just point to the right of one's body.  That's all there is to it.  Once a person has been established using contrastive structure, you simply point back to that spot to refer back to them.  This works with multiple people as well, but try to refrain from using more than two people at a time, as it may confuse the other signer.

==Verbs and Usage==
Verbs are another common concept in all natural languages.  They allow us to explain what it is we are doing.  In fact, without verbs, language would cease to exist.  Verbs in ASL come in three types:  '''plain''', '''inflecting''', and '''spatial'''. 

===Plain Verbs===
A plain verb is a normal verb in ASL.  When using plain verbs the signer must designate the subject and the object.  Examples of plain verbs in ASL are PLAY, RUN, JUMP, and SING.

===Inflecting/Indicating Verbs===
Inflecting/Indicating verbs allow the signer to incorporate the subject and object into the verb in one fluid motion.  Examples of inflecting verbs in ASL are GIVE, INFORM, TELL, PICK-ON, SEND, and PAY. The sign PAY can have two different meanings as in ''I pay to you'' or ''you pay me,'' depending on the starting and ending locations of the sign.

===Spatial Verbs===
The last type of verb is a spatial verb.  These just allow the signer to specify where things are or how he or she moved them around.  Examples of spatial verbs in ASL are PUT-UP and PUT-BELOW.

==Adjectives and Adverbs==
Descriptive words are adjectives and adverbs.  They help us describe things in detail.  They also add imagery to our writing, speech, and signing.

===Placement of Adjectives===
Typically, ASL puts an adjective after the noun it modifies, but one may place the adjective before the noun for stylistic purposes.  This is similar to the word order of many Romance languages, but differs from English, which requires that an adjective precede the noun it modifies.

:'''English:  I have a brown dog.'''
:'''ASL:  DOG BROWN I HAVE'''

===Placement of Adverbs===
In English the adverb is placed after the verb, whereas in ASL it is placed before the verbs.  Most of the time adverbs are simple the same sign as an adjective, only it is distinguished by the context of the sentence.

:'''English:  I enter the house quietly.'''
:'''ASL:  HOUSE I QUIET ENTER'''

Adding ''-LY'' to the end of the adjective to form an adverb is improper and is considered Signing Exact English.  One should avoid slipping into other portions of the sign continuum at all costs.

==Usage of Conjunctions, Interjections, and Prepositions==
These three concepts are probably the least used in ASL, because it is a high contextual language.  Despite this fact, they are still used in signing to an extent.

===Conjunction===
The combining of two sentences in ASL is different based on the conjunction needed.  For example, the concept of the word ''and'' does not exist in ASL.  Simply, sign a sentence, take a short pause and then sign the next sentence.  Similar conjunctions such as ''or'' and ''but'' have signs.

:'''English:  I have two cats and they are named Billy and Bob.'''
::'''ASL:  TWO CATS I HAVE. NAME #BILLY #BOB.'''

:'''English:  I like to swim, but I don't like to run.'''
:'''ASL:  SWIM I LIKE, BUT RUN I LIKE-NOT'''

===Interjections===
:Interjections such as WOW! or OH! can be fingerspelled or they may have a sign like WOW.  They are usually made into a separate statement such as:  '''WOW. YOUR BIKE RED I LIKE.'''

===Prepositions===
Now, most prepositions are not used in ASL at all, because it is reserved more for Signing Exact English.  It is a good idea to avoid prepositions when signing in ASL, because they are shown in context.

==Syntax==
With background on how parts of speech are used in ASL, we can now evaluate the syntax, or word order, of ASL.  As stated previously in the article, the word order of ASL is different from that of English.  English follows a SVO, Subject-Verb-Object sentence pattern, whereas ASL uses a Topic-Comment pattern.

:'''English:  I go to the store.'''

:'''ASL:  STORE I GO'''

Signing is a heavily visual language and does not require as many words as spoken English.  In the above example one can see that the words ''to'' and ''the'' are deemed unnecessary for an ASL sentence.  However, the inclusion of these words is called Signing Exact English and is therefore not ASL.

===Placement of Time Words===
Time words are the only thing that comes before the topic of the sentence in ASL.  So, adding time words makes our ASL word order now Time-Topic-Comment.  Also, the concept of AM and PM does not exist in ASL.  They simply sign MORNING or AFTERNOON to denote AM or PM.

:'''English:  I'm going to the store at 9:00AM.'''

:'''ASL:  9:00 MORNING STORE I GO'''

===Word Order of Questions===
In other natural languages such as English, French or German, statements are given in a particular word order.  Then for questions they either invert the word order or add in a few words such as:  ''do'' or ''est-ce que''.  ASL does not invert its word order nor does it add in any helping words, it uses non-manual signals to display a question asked.  These non-manuals can consist of body movements, facial expressions, or eyebrow movements.  Let's examine a simple YES/NO question in ASL and English.

:'''English:  Did you go to the store?'''

:'''ASL:  STORE YOU GO?'''

English added our helping verb ''to do'', but ASL didn't change or add anything.  This is because in a YES/NO question the eyebrows are raised and the body leaned forward slightly.  These non-manuals show the receptive signer that the statement is actually a question.

Another type of question is a WH-question.  These types of question require more of a response than yes or no.  They always include signs like WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, HOW, or WHY?  These WH-words ''always'' come at the end of the question, unlike in English where it is the first word in the question.

:'''English:  What are you eating?'''

:'''ASL:  YOU EAT WHAT?'''

Similar to a YES/NO question, WH-word questions also have non-manual markers, however this time instead of raising your eyebrows, you must lower your eyebrows.  In addition to lowering your eyebrows the signer must lean the body in slightly and extend the last sign for a couple seconds.  This allows the receptive signer to understand they are being asked a question that requires more of a response.

The final type of question is called an RH-question.  The use of an RH-question is like an English speaker using the word ''because''.  There is no sign for the word ''because'' in ASL, therefore they sign a question and answer it themselves.  The non-manual markers for an RH-question are the same as a YES/NO question.

:'''English:  I like to play tennis, because it is fun.

:'''ASL:  TENNIS I LIKE PLAY WHY? #FUN

===Negation in ASL===
The role of negation in ASL is a fairly easy concept to grasp.  There are only two signs one needs to know to be able to negate a sentence.  These two signs are NOT and NONE.  The non-manual marker for a negated sentence is simply a shake of the head when signing the word NOT or NONE.  Also, one must remember that in ASL syntax negation words always come at the end.  The only exception to this rule is a WH-word.

NONE is typically used when talking about possession of a noun.  It functions similar to the English words none or any.

:'''English:  I don't have any dogs.'''

:'''ASL:  #DOG I HAVE NONE

NOT functions the exact way it does in English.  Except that in English it is typically found in contractions like ''don't''.

:'''English:  I shouldn't eat candy.

:'''ASL:  CANDY I SHOULD EAT NOT

===Modal Verbs===
The concept of modal verbs is essentially the same in ASL and English.  In ASL the modal can come after the other verbs in the sentence.  However, in English it is the very first verb.

:'''English:  I can go to the store for you.'''

:'''ASL:  FOR YOU, STORE I GO CAN'''

==Fingerspelling and Numbers==
The English alphabet has 26 letters and ASL uses a manual alphabet the mimics that of English.  Signing numbers is different than the hand-signs that most English speakers use.

===The Role of Fingerspelling===
Fingerspelling is used for proper nouns.  They may include, but are not limited to movie titles, books, names, and street names.  When glossing ASL or writing it down, we denote fingerspelled words like this:  '''#DOG'''.  Fingerspelling should not be used in place of a sign.  If you do not know what a sign is do not immediately fingerspell.  First, one should gesture or attempt to describe the object.  If that does not work, then you can fingerspell.

===The Role of Numbers===
All numbers under one thousand are signed using a single hand, and the second hand is only used to designate that a number is in the thousands or millions.  There are separate signs that need to be learned in order to talk about age, time, money, and other concepts.  Numbers are used the same way that they are in English.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Terminology==
===Deaf vs. hard of hearing vs. hearing-impaired===
''Deaf'' generally implies complete lack of ability to hear; someone with a partial inability to hear is more likely to be referred to as '''hard of hearing''' or the qualified '''partially legally deaf'''. People with varying degrees of hearing loss have also been referred to as '''hearing-impaired'''.

The term &quot;hard of hearing&quot; may be used to describe all degrees of hearing loss, up to and including total deafness. In the case of profound deafness this may be political correctness, a euphemism for the simpler and accurate &quot;deaf.&quot; Interestingly, this is seen as a euphemism only from the side of the mainstream - the deaf community sees it as a potentially pathological label.

Total deafness is quite rare - most deaf people can hear a little.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gri.gallaudet.edu/Demographics/factsheet.html Gallaudet University: Demographics of Deafness]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since hearing loss is generally frequency-based rather than amplitude-based, a deaf person's hearing may not be usable if the normal frequencies of speech lie in the impaired range.

People with a moderate hearing loss, of about 36–50 dB,&lt;ref name=&quot;handsandvoices&quot;&gt;
{{Citation

  | publisher =HandsAndVoices.org
  | url =http://www.handsandvoices.org/resources/coGuide/05_Lossvseffct.htm
  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
generally describe themselves as &quot;partially deaf.&quot; Others who were born hearing, but who have partially lost their hearing through illness or injury are &quot;deafened.&quot; Those with a slight hearing loss (eg. about 16–35 dB hearing loss),&lt;ref name=&quot;handsandvoices&quot;/&gt; or have lost some of their hearing in old age may prefer an informal term such as &quot;hard of hearing&quot; or &quot;hearing-impaired&quot;.

Those with some functional hearing generally do not take part in the Deaf community, and typically work and socialize with hearing people to the best of their ability.  People with all degrees of hearing impairment may encounter discrimination when looking for work, while at their jobs, or when socializing with hearing people.

==Deaf Culture==
'''Deaf community''' and '''Deaf culture''' are two phrases used to refer to cultures comprised of people who are culturally Deaf as opposed to those who are deaf from the medical/audiological/pathological perspective. When used in the cultural sense, the word ''deaf'' is very often capitalized in writing, and referred to as &quot;big D Deaf&quot;.

Big D Deaf communities do not automatically include all those who are clinically or legally deaf, nor do they exclude every hearing person. According to Baker and Padden, a person is Deaf if he or she &quot;identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community.&quot; Deaf culture may include those who attended deaf schools, children of deaf parents, and some sign language interpreters. 

The primary languages of those who identify themselves as Deaf are signed. Deaf communities also often possess social and cultural norms that are distinct from those of surrounding hearing communities. 

==Background==

The use of the cultural label of being Deaf can be a declaration of personal identity rather than an indicator of hearing ability. Indeed, many people who self-identify as Deaf from a cultural perspective may have 'better' hearing than those who don't. 

Deaf culture commonly perceives the term hearing impaired as insulting or misleading. The primary reason is that Deaf people feel the word &quot;impaired&quot; carries too much negativity. Some Deaf people also do not feel the terms &quot;hard-of-hearing&quot; and &quot;Deaf&quot; are synonymous or should be put in the same category. 

Deaf communities provide a sense of belonging for deaf people, who might otherwise feel excluded from the dominant hearing culture. As deafness is a relatively rare condition, relationships within a Deaf community can extend over great distances to bring people together. Deaf culture emphasizes community and interdependency but the main characteristic of Deaf culture is the use of signed languages. Signed languages are distinct from local spoken and written languages. Although some spoken words may have a corresponding sign, the usage, inflections, and grammar (and even the rate of communication) of signed languages can differ greatly from speech.

==Distinction between clinical deafness and Deaf culture==
The word 'deaf' can be used both to refer to individuals who are clinically deaf and individuals who are members of a cultural group consisting mostly of people who are clinically deaf. The label of the cultural group is conventionally distinguished in writing by using an upper case D. The distinction between 'deaf' and 'Deaf' individuals is not simply a matter of perspective since there are deaf people who do not consider themselves part of Deaf culture and hearing people who do, but in practice the groups have a very similar membership. 

Acceptance within Deaf culture can depend on the age at which a person became deaf, attendance at a residential school or college for the deaf, and especially the ability to sign. While children of deaf adults and interpreters may be considered &quot;honorary Deaf&quot;, hearing people are not generally accepted as members of the Deaf community.

==Common beliefs and values in Deaf culture==

The affinity that Deaf people have for one another does not derive from the same source as cultural groups that are based around ethnicity since Deaf people do not necessarily share common ancestry or a common language. They don't share common ancestry since the majority of Deaf people come from hearing families  and Deaf people from around the world are as divided by language barriers as hearing people. In the United Kingdom the dominant sign language is British Sign Language, in the United States, it is American Sign Language, in Australia, it is Auslan and so on. Each of these languages has a distinct grammar and vocabulary that makes them mutually unintelligible in exactly the same way that spoken languages such as English and Chinese are mutually unintelligible.

In many respects it may be more accurate to speak of many distinct Deaf cultures that are specific to particular geographic regions and the specific sign languages that are used in them. There is however a general affinity between Deaf peoples from around the world that is associated with the common physical and cultural obstacles that they face. International events that reinforce this identity include the Deaflympics which has been staged every four years since 1924, though it is not sufficient for athletes to self-identify as members of Deaf culture to participate in this event since qualification is based on clinical deafness.

A belief commonly shared by Deaf people from around the world is that deafness should not be regarded as an impairment or disability. Deaf people are disadvantaged relative to hearing people, but much of this can be attributed to the fact that societies are structured almost exclusively around the concerns of the hearing. However, deaf people are also at a disadvantage simply by virtue of having a channel of information about their environment closed off to them and this is irrespective of how they are treated by the dominant hearing culture.

==Mainstream recognition of Deaf culture==

For much of history, deaf people were expected to adapt to hearing culture as best they were able or to be hidden or invisible. Recently, especially in the United States and the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland), the existence of a Deaf culture has been increasingly recognized. (Charlotte Baker, 1980)

'''Deaf President Now:'''  The 1988 student strike at Gallaudet University, in Washington, D.C., was a watershed moment in the awareness of Deaf culture by the dominant American hearing culture. Deaf President Now student organizers and allies forced the university, which, after all, served an all-deaf and hard of hearing population, to select its first deaf president. Perhaps more importantly, the movement helped frame the struggle of deaf people within the context of a civil rights movement.  Having a leader who can fully understand and relate to this principle was considered vital to the Deaf population.

'''Cultural Centres:''' The Dorothy Miles Cultural Centre, based in Guildford, England, exists to bridge the gap between deaf and hearing people through social, cultural and educational activities. The Centre also offers courses in British Sign Language (BSL) which are accredited by the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People. DMCC runs drama workshops involving professional actors and organises sporting events, including an annual cricket match. There is also widespread availability of BSL courses from other providers across the UK.  Nearly all terrestrial television is closed captioned.

The Deaf Culture Centre opened in 2006 in central Toronto.  A project of the Canadian Cultural Society of the Deaf, it features a museum, art gallery, and gift shop.  It also houses archives and provides facilities for research.  Visitors can sample state-of-the-art visually rich technology highlighting Deaf historical artifacts and literature. There is also an ASL/LSQ interactive website/television and multimedia production studio.

==Cultural Behaviors==
Members of the Deaf culture tend to behave very differently from their hearing counterparts as the differences will be listed below:

*Attention getting devices
**Hearing: Shouting, &quot;Hey!&quot;
**Deaf: Tapping firmly on the shoulder with the whole hand, flickering the lights (to gain the attention of a whole room), stomping the feet, and throwing things at the person.

*Facial Expressions
**Hearing: Extreme emotions are displayed.
**Deaf: All emotions are displayed, as well as grammatical information (these expressions are non-optional markers of grammar).

*Pointing to certain people/things
**Hearing: pointing is often considered rude, though acceptable to give directions for example
**Deaf: pointing is permitted in order to use pronouns in sign language, as well as giving directions, etc.

*Settings of social gatherings
**Hearing: choice of room might be based on what is quietest - no auditory distractions
**Deaf: congregating in the kitchen where there is better lighting, in order to make it easier to see everyone signing

*Introduction rituals
**Hearing: &quot;Nice to meet you&quot;
**Deaf: Long introduction rituals (i.e. Where are you from?  Which schools are you going to?  Who your parents are? and so on)

*Manner how introduction rituals are completed
**Hearing: shaking hands
**Deaf: hugging after rituals (which is very common)

*At the Table
**Hearing: It is considered rude to talk with the mouth full of food
**Deaf: Can &quot;talk&quot; (sign) with mouth full of food

*Misbehaving children
**Hearing: Hearing misbehaving children cover their ears when being scolded at
**Deaf: Deaf misbehaving children cover their eyes when being scolded at

==Deaf Cinema/Theatre==
There are several films that was produced by deaf, those films also included deaf actor/actress.

The company [http://www.aslfilm.com ASL Film] has featured 3 films: &quot;Forget Me Not&quot;, &quot;Wrong Game&quot; and finally a new feature-length film &quot;The Legend of the Mountain Man&quot;. All of those films are in American Sign Language, with no audio, but with optional [[w:subtitles|subtitles]].

==Children of deaf adults==
Children of deaf adults (CODAs) with normal hearing ability may consider themselves, and be considered, culturally Deaf or as members of the deaf community.  In some cases they may need speech therapy due to limited exposure to spoken language.  An organization, also called CODA, was established in 1983 and now holds annual conferences.  There are also support groups for Deaf parents who may be concerned about raising their hearing children, as well as support groups for adult CODAs.

There are also several camps established for CODAs, such as the one at Camp Mark Seven which hosts two separate 2-week programs for CODAs, one from age 9 to 12 and one for CODAs from age 13 to 16 and it usually occurs during the summer, from the last week of June to mid-August.

'''Bimodal bilingualism''' refers to an individual or community's [[multilingualism|bilingual]] competency in (at least) one [[spoken language]] and (at least) one [[sign language|signed language]] (''spoken'' and ''signed'' are the &quot;modes&quot; to which &quot;bimodal&quot; refers). Bimodal bilingualism is often also referred to as '''d/Deaf bilingualism''', but that term is somewhat misleading, as one need not be d/Deaf ([[deaf culture|culturally]] or [[models of deafness|audiologically]]) to be bimodally bilingual (for example, [[Child of Deaf Adult|Children of Deaf Adults]] or other [[hearing (person)|hearing people]] who learn sign language for various reasons). The core group of bimodal bilinguals, though, are Deaf. Deaf people as a group have their own sign language and culture, but invariably live within a larger hearing culture with its own spoken language. Thus, &quot;most deaf people are bilingual to some extent in a spoken language in some form&quot; (Ann 2001).  In discussions of [[multilingualism]] in the [[United States]], bimodal bilingualism and bimodal bilinguals have often not been mentioned or even considered, in part because [[American Sign Language]], the predominant [[sign language]] used in the U.S., only began to be acknowledged as a [[natural language]] in the 1960s (In discussions of bimodal bilingualism in the U.S., the two languages involved are generally ASL and English). However, bimodal bilinguals share many of the same traits as traditional bilinguals (those with competency in at least two ''spoken'' languages), as well as differing in some interesting ways, due to the unique characteristics of the [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]].

==Similarities to spoken language bilingualism==
===Diverse range of language competency===
To be defined as bilingual, an individual need not have perfect fluency or equal skill in both languages (Savic 1996). Bimodal bilinguals, like spoken language bilinguals, exhibit a wide range of language competency in their [[first language|first]] and [[second language|second]] languages. For Deaf people (the majority of bimodal bilinguals in the U.S.), level of competency in ASL and English may be influenced by factors such as degree of [[hearing impairment|hearing loss]], whether the individual is [[prelingual deafness|prelingually]] or [[post-lingual deafness|post-lingually]] deaf, style of and language used in their education, and whether the individual comes from a hearing or Deaf family (Lucas &amp; Valli 1992). Regardless of English competency in other areas, no Deaf individual is likely to comprehend English in the same way as a hearing person when others are speaking it because only a small percentage of English phonemes are clearly visible through lip reading. Additionally, many Deaf bilinguals who have fluency in written English choose not to speak it because of the general social unacceptability of their voices, or because they are unable to monitor factors like pitch and volume (Lucas &amp; Valli 1992).
===Denial of their own bilingualism===
Like hearing spoken language bilinguals, Deaf bimodal bilinguals generally &quot;do not judge themselves to be bilingual&quot; (Grosjean 1992). Whether because they do not believe the signed language to be a legitimate and separate language from the majority spoken language, or because they don't consider themselves sufficiently fluent in one of their languages, denial of one's bilingualism is a common and well-known phenomenon among bilinguals, be they hearing or Deaf (Grosjean 1992).
===Everyday shifts along the language mode continuum===
Deaf or bimodal bilinguals, in their day-to-day lives, move among and between various points on the language mode continuum depending on the situation and the language competency and skills of those with whom they are interacting. For example, when conversing with a monolingual, all bilinguals will restrict themselves to the language of the individual with whom they’re conversing.  However, when interacting with another bilingual, all bilinguals can use a mixture of the two common languages (Grosjean 1992).
===Unequal social status of the languages involved===
As is the case in many situations of spoken language bilingualism, bimodal bilingualism in the U.S. involves two languages with vastly different social status. ASL has traditionally not even had the status of being considered a legitimate language, and Deaf children have been prevented from learning it through such &quot;methods&quot; as having their hands tied together. Hearing parents of Deaf children have historically been advised not to allow their children to learn ASL, as they were informed it would prevent the acquisition of English. Despite the fact that Deaf children's early exposure to ASL has now been shown to enhance their aptitude for acquiring English competency, the unequal social status of ASL and English, and of signed languages and spoken languages, remains (Davis 1989) (Lucas &amp; Valli 1992).
==Differences from spoken language bilingualism==
===Lack of societal acknowledgment of bilingual community status===
Since linguists didn’t recognize ASL as a true language until the second half of the twentieth century, there has been very little acknowledgment of, or attention or study devoted to, the bilingual status of the American Deaf community (Grosjean 1992). Deaf people are often &quot;still seen by many as monolingual in the majority language whereas in fact many are bilingual in that language and in sign&quot; (Grosjean 1992).
===Bilingual language mode: &quot;Contact Signing&quot;===
Because almost all members of the American Deaf community are to some extent bilingual in ASL and English, it is rare that a Deaf person will find themself conversing with a person who is monolingual in ASL. Therefore, unless an American Deaf person is communicating with someone who is monolingual in English (the majority language), he or she can expect to be conversing in a &quot;bilingual language mode” (Grosjean 1992). The result of this prolonged bilingual contact and mixing between a sign language and a spoken language is known as [[Contact Sign|Contact Signing]] (Lucas &amp; Valli 1992).
===Unlikelihood of large-scale language shift===
[[Language shift]] &quot;occurs when speakers in a community give up speaking their language and take up the use of another in its place&quot; (Ann 2001). ASL in particular, and signed languages in general, are undeniably influenced by their close contact with English or other spoken languages, as evidenced by phenomena such as &quot;loan signs&quot; or lexicalized fingerspelling (the signed language equivalent of [[loanword]]s), and through the influence of [[Contact Sign]]. However, due to the ''physical'' fact of deafness or hearing loss, d/Deaf people generally cannot acquire and ''speak'' the majority language in the same way or with the same competency that the hearing population does. Simultaneously, Deaf people still often have a need or desire to learn some form of English in order to communicate with family members and the majority culture (Davis 1989). Thus, Deaf communities and individuals, in contrast to many hearing bilingual communities and individuals, will tend to &quot;remain bilingual throughout their lives and from generation to generation&quot; (Grosjean 1992).
