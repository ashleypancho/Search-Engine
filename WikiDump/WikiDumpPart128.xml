== there is no suck thing as שלום אם ==

the hebrew way of saying &quot;hello mother&quot; is שלום אמא, shalom em means something like &quot;hello a mother&quot;.

== How to say: brother, sister... ==

We learn how to say cousin, but... how about: ''brother, sister, parents, grandparents, grandmother, grandfather, grandson, granddaughter, children, grandchildren'' ?

And why ''love'' but not, e.g., ''family''?

== Need more Exclusive dedicated material ==

I have also viewed the original 'unilang' page, I appreciated the attempt made by the author and thank Wikipedia for all their efforts in every stream to bring information and knowledge for free which is right and the way it should be. My limited knowledge on how to use wiki has been a hindrance towards my contributions towards wiki, which I am working upon and will try to bring in some good stuff. Thanks to wiki again. Will bookmark and try to contribute more.</text>

== WE versus YE ==

This article does not mention that the Kana for ゑ/ヱ has Western usage as YE, as in the word &quot;Yen&quot;, &quot;Yebisu&quot;, and archaic writing of Tokyo as Yedo (Edo), as it appears in chapter 11 of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, as well as in the short tale Yuki-Onna from Kwaidan by Lafcadio Hearn.  

According to two articles on Sci.Lang.Japan (http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/yen.html), (http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/yeyi.html) this usage is a result of romanization in Hepburn's dictionary of 1867.  While this may not be correct usage, its acknowledgement may clarify confusion among English-speaking students of Japanese.

== Old Letter-Writing-Instructions Pics ==

Hi,
Where can I find the old pictures the shows you how to write each letter, and not in animation.
It's nice, but how can you print it?

: Hi. I think your question brings up a good point, perhaps we should add some external links to this book. In the meantime, check out [http://www.japan-zone.com/new/pix/common_kanji.gif this chart], hope it helps! --[[User:Girdi|Girdi]] ([[User talk:Girdi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Girdi|contribs]]) 20:50, 6 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Completeness ==

Although the kanji for father and mother both included ''kata'' (方), the character was not offered in this lesson.  I feel this is important, particularly because ''kata'' only differs from ''man'' (万) by one stroke, and the two can be easily confused.  

Additionally the word &quot;omoya&quot; (母家) involves the use of a ten-stroke character that for beginners will be difficult to write and retain.  

Last, the vocabulary offered in the examples isn't anything I've heard actually come up in conversation.  Its usability in practical situations is remote.  I find that for kanji lessons to be useful, the lesson should be based on building vocabulary, and should incorporate combinations of basic kanji that can be rearranged and used together, in the way that &quot;fubo&quot; (父母) was.

However, the animations are excellent writing guides, and the overall presentation is clear and easy to read.  Likewise, the presentation of the numbers in these first three lessons is straightforward and handy.

== Needs moving ==

The test has been rescaled, and the old level 2 (that this page name references) has become level N2.  The new name should be something like &quot;JLPT Guide/JLPT N2 Grammar&quot;.  Anyone opposed?  --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 07:09, 30 November 2010 (UTC)
: Page was moved, thanks! --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 23:19, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

== Source of information ==

The information here is lengthy and if cleaned up looks quite useful.  Was this copied from elsewhere, or was it written by the poster?  For example, part of it is identical to [http://mehrez.kristou.org/page/37/].  Is there a copyright problem here?  --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 07:13, 30 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Page should be moved. ==

The test has been rescaled, and the old level 3 (that this page name references) has become level N4.  The new name should be something like &quot;JLPT Guide/JLPT N4 Kanji&quot;.  Anyone opposed?  --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 07:05, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

== Removing some romaji ==

We list the onyomi and kunyomi in kana and romaji, which is redundant.  Kana is the standard way of showing the reading, and the test taker must learn it anyway, so is removing the romaji fine? --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 04:24, 2 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

== I'd Like to Offer My Help ==

I am a native Kapangpangan speaker.  I noticed you needed help with audio portions or this book.  I can help with that.  Let me know.
:Thanks, but you haven't left a signature to identify yourself, MetungKP, it makes it easier for us to know who is talking if you sign your message using four tildes like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

I am reverting the last 3 changes which removed the y. This books stated that it is not concerned with the old Spanish spelling of the Pampango writing, but with the modern spelling of Kapampangan only. --[[User:Lgriot|Lgriot]] ([[User talk:Lgriot|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lgriot|contribs]]) 17:19, 8 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

I am reverting all the changes that 

1. introduce new words that are not explained (you can't do this, this is a language text book).

2. change the spelling of English words into American English spelling (this book uses British Commonwealth spelling).

3. change the spelling of Kapampangan words into the old Spanish spelling (this book uses Tagalog-based spelling as explained earlier) --[[User:Lgriot|Lgriot]] ([[User talk:Lgriot|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lgriot|contribs]]) 16:15, 8 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

== tsa?? ==

I don't remember us pronouncing tea as literally &quot;tsssa&quot;...  I remember we pronounce it as the Japanese, Korean, and Chinese do, &quot;cha&quot;, in fact, we pronounce everything with &quot;ts&quot; as &quot;ch&quot;.  The pronunciations need to be checked.--[[Special:Contributions/50.168.47.113|50.168.47.113]] ([[User talk:50.168.47.113|discuss]]) 02:30, 29 September 2013 (UTC)</text>

For an example of (ㅌ ㄴ) what about 맡는? 맡다 means &quot;keep,carry&quot;.[[Special:Contributions/119.202.86.57|119.202.86.57]] ([[User talk:119.202.86.57|discuss]]) 11:42, 22 May 2011 (UTC)

      <comment>Mixed script Korean Bible as 백팔대참회문 is incorrect.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}}
Intro gives mixed script Korean Bible as 백팔대참회문, but that is a Korean Buddhist text (prayer book, I think) - nothing to do with the Bible.  If I can find out how a mixed script Bible is referred to, I'll correct it.</text>

This page wrongly refers to the son of one's father's brother as a nephew. That is actually a cousin.
A nephew is the son of one's brother (or sister). Perhaps what's meant is &quot;son of one's brother&quot; or &quot;son of one's father's son&quot; (i.e. son of one's brother or of one's paternal half-brother).
Clarification is needed.</text>

== Rohingya Language doesn't exist  ==

Rohingya is so called Fake named used by Bangladeshi illegal immigrants. So they don't have any alphabets at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}}

== Tonality in script ==

&quot;Also, the Sumerian writing system, one might imagine, would have developed a way to capture tonality in the script, as has happened in most other tonal scripts.&quot;

I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. By the very fact that, say, du and du3 are distinguished in the script, tones (provided that the difference was tonal) are reflected in it. If, on the other hand, the author means that the script should designate the tones as such directly and predictably, that would have made it a phonetic script and not a logographic one. The only other logographic script for a tonal language that I can think of, the Chinese one, is certainly not phonetic in that way, as it does not have any special signs for the tones as such. Thai is not comparable, since its tones developed after the orthography had been established, and again it is not the tones but the historical tone-conditioning consonants that are expressed in the script. Other &quot;tonal scripts&quot; have mostly been created in modern times and are Latin-based - we can hardly be surprised that the Sumerian one is not like them.--[[Special:Contributions/91.148.159.4|91.148.159.4]] ([[User talk:91.148.159.4|discuss]]) 18:27, 22 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

== more explanation needed... ==

I could use this explained better....

&quot;So instead of saying I am your king = lugal.zu i.men, we could just as easily say lugal.zu.en. Simple as that! The meaning is the same, it's just a little bit of syntactic variety to a common expression&quot;

&quot;I am your king&quot; could be /lugal.zu i.men/ or /lugal.zu.en/

would that be the same for &quot;He/she is your king&quot; ...can we say, /lugal.zu i.me.am/ OR /lugal.zu.en/ .. if not how does the copula work in this instance?</text>

== /z/ phoneme in Telugu ==

The word for true is &quot;nizame.&quot; The romanization I just typed is exactly how it sounds in Telugu. The problem is that the IPA for it is incorrect. /nid͡ʒaːme/ should actually be /nizəːme/ otherwise the romanization would've been &quot;nijaame&quot;. It seems like someone just transliterated the Telugu script into IPA and paid no attention to pronunciation, because the script uses /d͡ʒ/ to represent /z/ like Devnagri. Of course, this could be different from my Gunturi dialect. I am going to go ahead and change it.

== Towards a larger audience ==
I wouldn't mind to include a translation to Portuguese from the English as the book evolves. This could also be interesting for those learning English and Portuguese especially if they understand Tetum.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:46, 6 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">    My name is Ryan Gaudreau and this is my first semester at Old Dominion University. I have transfered in credits from the University of Connecticut and Quinebaug Valley Community College and am almost a Junior. I just took basic college courses on and off after high school. I enjoy school. I am a fairly laid back person, I work well with others, and look forward to the opportunities here at ODU. 
    I always wanted to teach and I get pretty excited about sciences so that is what I am persuing. I live off campus and am very active in the community. I grew up in New England, but have lived in this area for a year now. I enjoy the area and most importantly, the people I have met here. 
    Because of my interest and passion in science, I can effectively communicate the knowledge I have about it well. I seem to make it interesting, even for people who do not seen too interested in it. As of yet, I am planning on teaching high school and look forward to learning techniques to excel in the education field. 
    Often students have this impression that they &quot;have&quot; to be in school, and essentialy, do not want to be. I look forward to making class fun and even inspirational. You really cannot transmit something you have not got, so I hope I remain inspired and fun loving!

'''Traffic lights''', which may also be  known as '''stoplights''', '''traffic lamps''', '''traffic signals''', '''stop-and-go lights'''{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, '''robots'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydriverslicence.co.za/driving_%20road_signs.htm  The meaning of traffic lights/red green and amber robots - South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''semaphore'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techtransfer.berkeley.edu/newsletter/07-4/traffic_signals.php A Brief History of Traffic Signals- UCA Berkely]&lt;/ref&gt;, are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, [[pedestrian crossing]]s and other locations to control competing flows of traffic. Traffic lights have been installed in most cities around the world. They assign the [[Right-of-way (traffic)|right of way]] to road users by the use of lights in standard colors ([[Red]] - [[Amber (color)|Yellow]] - [[Green]]),  using a universal [[color code]] (and a precise sequence, for those who are [[w:color blindness|color blind]]). 

Typically traffic lights consist of a set of three colored lights: red, yellow and green. In a typical cycle,
*Illumination of the green light allows traffic to proceed in the direction denoted,
*Illumination of the yellow light denoting if safe to, prepare to stop short of the intersection, and
*Illumination of the red signal prohibits any traffic from proceeding.

Usually, the red light contains some [[orange (color)|orange]] in its [[hue]], and the green light contains some blue, to provide some support for people with red-green color blindness.

==History==
[[Image:Marshalite traffic signal, Melbourne Museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marshalite]] traffic signal. Formerly fitted in various intersections in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], indicating how much time remained before a signal change.]]

On December 10, 1868, the first traffic lights were installed outside the [[Palace of Westminster|British Houses of Parliament]] in [[London]], by the railway engineer [[J. P. Knight]].  They resembled [[railway signal]]s of the time, with [[semaphore]] arms and red and green gas lamps for night use.
The gas lantern was turned with a lever at its base so that the appropriate light faced traffic. Unfortunately, it exploded on 2 January 1869, injuring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2009/07/16/john_peake_knight_traffic_lights_feature.shtml|title=The man who gave us traffic lights|date=2009-07-16|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or killing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Lance|coauthors=Ian McNeil|title=Biographical dictionary of the history of technology|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1996|pages=404–5|isbn=0415060427|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9HQDGHQzVqAC&amp;pg=PA404&amp;lpg=PA404&amp;dq=John+Peake+Knight%2Bobituary&amp;q=John%20Peake%20Knight%2Bobituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; the policeman who was operating it.

The modern [[electric]] traffic light is an American [[invention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blasphalt.htm |title=The History of Roads and Asphalt |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=1952-02-05 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1912 in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], policeman [[Lester Wire]] invented the first red-green electric traffic lights.  On 5 August 1914, the [[American Traffic Signal Company]] installed a traffic signal system on the corner of East 105th Street and Euclid Avenue in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sessions|first=Gordon M.|title=Traffic devices: historical aspects thereof|year=1971|publisher=Institute of Traffic Engineers|location=Washington|oclc=278619|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Traffic Signal Installed|journal=The Motorist : official journal of the Ohio State Automobile Association|publisher=Ken Pub. Co|pages=28–29|month=August|year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had two colors, red and green, and a [[buzzer]], based on the design of James Hoge, to provide a warning for color changes. The design by James Hoge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01251666&amp;PageNum=6&amp;idkey=NONE |title=USPTO # 1251666 Sept. 22, 1913 |publisher=Patimg2.uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed police and fire stations to control the signals in case of emergency. The first four-way, three-color traffic light was created by [[police officer]] [[William Potts]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sheldon|last=Moyer|title=Mr. 'Trafficlight'|journal=Motor News|publisher=Automobile Club of Michigan|pages=14–15,27|month=March|year=1947| url=http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/trfclt/mrtrafficlight/mrtrafficlight.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922, T.E. Hayes patented his &quot;Combination traffic guide and traffic regulating signal&quot; (Patent # 1447659).  [[Ashville, Ohio]] claims to be the location of the oldest working traffic light in the United States, used at an intersection of public roads until 1982 when it was moved to a local museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohiosmalltownmuseum.org/museum1.htm Neato Stuff At the Ashville Museum]. ''Ashville Area Heritage Society''. Retrieved 2008-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interconnected traffic signal system was installed in [[Salt Lake City]] in 1917,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} with six connected intersections controlled simultaneously from a manual switch. [[Automatic]] control of interconnected traffic lights was introduced March 1922 in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 1.5: &quot;System Evolution&quot;, ''[http://www.spcregion.org/downloads/ops/FHWA_TrafficControlSystemsHandbook_10-2005-FINAL.pdf Traffic Control Systems Handbook]'', [[Federal Highway Administration]] Report FHWA-HOP-06-006, October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[automatic]] experimental traffic lights in [[England]] were deployed in [[Wolverhampton]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/plaques/LichfieldStreet.htm Wolverhampton's Blue Plaques]. Wolverhampton History &amp; Heritage Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The color of the traffic lights representing stop and go might be derived from those used to identify port (red) and starboard (green) in maritime rules governing  [[Port and starboard#Right-of-way for other vessels|right of way]], where the vessel on the left must stop for the one crossing on the right.

Timers on traffic lights originated in Taipei, Taiwan, and brought to the US after an engineer discovered its use.  Though uncommon in most American urban areas, timers are still used in some other Western Hemisphere countries. Timers are useful for drivers/pedestrians to plan if there is enough time to attempt to cross the intersection before the light turns red and conversely, the amount of time before the light turns green.

== Types ==
{{Main|List of variations in traffic light signalling and operation}}
[[Image:Traffic lights.jpg|thumb|right|Traffic lights can have several additional lights for filter turns or bus lanes. This one in [[Warrington]], [[United Kingdom]], also shows the red + amber combination seen in a number of European countries. It also shows the backing board and white border used to increase the target value of the signal head. Improved visibility of the signal head is achieved during the night by using the retro-reflective white border.]]

===Single aspects===
The simplest traffic light comprises either a single or a pair of colored aspects that warns any user of the shared right of way of a possible conflict or danger. 

Flashing Red: Treat as a [[stop sign]]&lt;br&gt;
Flashing Amber: Caution, crossing or road hazard ahead
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
Flashing Green: Varies among jurisdiction

===Dual aspects===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
===Three or more aspects===

The universal standard is for the red to be above the green, with amber placed in between. When mounted vertically red is on top, and when mounted horizontally, red is the leftmost light. In addition to the standard red amber and green aspects, other aspects are usually mounted when intersection require more control (i.e. public transport, and permissive turns). Traffic lights in this configuration tend to have a delay between any entry points to allow any residual traffic in the intersection to clear. The delay can be dependent upon the type of intersection, traffic, and road conditions.

===Pedestrian and cyclist crossing lights===
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:AnimatedTrafficLight.ogg|Animated traffic light seen in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

When condition require a signalized crossing for non-motorized traffic, crosswalk signals are implemented into the intersection

====European Standard====
The European approach to a signalized crossing is use dual or more rarely, a triple aspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/trafficlightsignals2/euroheads.htm Freewebs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with a blackened out lens of a [[Pictogram]] pedestrian. For cyclist, the same approach is used with the lens blackened out for a bicycle frame. It is not uncommon to see lenses with both symbols on them. &lt;br&gt; 

Light Sequence;&lt;br&gt;
Green: Cross with caution&lt;br&gt;
Amber (if used): Same value as a flashing green &lt;br&gt;
Flashing Green: Continue to cross if already in the intersection. Do not start to cross&lt;br&gt;
Red: Do not cross

====North American Standard====
In North America, the most common aspects found are text only lenses (WALK/ DON'T WALK), and the pictogram stop hand (in Red) and a walking person (in white). Increasing for retrofits of dual aspects and newer installations, the lower aspect formally used for the walk signal (walking person) is being replaced with a timer countdown.

Light Sequence;&lt;br&gt;
Green (Walking Person or WALK); Cross with caution&lt;br&gt;
Flashing Red (Stop hand or DON'T WALK); Continue to cross if already in the intersection. Do not start to cross&lt;br&gt;
Red; Do not cross

====Asia====
Japan
Light Sequence; &lt;br&gt;
Green: Cross&lt;br&gt;
Yellow: Cross if already in intersection, otherwise do not (however by law, you are allowed to cross) &lt;br&gt;
Red: Do not cross&lt;br&gt;
Green (sometimes blue)Arrow: Turn only the direction the arrow points
Pedestrians:
Green man: Walk &lt;br&gt;
Flashing Green Man: Cross if already in intersection, otherwise do not &lt;br&gt;
Red Man: Do not cross &lt;br&gt;
Japan generally does not have timers that accompany the signal, however some new signals will have this function.
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}

====Oceania====
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}

Some traffic-light controlled junctions have a light sequence that stops all vehicular [[traffic]] at the junction at the same time, and gives pedestrians exclusive access to the intersection so that they can cross in any direction (including diagonally).  This is known as a [[pedestrian scramble]] in some places.  [[Ampelmännchen]] pedestrian traffic signals have come to be seen as a nostalgic sign for the former [[German Democratic Republic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

'''Australia:'''
In Australia, a red man means do not cross, a green man means cross and a red flashing man means finish crossing.

==Lights for public transport==

[[Image:Т-образный светофор.JPG|thumb|4-lamp public transport traffic light in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], showing &quot;stop&quot; signal.]]
[[Image:Ampel muenchen.jpg|thumb|Traffic light in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], showing a special [[bus]] signal.]]

Traffic lights for public transport often use signals that are distinct from those for private traffic. They can be letters, arrows or bars of white or colored light. 

In [[Portland, Oregon]], the tram signals feature a horizontal white bar and an orange vertical bar.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Some systems use the letter B for buses, and T for trams.

In [[Russia]], dedicated traffic signals for public transport (tram, trolleybus or bus) have four white lights that form the letter T.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} If the three top lamps are lit, this means &quot;stop&quot;. If the bottom lamp and some lamps on the top row are lit, this means permission to go in a direction shown. In case of a tram signal, if there are no tram junctions on an intersection, a simpler system of one amber signal in the form of letter T is used instead; the tram must proceed only when the signal is lit.

In North European countries the tram signals feature white lights of different forms: &quot;S&quot; for &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;—&quot; for &quot;caution&quot; and arrows to permit passage in a given direction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

[[Image:Public transportation traffic lights in NL and BE.svg|border|none|300px]]

The [[Netherlands]] use a distinctive &quot;negenoog&quot; (nine-eyed) design shown on the top row of the diagram;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://wetten.overheid.nl/cgi-bin/deeplink/law1/title=RVV RVV 1990 artikel 70] Official regulation of traffic rules and traffic signs]&lt;/ref&gt; bottom row signals are used in [[Belgium]] and [[France]]. The signals mean (from left to right): &quot;go straight ahead&quot;, &quot;go left&quot;, &quot;go right&quot;, &quot;go in any direction&quot; (like the &quot;green&quot; of a normal traffic light), &quot;stop, unless the emergency brake is needed&quot; (equal to &quot;yellow&quot;), and &quot;stop&quot; (equal to &quot;red&quot;).

The [[Hiawatha Line]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] uses a simplified variant of the Belgian/French system in the city's central business district where only the &quot;go&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; configurations are used.  A third signal equal to yellow is accomplished by flashing the &quot;go&quot; signal.

In [[Japan]], tram signals are under the regular vehicle signal; however the color of the signal for the tram is coloured orange.

===Preemption===
{{Main|Traffic signal preemption}}

Some regions have signals that are interruptible, giving priority to special traffic.  Such ''traffic light preemption'' is usually reserved for [[emergency vehicle]]s such as [[fire apparatus]], [[ambulance]]s, and [[police]] [[squad car]]s, though sometimes [[mass transit]] vehicles including [[buses]] and [[light rail]] trains can interrupt lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Emergency vehicle traffic signal preemption system  | work=United States Patent and Trademark Office | url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=6326903| accessdate=October 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part4/part4f.htm Chapter 4F] of the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the systems operate with small transmitters that send radio waves, [[infrared]] signals, or [[strobe light]] signals that are received by a sensor on or near the traffic lights.  Some systems use audio detection, where a certain type of siren must be used and detected by a receiver on the traffic light structure. 

Upon activation the normal traffic light cycle is suspended and replaced by the &quot;preemption sequence&quot;: the traffic lights to all approaches to the intersection are switched to &quot;red&quot; with the exception of the light for the vehicle that has triggered the preemption sequence. Sometimes, an additional signal light is placed nearby to indicate to the preempting vehicle that the preempting sequence has been activated and to warn other motorists of the approach of an emergency vehicle. The normal traffic light cycle resumes after the sensor has been passed by the vehicle that triggered the preemption.

In lieu of pre-emptive mechanisms, in most jurisdictions,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} emergency vehicles are not required to respect traffic lights, but must activate their own emergency lights when crossing an intersection against the light, in order to alert oncoming drivers to the preemption.

==Turning signals and rules==
[[Image:Traffic lights 4 states.svg|thumb|left|Overview of UK 4-state traffic lights:&lt;ref name=UKHC&gt;{{cite web |title=Signs and markings |work=Highway Code |publisher=UK Government |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/Signsandmarkings/index.htm |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1&amp;2. Stop; 3. Go if clear; 4. Stop if safe to do so]]
[[Image:Traffic light.gif|thumb|Animation of a 3-state traffic signal cycle]]
[[Image:Colourblind traffic signal.JPG|thumb|right|A traffic signal in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] with specially-shaped lights to assist people with color blindness.]]
In some instances, traffic may turn left (in left-driving jurisdictions) or right (in right-driving jurisdictions) after stopping at a red light, providing they give way to the pedestrians and other vehicles.  In some places that generally disallow this, a sign next to the traffic light indicates that it is allowed at a particular intersection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/trafficinformation/trafficfacilities/trafficsigns/r2/r2-20.html NSW.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, jurisdictions that generally allow this might forbid it at a particular intersection with a &quot;no turn on red&quot; sign, or put a green arrow to indicate specifically when a turn is allowed without having to [[yield sign|yield]] to pedestrians (this is usually when traffic from the perpendicular street is making a turn onto one's street and thus no pedestrians are allowed in the intersection anyway).  Some jurisdictions allow turning on red in the opposite direction (left in right-driving countries; right in left-driving countries) from a one-way road onto another one-way road; some of these even allow these turns from a two-way road onto a one-way road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/washington/codes/title46/46.61.055.html Justia.com] para 3a.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also differing is whether a red arrow prohibits turns; some jurisdictions require a &quot;no turn on red&quot; sign in these cases.  A study in the [[Illinois|State of Illinois]] (a right-driving jurisdiction) concluded that allowing drivers to proceed straight on red after stopping, at specially posted T-intersections where the intersecting road went left only, was dangerous.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Proceeding straight on red at T-intersections where the intersecting road went left only used to be legal in [[Mainland China]], with right-hand traffic provided that such movement would not interfere with other traffic, but when the [[Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China]] took effect on 1 May 2004, such movement was outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jusjih/trafficlightsignals.html#turnred |title=Traffic Light Signals and Red Light Cameras |publisher=Geocities.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/20040724025749/www.geocities.com/jusjih/trafficlightsignals.html#turnred|archivedate=2004-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some other countries, the permission is indicated by a flashing amber arrow (cars do not have to stop but must give way to other cars and pedestrians).

Another distinction is between intersections that have dedicated signals for turning across the flow of opposing traffic and those that do not.  Such signals are called dedicated left-turn lights in the United States and Canada (since opposing traffic is on the left).  With dedicated left turn signals, a left-pointing arrow turns green when traffic may turn left without opposing traffic and pedestrian conflict, and turns red or disappears otherwise.  Such a signal is referred to as a &quot;protected&quot; signal if it has its own red phase; a &quot;permissive&quot; signal does not have such a feature.  Three standard versions of the permissive signal exist:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  One version is a horizontal bar with five lights - the green and yellow arrows are located between the standard green and yellow lights.  A vertical 5-light bar holds the arrows underneath the standard green light (in this arrangement, the yellow arrow is sometimes omitted, leaving only the green arrow below the solid green light, or possibly an [[LED]] based device capable of showing both green and yellow arrows within a single lamp housing).  Some newer LED turn arrows seen in parts of [[Canada]] are capable of multicolored animation.  Such lights will often display a flashing and animated green or yellow arrow when the dedicated turn is allowed, but then transform into a red arrow on a white background with a red line through it, emphasising that the turn is no longer allowed.  These lights will also often have the words &quot;NO TURN&quot; displayed, or an explanatory reason why the turn is not allowed, such as &quot;TRAIN&quot; in the case of a rail or light rail crossing.  A third type is known as a &quot;doghouse&quot; or &quot;cluster head&quot; - a vertical column with the two normal lights is on the right side of the signal, a vertical column with the two arrows is located on the left, and the normal red signal is in the middle above the two columns.  Cluster signals in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] use six signals, the sixth being a red arrow that can operate separately from the standard red light. In a fourth type, sometimes seen at intersections in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec|Quebec, Canada]], there is no dedicated left-turn lamp per se.  Instead, the normal green lamp flashes rapidly, indicating permission to go straight as well as make a left turn in front of opposing traffic, which is being held by a steady red lamp. (This &quot;advance green,&quot; or flashing green can be somewhat startling and confusing to drivers not familiar with this system. This also can cause confusion amongst visitors to British Columbia, where a flashing green signal denotes a pedestrian controlled intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.icbc.com/Licensing/RoadSense%20for%20Drivers%20PDFs/RoadSense_for_Drivers_Signs_Signals_and_Road_Markings_MV2075.pdf  RoadSense for Drivers - Signs, Signals and Road Markings]}} Accessed: 05 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;)  Another interesting practice seen at least in Ontario is that cars wishing to turn left that arrived after the left turn signal ended can do so during the amber phase, as long as there is enough time to make a safe turn.

A flashing amber arrow, which allows drivers to make left turns after giving way to oncoming traffic, is becoming more widespread in the United States, particularly in Oregon.  In the normal sequence, a protected green left-turn arrow will first change to a solid amber arrow to indicate the end of the protected phase, then to a flashing amber arrow, which remains flashing until the standard green light changes to amber and red.  These generally take the form of four signal sections (green, amber, amber, red). On some newer signals, notably in the city of Bend, the green and flashing amber arrows emanate from the same light section through the use of a dual-color LED array, while the solid amber arrow is mounted above it.

Generally, a dedicated left-turn signal is illuminated at the beginning of the green phase of the green-yellow-red-green cycle. This is called a leading turn. This allows left-turn traffic, which often consists of just a few cars, to vacate the intersection quickly before giving priority to vehicles traveling straight.  This increases the throughput of left-turn traffic while reducing the number of drivers, perhaps frustrated by long waits in heavy traffic for opposing traffic to clear, attempting to make an illegal left turn on red. A dedicated left-turn signal that appears at the end of the green phase is called a lagging turn. If there is no left-turn signal, the law requires one to yield to oncoming traffic and turn when the intersection is clear and it is safe to do so.  Nevertheless, it is increasingly and disturbingly common in at least the U.S. to see drivers who do not yield in the absence of a dedicated signal, cutting off traffic that has right-of-way and is starting to head across the intersection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  In the U.S., many older inner-city and rural areas do not have dedicated left-turn lights, while most newer suburban areas have them.  Such lights tend to decrease the overall efficiency of the intersection as it becomes congested, although it makes intersections safer by reducing the risk of head-on collisions and may even speed up through traffic, but if a significant amount of traffic is turning, a dedicated turn signal helps eliminate congestion.

Some intersections with protected-turn signals occasionally have what is known as &quot;[[yellow trap]]&quot;, &quot;lag-trap&quot;, or &quot;left turn trap&quot; (in right-driving countries).{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} It occurs at intersections where vehicles are permitted to make left turns on normal green lights. &quot;Yellow trap&quot; refers to situations when left-turning drivers are trapped in the intersection with a red light, while opposing traffic still has a green.  In British Columbia, the law addresses this problem by giving a left-turning driver already in an intersection the right-of-way to make the turn once the intersection is otherwise clear, regardless of the traffic light state.

For example, an intersection has dedicated left-turn signals for traffic traveling north.  The southbound traffic gets a red light so northbound traffic can make a left turn, but the straight-through northbound traffic continues to get a green light. A southbound driver who had entered the intersection earlier will now be in a predicament, since they have no idea whether traffic continuing straight for both directions is becoming red, or just their direction.  The driver will now have to check the traffic light behind them, which is often impossible from the viewing angle of a driver's seat.  This can also happen when emergency vehicles or railroads preempt normal signal operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/midimagic@sbcglobal.net/lagtrpqz.htm |title=Lag-Trap Quiz |publisher=Geocities.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/20090915215755/www.geocities.com/midimagic@sbcglobal.net/lagtrpqz.htm|archivedate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, signs reading &quot;Oncoming traffic has extended green&quot; or &quot;Oncoming traffic may have extended green&quot; must be posted at intersections where the &quot;yellow trap&quot; condition exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2003r1r2/part4/part4d.htm#section4D05 |title=FHWA - MUTCD - 2003 Edition Revision 1 Chapter 4D |publisher=Mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2003r1r2/part2/part2c.htm#section2C39 |title=FHWA - MUTCD - 2003 Edition Revision 1 Chapter 2C |publisher=Mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[motorcycle]]s and [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] in most jurisdictions follow the same traffic signal rules for left turns as do cars and trucks, some places, such as [[Taiwan]], have different rules.  In these areas, it is not permitted for such small and often hard-to-see vehicles to turn left in front of oncoming traffic on certain high-volume roads when there is no dedicated left-turn signal.  Instead, in order to make a left turn, the rider moves to the right side of the road, travels through the first half of the intersection on green, then slows down and stops directly in front of the line of cars on the driver's right waiting to travel across the intersection, which are of course being held by a red light.  There is often a white box painted on the road in this location to indicate where the riders should group.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  The rider turns the bike 90 degrees to the left from the original direction of travel and proceeds along with the line of cars when the red light turns green, completing the left turn.  This procedure improves safety because the rider never has to cross oncoming traffic, which is particularly important given the much greater likelihood of injury when a cycle is hit by a car or truck. This system (called a &quot;[[hook turn]]&quot;) is also used at many intersections in the CBD of Melbourne, Australia, where either or both streets carry tramways. This is done so right-turning vehicles (Australia drives on the left) do not block the passage of trams. The system is being extended to the suburbs.

==Lane control==
{{Main|Lane control lights}}

Lane control lights are a specific type of [[Traffic lights|traffic light]] used to manage traffic on a multi-way road or highway. Typically they allow or forbid traffic to use or more of the available lanes by the use of green lights or arrows (to permit) or by red lights or crosses (to prohibit).

==Special provisions==

Traffic light failure in most jurisdictions must be handled by drivers as a priority-to-the-right intersection in both drive-on-the-left Australia and some states of the mainly drive-on-the-right Europe, or an all-way stop elsewhere, pending the arrival of a [[Police|police officer]] to direct traffic. 

Some jurisdictions, however, have additional [[Traffic#Right of way|right-of-way]] signs mounted above, below or next to the traffic lights; these take effect when the lights are no longer active. (In [[Italy]] as well as some jurisdictions in the US, traffic lights inactive at nighttime emit an amber-colored flashing signal in directions owing priority while the intersecting street emit a flashing red light, requiring drivers to stop before proceeding. In [[Germany]] the priority directions will not be illuminated while the intersecting streets will be shown a flashing yellow signal.) In the [[UK]] and parts of [[North America]], drivers simply treat the junction as being uncontrolled when traffic lights fail, giving way as appropriate, unless a police officer is present.  In much of the United States failed traffic signals must be treated as [[all-way stop]] intersections.

==Dummy lights==
[[Image:Dummy Light.jpg|thumb|Historic dummy light in [[Canajoharie (village), New York|Canajoharie, New York]], [[United States]]]]
A dummy light is a traffic light that stands on a pedestal in the middle of an intersection.  There are at least three that still operate in the United States today, all located in [[New York|New York State]]: [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]], [[Canajoharie (village), New York|Canajoharie]] and [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  There have been a number of requests in recent years for these traffic lights to be removed due to safety concerns, but the historic value has kept these landmarks at their original locations.

==Technology==
===Optics and lighting===
[[Image:LED traffic light.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An example of an LED traffic light [[Australia]]]]
Traditionally, incandescent and halogen bulbs were used. Because of the low efficiency of light output and a single point of failure (filament burnout) municipalities are increasingly retrofitting traffic signals with [[Light Emitting Diodes|LED]] arrays
that consume less power, have increased light output, last significantly longer, and in the event of an individual LED failure, still operates albeit with a reduced light output. With the use of optics, the light pattern of an LED array can be comparable 
with the pattern of an incandescent or halogen bulb.

===Programmable visibility signals===

[[Image:First and Mill 3Ms img14.jpg|right|250px|thumb|3M traffic signals installed in [[Shelton, Washington]], [[United States]]. Standing off-axis from the intended viewing area, these signals appear to be &quot;off&quot; or invisible to adjacent lanes of traffic during the daytime. (A faint glow is present in the lit indication when viewed at night)]]
[[Image:First and Mill 3Ms img07.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The same two signals above, taken in the signal's intended viewing area (a single lane of northbound traffic). Special light-diffusing optics and a colored fresnel lens create the indication.]]Signals such as the [[3M High Visibility Signals|3M High Visibility Signal]] and McCain Programmable Visibility signal, utilize light diffusing optics and a powerful fresnel lens to create the signal indication. Lit via a powerful 150W PAR46 sealed-beam lamp, the light from the lamp in these &quot;programmable visibility&quot; signals passes through a set of two glass lenses at the back of the signal. The first lens, a frosted glass diffusing lens, diffuses the light into a uniform ball of light around five inches in diameter. The light then passes through a nearly identical lens known as an optical limiter (3M's definition of the lens itself), also known as a &quot;programming lens&quot;, also five inches in diameter.  

Using a special aluminium foil-based adhesive tape, these signals are &quot;masked&quot; or programmed via the programming lens so that only certain lanes of traffic will view the indication. At the front of these programmable visibility signals is a 12&quot; fresnel lens, each lens tinted to meet United States [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] (ITE) chromaticity and luminance standards. The fresnel lens (3M utilized a square lens masked to create a ball indication, McCain used a circular lens itself) focuses or concentrates the light output created by the lamp, and creates a uniform display of light for the lane in which it is intended. These signals were first developed by the [[3M]] Company in the late 1960s,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and were wildly popular in the late 1970s as traffic density increased.

In addition to being positioned and mounted for desired visibility for their respective traffic, some traffic lights are also aimed, louvered, or shaded to minimize mis-interpretation from other lanes.  For example, a [[Fresnel lens]] on an adjacent through-lane signal may be aimed to prevent left-turning traffic from anticipating its own green arrow.  One example of the Fresnel lens application common in the USA is the [[3M High Visibility Signals|3M Model 131 traffic signal]] (dubbed the &quot;Programmed Visibility&quot; signal). Although 3M has recently discontinued the M-131, it became a popular traffic signal for skewed or complex intersections. Today, McCain Traffic Systems (a traffic signal manufacturing company based in [[Vista, California]]) is the only U.S.-based manufacturer producing true &quot;programmable visibility&quot; traffic signals. In addition to aiming, Fresnel lenses, and louvers, visors and back panels are also useful in areas where sunlight would diminish the contrast and visibility of a signal face.

Typical applications for these signals were skewed intersections, specific multi-lane control, left-turn pocket signals or other areas where complex traffic situations existed.

===Conventional lighting systems===

Conventional traffic signal lighting, still common in some areas, utilizes a standard light bulb.  Typically, a 67 watt, 69 watt, or 115 watt medium-base (household lamp in the U.S) light bulb provides the illumination.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Light then bounces off a mirrored glass or polished aluminium reflector bowl, and out through a polycarbonate plastic or glass signal lens. In some signals, these lenses were cut to include a specific refracting pattern. Crouse-Hinds is one notable company for this practice. In the 1930s throughout the 1950s, they utilized a beaded prismatic lens with a &quot;smiley&quot; pattern embossed into the bottom of each lens.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Light design===
In the United States, traffic lights are currently designed with lights approximately {{convert|12|in|-1|-1}} in diameter. Previously the standard had been {{convert|8|in|-1|-1}}, however those are slowly being phased out in favor of the larger and more visible 12&amp;nbsp;inch lights. Variations used have also included a hybrid design, which had one or more 12&amp;nbsp;inch lights along with one or more lights of {{convert|8|in|-1|-1}} on the same light.  For example, these &quot;12-8-8&quot; (along with 8-8-8) lights are standard in most jurisdictions in Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia (that, is, the red light is 12 and others 8, making the red more prominent). {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In the United Kingdom, 12&amp;nbsp;inch lights were implemented only with Mellor Design Signal heads designed by [[David Mellor (designer)|David Mellor]]. These were designed for symbolic optics to compensate for the light loss caused by the symbol. With the invention of anti-phantom, highly visible SIRA lenses, lights of {{convert|8|in|mm|-1|-1}} could be designed to give the same output as plain lenses, so a larger surface area was unnecessary. Consequently lights of {{convert|12|in|-1|-1}} are no longer approved for use in the UK and all lights installed on new installations have to be {{convert|200|mm|0|0}} in accordance with TSRGD (Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions). Exemptions are made for temporary or replacement signals. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In the state of Victoria, Australia, lights used to have long visors with a slanted cut on the side nearest the road (for approach side) and none for the opposite side.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} These lights also had a sort of horizontal filter covering the upper half of the visor, except on arrows. This design eliminated or minimised washout of the light by a low-lying sun. This type of design has yet to surface outside of Victoria. LED-based lights, however, do not follow this standard, adopting the national standard of having a short visor and cut on both sides, although the cut is also applied to the lights on the opposite side of the junction. Some installations do not have cuts on the opposite side. There exists at least 1 LED-based light using the visor and filter set of its predecessor.

===Control and coordination ===
{{Main|Traffic light control and coordination}}

The normal function of traffic lights requires sophisticated control and coordination to ensure that traffic moves as smoothly and safely as possible and that pedestrians are protected when they cross the roads.

===Mounting===

There are significant differences from place to place in how traffic lights are mounted or positioned so that they are visible to drivers.  Depending upon the location, traffic lights may be mounted on poles situated on street corners, hung from horizontal poles or wires strung over the roadway, or installed within large horizontal gantries that extend out from the corner and over the right-of-way.  In the last case, such poles or gantries often have a lit sign with the name of the cross-street.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Croatia]], along with some jurisdictions in the [[United States|U.S.]] (including [[New Mexico]], [[Wisconsin]], most of [[Texas]], [[Florida]], [[Nebraska]], and some localities in [[Kansas]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Louisiana]].),some places in [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] mount lights with their multiple faces arranged horizontally, often with supplemental vertical signals on the side, while others use vertical signals almost exclusively.  Horizontal signals have consistent orientation, like their vertical counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part4/fig4d-03_longdesc.htm |title=FHWA - MUTCD - 2003 Edition Revision 1 Fig. 4D-3 Long Description |publisher=Mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, supplemental curb pedestal mounts, intended to support a signal for a different approach road, are used when primary signals are partially obscured due to structures such as overpasses, approaches around a building that obscures the primary signal mountings, and unusual approach geometry. In Florida, horizontal signals mounted on poles, known as &quot;mast arms&quot;, are in wide use due to their lower wind profile, important for minimising [[hurricane]] damage. The horizontally mounted traffic light position is very common in [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], and [[South Florida]] on most intersections.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In areas where wind-load is not as major a concern as ice-load such as [[Illinois]] or [[Minnesota]] the lights are mounted vertically to reduce the accumulation of ice or snow over the surface of the signal heads.

[[California]] is particularly rigorous{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} in ensuring that drivers can see the current state of a traffic light.  One entrance to a typical large intersection, with three through lanes, two dedicated left-turn lanes, and a crosswalk, may have as many as three traffic lights for the left-turn lanes, three for the through lanes, and a pedestrian signal for the crosswalk.  Those numbers must be multiplied by four to cover all four ways to enter a typical intersection.

[[Image:20060627 Trump Taj Mahal from Pacific Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|Example of horizontal mounted traffic light in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]]]
Traffic signals in most areas of Europe are located at the stop line on same side of the intersection as the approaching traffic (there being both [[right- and left-hand traffic]]) and are often mounted overhead as well as on side of the road. At particularly busy junctions for freight, higher lights may be mounted specifically for [[lorry|trucks]]. The stop line alignment is done to prevent vehicles blocking any crosswalk blocking and allow for better pedestrian traffic flow. There may also be a special area a few metres in advance of the stop line where cyclists may legally wait but not motor vehicles; this [[advanced stop line]] is often painted with a different road surface with greater friction and a high color, both for the benefit of cyclists and for other vehicles. The traffic lights are mounted so that cyclists can still see them.

In North America, there is often a pole-mounted signal on the same side of the intersection, but additional pole-mounted and overhead signals are usually mounted on the far side of the intersection for better visibility.  In some areas, signals facing all four directions are hung directly over the intersection on a wire strung diagonally over the intersection.

==Implementation==
According to transportation engineers, traffic lights can have both positive and negative effects on traffic safety and traffic flow.  The separation of conflicting streams of traffic in time can reduce the chances of right-angle collisions.  But also the frequency of rear-end crashes can be increased by the installation of traffic lights, and they can adversely affect the safety of bicycle and pedestrian traffic.  They can increase the traffic capacity at intersections, but can also result in excessive traffic delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Traffic Signals |publisher=Institute of Transportation Engineers |date=September 2007 |url=http://www.ite.org/safety/issuebriefs/Traffic%20Signals%20Issue%20Brief.pdf |accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hans Monderman]], the innovative Dutch traffic engineer, and pioneer of [[shared space]] schemes, was sceptical of their role, and is quoted as having said of them: &quot;We only want traffic lights where they are useful and I haven't found anywhere where they are useful yet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Small vehicle safety===
In some instances the stoplight traffic detector will not change the light for small vehicles such as motorcycles and scooters. This is the result of the inability of the sensors to detect the presence of the small vehicle. A vehicle with sufficient mass consisting of a metal such as steel interacts with the sensors magnetic field causing the light to change at the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/question234.htm Howstuffworks.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Motorcycles and scooters have much less mass than cars, resulting in a failure to trigger the sensor. This situation most often occurs at the times of day when other traffic is sparse as well as when the small vehicle is coming from a direction that does not have a high volume of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motorcycleassistant.com/motorcycles-and-stoplights/ Motorcycleassistant.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all sensor traffic lights have this problem. There are some that can pick up these vehicles without problems and most are capable of doing so, however through road construction and other processes they are not properly adjusted or calibrated for the small vehicles - but they should be, including bicycles. Faulty ones should be reported. Magnetic field sensors detect vehicles passing over them and not necessarily stationary vehicles.

===Traffic signal warrants===
{{globalize/USA}}
Traffic signals have strengths and weaknesses that must be considered when deciding whether to install them. Signaled intersections can reduce delay for side road traffic and reduce the occurrence of collisions by turning traffic and cross traffic. But they may also cause delay for traffic on the main road, and often increase [[rear-end collision]]s by up to 50%&lt;ref name=CRF&gt;National Cooperative Highway Research Program, Crash Reduction Factors for Traffic Engineering and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Improvements: State-of-Knowledge Report, November 2005, Table 3&lt;/ref&gt;. Since right-angled and turn-against-traffic collisions are more likely to result in injuries, this is often an acceptable trade-off.

==US Department of Transportation Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices==

Criteria have been developed to help ensure that new signals are installed only where they will do more good than harm. In the United States these criteria are called ''warrants'', and are found in the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] (MUTCD), the Federal regulation covering the use of signs, pavement markings, traffic signals, and similar devices.

In the US MUTCD, there are nine warrants for traffic signals:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part4/part4c.htm Section 4C. Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (2009 Edition).]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume'''. Traffic volume must exceed prescribed minima for eight hours of an average day (usually a weekday).
&lt;!-- {{Clarify|reason=Does weekday include Saturday?|date=March 2009}}
The MUTCD text specifies &quot;average day&quot;, except in Warrant 8, where it mentions the term &quot;weekday&quot;. But the MUTCD usage of &quot;weekday&quot; does not include Saturday or Sunday, because Warrant 8 specifies different conditions for Saturday and Sunday. Refer to Section 4C.09 for this usage, there's a citation link now. --&gt;
*'''Four-Hour Vehicular Volume'''. Traffic volume must exceed prescribed minima for four hours of an average day. 
*'''Peak Hour Volume or Delay'''. This is applied only in unusual cases, such as [[office park]]s, industrial complexes, or [[park and ride]] lots that attract or discharge large numbers of vehicles in a short time, and, for a minimum of one hour of an average day. The side road traffic suffers undue delay when entering or crossing the major street.
*'''Pedestrian Volume''', if the traffic volume on a major street is so heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in attempting to cross it
*'''School Crossing''', if there not enough safe gaps in traffic for school children to safely cross the street
*'''Coordinated Signal System''', for places where adjacent traffic control signals do not keep traffic grouped together efficiently. 
*'''Crash Experience'''. The volumes in the eight- and four-hour warrants may be reduced if five or more right-angle and cross traffic turn collisions have happened at the intersection in a twelve month period.
*'''Roadway Network'''. Installing a traffic control signal at some intersections might be justified to encourage concentration and organization of traffic flow on a roadway network.
*'''Intersection Near a Grade Crossing'''. A traffic control signal is often justified at an intersection near a [[railroad crossing]], in order to provide a preemption sequence to allow traffic queued up on the tracks an opportunity to clear the tracks before the train arrives. 

An intersection should meet one or more of these warrants before a signal is installed. However, meeting one or more warrants does not ''require'' the installation of a traffic signal, only ''suggests'' that they may be suitable. It could be that a [[roundabout]] would work better there. There may be other unconsidered conditions that lead to traffic engineers to conclude a signal is undesirable. For example, they may decide not to install a signal at an intersection if traffic stopped by it will back up and block another, more heavily trafficked intersection. Also, if a signal meets only the peak hour warrant, the advantages during that time may not outweigh the disadvantages during the rest of the day.

Between 1979 and 1988, the city of [[Philadelphia]] removed 199 signals that did not meet any of the warrants. On average, the intersections had 24% fewer crashes after the unwarranted signals were removed.&lt;ref name=CRF/&gt;

==Legal implications==
[[Image:Redlightfinesign.jpg|left|thumb|Attempt to discourage red light running by posting the minimum fine, which has increased by $1.09 since this photo was taken.]]

In virtually all jurisdictions{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} in which they are used, it is an offence for motorists (and other road users) to disregard the instructions of traffic lights (or other traffic control devices). Exceptionally, it is not an offence for pedestrians to cross against a red light in the United Kingdom, where pedestrian lights officially give advice, rather than an instruction, although UK pedestrians do commit an offence if they cross a road against the signals of a police officer controlling traffic.

The most common{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} infraction associated with traffic lights is failing to stop for a red light (in some jurisdictions, running an ''amber'' light can also incur a penalty).  Enforcement of traffic lights varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; some places are extremely strict.  Other locales are infamous for traffic lights being routinely ignored by motorists, with no serious attempts by law enforcement to alter the situation.

Jurisdictions differ somewhat on how to deal with &quot;red light running&quot; — attempts by motorists to race to an intersection while facing a yellow light, in an attempt to beat the red.  In some locales, as long as the light is yellow when the motorist enters the intersection, no offense has been committed; in others, if the light turns red at any time before the motorist clears the intersection, then an offense occurs.  In  [[Oregon]] and other places, a stricter standard applies-—running an ''amber'' light is an offense, unless the motorist is unable to stop safely.  This standard has been criticized{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} as ambiguous and difficult to enforce (red light cameras in Oregon are activated only if a motorist enters the intersection on a red). Red light cameras in [[New South Wales|NSW, Australia]] are activated only if a motorist enters an intersection 0.3 seconds ''after'' the light has turned red.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/licensing/downloads/road_users_handbook.pdf NSW RTA Road users' handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions (such as [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[New York City]], and the state of [[California]]){{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, there are ordinances against &quot;[[gridlock]]ing.&quot;  A motorist entering an intersection (even if on a green light) but is unable to proceed and gets stranded in the intersection (when traffic ahead fails to proceed), and remains after the light turns red (thus blocking traffic from other directions) may be cited.  The definition of the intersection area is that square where the two streets overlap marked by the inner lines of each crosswalk.  (Occupying the space inside the crosswalk lines is itself a traffic infraction, but different from gridlocking.)  This gives the meaning to the anti-gridlock slogan &quot;Don't Block the Box.&quot;  This is sometimes used as a justification for making a turn across the opposing travel lanes on a red light at a busy intersection, by pulling partway into the intersection at a green light waiting to perform the turn, and, if oncoming traffic is not abated before the light changes to red, proceeding to turn once the light has turned red and opposing traffic has stopped. This means that at busy junctions without a protected green arrow for turning traffic, one turns after the light turns red.  This maneuver is commonly referred to as &quot;occupying the intersection&quot; or &quot;being legally allowed to complete one's turn&quot;.  In some jurisdictions, including most American states, a vehicle already in the intersection when the light turns red legally has the right of way, and vehicles who have green must yield to the vehicle in the intersection.

In [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]], [[New Brunswick]] it is customary for through traffic to voluntarily yield to the first oncoming left-turning vehicle to allow it to perform a [[Pittsburgh left]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} This is similar to a [[hook turn]] performed in Melbourne, Australia, which is legal at signed intersections.

Enforcement of traffic lights is done in one of several ways:

* By police officers observing traffic, and issuing citations to motorists who violate the signal.
* As a result of an accident investigation, if it is determined that one or more motorists ran the red light — even if the incident was not observed by a police officer.
* With red light cameras.

===Red light cameras===
{{details|Traffic enforcement camera}}
In some areas, [[red light camera]]s are used.  An automated camera is connected to the triggering mechanism for the corresponding traffic light, which is targeted to photograph any vehicle, which crosses against the light. The driver or owner (depending on local laws) of a vehicle is photographed so that they can be fined for the violation. In some jurisdictions in the United States, private companies have been contracted to operate traffic-related cameras and in turn receive a portion of the resulting revenues. This has resulted in abuses, where vehicle operators that are innocent of infractions have been fined as a result of traffic systems that have been improperly modified to benefit the private companies.

===Light timing length===
{{See also|Traffic light control and coordination}}
The length of amber lights can differ, for example in many places the length of an amber light is usually 5 seconds, but elsewhere it may be as little as 3 seconds considerably reducing the time for reaction.  It is typical for these times to vary according to the set speed limit, with longer times for higher limits. In the state of Georgia, United States, an amber light must be lit one second for every 10&amp;nbsp;mph of posted speed limit. In this situation, a 45&amp;nbsp;mph posted speed limit would have a 4.5 second amber light.  For intersections with red light cameras, 1 extra second must be added. In Colorado Springs, Colorado, green lights at numerous intersections have been noted with durations of approximately two seconds. 

The time from when a red light is displayed and when a cross street is given a green light is usually based on the physical size of the intersection. This intervening period is called the all-red time. A typical all-red time is 3 seconds to allow cars to clear the intersection.  In a wider intersection, such as 4 lane road or highway intersection, the all-red time may be as much as 5 seconds, allowing drivers who could not stop at the amber light enough time to clear the intersection without causing a collision.

==In other contexts==
The symbolism of a traffic light (and the meanings of the three primary colors used in traffic lights) are frequently found in many other contexts. Since they are often used as single spots of color without the context of vertical position, they are typically not comprehensible to up to one in ten males who are [[color blindness|color blind]].

Traffic lights have also been used in pieces of artwork, particularly the [[Traffic Light tree]] in London, UK.

===Racing===
Automobile racing circuits can also use standard traffic signals to indicate to racing car drivers the status of racing. On an oval track, four sets may be used, two facing a straight-away and two facing the middle of the 180 degree turn between straight-aways. Green would indicate racing is under way, while yellow would indicate to slow or while following a pace car; red would indicate to stop, probably for emergency reasons.

[[Scuderia Ferrari]], a [[Formula One]] racing team, formerly used a traffic light system during their pit stops to signal to their drivers to when to leave the pits.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The red light was on when the tires were being changed and fuel was being added, yellow was on when the tires were changed, and green was on when all work was completed. The system is (usually) completely automatic. However, the system was withdrawn after the [[Singapore Grand Prix|2008 Singapore Grand Prix]], due to the fact that it heavily delayed [[Felipe Massa]] during the race, when he was in the lead. Usually, the system was automatic, but heavy traffic in the pit lane forced the team to operate it manually. A mechanic accidentally pressed the green light button when the fuel hose was still attached to the car, causing Massa to drive off, towing the fuel hose along. Additionally, Massa drove into the path of [[Adrian Sutil]], earning him a penalty. He finally stopped at the end of the pit lane, forcing Ferrari's mechanics to sprint down the whole of the pit lane to remove the hose. As a result of this, and the penalty he also incurred, Massa finished 13th. [[Ferrari]] decided to use a traditional &quot;lollipop&quot; for the remainder of the [[2008 Formula One season|2008 season.]]

===As a rating mechanism===
{{See also|Traffic light rating system|European Union energy label}}

The colors red, amber and green are often used as a simple-to-understand rating system for products and processes. It may be extended by analogy to provide a greater range of intermediate colors, with red and green at the extremes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter VI:  Seasonal work and the village school====  

Just after WWII it was still possible to see steam engines propelling wagons, road rollers and farm implements. The threshing machine  working in Tatworth was hired from the local supplier. It usually came with its own team of men who were familiar with its workings. The decision to start threshing was a judgement made by the farmer. His starting point would be the price of flour, the position of his bank balance and the gamble he was prepared to make on the state of the local economy. Usually the corn was threshed in late autumn and early winter. If done outside, the state of the weather or what was forecast, was the adjudicator. The flail was still known to be used – mainly in the winter, to give work when bad weather kept the workers from the field - to produce corn for the chickens.

Threshing was always done in a hurry - using the maximum number of workers. A full water cart was always to hand. It was no good finding you were out of water halfway through the job - having to close down the boiler. It was the farmer’s responsibility to see that water was always available and sufficient coal to hand. If local water unavailable it was pumped from a stream or pond into the water tub. Welsh steam coal was shovelled into the boiler as gradually steam pressure was reached… The tall chimney belched black smoke and the whistle blew – at last pressure 'was up!' The great flywheel turned and the piston rod jerked backwards and forwards… the belt started to flap and the speed regulator spun… The thresher started pulsating – humming its never-ending tune, as every piece of loose metal, associated bit of tackle, and worn bearing, started to rattle and shake. One man started to go round the road wheels on the engine, to hammer in wedges to prevent the engine from moving closer to the thresher, and another man wedged the thresher – the idea was to stop the belt from slipping by maintaining the correct tension on the belt.

Two men usually unricked the sheaves of corn onto a cart… which duly, pulled up to the elevator, to be off-loaded onto the conveyor. The sheaves passed along the conveyor to the bond cutter who cut the string or untied the band to release the stalks, which were then entered into the drum feeder. At the other end of the feeder the now husk-less straw was taken off the drum to be taken to the straw-stack… the grain was bagged up from the side-chute using a sack-trolley in two hundred-weight sacks, and loaded onto the grain wagon.

Ten men often carried out this whole operation. The spent straw not always taken immediately to make a stack – some farms would tie the straw into trusses using a straw-bond, sold-on or ricked-up. The husks left to fall onto the ground, although: the very action of the belts driving the action, the spinning drum, and conveyor, tended to blow the husks out, making a cloud of irritating, itching-making husks, mask the whole operation – covering everything. From removal of the corn from the ear, to grinding at the mill, as much husk was removed as possible -  winnowing, by using draughts of air - by blower or fan… The threshed straw went to build the rick. This straw would be animal feed for the winter and cut out of the rick by the ‘fogger’ using very long and broad hay-knives to cut away a truss, which was then bound and carried to the field. Un-used ricks, which were surplus, broken down and spread on fields - to be ploughed-in or cut-up to make manure heaps. Ricks could be either round or square-sided, with or without end hips. They were built mostly in the rick-yard reasonably close to where the animals were to be fed – near to the chickens - to nest, feed and lay. If likely to be infested with vermin the rick would be built on staddle stones [mushroom shaped stone or iron to prevent vermin from getting into the ricks] - if not, a base of bundles of brushwood laid to allow air to circulate - kept the straw or hay off the ground to prevent rotting. Once the rick built up, the top was thatched.

At the turn of the century, this would cost the farmer 2s for five hours work. At the same time the ricks were being built, the swedes and mangles were being made into heaps [clamps] and covered with straw and earth to keep off the frosts. Potato clamps were specifically for humans although if sufficient, at the end of the season, they would also be fed to the pigs. Both these root crops were used as winter-feed for the cattle. In the winter, cattle food was not just thrown on the ground but placed in large wooden troughs and hayracks. The carter’s stockmen and shepherds were expected to administer to their animals when they were ill. Old remedies were used perfected over the ages to cure swine fever, foot and mouth disease, and foot rot. Antiphlegestin, Stockholm tar and castor oil, were all popular medicants. The only animals to be kept in close confinement were pigs. In some farms, they were allowed to feed off the apples in the orchards or in small fields to graze the acorns. Very often, particularly for hops and soft fruit, town’s folk would descend on the farms to do casual work – staying in purpose built wooden huts. They considered this not only a method to earn a little extra but as a holiday too. It was usually an expected and organized event at harvest time and the same families met up every year taking in turn to look after the children. The huts were provided with cooking facilities and a communal sink and latrines.

After the harvest had been gathered in and the festival blessed in the church, the village held its thanksgiving. In times past this was known as ‘The Revels’, but Puritanism soon put a stop to all that. Now the village fete and garden show took its place. They still draw the inhabitant together: for the children to run wild and the merry-go-round to spin - by the efforts of the showman and his cranking handle. There were country dancing, races and hoopla, ducking apples… and the maypole to be laced – danced round. However trivial it may seem, it was planned for, looked forward to, and continually remembered. A demand was now made on Bradford’s warehouse for coulters, ploughshares and dung forks, as the crops were cleared from the fields. Dung was tipped in piles across the fields and old ricks broken up and interspersed too, ready for ploughing. It was the time for the stable hands to start repairing the harnesses and to put right all those faults with the carts and wagons.

The morning started bright and clear. It was the most perfect September day, the sky was cloudless, the only sounds disturbing the peace was the cooing of the wood pigeons, and the squabbling of the rooks high in the trees overhead. Not far away a stag rears on its hind legs to knock some more acorns off the lower branches of the oak… a shaft of sunlight through the branches lights-up a peacock butterfly - which settled for a moment before continuing its erratic journey. On one of the top branches, a kestrel swivels his head - to left and to right, surveying his kingdom…

The wet grass from an overnight shower sparkles and thousands of small cobwebs glisten from tiny water droplets that shimmer in the sun. Gradually the morning mist lifts from the ground as the sun warms the air… piles of newly dug soil advertise the underground run of a mole. Autumn has begun, we put aside all thoughts of how well Somerset is doing in the cricket league… the football season is upon us. The countryside now changes. The sun is still hot but comes to us lower in the sky. September kicks in with a sudden chill makes one reach for the jumper. The ground begins to show the first scatterings of fallen leaves. They are in a variety of browns, reds and oranges blowing about the ruts, rustling and chattering as they pile up. The dewy grass, covered with early morning webs, soak my shoes that are not waterproof - giving me wet socks again… The acorns and fallen twiglets crunch underfoot. The humming and squawking wildlife quietens as day by day their food becomes more difficult to find… finally the blackbird and song thrush leave for warmer climes…

Tomatoes are starting to ripen outside as well as the blackberry and autumn delight raspberries, the potatoes, onions, beans and marrows become staple diet. The weeds keep coming… it is a full-time job to keep on top of their growth. The pears and apples on the trees behind the privy are picked as they become ready. Those not eaten are wrapped in newspaper and stored on trays in the outhouse.

The local thatcher lays out his unthrashed wheat straw… gathers and ties them, in handy bundles. On wet days, he whittles his pegs, sharpens his scissors and prepares for the next fine day. His first job on Monday morning is the cottage in Perry Street, by Crossways Corner. It is there that he places his very long ladders – in readiness, carting and stacking his prepared bundles for an early morning start. He not only works for the farmer repairing barns, haylofts and making ricks but also re-thatched and replaced roof ridges in the village.
 
The fields, in the first half of the twentieth century, the banks, and ditches, all presented an enormous variety of plant life compared to today's selection. There were trees of fruit, nut and thorn, varieties of bush rose, vetch, yarrow, knapweed and birdsfoot. The ditches were deeper and damper, with grass more lush and succulent. Insect life not only of greater variety but larger: dragonflies, stag beetles, butterflies, moths, glow-worms, snakes, lizards, toads, frogs and crickets. Birds too would be more numerous. In fact, the whole flora and fauna would be almost unrecognisable by the profusion of differing types and species, especially the winged insect variety.

As September led into October… the cabbages displayed frayed edges as the white butterfly’s caterpillar nibble away - gradually reducing the leaves to skeletons, a number lay across the leaves producing a crosshatched colouration of yellow and black. Some of the cabbages have their hearts completely destroyed – going mouldy and black. There is no time to be sentimental the caterpillars have to be removed – pinched out. By now the beans are stringy and the marrows hard. Digging in earnest… preparing the ground to sow the spring cabbage must be concluded… All the old decaying crops removed to the compost heap. The time for sowing the broad beans, that are going to stand the winter, will have to be sown - to give the New Year a good start.

The compost heap was broken into and manure from the yard made up the load to spread upon the stubble. Now is the time to start pulling and cutting the tops off the cattle-beet… followed by the autumn ploughing and the planting of beans… Immediately drilling the winter wheat, the horse teams are prepared in advance, putting at least a two-horse drill on the light soils. The mangels could now be collected up and carted off to the clamp - which lay beside the potatoes. 
Autumn is well under way. October starts cold and damp. The early morning mist lies late into the morning giving the fields a ghostly presence. The river is clear and low and the banks encroach – the luxuriant grass weighed down by water droplets sags dipping their heads into the water… the water reflects the growth making the width of the stream appear even smaller. Lower down a pair of swans go through their bonding ritual ducking their heads then reaching up until finally they touch one another. 
    
The thick hedges provided not only a field boundary but also give new material for future hedge and fence, shelter for the farm animals and birds, and provide a byway for wild creatures – to pass from field to field. The hedgerows at the side of the lanes would not be cut, becoming, in some cases, interlinked over the middle of the road forming a tunnel - which shut out the daylight. In the evening or winter nights these lanes were frightening places for us children; the trunks began to form faces and the long tendrils of the branches looked like arms ready grab any unfortunate passer-by. The glow-worms light twinkled in the dark, dank ditches and lane sides, whilst the bats flitted above on their set course to the nearest food. The hooting owls and barking foxes gave a sinister background to the shadowy undergrowth…  The hedge banks and ditches were ancient boundaries of tracks running from hamlet to village, from village to town… a source of wonderment at the diversity of wildlife, a fascination at the beauty of the leaf and branch - forming a varied, colourful picture.

The ditches became flooded every year. Tall rushes, herbs and reed, shoot up, at the expense of smaller, less vigorous plants, when the ditches are lush and green – it is impossible to see the bottom of the ditch and quite difficult to extract oneself - if clumsy enough to fall in! In early November, the wind penetrated the stoutest coat. The skies washed out and threatening. The rooks were buffeted, being blown off course, having to make an extra effort to regain their perch. They complained creating a tremendous racket. When they took off to find food, they swept over the fields in gigantic swoops soaring upwards to gain height and then down again almost plunging into the ground. They seemed to keep this up for hours, almost as if they were at play…

Halfway through the month, the better weather arrived and a walk by the brook revealed a wider streambed - now that the dead and dying vegetation had rotted and fallen away. The trees were beginning to look bare - half their leaves had fallen. The reeds with their yellow stems and black rotting heads were flattened by the wind - lay in the water, the fallen leaves clogging their matted remains.The warm weather never lasts long for the rain settles in again, turning the roads into glistening rivers of black ink, gurgling down the drain which leads to the river. Now the mornings were frosty, quickly thawing out to leave just the shady areas icy on dead leaves and limp grass. The river changed again now reflecting browns and ochre’s. It is going to stay that way for some time to come… Back at the cottage, work continued... the war had not changed the routines of life one jot. The butter factory, near Chilson Common, took over the mantle of chief employer after the net making industry had suffered yet another poor year. 

The early mornings were crisp, the frost glistening on the roads. The forecast is two days of rain and sleet followed by strong winds. The river is high and unusually brown from mud washed down stream. Last weeks rain has made the current strong as the water rushes over the stones swept down from higher ground. Once again, the moles have been active on the grassy bank every so often the brown earth thrown up into soft crumbly piles. Out of all the greenery, left by the winter’s blast, the ivy remains bright and vibrant. The flowers of pale-yellow populate the tops and by the end of December the berries will be very dark green. Also looking strong, but not as colourful, is the holly with its many bunches of bright red berries - declaring a hard winter… Should look a picture when pinned to the beams in the sitting room, along with the mistletoe, from the oak in yonder field. There is just time for grandad to plant the shallots… before he sits down to the main meal of the day. Then off with his sons to the Poppe Inn… known before 1927, as the Country Hotel,the local meeting place for most of the local village men folk… this is where they played darts, shove-halfpenny and dominoes, until about ten, when they returned home to sit by the fire, play cards or relate the local gossip to grandma.

After Christmas, when all the festivities were over, the farm-workers tried to keep indoors, or at least stayed close to the barns where the seed-barley could be thrashed. On dry days, the broken fences and gates could be repaired or the stack-yard swept. There was always something to do even in the foulest weather to keep the men busy. At Rosalie Cottage, life got back to normality after the Christmas jollities. Other than during the winter the cottage door was left open – guarded by a large, cast iron dog. Step over the threshold onto the thick stone step, which spans the width of the door; take the cambered sandstone brick path through the gate onto the road beyond… Turning right, start up the hill; a few paces more and there, on the left… some steps, with a neat set of iron railings supporting a handrail which lead to a gothic door. The school entrance stands impressively tall. Its an official building… surmounted by the bell tower… the autumn term was ending - another year almost over… The children are practicing their carols; ‘The Holly and the Ivy’ filters out - in time with the piano… Another cold day - the third week in December – the last week of term. The sun shines weakly as it tries to penetrate the moisture-laden air. Nobody dallies, head down, they move quickly to get inside out of the cold. There, the fire blazes up, casting a warm, flickering  light, against the brass warming pan… the paraffin lamp is already lit, the smell of the oil another part of my memory bank… gives light, as well as comfort.

On the beams in the living room the pinned holly and mistletoe remained. The painted and crayoned cards still lurked behind the clock and candleholders. The table is set again as grandma bustles about cutting the bread ready for the evening meal… Life in the village changed little. This was the quietest time, it was as if everything waiting for warmth to strike flesh or ground. Inside the cottage the fire crackled in the hearth and the clock strikes midday. The wind and rain of January has passed to clear cold days of February. The farmer over the hedge has started drilling the spring beans and peas. In a few weeks time the oats and barley would have to go through the same procedure. In the village school the children stayed in during their break times, the cold penetrated up from the floor making their toes as cold as ice. The coke fire did little to keep the cold at bay…

Tatworth was not a normal rural village. The lace mill, butter factory and railway junction made it more isolated from the affects of low farm prices - than an economy solely reliant upon what could be produced from the land. The offshoots to all three plus the corn mill at Forton gave it strength to resist unemployment. Even when there were hard times for lace, production one or other of the employers would came to the rescue, plus the largest landowners like Parrocks Lodge and Forde Abbey. This relative isolationism was reflected in the population’s view of the outside world’s troubles, as being a hindrance to the perpetuation of all that was good and normal. Life, like the language, was slow and ordered, in pace with the seasons. Within all his rural activity, the creative industries fed off the large manufacturers circulating wealth and jobs. This circular life in Tatworth, where all benefited from this mechanism - each part fed off the other, maintained the coherence of the complete social group.

Village schools in the eighteen hundreds had their teaching practice based upon learning by rote… in classrooms holding a number of other age groups. In most schools, there was only one large room, which was cold, damp and dusty. Religious bodies… mainly the Anglican National Society established in 1811, controlled the institutions. Church schools greatly outnumbered voluntary organization. All schooling required fees supplemented by donations and government grants. ‘The Education of the Poor’, such as it was, was ministered by the church – by the Church of England’s National Society. At this time, there was no Government provision or legal requirement. The provision of a school was dependant upon patronage and beneficence of the Rector of Chard Church… plus, bequests and subscriptions. Only five years before A Parliamentary Act banned the use of child labour although it did carry on for a few more years.In 1837, Victoria came to the throne one year after the Union workhouse was built on the Crewkerne Road. A further two years saw 243 people sheltered there from the town and borough. Out-relief was a fund raised to help the unemployed… that year a sum of seventeen hundred pounds was allocated for that cause.

The start of the century had seen harvests ruined by bad weather and the lead up to the coronation was to see little improvement. William IV had been on the throne for seven years… now it was the chance to turn round the economy. Victoria was eighteen and she was made of sterner stuff. One the continent, 1830 was a year of revolution. England was up in arms serious rioting broke out. Farm machinery was smashed, ricks set on fire and fists were raised. The rain in 1828 had been the worst in living memory and agricultural prices dropped. During the next ten years farmers’ begged for a reduction in their rent's – a few had to sell up and move away to the town. The lord of the manor, in a number of estates, gave land over to the community for allotments. It was a bad time for all, particularly for the already poor. There was much unemployment, for neither farmers nor workshops were taking on labour. The poorhouse in the town had to turn people away. The Mayor of Chard called a meeting where he put it to the assembled parishioners that the severe weather was creating hardship. It was decided to make donations and a collection was immediately taken – which raised £60. The plan was to purchase coal, bacon and peas and share those out to six hundred poor persons.

The social gap was widening as the inefficient and uneconomic farmer sold up and the wealthy tenant and lord increased their holding. Landowners had benefited from the purchase of low price land. The industrialisation of manufacturing brought to a head the scandal of child labour. By 1844, the employment of any child below the age of eight, in the textile industry, was banned. Between eight and thirteen, the child had to attend school for three hours a day. Many parents evaded the restrictions where they could. Textile workers opposed the raising of the minimum working age of half-timers. Lace schools were set up to teach children to read. The commissioners later tested the children to find out what had been learnt. The results proved that although the children could read the majority could not write.

The Union workhouse was still a necessary. Inmates were issued with a hammock although it would appear that these were not in a very good condition. An issue of string gave some comfort to repair the netting and to ensure the hammock hung properly. Two rugs made by previous inmates were all that were allowed for each person. There were complaints about not being able to wash and the violent disturbances resulted in two months hard labour, in the House of Correction.

It was the large acreage now of the thrusting landowners that allowed them to survive the hard times, after the act of enclosure. Once again, the Pouletts gained most. By 1865 horse-powered threshing machines had been installed, improved land drainage continued, whilst fields redesigned both assisted hay farming to reach its peak by the end of the century.In 1866 J B Gifford, who owned and foundered a lace manufacturing business at Forton - then moved to Holyrood Mill, forming Gifford Fox &amp; Company, who were approached to finance and provide premises for a Co-op. This they did with the additional loan of £15. This proved to be a very successful enterprise although it did not stay at the mill but moved to Fore Street under the title of Chard Industrial &amp; Provident Society. The shop’s staff was in the main local people. To them came Thomas Dolling as a twelve-year-old errand boy in the year 1879. He was a Chard Board pupil who was not only accomplished at schoolwork but also diligent in the shop. Within twenty years, he had risen to become the head of the Co-op. For the next forty years he stayed and directed the operation taking it to great heights.

Tatworth boasted the building and consecration, of a daughter-church to St Mary’s of Chard. This became the Mission Chapel of Tatworth, in September, 1851, [at that time, still considered a hamlet].  When built it was consecrated by the Bishop of Jamaica – the foundation stone being laid three months before, in June, with much approbation.. The chapel, built on a quarter of an acre of land, had been donated by the lord of the manor, Earl Poulett, together with the necessary stone, and fifty pounds towards the total cost of one thousand and forty pounds. All previous churchgoers from Tatworth had to walk three miles to attended St Mary’s Church, Chard. When the poor arrived the church was short of seating – even as far back as 1827. Years later a gallery had been erected, but still the church lacked sufficient accommodation. Many worshippers attended St Margaret’s Chapel of Ease in South Chard rather than face the walk and the possibility of not having a seat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello world -- wow, I've only recently discovered Wikibooks, and found that it's quite a resource! (Aug 2010). I appreciate all the work its authors/editors/admins have put into it.

I am now working through the book, ''Blender 3D: Noob to Pro''. It's quite well put-together. I find the online pages easier to read than the downloadable PDF version. However, in the online version, I have yet to find a ''specific'' page with a &quot;sequential&quot; TOC, that we can expand into subsections. Since it's a tutorial whose topics are presented in a meaningfully sequential manner, a master TOC page would be a godsend. (otoh, maybe I'll find this page in the next 5 minutes -- apologies in advance......)--[[User:Mike410books|Mike410books]] ([[User talk:Mike410books|talk]]) 22:11, 2 September 2010 (UTC)

Sigh: I found the nice, well-organized, sequential TOC: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro#Table_of_Contents. Gotta love that Scroll-Down key.....</text>

      <comment>/* Extruding the Cone */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Adding the Curve modifier ==
Noob note: Whole tutorial worked fine and easy to follow, right up to the last step. I can't get it to deform to curve at all. :(

Noob2 note: Just the same with me. After adding the Curve modifier nothing happens.

Noob3 note: After I added a Curve modifier and pressed the &quot;Y&quot;,the cone MOVED ALONG the Curve, not bent to it.

Noob4 note: This happened for me too, it just means you're aligning the cone on the wrong axis. Try using one of the other five (it was the x button for me, not y). also make sure that the curve is aligned to an axis, don't goof off too much in 3d view when making the curve, stay in top/side/front view.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Bezier_mod_Y.JPG|thumb|120px|left|Notice of the &quot;Y&quot; button pressed]] --&gt;

('''Wi_Tr Note:''' In order to obtain a deformation like the one shown above, be sure you've pressed the '''Y''' button located at the bottom row of ''Modifiers'' tab. This seems to inhibit deformations through the selected axis).

Noob5 (6 months training anyway) I found the X axis button on the modifier must be pushed to display the cone like shown. 

Noob6: Make sure the surface of the cone has many faces as well - if you just extruded the cone tip like I did the cone will not twist at all but only follow the path. I ended up extruding the tip out some ways and then subdividing the cone a few times in addition to setting x as the axis of deformation. It worked then.

Noob7: If you can not get it to work select your curve and look in the lower left under links and materials. You must find the ''real'' name of your curve, mine said &quot;Curve.001&quot; the .001 is important it will not work without the entire name.

Thanks for the fix... somehow that got left out! *smacks forehead into desk* Apologies... chalk it up to a newbie tutorial writer. I think it's fixed now... [[User:Embri|Embri]] ([[User talk:Embri|talk]])

== Extruding the Cone ==

another reader: I found that it works to make a cylinder, '''Ctrl+R''' it into 10-ish segments, then select the circle of vertices on the top (use the '''B''' key, preferably). Press '''S''', use the wheel to increase the selection radius to include almost the entire cylinder, and scale them to 0 (make sure the pivot is set to ''&quot;Individual Centers&quot;'' - that's close to the middle of the 3D View window header). This should squeeze the top of the cylinder into a cone and compress the segments below it by smaller degrees. The segments won't be of the same height, but the idea's the same. At least it's easier than extruding and scaling ten times.

reader note: I can't loop cut a cone (in Blender 2.48 - don't actually know why), as an alternative you can select all the edges that start from the tip of the cone (be sure to be in edge select mode) and subdivide/subdivide multi

reader 2: I found a much easier way to get the cone ready for the curve was to create the cone initially with a depth of 20, then do a knife multi-cut (k, multicut, 10).  No extruding or scaling necessary.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter VII: The early life of Elsie May====
Tatworth school was built in 1872, in the same Early English style as the church, built some twenty years before. These two institutions gave the village a new status: recognised as a separate community from Chard - to became a parish in its own right. Thirty-percent of the population was aged fourteen or less, and it was deemed highly desirable to have a local school. The new school was built of local flint stone with brick quoins around the windows and doors. Two gable ends faced the road, separated by two lean-to aisles and a front porch. Two sets of steps mount the pavement to meet at the arched wooden doors, which led into cloakrooms. Topping the whole was a bell tower, whose ringing bell called the children to school. 

The pupils were mainly from homes who’s parents worked at the mill or creamery - they all knew each other or knew of each other.  It was that sort of village school. Very few lived at a distance and most walked or rode a bike. Living opposite, gave the Collins children an even greater sense of belonging, not just to the school but to the community and to its inhabitants.

When the school day was over all the children came out in succession - the youngest first, making the otherwise deserted road alive with their shouts and calls. It was a happy place remembered fondly. They were all oddly dressed especially the younger ones. Their chatter was joyful if rather quaint not in the least embarrassed by their local patois. The boys in their caps and the girl’s hair tied up in ribbons skipping along in their pinafores. The majority would come from poor homes but that does not explain how they were brought up. The village was in the main a god-fearing place, its inhabitants Low Church, ridged in behaviour, and set in their ways.

The boys and girls who lived at the other side of the village - near the railway station, or Chardstock, used lane, path and short cut, to reach school. Along the way they could usually find some stick or special find to show-off with… betting each other that theirs the greater find, and couldn’t be bettered. It was the boys who liked to find a stick to make a bow or make-pretend sword, catapult or pipe. The girls, who kept well away from the nettles and briars, were the authority on what could be eaten safely or which leaf would make the better print. They chatted and giggled, keeping to their own little group, as they weaved their way past the cowpats refusing to take notice of the boys… by now, carving their name on the beech tree.

Their past-times, games, hobbies, and interests, are little different from those played generations before, or now. The boys kick a ball or tin and the girls skip, play catch or hopscotch – the same the world over. Their clothes less tattered today although fashions have changed slightly - but childish behaviour remains much the same… The bullies demand subservience and the meek consideration, the confident were heard, and the shy tried to hide. That, after all, is the way of the world!

The village was lucky having the mill and creamery, with all their ancillary trades, giving training and employment to its inhabitants. The Chard Road station and sidings, gave employers the means to import labour and transport goods. Both the warehousing sheds and ironmongers provided all those ancillary pieces of equipment necessary to support both these firms engineering shops.

Ten years before the school was built, education standards were linked to ‘student results’ – under the Revised Code. There was an annual examination, an attendance record level, religious instruction and needlework for the girls. Specific subject grants for grammar, history and geography, were brought into being in 1867, which  raised the number of subjects - giving a broader curriculum; these subject became ‘class’ subjects, eight years later. Shortly before, a number of other subjects were included: Latin, mathematics, science, modern languages and domestic economy – cookery and gardening. By the turn of the century, the curriculum as we know it, was in general use, and not long afterwards ‘payment by results’ ended. 

Child labour under eight was forbidden, six years later the employment of children on farms was not allowed [in a group less than ten] even though eight-year-old children could be employed, if they had attended school for 250 days during the preceding year. However, all the laws passed to regulate labour were widely evaded. The Elementary Education Act of 1870-73, compelled Chard authorities to ensure that there was adequate provision… to establish a Chard Board School. The cost of the board was met by local taxation. Church Aided Schools had to rely upon voluntary donations topped up by donations from the local gentry. The Board Schools provide national elementary education for over two million children. There was now a universal curriculum, which had to be followed. Secondary education did not have the same encompassing system until the School Boards tried to instil order. Eventually the Education Act of 1902, ensured the basis of all public education, and lasted until the Education Act was brought into being by Rab Butler in 1944.
        
My mother, started school at the age of four, in 1912. Academic standards in the Board Schools still did not rise sufficiently, even after the 1902 Act set out targets levels for Standards I and II. Standard I required an ability to read from a textbook, including words of more than one syllable: dictation, writing down a few common words, in a neat hand, the ability to add up, and subtract - not more than four figures, and the recitation of the multiplication table up to six. Many children did not reach even this low minimum standard and it is unfortunate that teachers resorted to harsh methods to improve their standards.

Village schools, at the turn of the twentieth century, laid great emphasis on the principles of Christian religion, morals, reading, writing, and the casting of accounts with beads. Some pupils went on to grammar schools. Girls were accepted into the village school but not allowed into the grammar. The grammar school’s curriculum consisted of Latin grammar and literature, history and geography - to some degree, and a little Greek... The scriptures were obligatory, so too arithmetics - mental and addition. Diction and manners were given special regard, along with National heroes. Marching, some games, and physical exercises, considered fitting in short measure. Boys attended six-days of the week and church on Sundays. Those parishioners who valued education – the ability to read and write and reckon, were usually those who could afford to do so without their child being ‘put to labour’, for as long as was necessary. Those folk were tradesmen, yeoman farmers, and lesser gentry. When the School Boards were put in place it was to those citizens – those unable to afford individual lessons by tutors and public schools, they were planning for. 

The School’s Inspectors - noticed in both town and country, the bad treatment of schoolchildren. The nation’s children were, from this time forward, going to be better educated. The ‘payment, of teachers, by results’ had disappeared by the time Elsie went to school. Although the children in Tatworth had the benefit of an education in a new school, operating a regulated curriculum, they still lacked the cultural benefits available to town children. Eight years before, the Board of Education defined elementary education as ‘forming and strengthening the character of children, and developing their intelligence’, assisting boys and girls to, ‘fit themselves for the work of life’. Girls were expected to be self-sacrificing, domesticated, and moral… boys, hard working, loyal, and brave, both boys and girls extolled as, ‘Children of the Empire. The Nation was proud of itself believing that there were, ‘further noble deeds to be done’, the Empire was supported throughout the country. Heads of rural schools not only maintained discipline within the school but were sometimes expected to control the behaviour of their charges outside as well. In many outlying hamlets, sending older children to school was looked on as 'wasted labour' by the poor.

When Elsie went to school in 1912, children were being given cocoa or some other warm drink for a 1d during the midday break. The local nurse still discovered ‘dirty heads’ during a school inspection, teachers were always taking care that when children scratched they were inspected for lice or flea bites. Inferior meals at home caused some of the children to be undernourished. Giving free school meals afforded the school the opportunity to instil good manners and proper eating habits – to eat properly with a knife and fork. A full-time dentist travelled from school to school checking the children’s teeth. He carried out inspections whilst the children were sent out to play. Cheap spectacles were obtainable free of charge and instruction given about the correct way to clean one’s teeth. The health of the nation’s children had become a national issue and initiatives started to improve the general state of health, and other child welfare matters. The Rowntree Foundation highlighted the ‘serious physical deterioration amongst the poorer section of the community, in their 1901 publication. The First World War evened out the vast difference between children health, in good and bad areas, by government inspection. 
 
Every day began the same for all children. At the turn of the twentieth century, most working-class families expected their children to contribute to the running of the household. Tasks were learnt by following their parents round the home helping as they went. The boys took on the heavier work whilst the girls helped with the sewing and food preparation… water had to be bought from the stream... each day had its routine of household chores. All this work had to be done before going to school… It was expected that Elsie and her sisters helped their mother look after the chickens, fetch the eggs, and clean them out. The washing had to be mangled, hung out, turned, and then ironed, when dry. The vegetables gathered from the garden, washed and put away for the next meal. There was a half-time system at the mill; children over the age of ten could work limited hours, whilst receiving their education. This continued until after the First World War.

After the war, the troops were dismissed and returned home. They might have been informed by letter that the village had changed or they might have seen for themselves a few of these changes when they were sent home on leave. However, it was a different thing altogether when they had to face the changes day after day. Younger people were not content to put up with things that had gone on for centuries. They wanted to sample the so-called good living to be found in the towns and cities. Women too had seen for themselves their sex working on the land and others had gone to work in factories. The industrial age had started the decline. The First World War had carried the momentum further, shattering the old ways. Things were never to be the same again. It was not just the working class that had to adapt. The upper classes, particularly the large landowners lost their sons who were going to take over. Working arrangements at the mill continued, but not for long…!

Children still worked at the mill crawling under the looms, with bare feet to stop slipping, to retrieve the ends of broken threads. These ends had to be instantly repaired in very hot and damp conditions to quickly get the gliding jennies back into action again. They felt proud they were contributing to the family’s income as they felt the sixpence in their pockets. The children of farm workers also turned their hands to the work in the fields. Picking up stones, weeding the crops, and collecting potatoes. No child of the poor was allowed to get away from, ‘working for their keep’.
   
The bell on the roof tolled at 9am. It seemed very loud and the pigeons scattered at its sound… the noisiness of the children greeting friends subsided and the running around stilled… lines were formed outside the door and all waited for the teacher to admit them. No talking was allowed and each child allotted a seat - after the girls put on their pinnies. Any late comer received a black mark and this was entered in the term report. The roll was called when attendants were ticked off in red. All the Collins children went to this school – there was no escaping either the building or its influence – it stood before Rosalie Cottage and dominated the skyline!

Prayers and Hymns started the day - always the well-known favourites learnt by heart… just as the scholastic subjects were reinforced, by repeating them in rhyme - intoned in a singsong fashion. It was an unchanging ritual going back generations. Classes started at nine o-clock, and lasted until three thirty every day; these went on until she was fourteen. The school hall divided by a large curtain, which did not reach the top of the pitched roof, one side for the younger children and the other side for the older ones. The sun’s rays, finding a gap in the curtain, penetrating the dusty haze, created a spectrum on the opposite wall as they passed through the glass … normally drawn back for morning assembly and special occasions.

A trained certificated male assistant teacher received £100 per year; his female colleague received £10 less. Teacher training colleges insisted upon a strict religious calling for their student intake – they must be free from all faults. It was about moral ascendancy over literary knowledge. It was not always the case that properly trained teachers filled the vacancies. Acting teachers, who were usually the brightest girls in their final year, were preferred – heads considered that they understood their jobs better and had an empathy with their charges. Elementary teachers were, ‘uncultivated and imperfectly educated’, commented one Chief Inspector. It was not unusual for the local squire or magistrate to require schoolteachers to attend Sunday school, play the piano, and organize out of school educational trips, without payment...

The first and second year children followed the seasons with calendar records noting when the first snowdrop showed itself, when the first cuckoo called, and the first swallow flew. The class would be given the task of drawing these and the best ones displayed on the wall. 

All the younger children and newcomers used slates and squeaky slate pencils and approved lessons like English and arithmetic checked by the local authority. Scripture was compulsory for all and once a week the vicar would come to talk about moral behaviour - told in the form of a story. Country children were taught to observe and appreciate the countryside and local history sometimes by a village elder. When the class was considered capable, they were given lead pencils and told to copy letters of the alphabet and words from cardboard specimens. The next stage, after obtaining the correct standard - exercise books with faint green lines were passed out, was to copy off the blackboard simple sentences, this carried them to the next stage, linking sentences together to make a paragraph.

After the two years, the class graduated to the use of pen and ink. Every day the ink monitor would pass out the filled china inkwells placing them in the drilled holes at the top of each desk. It was found difficult to control the ink at first or even to make the pen work at all. The nibs had to be clean and the points not splayed out or crossed - by too much pressure – if so a new one was issued from the store cupboard. Blots and smudges appeared as if by magic. Sleeves and hair sometimes got in the way. But these hurdles were soon overcome and the class settled down to perfect their copper plate hand writing – less pressure on the pen for up strokes and a firmer pressure on the way down. There was always a controversy whether strokes down should follow directly on top of those going up instead of making a loop.

It was consider important by school authorities that ‘drill’ superseded random gymnastics.  The class was told to march swinging their arms forward with the opposite leg – in military fashion. All the arm and leg movements were to be done in correct order - following an accepted pattern – so that each exercises known in advance. Every muscle had an approved exercise and running strictly regulated. If the day were particularly cold then: marching, swinging the arms, hopping and coordinated exercises proceded in turn - the class all following round and round folding and unfolding like a snake. There was never enough space for games, and no equipment if there were. Once a year there was sports day, when all the classes did their exercises before their parents. There were three-legged races, egg and spoon and sack races, throwing the beanbag and catching the ball. All the children had to bring an enamel mug to school so that lemonade could be served out. There were iced and currant buns, provided by the school authorities. Prizes won and achievements recognised, usually in the form of a book with an inscribed insert.

Music lessons consisted of practising singing the National Anthem, the national songs of each country making up Britain, popular patriotic songs and folk songs. This involved much practice, which was taught using the tonic sol-fah system, using a tuning fork to start on the right note.

The whole school marched into the playground to salute the flag and sing all the songs practised…. on Trafalgar Day - with an emphasis on why it was so important to have a navy to protect the country, its Empire, and its trade. After the First World War, Armistice Day was observed when once again the whole school assembled to salute the flag and observe the two minutes silence with the flag at half-mast. National and Saint Days celebrated - Flying the Union Jack and the flag of St George a prerequisite for all organizations and groups. Empire Day considered the most important national event next to the Kings birthday. Patriotic songs sang and tales of daring do – exploration, discovery and invention, read aloud and cheered. All these national events were celebrated during the Sunday church service, which following on from where the school left off.   

My mother and her class were taken for country walks where the names of plants and trees were written down and the local wild-life pointed out. Collections of grasses, leaves, butterflies and other insects mounted and named. Records of when certain things happened throughout the year were copied down and older children made their own sketchbooks, which were initialled and coloured up. Prizes were presented in the hall at the end of each year, these, once again were mainly books.

There were three teachers taking different groups called standards. Infants were taught to knit dishcloths and to patch holes and darn. Elementary dressmaking, buttonhole stitching and pleating was also taught. Reading was considered especially important and frequently checked by the School Inspector.  The quality of writing - using correct English grammar, neatly set out on the page a necessity:  Geography, History, and Nature Studies, Needlework, Cooking and Gardening, all given attention.

Most girl pupils had long hair, plaits or ponytails [on leaving school hair was ‘put up’ either in a bun or braids round the head or draped either side below the ears]. Where possible in large families most of the clothes would be hand-me-downs. If these were not available, they were purchased at ‘bring and buy sales’ or made by mothers, except shoes and hats. Generally, the dresses were of checked gingham, knitted socks, and cotton knickers. Winter wear usually navy skirt attached to a bodice, with hand-knitted jumper, knee high socks, brown lace-up shoes, knitted woollen vest, a liberty bodice buttoned down the front, and an assortment of other buttons to hold up suspenders and knickers. In extremely cold weather, fleecy knickers were worn with a pocket for a handkerchief.

Nothing was ever wasted in the clothing line. Discarded clothes were: cut down, shortened, taken up, patched, darned, or cut into squares - for rag rugs. Worn sheets turned side to middle or made into pillowcases. Worn pillowcases became handkerchiefs, liners or tea towels. There was no end to the amount of make do and mend necessary to look after a large family. All families had a rag bag the contents useful for repairs or making up patchwork quilts and mats.
  
The only outside building was the coal shed and a row of lavatories in the playground. They contained a wooden seat over a bucket that was emptied each week by the school caretaker, who also provided the torn-up newspapers on a string!

There were lessons on Health &amp; Hygiene – the importance of washing hair emphasised, as were: brushing teeth, cutting nails, and what was good to eat. The importance of bathing; the girls were taught how to look after babies. However, there were no lessons on sex. Girls were instructed on how to look after and run a home and this was linked to sewing - the make-up of curtains and covers. Boys were instructed how to dig, why to dig and how to plant out vegetables, and run a greenhouse. There were talks on how to avoid common ailments by a local nurse who cautioned about practising old country remedies, dispelling superstitions, and tales of false beliefs - especially about the menstruation period. Some children smelled strongly and no one wanted to share a desk with them… much of the nurse’s talk was trying to make children aware without spelling out the truth. Children sometimes wore underwear all the year through, never taking them off.   

There was neither school milk nor lunches – sandwiches were eaten at the lunch break… there was always water from the tap in the playground. The eldest children did not finish until three-forty-five to give the infants and their mother’s time to clear the front entrance. Those children who had an elder brother or sister, to take then home, had to wait inside. 

The rooms were well lit because there were such large windows set into the gable ends. In winter, it was always cold due to the high ceilings. Two large round stoves heated both ends of the room. However much the stoves were stoked it was never sufficient to heat the corners. The floor was bare boards, which gave off clouds of dust whenever there was any movement, particularly during  the morning assembly, and for the dancing class. 

Infants were taught to knit with two needles and then four. Darning, using a wooden mushroom, how to turn, hem and take-up and gather in, how to sew on buttons, make floor cloths and cover buttons and taught fraying out – removing each separate thread from a patch of material and un-picking – unravelling an old woollen garment, were methods used to provide material to make-up new. Sewing bags made and each girl’s initials graced the sides – these were end of first term tests and used by the teachers to keep one class quiet whilst the other in the room carried on with their reading and writing. Material was supplied by the council – always-white cotton. From this articles of clothing were made, pillowcases and nighties. Patterns had to be traced, suitable for the child’s size. There was a communal box of thimbles, needles and thread. Embroidery with coloured wool made simple samplers. 

A school inspector of the day noted that a number of children had died through diphtheria. The winter always brought the usual bout of illnesses: whooping cough, mumps, chicken pox, scarlatina, diphtheria, scarlet fever, colds and influenza. The Schools Medical Officer had to be notified especially in an outbreak. These problems affected the standard of education. Special lessons were arranged for children to catch up with lost lessons. Regular attendances by the Doctor and Nurse, to inspect for infections and general cleanliness.If there were, the parents were visited to check that action had been taken... Heads were examined by the Nurse, for nits, and general health. Proper clothing and shoes for winter wear identified, reported and logged. There were no aspirins or cold remedies. Antibiotics had not long beern discovered. Infections were easily spread by contact. In the early twenties, there was a national epidemic of mumps and influensa.

The senior classes had to fill in nature notebooks mostly by personal observation, making sketches and writing explanatory notes. It was encouraged that everyone should be observant and knows what to look for when each season arrived. Poetry was used to promote a good memory. Popular writers of the day discussed and passages read out. On Speech Days, prizes would be distributed for every subject. As with national songs, poems and noted authors - these works committed to heart - to the extent that they could be remembered all through one’s life. In rural areas, in the early twentieth century, most children left school at twelve, to start work. The Education Act of 1918 raised the age to fourteen. The School’s Inspector noted, ‘that arithmetic was not a strong subject but that the discipline was good and the children attentive to their lessons’.

In the early afternoons, before the youngest children pored out of the main school doors, shouting and screaming, their mothers had done the shopping and made courtesy calls... pushing their coach-built, second-hand, much used prams, containing the latest addition. It was a time relished by the mothers knowing their peaceful existence about to be extinguished when their little ones came out of school. They remembered their time in the same school, sometimes even the same teachers. The layout of the schoolrooms recalled - the smells and sounds the same. There were brothers, sisters, cousins, and even more distant relations, mingling with friends, made many years before, all doing the same lessons, in the same manner.

After school my mother roamed the woods and fields with her sisters and brothers in search of birds’ nests and ‘fruits of the hedge’ to take home and present to their mother which might stop her complaining about their torn clothes. She was strict which was necessary considering that at thirty-seven she had eleven children to look after. Her life was a constant endeavour to make ends meet. Gentle, devoted and strong willed, worshipping respectability and constancy. The children played hide-and-seek and Red Indians leaping the streams, climbing the trees, collecting bluebells in the wood and constructing bows and arrows. Mum would be wearing her pinny and hair in ribbons, her brothers, corduroy knee breeches and a jersey. They would search the hedges for suitable sticks to make into pipes, whistles, catapults and peashooters, spud and pop guns, bows and arrows, lances, swords and daggers. The vibrating blade of grass - held between thumbs, made a whistling noise when air blown through… Owl hoots, produced in the same way, but without the grass… betting each other, they could whistle louder or longer... Children still trundled their hoops, bowled marbles – tip-cat'd and skipped; drew hop-scotch chalk lines, spun tops and constructed ‘cats cradles’… Girls played their singing games - joined hands and skipped… here we go gathering ‘Nuts in May’; Jenny Jones visited, Orange and Lemons chopped off heads, and What’s the time Mr Wolf - tempted giant paces… The Big Ship Sails, and The Farmer wants a Wife, gave everyone a chance. Throwing a ball against the school wall, clapping hands, whilst spinning round, sevens, or swapping marbles, or cigarette cards, were all games played at school. Conkers were strung in the autumn and daisies threaded in spring.

All the children in the village went to Sunday school, whose numbers had been built up since the chapel had been erected, thus enabling a choir of boys and young men to be formed - the Morning Service, followed on after the school. The choir was used, as a means of teaching basic music to the children - would make them keener to continue attending. Occasionally there would be special services for a christening, saint’s day or Mothering Sunday. The annual Empire Day was celebrated using paper hats previously painted in the Union Jack colours. Patriotic songs were sung - stories of daring-do – Cecil Rhodes and Captain Cook, atlases perused for its pink areas and places of British influence. It was a day for rejoicing and celebration, greatly looked forward-to. The organist who doubled as the choirmaster religiously stuck to the few Hymns, Ancient and Modern, which were well known and practiced. It was a way of ensuring that there would not be any embarrassing silences of mumbled verses. The church brought together all the various elements of the population cementing the community together. Whether the day wet or fine… the music of the choir, gave the stark interior a softer touch.

In the winter, the cold seemed to be far more intense. Clothing was not so efficient at keeping the cold out and often children had chapped hands and legs. Some cried, when their hands started to thaw out, whilst standing round the coke brazier. Many of the children reached school having to stumble over rutted ground and frozen field still wearing ordinary shoes worn by much use – usually from being passed on from older brothers and sisters. Sometimes the soles would be so thin that studs and blakies would not hold in to the leather. Fortunately, the Collins children lived opposite the school did not suffer these setbacks. This was one of the positive aspects to having the school so near!

My mother told us that her reading was done mostly in bed by the light of a candle. During the evening, before going to bed, time would be filled by knitting in front of the fire, resting her feet on the logs, set before the fire. Her sisters would embroider, make spills – rolling up strips of newspaper, make dolls’ clothes and Christmas presents: kettle or iron holders, gloves, pin-cushions, handkerchief sachets, lavender bags, padded coat hangers, peg bags and tray cloths – many of these would be crocheted or contain crocheted borders. French knitting, using a cotton reel with looped wool over pins, made a long cord that could be tacked in the round to make mats. A useful present could be made from sewing mothballs in red silk… providing leaves, cut out of thick felt, to represent holly, a hanging loop of platted wool would ward off moths in the wardrobe. Dishcloths were knitted from heavy cotton yarn, face flannels from old cut down towels, old dresses made aprons, rag rugs, patchwork quilts and sacking doormats. Cardboard cutouts were decorated with coloured paper stuck on with flour paste to make theatre sets were some of the pastimes, which contributed towards passing long winter evenings. Her brothers designed poker work using red hot skewers spliced onto a wooden handle, cut jig saws out of pictures pasted on boards, and interlaced wooden spills to make mats.

Along with the harvest revels, Christmas Day and Boxing Day were the other two great occasions for the whole family. Both these were holidays celebrated by everyone, although the animals still had to be looked after. Holly and mistletoe – the only decorations, were draped across the tops of pictures and laid across the ceiling beams. Carols were sung, everyone singing one verse on their own, party games enjoyed and simple presents unwrapped. The children went to church three times on Christmas Day and on each occasion they enjoyed a special meal, the highlight of the day's events, the afternoon meal served with parsnip wine for the elders. The church choir did the rounds and the children knocked on doors after singing a carol. Neither, New Year's Eve, or the following day, were marked by celebration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter VIII: Elsie and the world of work====

Amongst the children who left school, in the twenties, there were few who went on to higher education. Some of the girls took up nursing or teaching - the only two positions which required training for girls. Those who were to become pupil-teachers could stay on at school to teach the youngest children and pick up some of the skills necessary for teaching. Trainee nurses might be taken on in hospitals if they were near enough. Both positions were underpaid receiving less than the lowest paid worker. Women teachers, and nurses in training, could not get married, having to leave if they did so.

If a bright thirteen year old, from a lower-middle class family, residing in the country – father perhaps a self employed artisan with a flourishing business employing others; the track to become a teacher would be as a class monitor, to an uncertificated teacher, teaching the first induction class of about fifty children. If he/she proved capable, offered a formal indenture - as a pupil-teacher. The first hour of every day was put aside for instruction… you would be also expected to take an annual examination for each of the five year apprenticeship course when you then proceeded to a teacher training college - to take a two-year course. After 1903, the starting age for apprenticeships was sixteen and paid £2 per annum. Their title was pupil-teacher in a four-year course. It is clear that a national scheme was still a long way off. The observance of one scheme rather than another depended on the local authority - whether it was at a board school or attached to a religious body.

There were no unions or tribunals working arrangements were strictly adhered to. Pupil Teachers had to attend county classes twice a week This continued until the Second World War had been underway for a couple of years. Then the emergency of all out war made such rules irrelevant. The training for both skills took until the pupil was eighteen - then earning about £1.16p per month One pound usually went back home to mother and the rest on lodging and keep, leaving very little left; then a college course undertaken for full training.

The County Council paid any travelling expenses – this was the only grant. Books had to be bought and college fees had to be paid – by the parents. An oath had to be taken by Pupil Teachers that they would not work out of the county for two years after qualifying. It also meant that the now trained teacher could not get married until after that period had been completed.

Some children were bright enough to sit for a scholarship examination when eleven – and then go to a grammar school. However, there were so few places that extra cramming had to be contemplated. School uniform, books, sports equipment and satchel all had to be bought, and the fares paid for train or bus. It was quite impossible for workers children to think of such treatment.

If the boy was to go into ‘trade’, he too had to think of an apprenticeship. There were no such schemes for girls until the late seventies. An employer had to be found to take on a lad and there were many who wanted the chance. Most trades took five years - to become full trained, others took seven. The parents had to pay the employer a fee for the privilege - which might be several hundred pounds. The often meant that the boy had to leave the village and find lodgings. At the end of his apprenticeship, he would have his ‘papers’ stating that he was full qualified. He was then likely to be taken on as an ‘improver’ at the lowest paid rate, for at least the first three months; by which time the employer would be in a better place to judge whether to take on the worker. If taken on, it would take several years to be accepted as a fully trained worker, then, and only then, would he receive the ‘going’ rate for the job - at the bottom rung of any ladder -  any layoffs, then he suffered the 'last in, first out' rule.

An alternative was to work on a farm – as a ‘lad’, to pick up the skills of a land worker - this maybe, looking after animals, helping repair walls, ditches and fences. Alternatively, as a carrier’s boy, delivering. Other employment could be found working for the local estate – park, garden or ‘in house’. Girls usually stayed at home under the watchful eye of mother – perhaps making lace, straw dollies or making garments. What is interesting is that women were more adventurous than men and that of those women it was the younger who opted for urban life – more often than not, to life in-service. It is clear from census figures that economic and social developments since the latter part of the nineteenth century have confirmed that women were attracted to town life… It only needed the stimulus of a shortage of men in the work place to attract women from the home. Each of the wars in the twentieth century has contributed to this trend. By the time the First World War was over women had seen a complete change in social cohesion. This was the start to the breaking up of class structures. The numbers of men killed and maimed, particularly the officer classes, was felt by the gentry who were looking forward to getting back to pre-war standards. Inheritance taxes completed the breakdown…

Girls from agricultural labourer’s families in their first job often only worked for their keep - so that they might receive training and eventually that much sought after reference. The turnover of servants was high the average time in a first job was three years. Positions for more skilled trades were found through the grapevine – the church, tradesmen, family or friends.

My mother started work, four years after the Great War finished, in 1922 - immediately on leaving school at the age of fourteen. Her father, aged fifty-two, was employed as an independent lace engineer at Small &amp; Tidmas net factory doing maintenance work. Elsie’s mother Rosa was looking after ten of her children at home. It is uncertain if they were all living together, but certainly seven were – which made Rosalie Cottage very cramped living indeed. The number of children conceived close together was normal for the working class and the lack of living space common for the poor. The obvious lack of family planning being the result of the absence of sex education, lack of discipline, and personal ambition... there was also a degree of, ‘conforming to general behaviour patterns’. Even though there was a national exodus to the cities and towns, there were still insufficient jobs and housing. In the 1920s, neither the Tatworth Parish Housing Scheme, at Wellings Close provided sufficient housing, nor did the Perry Street Factory cottages - mainly taken up by retired workers. This shortage mainly affected the growing population of young people with children. Money was short, jobs hard to come by, and even when they did, the choice was limited; everything had to be within cycle range.

It is not generally realized that between the end of the First World War and 1922, one quarter of the land in Britain changed hands. It was not appreciated at the time and has scarcely been written about after. It was not just one factor that brought this about... the great landowners were short of cash, and they were tired... tired of the responsibility, after so many of the owners, and their male progeny, had been killed - in the slaughter of WWI. It could have been put down to taxation, poor grain harvests, imported grain prices forcing down its profitability and the decline in the old tenant landlord system. It all came a head... the old ways could not continue. The aristocracy had let the country down, now it was the turn of the Trades Unions and the Labour Party. Surely, the workers could rely upon each other?  

In the twenties, most working-class families expected their children to contribute to the running of the household. Tasks were learnt by following their parents round the home helping as they went. The boys took on the heavier work whilst the girls helped with the sewing and food preparation… water had to be bought from the stream... each day had its routine of household chores. Even though Tatworth had two main employers that made the village more self sufficient for jobs at least forty per-cent of labour was connected to the land. Agricultural prices had been falling for six months and continued to fall. The price of wheat had halved in six months and the farmers, to combat this: shed workers, reduced prices, and reduced the acreage of cereal cultivation. It took ten years of struggle for the farming industry to recover and by 1932, the Wheat Act guaranteed prices and control mounted through Marketing Boards. 

Knowing that her daughter needed work her mother arranged for her son Cecil, to introduce Elsie to Mr Phelps - the manager of the lace mill. Her good references and connection with the factory - through the family, ensured that she would stand a good chance of being employed - to become a trained lace hand. This was no light matter. Only one child in six was offered training of some kind, and to be an apprentice was even more difficult... My mother’s references and good school report stood her in good stead. She started work at the Small &amp; Tidmus net factory in 1922, the fourth member of the Collins family to work there. This was three years before the ‘mule’ spinners, became the first group of workers to be enrolled as legalized trade unionists. The man in charge of the lace factory was Fred Phelps who lived at the top of St Margaret’s Lane, opposite the thatched chapel of ease.

The Perry Street Lace Mill was Tatworth's main employer giving work to over fifty people in lean times, and a hundred, when in full production. The mill had been developed by Cuff &amp; Co., in 1830. Ten years later J B Payne had bought it but had very little capital to develop the mill. The power was supplied by a feeder pond discharging into leats. During the next ten years, the industry was in the doldrums and the workers on half time. This unsettled production period was caused by the usual social problems – industrialization, labour problems, cost of living, export restrictions, fashion changes, and war. In effect, lace for fashion was a luxury; however, for mosquito netting it had a permanent place in the nations shopping list - during wars and troop settlements abroad – later for parachute silk. 

Mr Phelps, the works manager, saw to it that Elsie was properly taught, and then she was placed under the watchful eye of one of the senior lace hands... It was not long before she was crawling about under the looms joining the broken thread in company with the other girls. Eventually she was allowed to wind the bobbins. The Manchester spinners, their wagons rolled into the mill yard at frequent intervals, supplied the yarn by the hank, which were slipped over the free-running spoked frame and drawn off by Elsie and her fellow trainee girls to wooden bobbins.When sufficiently filled the wooden bobbins were placed into a basket, taken to the machine bobbin rack, and placed in rows… their threads taken through feeder guides to brass bobbins, an inch and a half diameter within a slim case. Once winding completed they were packed tightly into a bobbin carriage ready to be inserted into the lace machine. The yarn from each bobbin threaded through an eyelet.

Another rack was filled with a long line of wooden bobbins their threads drawn off and taken through guides, to converge with others – warping onto a drum. From the drum groups of threads taken off onto a long roller called the beam… this beam was then taken to the lace machine and placed in position. A bundle of threads were then untied and lead through guides to the net roller and when given tension - the warp was ready. The brass bobbin carriages then set into slots in the machine. The machine was set into motion. The weft thread was given a twist as it engaged with the warp thread making a series of interlocking loops.

There, Elsie worked with her assistant for ten years, with the great mill wheel, within the building on the floor below, revolving with enough weight and power to shake the building, throbbing and thrusting away, as it gathered speed. A clackerty, pulsating action, that seemed to be beating time with your pulse. The mill’s power transferred by an iron shaft beneath; above, on every floor, the pulleys, spindles, cogs running in and out, and drive belts slap and clap as they start the bobbins spinning… then nothing but the mighty crescendo could be heard. The lace hands signalled to each other by hand, mouthing the words – much like the deaf and dumb. The world trembles as the tiny cotton particles dance to the tune. It was the job of her father to repair and make his own machines in the workshop alongside the mill.
  
The ‘lace hand’ or ‘twist hand’ worked with a boy or girl to look after a pair of machines… setting the machine up – un-tying a bundle of warp threads… leading them through the guides to the net roller, to be tensioned. When the brass bobbins were slotted into carriages the machine was ready to start… knitting - twisting as it engaged with the warp thread. The labourers made up the largest numbers in the mill followed by lace menders and lace hands.

After learning the trade, she was paid five shillings a week; a labourers wage was forty-six shillings. Nearly all lace manufacturers kept a general store and made the workers take goods for money. Two loaves of bread and half a pound of butter formed part of the weekly allowance. Mother could well remember the noise made by the machinery, the dust and the fluff that flew about – being breathed in… and the danger of fire and explosions. She worked among the rows of whirling spindles where the threads often broke when the tension was too great… twisted and spun. Her first job was to repair these broken ends as quickly as possible moving as fast as she could taking care not to slip on the oil-soaked wooden floors. It was so hot in the spinning and weaving sheds maintaining a moist atmosphere to prevent the threads breaking… that the girls wore just their slips throughout each day. Elsie stayed there for ten years until she was twenty-four, working her way up the ladder… becoming one of the senior lace hands.

Both men and women operated a number of looms packed closely together. Although this made a short distance to cover, it was tightly packed. The operator had to maintain his or her own looms making sure the area was swept clear and the machine oiled. The breaks in the cotton and lack of weft made good if the young trainee girls were not there. The weaving shed were kept cool and damp in summer and steam heated in winter… the object being to stop the cotton from breaking and assist in a better weave. However, the dripping condensation and damp atmosphere did nothing for colds and chills. In summer, the floors kept damp to hold down the flying dust and fluff, which could become a hazard being flammable and causing lung damage. From accounts of factory life at the turn of the century it is obvious that the working conditions for both men and women would not remain in such a depressing state… relying on time to heal the sore expected… however, forces more urgent pushed evolution.

The comparison is easy to make between the periods prior to each of the World Wars… both lengthy agricultural depressions. It is also not difficult to see why these depressions were immediately reversed by rearmament and conscription. The second agricultural revolution saw the state intervene to reconstruct rural Britain. There was an urgency to expand production at any cost we were to become self-sufficient.

Grandfather gave up being a self-employed lace mill engineer when he was sixty-five, in 1935. The Salter &amp; Stokes creamery had open up in South Chard near to Chard Junction some years previously and he and his sons went to work there. In the 1938, The Wiltshire United Dairies stated a milk processing plant on the site, the most modern in the world at the time. Shortly afterwards it became part of the United Dairies Group… then in turn Cow &amp; Gate… all part of the Unigate Group. Now there was no family connection with the lace mill.

Only a cycle ride away from Tatworth is Forde Abbey. The original abbey had been built to accommodate twelve brothers in 1142 – after taking six years to build. By 1200, it was considered one of the major scholastic, religious foundations in Britain, continuing its role until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. The last abbot, Thomas Chard considerably enlarged the building adding the cloisters. After the dissolution, it fell into decay until bought a hundred years later by Sir Edmund Prideaux – who later became Oliver Cromwell’s Attorney General - further enlarged it to today proportions. In 1702, the estate came by marriage to Sir Francis Gwym, whose inheritors continued the ownership until a relation of the present family, Mrs Bertram Evans, bought the building and nearly two thousand acres of land, including five farms, in 1864. In 1905, there were eight resident servants for the family. The in-house servants included a housekeeper, governess, a nurse and nursery-maid, a cook. A parlour maid, and a ‘tweeny’, who combined the duties of housemaid with those of the kitchen. For outside duties, a coachman/chauffeur and stable-man who occupied the stable mews, whose duties involved driving the new car – the brougham was still kept, as were a pair of horses for carriage work, and a hunter for him. Head gardener with a staff of four who maintained a kitchen garden and park, and pig man whose duties included the pig-sty, chicken houses and milking the cow. The laundry was done outside the house in the village, as was the shoeing of the horses. Increasingly the number of servants was reduced the work taken over by part-time staff. As the main services were introduced so there was a further reduction in staff. Before mains water was piped to the abbey, there was a great deal of water to be supplied to the rooms daily. There was three breakfasts to prepare - for the nursery and schoolroom at eight and for the dining room at nine.It was the housekeeper’s job to control and direct the staff inside the house. Many of the servant’s duties carried over into other tasks to help. The gardener and stable-hand trimmed the lamps, filled the lamp’s bowls and pumped water into the cistern.

Life at the abbey was highly structured. To maintain the house and grounds required an enormous amount of work… it needed to be painted on a regular basis both inside and out and the grounds kept mown. The annual spring clean was a major event when a number of village girls were employed to dust, polish, and attend to the crystal chandeliers.
 
The Lady of the house announced locally that there was a vacancy for a live-in woman’s maid/house-cleaner. It was common knowledge that the the owner was a good employer – considerate towards their staff. Her sister told Elsie that there was a vacancy for a maid and it was for this post she applied after telling the foreman at the lace factory her intentions to apply. The management graciously supplied her with good references to go with the application. She soon heard back that her application was satisfactory that she was expected to attend an interview in a few days. This she did and the interview was a success to the extent that she was offered the position of ladies maid instead. Elsie considered she was very fortunate, excited by the thought of leaving the mill -having a far gentler, cleaner, superior job.

She was lucky to be employed by someone considered a good employer who was fortunate too, in that my mother was very keen to leave the mill - to do more gentle and refined work, in comfortable surroundings. In 1932 at the age of 24, Elsie left the lace factory for good. The job description was changed to that of ‘Lady’s Maid’, after my mother had been interviewed. The owner was delighted to find someone who understood quilting and cap making even though they were outdated skills. A Lady’s Maid was often expected to originate new dress designs whilst up dating others. Her other main task was to dress and fashion her mistresses hair. Having worked at the Lace Mill, she was familiar with the skill of maintaining-materials, cleaning, stitching and re-adapting old work.

This was towards the end of the Depression - things were just beginning to ‘look-up’. It was a new start for my mother, at a time when there was more optimism about. It was also the time when many estates were breaking up. The wealthy had tried to hold on skimping here and there trying to make ends meet. Many failed and their homes sold up. There were many house sales. Land was sold to absentee landlords as an investment. The old ways stated to disappear. Into this new world, my mother trod without knowing where it would lead. She had been offered the position of Lady’s Maid and she was excited, as she had just cause to be…!

The four year period between the end of the First World War and Elsie ‘going into service’, one-quarter of the land in Britain changed hands – the largest change of ownership since the dissolution of the monasteries – it was the break-up of the landed estates. Once again, much of the land ended up being cultivated by farmers. There was a shortage of domestic labour, rationing was imposed and the state intervened in the running of the countryside. All these things were to affect the owners. Forde Abbey survived and continued to play a part in society. 

A Lady’s Maid was a considerable step up in the world, no more backbreaking work replacing shuttles. There was always the possibility of visiting London, which she had to agree to do before accepting the job. Quite often Elsie wore clothes handed down to her although she was obliged to alter the dress so that it was not recognisable as her Mistresses. Her ordinary dress was black stockings and close fitting floral dress. There was a strict code of behaviour even though her employer was easy going. My mother would never speak badly about her mistress and nothing would ever induce the mistress to disparage her maid’s character.

Elsie’s position in the household was just below that of the housekeeper – above the nurse, and about the same as the governess. Most came from middle-class parents in reduced circumstances, which is why my mother was so delighted to be offered the position. Her income was £20 per week. Although the work was not arduous, she was very much kept on the go – adjusting her lady’s hair, changing her clothes and preparing for the next outing. The biggest drawback to the job was that generally the Mistress preferred their personal maid to be young, good looking and well turned out. As the older ladies maids lost their calm so fear of unemployment followed. 

Mum was woken at seven every morning by the housemaid to quickly wash and comb her hair; her day lasted until ten o’clock at night having half an hour for breakfast, tea and supper, and an hour for dinner. She had to be ready at half-past seven to take tea and toast, the morning paper and any letters. The bath had filled and the toiletries prepared, before taking breakfast with the other servants in the Servants Hall. Immediately afterwards she had to be upstairs to help her Mistress to dress.

She had a comfortable bedroom next door to her mistress. The bed was made for her by the upstairs maid, with clean sheets every week. There was hot water for her bath and jug, and on cold night a hot water bottle. Once a week she had her own tablet of soap and a lighted candle placed by her bed at seven. Her main tasks were to correct, alter, make-up her mistresses clothes in the sewing room and attend to her mistresses every want.

Dinner was at one o’clock, the first course in the Hall, and the second in Nan’s [the governess’] room. Work started an hour later, completing her morning work. A walk in the grounds could take up the rest of the day until teatime at four, when it was time for a buffet meal of sandwiches and cake. This lasted a further hour when the mistress’s clothes were to be prepared for the evening - or, for ‘calling’. The timing for the evening's entertainment discussed well before. It was now four years after the First World War. The services reduced to pre-war levels… the influx of so many men onto the job market created massive unemployed. There were groups of men on every street corner around the job centres.

The social changes brought into being by women taking over men’s jobs changed forever the role of women. They liked the responsibility and the freedom from household drudgery… women were not going to give up their newfound status. Women’s fashions displayed this change - skirts and dresses were designed to be worn level with the knee. It was the age of the flappers – short straight dresses, dropped waistlines, cloche hats and short hair – cut in a shingle, or bob if slightly longer. The Marcel effect, corrugated waves, was achieved by using curling tongs.It was the time for women to display boyish figures to go with the shingles and long cigarette holders. Waist was small, and hips and busts kept in proportion. Undergarments changed, now waists compressed in roll-on girdles with suspenders attached – stocking always worn. A shapeless bra known as a bandeau flattened the bust. Over these were worn cami-knickers or a camisole and French knickers.Length of outer garments kept well above the knee consisting of sleeveless dresses with dropped waistlines. Strait skirts with perhaps box pleating that mother had to continually iron. Shoes had medium heels, pointed toes and a bar across the instep, considered very stylish. Hats were cloches, tightly fitting over the ears with a close turned-back brim. It was mother’s job to sew trimmings of ribbon on the hats to match the suit worn for the next day.    
  
Each morning’s task was to prepare her Mistresses clothes, for the day as well as seeing that the previous were put away - clean and tidy. Any repairs set aside for future work by the seamstress. There was generally an hour for needlework and specialist ironing. Once ready for her day, and had left her bedroom, the room was tidied, bed aired and remade and the next set of clothes laid out for the afternoon or for travelling out – walking or riding in the dog-cart. Carpets cleaned, surfaces dusted and dressing glass polished. At monthly intervals the furniture was polished.

If a shopping trip arranged then mum would accompany Mrs Roper to help her with the bags and be a companion. If visiting, presents or gifts set aside ready for the occasion. If she stayed in there would be tea, served in the Servants Hall at eleven… In the winter, it was mum's job to make-up - keep lit, the bedroom fire - to ensure the room aired. A clotheshorse draped with recently ironed clothes to air them properly. The lake in the garden, enclosed by the flower borders and tall trees, held the evening air, which made the house damp if the windows left open and fires not kept in. The Servants dinner served at midday and taken with the rest of the staff. The pudding, and after dinner tea served in the Housekeeper’s Room where mum’s friend Nan, who was the governess, entertained her.

Between the hours of two and four – when tea served in the Servants Hall, mum was able to catch up on her sewing and any leisure-time practices before helping Mrs Roper to dress for Afternoon Tea - served at five. She may have visited the garden to arrange with the Gardener to cut some flowers for the bedroom. Thereafter, the bedroom was set ready for preparation - dressing her Lady for dinner and the evening’s entertainment. This started at half-past six and ended with tidying up the room and toiletries, preparing the bed, inserting the hot water bottles, which were changed at half past eight. An hour later supper served in the Servants Hall after which the rest of the evening given over to leisure activities until the Mistress retired to bed when the final undressing supervised. 

Her life revolved around her mistress who always referred to her as Miss Collins. A lady's maid had to be with her mistress all the time whether at home or away. Every piece of clothing had to be in perfect condition - properly washed, ironed or steam-cleaned. All sewing completed, the dressing table equipped with all the necessary items and the bathroom laid out ready for use. For the lady of the house her maid was not only a helper but a confidant and friend.

Elsie was expected to travel with her employer wherever she went - to supervise her comforts and to carry anything extraneous. For the annual move to London - for the ‘season’ the ladies maid went along as did the chauffeur. This state of affairs for the wealthy was going through a transition period. Increasingly young staff did not want to enter service - the duties were considered boring and beneath them. Socialists and Trade Unionists, pointed out that servants were being exploited and should seek better wages and the ‘Girls’ Friendly Society considered the moral welfare of the young. Inheritance Tax finished off what industrialization started. The Second World War completed the transition not just the death of many young men who would have received an estate as an inheritance but the rise of Socialism and the victory of the Labour party. By the time Elsie started her new job the General Strike was in the past and the Government bent on rearming the nation. A period of full employment, massive house building and euphoria took the place of stagnation and decay.

The lady’s maid was responsible for dressing her employer's hair and laying out all the clothes to be worn that day - for every occasion. Dignity at all times and in all places was essential. Her mistress used Pond’s Cold Cream at night and Pond’s Vanishing Cream during the day, with a hint of rouge under a thin dusting of powder. Cremola hand cream used to soften the hands and scented lavender soap was at the side of the basin. Gloves of soft leather, white for summer and brown for winter, washed by my mother and dried very slowly to retain their softness. My mother stayed for only a year… as a companion rather than as a Lady’s Maid. That same year, 1933, she met her future husband at a Masonic dinner… they married … at St John the Evangelist, Tatworth and the wedding breakfast held at Rosalie Cottage.

It was a long way for my mother to have travelled… from the  garden gate, that lead out onto the street; the stream and its bridge - that never ceased to play a part in every day life. The dominant school building opposite - refusing to play a minor role, and of course, ‘The Mill’… and the childhood, teenage friends - all enduring, the cold, the damp and the clammer together. The secure family routine… closeness of relations and friends… wandering the country lanes - looking over the hedges at trees on far off purple hills, that touched the sky…; all things of the past but retained inside… Now, when married,it was to be a life of suburban pavement and shop… children, a pram and brick built house…, cinema, and all that makes for town-life. I am sure it was all, what my mother wanted - imagined in her dreams… whilst working away at the looms, and later… attending as a Lady’s Maid.

Elsie’s upbringing, despite the obvious lack of amenity and convenience did include security and love – the sort of love common to the time not sentimental and clinging. What stood her in good stead was her love and understanding of nature, which permeated her soul. She had witnessed the change in how the land was managed. The reliance on the horse now given over to the tractor, the decline in the number of village craftsmen and the move away from country ways to industrial muscle and the vans delivery service. The deferential attitude accorded to higher social classes by generations of tenants and workers were now questioned – changed for good after World War 1. Peoples ambitions, like my mother’s, did not included working three looms for the rest of her life. She wanted a bit of luxury not servitude… Mum could easily have returned to Tatworth, but, as with all dreams, reality dictated otherwise… what price then a glow-worm in the ditch instead of a street lamp… It is just like forgetting the pain of fingers thawing out, especially when the sun is burning the back of one’s neck!

By the time mum took us on holiday she had been living away from home for nine years. In those nine years she had been in service, married, moved to two London suburbs, had as many children… whilst suffering the blitz. Not only had her life changed, but work back at the mill had altered too… Her father had been retired for six years, missing the bombs, randomly dropped on the mill. The mill by 1941 was turning out mosquito nets for the Far East… the village meanwhile became inward looking when the blackout descended. Rationing had to be coped with and the extra hour of double-summertime allowed more work to be done in daylight hours. The Make-do-and-Mend slogan, initiated by the government, indicated the sort of attitude that should be adopted - for a country under siege.

The already hard rural existence was made harder still by shortages and absentee men folk. It was the woman’s job to ‘make ends meet’, which they did, turning to age-old methods of living off the country. They had not only the means to do so but also past experience to draw on. In fact, there was little change in the life of the Collins’ family or in the day-to-day life in the village. Some of the innocence and obedience, dignity and pride had rubbed off, replaced by: better education, fewer acceptances of past rules and regimes, more casual attitude to dress formalities, manners and etiquettes.

Elsie never forgot her early life, which shaped everything she did. Recounting those times brought her eyes alive and a smile to her lips. Giving time to her past kept the memories dust-free - easily plucked from her memory-bank in times of stress. She could recall and name the trees down the lane, the shrubs in the hedges lining the winding path, and the wild flowers in the meadow. The ford and the bridge, not far from the garden gate, served the brook, which bubbled and chuckled as generations of laughing children played in its crystal-clear water. Flocks of sheep passed over the bridge, hurried on by the shouts from the shepherd, later, the farmer’s cows pushed and shoved to get to their stalls - to be milked. The banks that lined the waters edge burgeoned with rush and thyme, waterlillies and cowsfoot. The willow in the hedge, beneath which the waters flowed, alive with chattering sparrows pecking at the berries then wiping their beaks on the lichen covered boughs. All these she left behind… for a town life, she had hankered for… To step away from the fluffy, damp atmosphere of the lace mill and in-service attendance. All these pictures were the rock upon which she clung, recalling their colours and shapes to pass on… more to satisfy her longings than to educate us children.

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meter was installed in 1928. All stamps are inscribed “[[w:CCCP|CCCP]]” either in the frank or the town mark. The Union collapsed into its constituent states in 1991. For issues since the break-up, see BELARUS, ESTONIA, [[w:KAZAKHSTAN|KAZAKHSTAN]], LATVIA, LITHUANIA, MOLDOVA, [[w:RUSSIA|RUSSIA]], and UKRAINE. Some Soviet meter designs continued to be used unaltered for months and even years after the break-up.

* The stamps are grouped according to appearance of the frank and usage:

:: A - Rectangle with simulated perforation border
:: B - Rectangle with straight-line border
:: C - Horizontal octagon
:: D - Upright octagon
:: PP - Special stamps for Parcel Post
:: PV - Public, self-service vending machine stamps&lt;/font&gt;

'''Description of the cover at right''':
:::::::::: The large circular marks are no postal cancellations or censor marks. The text says &quot;УСМО * Московская расчетная контора * За счет с оглашения № 4852&quot; and translates as &quot;USMO * [[w:Moscow|Moscow]] accounting office * On account of agreement number 4852&quot;. УСМО = Управления Cвязи Московской Области = Moscow [[w:Oblast|Oblast]]' Directorate of Communications. An 'Oblast' is the equivalent of a province. УСМО had a factory in Moscow which was evacuated to [[w:Shadrinsk|Shadrinsk]] in the Cheliabinsk Oblast' in November 1941 because of the war. It is still there. A smaller factory was re-established in Moscow in 1942.
 
:::::::::: The word &quot;расчетная&quot; in the circular mark relates to &quot;postage-on-account&quot; mail originating from a number of Soviet institutions and enterprises in the 1920's and 1930's. The procedure followed is described in an article in the Post Rider, the journal of the Canadian Society of Russian Philately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Post-Rider|publisher=Canadian Society of Russian Philately, Issue: 38, June 1996 - 'Postage on Account Mail'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::::::::: The cover shows an unusual use of this service, combining both a meter frank (15k being the international ordinary letter rate) and the use of the &quot;on account&quot; mark. It is conceivable that the meter frank was applied by an automated machine located on the enterprise's grounds and then the circular cancel applied by a supervisor to validate its use. The meter-franking machine would be periodically checked by the post-office to assess the total sum owed by the enterprise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Albanian language belongs to the Indo-European family of languages but has its own specifics, similar to Greek or Armenian, which means it does not have any direct similarities with other languages in the same family.

The Albanian language is spoken by Albanians who descend from the ancient Illyrian tribes that occupied the western part of the Balkan peninsula. It is recognized to be the continuation of the Illyrian language. Unfortunately, there are no written documents to prove this theory so the connection between the two languages is only indirectly supported through the names of people, places and historical studies.

The first document in written Albanian dates from the 16th century when the book, Meshari by Gjon Buzuku, was published in 1555.

During the middle-ages, there was a large exodus of Albanians into Greece, where today, an archaic dialect of Albanian is still spoken. The Albanian language was also spoken in the Chameria region of northern Greece, but due to the ethnic cleansing of Albanians by Greeks there, many Albanians took refuge in Turkey or returned to Albania. The remaining population has been forbidden to speak Albanian.

After the death of the great Albanian national hero, Skenderbeg, and the occupation of Albania by the Ottoman Empire, thousands of Albanians migrated to southern Italy and Sicily. Today, some 200,000 Albanians called Arbëresh remain there and speak a very old Albanian dialect.

The national literary Albanian language was formed during the middle of the last century. At that time, there were two main dialects used: the northern dialect, Gege, and the southern dialect, Tosk.

Both dialects were incorporated into one in 1972 during a language congress held in Tirane where most of the Gege dialect was incorporated into the Tosk dialect and was declared the official, unified Albanian language and was subsequently accepted by all Albanians of the former Yugoslavia.

Where is the Albanian language spoken today?

Today, the Albanian language is spoken in Albania and within the ethnic Albanian areas of the former Yugoslavia, such as Kosova, Macedonia, Montenegro and South Serbia. But in these regions, where daily political repression has become a way of life, the Albanian language is also suffering setbacks as a result of the widespread discrimination against Albanians.

Since the dawn of tribal society and the emergence of a social structure, the concept of governance has been evolving and changing.

=== Governance ===
Since the dawn of tribal society and the emergence of a social structure, the concept of governance has been evolving and changing. When a king is crowned and rules his lands with an even temperament or an iron fist the norms and behavior that is expected of his subjects is a form of governance. When ancient council members meet to discuss and decide on the rule of their lands is a form of governance. Governance is a tool for establishing ordered rule and mobilizing a collective into action (Stoker, 1998).  Stoker wrote &quot;The essence of governance is its focus on governing mechanisms which do not rest on recourse to the Authority and sanctions of government.&quot; (Stoker, 1998)  As societies become more advanced the mechanisms of governance become more advanced.  In the modern era governance is a complex network of checks and balances that requires adherence to many different concepts that work in unison to help keep the process of governance moving in a forward direction. The concepts that we are going to look at in this study are participation, transparency, responsiveness, consensus and accountability.

=== Good Governance ===
&quot;One of the most important aspects of governance is participation. Participation is achieved through legitimate intermediate institutions or representatives working towards a common goal.&quot; (UNESCAP, 2009) For example, the representative republic found in the United States Government requires a certain level of participation from elected representatives, their constituents, and the government itself to function properly. Without participation from various parties governance would fail to progress past its initial stages.
Equally critical to the success of governance is achieving consensus. (UNESCAP, 2009) A consensus oriented approach needs to take into consideration that there are several actors and as many view points in a given society. &quot;Good governance requires mediation of the different interests to reach a broad consensus on what is in the best interest of the whole community and how this can be achieved.&quot; (UNESCAP, 2009) This can only result from an understanding of the historical, cultural and social contexts of a given society or community. If decision makers aren’t sensitive to the needs and wants of the governed the proposal will ultimately fail.
Accountability is needed at all levels and stages of the governance process not only governmental institutions but also the private sector and civil society organizations must be accountable to the public and to their institutional stakeholders. (UNESCAP, 2009)  In general an organization or an institution is accountable to those who will be affected by its decisions or actions.
Transparency is also required to foster good governance. This means that decisions taken and their enforcement are done in a manner that follows rules and regulations. It also means that information should be freely available and directly accessible to those who will be affected by such decisions and their enforcement. Transparency also means that enough information is provided and that it is provided in easily understandable forms and media. This can ensure the right information is afforded to the decision makers to ensure the guidance or control of an activity, in order to meet a specific objective.  A good governance process must also be responsive to the needs of the all stakeholders within a reasonable time frame. (UNESCAP, 2009) For example the way Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which was created in response to the Enron scandal of 2001 was quickly enacted to protect the general investing public. If this legislation took ten years to become law the purpose for its creation would have been lost in the time between its inception and implementation. In addition to being timely any rule enacted needs to reach a broad consensus in society on the best interests of the community. For governance to succeed, consensus or an understanding of the consensus must be a priority.

=== The Internet ===
The Internet is a relatively new and dynamic technology. The origins of the internet can be traced back to the beginning of the 1960's with Leonard Kleinrocks' research on packet switching technologies and J.C.R. Lickliders' work on the concept of the &quot;Galactic Network&quot; (Leiner et al., 2009). Additional research and development of the Network Control Protocol (NPC) by Vinton Cerf and TCP/IP by Robert Kahn in the 1970s directly contributed to the development and success of the Internet (Leiner et al., 1997). However, the creation of the internet as we know it today is not simply the result of engineers and scholars working on new technologies. The individuals that were instrumental in creating the internet feel that developing new technologies and extending existing technologies was only one aspect (Leiner et al., 2009). In the beginning, the contributors of the technology needed to help build what we know as the internet were on opposite ends of the world while other scientists where in the United Kingdom (Leiner et al., 1997). They needed a way to come together and pool their collective knowledge and resources to achieve their goals.
The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created in 1958. The previous year on October 4, 1957 the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite into orbit. This singular action sparked a feeling of global hysteria and was the driving force behind the creation of ARPA (Van Atta, n.d.). As a result ARPAs mission in 1958 was to &quot;prevent technological surprise like the launch of Sputnik, which signaled that the Soviets had beaten the U.S. into space.&quot; (Wikipedia, n.d.). Today that mission has changed to &quot;maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military and prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high-payoff research bridging the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use.&quot; (DARPA Mission, n.d.). Though supported by the military Dr. Van Atta clarifies that DARPA was focused on high risk and high reward projects that have tangible results over theoretical progress (Van Atta, n.d.). The combination of curious minds in the form of Licklider, Kleinrock, Cerf and Kahn among others and the need for development of useful advancements in technology for military and defense purposes lead to the development of the Internet.

Since the 1970s the essence of the Internet has been against control and governance. Its very creators were working under the assumption that they were creating something that would exist outside of conventional control. Robert Kahn an Internet pioneer states that while he was working to develop his protocols for internet communication he was focusing on creating a system where individual networks could stand on their own, a system that was fault tolerant to the point that if a transmission or part of a transmission failed it would simply be resent from the source. He was trying to create a system that would have no global control (Leiner et al., 2009). ARPANET was officially terminated in 1989 but by that time the Internet as we understand it today was just getting started (Waldrop, n.d.). By the time the ARPANET died companies were incorporating TCP/IP into their products (Leiner et al., 1997). As time passed computers, networks and the Internet have become more entangled in our everyday lives. Online shopping, gaming and communicating have become common place.

=== Internet Governance ===
Internet Governance consists of the collective rules, procedures, processes, and related programs that shape social actors’, shared expectations, practices, and interactions and result in practices and operations that are consistent with the sovereign rights of states and the social and market interests of end-users and operators. It includes agreements about standards, policies, rules, and enforcement and dispute resolution procedures. Internet governance and many of its issues and questions upon sovereignty, security, stability, privacy, international coordination, intellectual property rights (IPR), who does what, have, over the past few years been hot topics. In my opinion, the debates reflected the reality that Internet governance is not limited to technical issues or to policy issues only. It has increasingly included important social, economic, and national security issues. In addition, people are troubled by the facts that there are no consensus on areas of responsibility, standards and accountability. We have to figure out who should be doing what? Is it the role of the government to govern the internet; should the government even have a role or should it be left up to the private sector that seems to enjoy the invisible hand approach that just seems to govern responses to issues, problems and trends as they happen?

=== Governing Bodies ===
Historically standards and governance act as a tool to aid in the development and advancement of systems and technology. A well defined set of standards and a clear governance structure will help pave the way for new systems and technologies to be presented to the masses and be adopted which in turn will allow for more advancement and still more required governance. This system growth and governance is not limited to tangible goods and service. Telecommunications, networked computing and the Internet are not exceptions to this trend. Since the inception of networked computing governance and standardization have played a heavy role in the direction and development of what we now understand as the Internet. Since the early 1970’s efforts have been made to provide governance to networked computing. In 1972 RFC 433 was published by Jon Postel pertaining to a unified process for the transmission of Registry Information (Socket Number Lists, 1972). Efforts of individuals like Jon helped spur the creation of numerous national, international, non-profit, for-profit, independent and government funded governing organizations specific to telecommunications and the Internet.

==== International Telecommunications Union ====

Telecommunications governance actually began in the late 1800’s. Prior to 1932 ITU stood for International Telegraph Union and was established IN May 28 1865 to facilitate amendments created during the International Telegraph Convention, which was signed in Paris on May 17, 1865 (ITU's History, 2009). In 1947 the ITU became a specialized agency of the United Nations. According to their website the mission of the ITU is to &quot;enable the growth and sustained development of telecommunications and information networks, and to facilitate universal access so that people everywhere can participate in, and benefit from, the emerging information society and global economy.&quot; (The ITU mission:, 2009) The ability to communicate freely is a pre-requisite for a more equitable, prosperous and peaceful world. And ITU assists in mobilizing the technical, financial and human resources needed to make this vision a reality. Over the last 145 years, the ITU has participated in improving the level of connectivity on a global scale. They have participated at the physical level by improving the global telecommunications infrastructure; they have made efforts from a governance and policy perspective by establishing global standards for communications systems; they continue to look ahead and address new issues to telecommunications and networking by helping to strengthen cyber security (About ITU, 2009). To better focus efforts to the varying areas of standards and policy in 1992 the ITU broke into three categories leaving the ITU-T as the contact point for standards-making efforts. In 1999 the ITU became a founding member of the Protocol Supporting Organization of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN PSO) (ITU Landmark Dates, 2009). Eight years later the ITU-T helped to establish governance and standards for IPTV that encompass television / video / audio / text / graphics / data delivered over IP based networks (IPTV-GSI, 2009). This effort to remain a leader in the development of standards and governance is what pushed the ITU to continue the development of telecommunications policy on a regional and global scale.

==== International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) ====
Another global leader in the area of standards development is the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The IEC was founded in 1906 with British scientist Lord Kelvin as its first president (IEC History, n.d.). This was a response to “steps should be taken to secure the co-operation of the technical societies of the world, by the appointment of a representative Commission to consider the question of the standardization of the nomenclature and ratings of electrical apparatus and machinery” commented at the International Electrical Congress in 1904 (IEC History, n.d.). The International Electrotechnical Commissions mission is to be “the leading global organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies” (Mission and Objectives, n.d.). The IEC feels that their national and international standards contributions have aided in fostering a climate of international cooperation in the area of electrotechnical standardization (Mission and Objectives, n.d.). Since its creation the IEC has worked to compile and standardize terminology and measurements for telecommunications. By 1914 they created an international standard for resistance of Copper on a wire. By 1930 they had developed uniform measurement for Hertz and Gauss (IEC History, n.d.). Directly related to modern technologies the IEC helped to standardize terms like ‘Network’, ‘Local Area network’ and ‘wireless LAN’ (IEC Electropedia, n.d.). Currently the IEC has made a commitment to focus is on the development of standards and uniform terminology for current and emerging technologies. This focus is not likely to change in the future as the IEC is trying to foster the idea of global participation through various affiliation programs and incentives (Raeburn, n.d.).

==== International Standards Organization (ISO) ====
A third legacy organization that has roots long before the development of modern computing is the International Standards Organization was established in 1946, when delegates from 25 countries met in London and decided to create a new international organization, of which the object would be &quot;to facilitate the international coordination and unification of industrial standards&quot;(ISO Story, n.p.). In the realm of Information Technology the ISO has developed standards that apply to the governance of management processes (and decisions) relating to the information and communication services used by an organization. “These processes could be controlled by IT specialists within the organization or external service providers, or by business units within the organization.” (ISO/IEC 38500:2008). The ISOs long term plans outlined in their strategic plan for the next five years are to increase the relevancy of their existing Policy documentation by improving the language support and promote the use of their standards and policy globally. They intend to boost stakeholder involvement by utilizing the feedback of stakeholders in both the public and private sectors. The ISO is also working towards improving the efficiency of development with closer interaction with the IEC and ITU (ISO Strategic Plan, n.d.).

====Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)====
Moving away from large international organizations that have broad scopes that are designed to encompass AS many industries as possible there is another level of organization that is more focused on the areas of information technology and the internet.  One such organization is the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  According to their official website, the history of the IEEE dates back to 1884, during a time when the popularity of electricity was beginning to broaden its reach. The American Institute for Electrical Engineers (AIEE) was formed to encourage and promote innovation in this field. Twenty-eight years later, the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) was separately formed to deal with wireless and radio transmissions as well as general electronics. Over time, the interests of the two groups started to overlap, and in 1963 they both joined to create the IEEE. (IEEE, 2009) The IEEE has played a large and important role in the ongoing realm of internet governance. The group is responsible for such standards as the 802.3 Ethernet and the 802.11 wireless networking standards. Both of these standards are heavily used access standards for the Internet and can be considered among the IEEE’s most important standards today. The IEE continues to push development and innovation standards in the power and energy, information technology, and telecommunications fields with over 1300 standards in development. (IEEE) One of IEEE’s most recent developments is the ratification of the 802.11n wireless networking standard which brings increased range and data rates for wireless data transmission. (IEEE, 2009)

====Internet Architecture Board (IAB)====
One of the first governance organizations that were born after the creation of modern computing is the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).  The IAB’s website explains that the Internet Architecture Board originated as the Internet Advisory Board and was formed in 1984 to replace the Internet Configuration Control Board (ICCB). The ICCB was created in 1979 by Vint Cerf, the programming manager at DARPA at the time, and its purpose was to offer technical advice on issues dealing with the Internet. In 1986 the IAB went under an official name change to become what is known today as the Internet Architecture Board. Current IAB documents deal with general principles relating to the Internet and network management. Some of examples of recent IAB dealings include the future of Internet addressing, partial checksums for UDP traffic, network management, and service identifiers and filtering (IAB, 2009). The IAG is also the confirming body for the IESG and IEFT. The IAB will continue to be more of an oversight and guidance organization rather than a technical standards one. In IAB’s Nov. 4 Meeting Minutes, the AIB discussed potential candidates to “act as the IETF liaison to the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP). (IAB, 2009)
Two years after the creation of the IAM the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was established.  According to the IETF website, the IETF was formed in January of 1986 to help promote and develop technical Internet standards. The organization works closely with the W3C and ISO/IEC and its focus is in “Making the Internet work better by producing high quality, relevant technical documents that influence the way people design, use, and manage the Internet.” (IETF, 2009)
There are no formal membership requirements for the IETF, and membership is open to all willing participants. Current examples of IETF research include areas in internationalized domain names, application-layer traffic optimization, and email filtering. In the future the IETF aims to continue producing relevant and technical standards and proposals to help govern the Internet. (IETF, 2009)

====The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)====
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is one of the Internet's oldest governing institutions, with its activities dating back to the 1970s. The IANA is responsible for coordinating many of the key elements that keep the Internet running. Even though the Internet is a worldwide network, renowned for being free from central coordination, there is a technical need for some key parts of the Internet to be globally coordinated and this coordination role is undertaken by IANA. Specifically, IANA allocates and maintains the unique codes and numbering systems that are used to drive the Internet. IANA aims to implement agreed policies and principles in a more universal manner. (IANA, 2009)
The IANA operates and maintains the root zone, and the .int and .arpa domains. The root deals with the upper-most part of the DNS hierarchy, and involves delegating administrative responsibility of “top-level domains”, which are the last segment of a domain name, such as .com, .uk and .nz. Part of this task includes evaluating requests to change the operators of country code domains, as well as day-to-day maintenance of the details of the existing operators. (IANA, 2009)
IANA also operates the .int top-level domain, designed for the sole use of cross-national organizations, such as treaty organizations, that do not naturally fit into a specific country’s top-level domain. In brief, the .int domain is used for registering organizations established by international treaties between or among national governments. The .arpa domain is used internally by Internet protocols, such as for reverse mapping of IP addresses, and delivery of ENUM phone number mapping. IANA administers this domain in close liaison with the Internet Architecture Board, which has policy responsibility for .arpa. The .arpa domain is the “Address and Routing Parameter Area” domain and is designated to be used exclusively for Internet-infrastructure purposes. It is administered by the IANA in cooperation with the Internet technical community under the guidance of the Internet Architecture Board. To help foster the deployment of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), IANA provides a repository of “IDN tables” which document the permissible characters for different languages and scripts provided for registration by different top-level domain registries. The repository is informative, and designed for information sharing. IANA provides a repository of “trust anchors” from top-level domain operators who sign their zones. This allows software to cryptographically verify that DNS data has not been modified in transit over the Internet. IANA provides an Interim Trust Anchor Repository to share the key material required to perform DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC) verification of signed top-level domains, in lieu of a signed DNS root zone. This is a temporary service until the DNS root zone is signed, at which time the keying material will be placed in the root zone itself, and this service will be discontinued. (IANA, 2009)
IANA is implementing internal systems and processes in order to allow users to sign the .ARPA zone with DNS Security Extensions. It is expected that this will be an important project to help prepare for implementation of DNSSEC in the DNS Root once policy has been developed on that area. IANA is also performing initial investigations and consultations on Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) work, which involves signing IP address assignments using security certificates. One of IANA's key projects is to move processing of IANA root zone management requests from a predominantly manual system into a new online system that will shepherd a request through its various processing stages. Key benefits of this will be greater transparency on the status of requests to their requestors, plus optimization of some tasks that are currently labor intensive. (IANA, 2009)

====The Internet Society (ISOC) ====
The Internet Society (ISOC) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1992 to provide leadership in Internet related standards, education, and policy. With more than 80 organizations and more than 28,000 individual members in over 80 chapters around the world, the ISOC is dedicated to ensuring the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of people throughout the world. (ISOC, 2009)
Internet governance is a broad term used in many different contexts, applying to activities as diverse as coordination of technical standards, operation of critical infrastructure, development, regulation, and legislation, among others. Internet governance is not restricted to the activities of governments. Many different types of stakeholders have a role in defining and carrying out Internet governance activities and ISOC has always been an active leader in such discussions. 'The Internet Society provides leadership in addressing issues that confront the future of the Internet, and is the organizational home for the groups responsible for Internet infrastructure standards. The Internet Society acts not only as a global clearinghouse for Internet information and education but also as a facilitator and coordinator of Internet-related initiatives around the world. For over 15 years ISOC has run international network training programs for developing countries and these have played a vital role in setting up the Internet connections and networks in virtually every country connecting to the Internet during this time.” (ISOC, 2009)
Through its sponsored events, developing-country training workshops, tutorials, public policy, and regional and local chapters, the Internet Society serves the needs of the growing global Internet community. From commerce to education to social issues, the ISOC’s goal is to enhance the availability and utility of the Internet on the widest possible scale. The Society's individual and organization members are bound by a common stake in maintaining the viability and global scaling of the Internet. They comprise the companies, government agencies, and foundations that have created the Internet and its technologies as well as innovative new entrepreneurial organizations contributing to maintain that dynamic. The Internet is built on technical standards, which allow devices, services, and applications to be interoperable across a wide and dispersed network of networks. Internet standards are developed by group of organizations which operate under the sponsorship of the ISOC. (ISOC, 2009)
The ISOC has an initiative called the Enabling Access Initiative, focused on enabling access to the Internet by addressing the fundamental impediments to Internet growth and usability. The challenges of improving Internet growth are multifaceted and interrelated, particularly in developing countries. They include, for example, access to technical skills and knowledge, the regulatory and policy environment for information and telecommunications services, and broader economic and market factors, language diversity, and the diffusion and reliability of basic infrastructures and services. The &quot;Global Addressing&quot; program specifically identifies challenges to global addressing. The goal is to deliver a smooth transition beyond the end of the IANA IPv4 address pool, while working out the longer-term architecture of the Internet. The ISOC also has a “Secure &amp; Stable Infrastructure” program aimed at supporting the development and deployment of key technologies for ensuring a stable and secure. The Internet Society's Trust and Identity initiative recognizes that in order to be trusted, the Internet must provide channels for secure, reliable, private, communication between entities, which can be clearly authenticated in a mutually understood manner. The mechanisms that provide this level of assurance must support both the end-to-end nature of Internet architecture and reasonable means for entities to manage and protect their own identity details. (ISOC, 2009)
A trusted Internet takes into account security, transaction protection, and identity assertion and management. Given the network dependence on unique numbers and the escalating amount of geo-location data being gathered, the privacy implications of the current Internet represent a significant and growing concern. Trust must be a primary design element at every layer of the architecture, and in some cases, existing elements may need to be redesigned or improved to meet emerging requirements. (ISOC, 2009)

==== RIPE NCC ====
RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) started in November of 1989.  RIPE is a collaborative forum that is open to anyone who is interested in wide area IP networks.  This is a mostly volunteer group.  A majority of the work done by this group is done on individuals on their own or their organization’s time.  Some activities do require constant availability and coordination between people working on projects.  This is why a RIPE NCC’ (Network Coordination Centre) was formed.
RIPE NCC began in April 1992 with there central office in Amsterdam.  The main administrative task of RIPE NNC is acting as a Regional Internet Registry.  A Regional Internet Registry allocates and assigns IP address space and other internet numbers.  RIPE NCC also had a helping hand creating MBONE and WWW services.  RIPE NNC also played a major part in helping to develop Internet Routing Registry (IRP).
In 1994 the Registration Services expanded more than anyone expected.  Funding became really tight and there was a shortage of service resources. In 1995 it was agreed that all registries need to contribute to funding RIPE NCC in order to receive service.
Today RIPE NCC is a not-for-profit organization.  Its membership mainly consists of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), telecommunication organizations and large corporations.  RIPE NCC mission now is to perform activities that benefit the RIPE NCC as a group.  Service and Activities are all discussed in detail in the open.  RIPE NCC does not compete with its’ members activities.

==== World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ====
In October of 1994, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT.   W3C works mostly on the standardization of Web Technologies.  To help come up with the highest quality of standards, W3C uses a community consensus.  All the stakeholders involved do have an opportunity to have a voice in the development of W3C standards. After the technical report development process is complete W3C publishes Recommendations, which are considered web standards. It is up to manufacturers to follow the recommendations of W3C.  If a product would like to be labeled W3C-compliant, it must meet the defined level of conformance set by the W3C.
Before W3C was created there were different versions of HTML put out on the market by various vendors.  Many of these different versions were not compatible with each other.  The consortium allowed the vendors to get together and agree on core principles which everyone would use.  Some web standards that W3c is responsible for are: CSS, XHTML, HTML, XML, P3P, and OWL.  W3C also is working on device independence.  Device independence would allow the web to be accessible by any device under any circumstance.  

==== Internet Corporation for Name &amp; Numbers (ICANN) ====
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was established in 1998.  ICANN is a not-for-profit organization that spans world-wide.  Its’ mission is to help keep the internet secure, stable and interoperable.  ICANN has no control over the content and doesn’t deal with access to the internet. 
ICANN helps co-coordinate the supply and assignment of IP addresses to help stop duplicate IP address problems.  ICANN also distributes ranges of IP addresses to regional registries who in turn distribute them to network providers.  ICANN’s role in internet governance is to provide “universal resolvability.”  Universal resolvability allows you to receive the same results when you are accessing the internet no matter your location in the world. 
ICANN was responsible for creating the registrar market (together with an accreditation system).  This helped create greater competition on the internet and the price of domains has fallen 80 percent.  The rapidly changing domain name market has caused ICANN to reform its accreditation process.  ICANN has also help implement a low-cost way to resolve ownership disputes of domain names.  The Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) helps disputes turn into costly court battles.
Approval of “generic top level domains” is also introduced by the ICANN.  This helps provide enough space online as more and more people take advantage of the internet.  ICANN has introduced 13 new top level domains.  ICANN is working on an improved process that will help introduce new TLDs.

=== Debate Over Governance Control ===
With the abundance of content on the Internet traveling around the world and back again in fractions of a second and countless organizations working to provide guidance in the form of uniform terminology, set standards and practices it can become difficult to manager and control the Internet at a whole.  Currently, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has been branded as the Internets ruling Body (Ward, 2002).  ICANN which is chiefly responsible for oversight of Top level Domain names and deciding who gets web addresses with the common suffixes we have become accustomed to as well as the IP addressing schemes that allow networked computers to communicate (Porteus, 2005).  In the US, some feel that the current governance in place is sufficient.  They feel that the current system though not perfect still provides an invaluable service.  In America, there is a sense that the current governance standards that are in place for Top Level Domains, web address suffixes for industry, government, military and even countries (i.e. com, net, gov, mil, uk, us, etc.) is perfectly acceptable.  American politician Representative Fred Upton from Minnesota feels that ICANN may be flawed but the benefits of an established process for creating domain names is critical to sustaining the global economy (Porteus, 2005).  Others feel that allowing a single nation that operates under a free and democratic market is the best option and the addition of multiple nations and ideologies would ultimately make the organization as a whole less effective.  Associate professor of public policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology agrees: “Things are more efficient if one government controls it but that's make everybody uncomfortable. You get everybody involved, you get stuck with a bunch of different committees and it becomes less effective.” (Porteus, 2005).  Not only are the functions of ICANN necessary to maintain the logical control of assignment of Domains and creation of organizational suffixes there are substantial physical concerns that must be taken into consideration.  The North America has the lowest response time and among the lowest incidence of lost packets of all major regions on the planet according to internet traffic reporting on a global scale (Internet Traffic Report, 2009).  North America on average has a response of less than 120 milliseconds and 5% packet loss (Internet Traffic Report, 2009).  The Europe has a response of almost 160 milliseconds while dealing with less overall traffic.  If control and management of the Internet were shifted there would be a global reduction in the quality of service and capability of the Internet until infrastructure demands were met by the new controlling nation or organization.
Outside of logical and physical considerations for maintaining control of Internet Governance within the United States is the abundance of court cases that are creating prescience at the state and federal levels that is establishing the guidelines for the future of internet governance from a legal perspective. 
 Here is an example at the state level:

==== Cohen vs. Google 2009 ====
In this case the Plaintiff Cohen is attempting to sue the Defendant Google for defamation of character this defamation occurred on a site hosted by blogger.com.  The blog site was posted anonymously and had contact information listed with Goggle.  As part of the pre-action discovery Cohen’s attorney requested electronic archive information to ascertain the identity of the anonymous blogger.  Google denied the request stating that the information requested was too vague and Google “has refused to provide Petitioner with any information or documents with respect to the Blog unless it is required to do so pursuant to applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request” (Madden, J., 2009).  In response the Plaintiff attempted to hold Google partly liable for the defamation in an attempt to get the necessary information.  Google stated that they are cannot be held liable for any damages as a result of their anonymous users because when entering into any agreement of service with Google, one must agree to specific indemnity terms that release Google from liability of wrongdoing.
The acceptance of the indemnity statements as a binding agreement is significant in this case because the acknowledgement used to indemnify Google from any nefarious actions committed by the anonymous blogger which was upheld by the courts was a check box clicked by the user when setting up their account.  This “signature” was acquired via a means that is virtually indistinguishable from any other users' similar action. In an interview with an employee of the Syracuse City Legal department she stated that in reference to legally binding documents that require a signature or similar form of acknowledgment, “a non-electronic binding signature must be uniquely identifiable” (Rauch, 2009).
The outcome of the pre-action discovery in Cohen v. Google illustrates the fact that at some levels the basis of internet governance has been set by de facto standards that have become so ingrained in society that they will stand in state Supreme Court.  This illustrates the need for a formal and sound governance structure to help shape future policy.  Similar findings have been made at the national level as well.

==== Gonzalez vs. Google 2006 ====
In 2005 the Bush administration demanding that Google and other search engines turn over aggregate search information to help revive a child protection law. Google refused to comply with the subpoena and a motion was filed in January of 2006 by US Department Of Justice to force Google to hand over the data. The government claimed that the information would help &quot;estimate how often Web users encounter harmful-to-minors material in the course of their searches, and to measure the effectiveness of filtering software in screening that material.&quot; Google’s lawyers have objected to the subpoena on the grounds that it lacks &quot;relevancy,&quot; it's redundant since Yahoo! and Microsoft already caved and that the company's trade secrets would be in danger.
On March 17th of 2006 Federal Judge, James Ware ruled that Google did not have to release any information to the government as its subpoena shows limited use for the information being gathered. “In particular, this Order doesn’t address the Plaintiffs’ concern articulated at the hearing about the appropriateness of the government’s use of the Court’s subpoenas power to gather and collect information about what individuals search for over the internet.” (US District Court Ruling, 2006)
When we're at home, the illusion of privacy and anonymity allows us to feel comfortable searching for anything. Let's not pretend that we haven't used the Internet to explore ideas we'd just as soon not share with friends, colleagues, family, or government prosecutors. Put another way, if you knew someone was looking over your shoulder when you used a search engine, would it change what you searched for? If the ISP’s and search engine developers were required to maintain a list of a user’s search records and could these records ever get out and embarrass you? Or worse, land you in jail? How is information private when anything?
Even though the Justice Department insists Google can strip away any information that could be linked to individual users, the Google still refuses to cooperate. Companies will always be subject to subpoenas served but the government, but the judge sent a clear message about privacy that is simply reassuring for internet users. What the ruling means is that neither the government nor anyone else has carte blanche when demanding data from Internet companies. When a party resists an absurd subpoena, the legal process of the United States’ justice system can be an effective check on such demands and a protector of its citizens.

==== FCC Guidelines ====
In October 2009 the FCC issued a press release proposing a set of rules governing net neutrality. Though the rules are not yet solidified and are still at a proposal stage, they aim to limit an ISP’s network management techniques on their networks in the name of net neutrality. The proposal includes a set of six rules, three of which govern the restriction of ISPs from tampering with a user’s content, applications or devices being used on the Internet.  The other three rules deal with fair competition, lawful content being passed through the Internet, and transparency as it relates to ISPs’ network practices. Each rule, however, contains a clause that is “Subject to reasonable network management”, which effectively leaves a gray area and still allows ISPs to perform reasonable network management practices such as traffic throttling during peak times (FCC, 2009).
The move by the FCC is a huge step towards net neutrality and Internet governance as a whole. In fact, this is probably the biggest step taken by the United States government in terms of regulation of the Internet. The FCC’s proposal has certainly set a precedent in United States Internet policy. This is significant because it paves the way for the possibility of further regulation in the future, such as with Congress and federal network neutrality laws.
Traditionally, the Internet in the United States was largely left at the mercy of the ISPs. The market has generally done well at keeping ISPs and other participants of the Internet honest and fair. The latest and most profound example of this is Comcast’s decision to throttle BitTorrent traffic in its network. After massive public outcry and public protest (as well as a nudge from the FCC in the form of an official investigation), Comcast decided to reverse its stance on BitTorrent traffic and become “protocol agnostic”. (FCC, 2009) Though the FCC did play a slight contribution in Comcast’s decision, the governing agency traditionally has not been strict on network management practices used by ISPs. The FCC’s new guidelines aim to demonstrate a stricter stance towards ISPs and their network management practices in the name of net neutrality.
In the face of all the support for maintaining the status quo of US/ICANN control of internet governance there are others that feel that a multinational organization is a better solution for Internet Governance.  Former Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan is focused on the inclusion of developing nations in the process and procedures for navigating the current Internet Governance Structure and feels that the United Nations or similar body could help bridge that gap (Porteus, 2005).

==== International Governance debate ====
International governance of the internet has a lot of questions that still need to be looked into before it can be determined whether or not governance on an international level is achievable or needed (Einar Himma, 2008).  There is debate over whether the internet should be subject to any restrictions.  If there should be restrictions, who and what determines what restrictions are justified?  How are international restrictions enforced?
It is pointless for one country to try and regulate the internet (Zizic, 2000). A country trying to regulate this internet can do more harm than good to itself.  E-Commerce sites could potentially move out of the country due to regulations imposed by the country the E-Commerce site resides in (Bick, 2006).  Different countries have drastically different positions on content regulations.  China and Saudia Arabia have very tight controls on what can and cannot be viewed on the internet. Content is filtered by country level proxy servers.  The country level proxy servers have large databases of blocked sites.  The government controls what websites are added to these databases (Einar Himma, 2008). The problem with this content system is sites that should not be block are.  An example would be a site with the word “breast” being used in a medical term.  The filtering system would block this site from being viewed. In contrast the United States and Europe have a very open policy (Reporters without Borders, 2006).
Legislation with a country has been a relatively effective way to govern the internet.  The United States banning internet gambling is an example of this.  While any gambling sites within the United States would have to comply with the legislation, sites who were outside of the United States boarders would not.  How the United States government worked a way to close this loop hole was to enact the Unlawful Internet Gambling Act of 2006.  This act made it illegal for US based banks and credit card companies to process payments to gambling sites.
“No person engaged in the business of betting or wagering may knowingly accept, in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful Internet gambling (1) credit, or the proceeds of credit, extended to or on behalf of such other person (including credit extended through the use of a credit card); (2) an electronic fund transfer, or funds transmitted by or through a money transmitting business, or the proceeds of an electronic fund transfer or money transmitting service, from or on behalf of such other person” (The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006).
Another case that proves the effectiveness of nations using their own legislation to govern the internet in their country is the LIRCA v. Yahoo! Inc.

==== LICRA v. Yahoo! Inc ====
Ligue contre le racisme et l'antisémitisme et Union des étudiants juifs de France c. Yahoo! Inc. et Societe Yahoo! France (LICRA v. Yahoo!) is a court case that was brought in front of France’s High Court in 2000.  The complaint involved the sale of Nazi memorabilia on Yahoo!’s auction sites.   Nazi memorabilia falls under Article R645-1 of the French Criminal Code. This code prohibits the public display of any insignia, emblem, or uniform which was worn by organizations that have been convicted of crimes against humanity.  Yahoo!’s defense was that their company is based in the United States and primary target audience are US residents. 
The French court found Yahoo! was providing illegal services under French law.  Yahoo! Inc was given orders to take all appropriate measures to block access to Nazi memorabilia to French residents.  Yahoo! Inc argued that is was almost impossible to comply with the courts order.
Instead of appealing the French Courts decision, Yahoo! Inc decided to bring the case to the United States Court system.  The United States District Court of the Northern District of California in San Jose agreed with Yahoo! Inc. The Court found that the decision returned by the tribunal de grande instance of Paris infringed upon Yahoo! Inc’s First Amendment right given by the United States Constitution.
LICRA appealed the decision by the District Court.  The appeal fell on the bench of the United States Court of Appeals for 9th Circuit.  The Appeals Court over turned the ruling of the District Court.  The Court ruled that &quot;France is within its rights as a sovereign nation to enact hate speech laws against the distribution of Nazi propaganda in response to its terrible experience with Nazi forces during World War II. Similarly, LICRA and UEJF are within their rights to bring suit in France against Yahoo! for violation of French speech law. The only adverse consequence experienced by Yahoo! as a result of the acts with which we are concerned is that Yahoo! must wait for LICRA and UEJF to come to the United States to enforce the French judgment before it is able to raise its First Amendment claim. However, it was not wrongful for the French organizations to place Yahoo! in this position.

=== &quot;Debate over Governance Control&quot; ===
The debate over Internet governance control is one that is becoming increasingly important as the popularity of the Internet continues to rise. There is a tendency to think of governance control as a debate between all of the different countries that are connected to the Internet. After all, legal systems that are formed in various countries have jurisdiction only to the extent of that particular country’s geographical borders. It would be logical to assume that the Internet would fall under the same constraints. In some ways, this notion is not incorrect. Laws and general Internet governance within a particular country can only extend to that country’s population. The United States’ Can-Spam Act, for example, cannot enforce its email and spam rules in other countries. This creates an inherent problem within the realm of Internet governance because of conflicting laws between different countries.
The Internet itself developed from the American ARAPNET, and agencies such as ICANN are headquartered in the United States. Thus the United States plays a very large part in the governance of the Internet despite it being just a single country among a multitude of others participating in the Internet. For this reason, there is increasing pressure by the International community for more of a multinational approach to Internet governance. The following discussion will examine three main approaches as possible solutions to the ongoing governance of the Internet.

==== Utopian Suggestion ====
The implementation of a global consortium similar to the United Nations will allow any and all decisions pertaining to the governance of the Internet to be made by the best minds available all working towards the common goal of providing the best possible services.
Using a global organization will help to eliminate the ill-conceived perception that the internet can be governed by anyone company, or government and that the rules of the internet are subject to change by its source or destination.

==== Dystopian but Practical Suggestion ====
Dividing the governance of the internet to be unique to the region of its source or destination would allow for maximum control of content and accountability of resources and usage.
The dystopian view of Internet governance would shift the majority of control away from the United States and towards all of the individual countries involved with the Internet. Separation of ownership of the internet will make its governance not dissimilar from current laws that change from country to country.  This will put the responsibility of maintaining compliance with the web surfer and content providers.  This will be akin to international travel and being subject to the laws of the country or in this case the network that they happen to have traveled to.
The advantage to this governance structure is that each country will be able to establish its own unique regulations to govern their portion of the Internet. As mentioned, this would not be unlike the current system set in place and thus there should not be any large interruption with the way each country handles Internet regulation. A multinational approach would also create a system whereby each country involved with the Internet has an equal amount of control, which might help to ease tensions between various countries struggling to increase their prominence over the Internet. Furthermore, it is possible that decentralized control of the Internet may result in increased redundancy of the Internet’s various services, as well as preventing a single country--the United States--from maintaining too much control over the Internet from other countries’ perspectives.
Separation of power does not come without its disadvantages. Because a central point of control over the Internet (the United States) would no longer exist, the reliability of worldwide Internet access may suffer, and there may be a significant interruption of service during the period of reallocation. This system would also require more cooperation between a much larger number of participating countries, which may prove to be very difficult to maintain, especially considering the participation of historically problematic countries such as North Korea and China. With decentralization and increased control between individual countries, political disputes could escalate into denial of service attacks or worse: fragmentation of the Internet itself. To a certain degree, centralized control can prevent this from happening, but decentralization would most likely be problematic in this regard.

==== Real Suggestion ====
Maintenance of the status quo will ensure the consistency of the Internet.  This will ensure that services are not interrupted and that the flow of information and money is not interrupted. Within this perspective, governance and regulation reflect the representation of the material stakes of different interest groups such as industry and commerce, profession, scientists, religious groups and so forth who are active within a social setting. In its simplest form, the model attributes core interests to specific groups over specific issues (Macmillan 2003).
 
Keeping ICANN and North America as a hub for Internet communications will help to ensure that the quality of service is not interrupted.
Recommendation:
In the wake of the various development that have been happing globally pertaining to Internet governance and the overall control and future of the Internet a global consortium is our recommendation for a robust solution for maintaining control of the Internet.  Globalization is dissolving borders in finance and politics, language barriers are slowly crumbling and the implementation of this worldwide organization will further compliment the steps to a unified world both on and off line.

=== Summary ===
 I.            What is Internet Governance
a.      Governance: Relates to decisions that define expectations, grant power, or verify performance. It consists either of a separate process or of a specific part of management or leadership processes. Sometimes people set up a government to administer these processes and systems.
                                                              i.      Good Governance
1.      Participation
2.      Transparency
3.      Responsiveness
4.      Consensus Orientation or Understanding
5.      Accountability
b.      The Internet: A global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private and public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope that are linked by a broad array of electronic and optical networking technologies.
c.       Internet Governance: The definition of Internet governance has been contested by differing groups across political and ideological lines. One of the main debates concerns the authority and participation of certain actors, such as national governments and corporate entities, to play a role in the Internet's governance.
     II.            Governing Bodies of the Internet
a.       International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
b.      International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
c.       International Standards Organization (ISO)
d.      Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
e.       Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
f.       The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
g.       The Internet Society (ISOC)
h.      World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
i.        Internet Corporation for Name &amp; Numbers (ICANN)
j.        National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)    
   III.            Debate over Governance Control
a.       Multinational Control: A Global consortium working together to manage, develop and organize the internet for the greater good of the many. 
b.      Regional Control: Each regional stakeholder will organize their own methods and mechanism for governance. 

=== Discussion and Recommendations ===
In the wake of the various development that have been happing globally pertaining to Internet governance and the overall control and future of the Internet a global consortium is our recommendation for a robust solution for maintaining control of the Internet.  Globalization is dissolving borders in finance and politics, language barriers are slowly crumbling and the implementation of this worldwide organization will further compliment the steps to a unified world both on and off line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTERS: Active Chapters and Candidate Chapters'''

Authors should write about the sociotechnical aspects of the subjects, not about all aspects of them. For example, for the chapter on high-fructose corn syrup, a detailed explanation of the manufacturing process would not be appropriate. Similarly, in the chapter on gambling, authors should frequently relate gambling to relevant technologies.

&quot;Tips&quot; are not part of chapter titles. They are suggestions to authors of subjects that might help them in their research.

=== Introduction ===

==== Brief History  ====
Net neutrality is not a new concept relative to the age of the Internet; its roots are embedded within the founders.  Net Neutrality refers to a guiding principle that preserves the free and open Internet with no discrimination.  It makes it such that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) cannot discriminate the speed of the connection - or lack there of - to one content provider versus another (Eudes 2008). When the Internet was first invented, founders wanted to be sure that it was to provide a safe haven for the transportation of information without any biases.  They wanted to ensure that all people had a consistent way to access to the Internet would be able use the Internet; regardless of their connection and social status (Margulius, 2003).
Net Neutrality has two polarizing factions; those who are in favor, and those who are not.  On this topic there is not a middle ground.  Those who are in favor of Net Neutrality consist of organizations like Microsoft, Google, and other content providers.  Those who are against Net Neutrality are generally made of telecommunication network organizations and/or ISPs (Owen 2007). 
The roots of Network Neutrality have been pointed towards the 1887 Act to Regulate Commerce.  Within this law exists the following verbiage:
&quot;It shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation…”
Initially this law was to regulate the railroad system.  At that time, certain rail lines were being accused of charging different fees based on the content of the object transported.  They also were being accused of taking a longer time to route the content to delivery based on who was asking for the item to be shipped.  This made the rail business extremely inconsistent and unfair.  As the legal system looks towards precedent when reviewing a legal case, proponents of network neutrality look towards this law as the foundation for network neutrality; whereas people against network neutrality see this as a completely different case in a completely different line of business.  However, some ISPs wish that they can apply the precedent which was set by Benjamin Franklin in which he would not carry or deliver newspapers which came from competing publishers (Johnson, 2006).

==== Reasons for being in favor of network neutrality ====
The reasons that people are in favor of net neutrality is because they want to make it such that they are preventing a monopoly from happening within the last mile of connection.  The last mile is the final leg of delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer (http://goingwimax.com).  At this point within the transportation of a packet, it has to reach through many service providers’ equipment.  What people are worried about is that a provider, who owns the physical cable lines in a given space, would charge a higher amount for a certain content provider to deliver its services versus another.  This would make the content providers’ cost of doing business to go up.  Going into the idea of preventing the last mile monopoly, content providers want to keep ambiguity down as ambiguity is inherent within risk.  If a content provider relies on a last mile provider to distribute their services, they would have to be paying for the service.  However, the last mile provider could unexpectedly increase their rates which were not accounted for within the content providers’ budget.  This could throw off the content providers’ business which can lead to incorrect projections of profitability. 

==== Reasons for not being in favor of network neutrality ====
As stated above, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not in favor of net neutrality.  A specific reason that they would like to be sure that net neutrality does not exist is so that they can gain the ability to offer tiered services.  They want to offer tiered services because they believe that a user should be able to pay for the quality of service provided to them (in terms of throughput).  Instead of offering a flat level of service (in terms of throughput) for all customers (both content providers and end users, the ISPs would like to offer different tiers of service.  They want to provide a content provider with a guaranteed level of service based on the tier that which they are willing to pay.  For a top tier service, this would allow that content provider for be able to provide their content at a fast rate to its users.  It would also let content providers, who do not want to pay for an extremely high level of throughput, to be able to save money by not paying for a high level.  People for net neutrality argue that this would provide a disadvantage to content providers who cannot afford top-tier services.  However ISPs already say that this form of increased level of service already exists when there is a content provider who has thousands of services strategically placed throughout the world. They have the ability to provide a consistently high level of service to its users due to physical access in relation to the users’ location.  ISPs think that because this already exists that it should not a problem; offering tiered services. 
Another reason that ISPs are against net neutrality is because they believe that by offering the tiered services, they will have the ability to offer a higher level of service to their subscribers through tiered filtration.  By offering different tiers that users can opt in and out off, users will be signing up for the service that they are happy with.  The ISP can better throttle its bandwidth as people will be in different tiers.  If a user subscribes to a low level of throughput then they will be paying for a low level of throughput and they will suffice with receiving a low level of throughput because they paid for it.  Likewise, if a user subscribes for a high level of throughput then they will be paying a higher fee and will be content with the high level of throughput.    Throughout this chapter we will be exploring the different aspects and impacts of net neutrality.  The various aspects that we will be covering will include the economics of net neutrality, the technicalities of net neutrality, past and current regulation of net neutrality, a suggestion on how to end the debate on net neutrality, and finally the conclusion about net neutrality. 
 
=== Economics of Network Neutrality ===

==== Existing Benefits from Net Neutrality and Open Access ====

Before a decision can be reached whether to impose regulation on the Internet or not, or whether to advocate for Net Neutrality, one must understand the current state of the Internet and its benefits to those that have a final saying, these being the end-users. The Internet has come a long way and has emerged as perhaps the best innovation in modern age. The Internet seems to have endless possibilities and it seems as if everything is possible. However, the debate over Net Neutrality could possibly alter further possibilities and pose a risk to innovation on the Internet. 

It is important to understand that the Internet came to be because the telecommunications markets were not allowed to provide “electronic data processing and data communications services (now know as “information services”) on an integrated basis” (Roycroft, 2006). Moreover, due to this fact of separation of the telecommunications markets and the information services markets the creation of the Internet was made possible. The initial start of the Internet was the dial-up access and this produced a “mass-market means of accessing the Internet,” which along with it fostered competition in the market. Because of the competition among providers, the customer was able to choose among a preferred Internet provider to access the Internet. From there on, the Internet grew step by step. Among many factors that contributed to the growth of the Internet was the factor of “flat rate” rates that were first imposed on the Internet, thus attracting more consumers and creating the mass-market and fostering competition (Roycroft, 2006).

With open access to the Internet, the end-user certainly has the final say about how much of the Internet he or she will use. It is important to keep this important fact in mind when deciding whether or not to impose regulation on the Internet. Open access has tremendous benefits because it does no allow one service provider, such as AT&amp;T and Verizon, to dominate the market and decide what is available on the Internet and how much content is available. Through the open access to the Internet companies/organizations are able to increase their consumer market, and it is possible to connect to users worldwide. Open and standard protocols such as web browsing, e-mail, search engines, and e-commerce are great examples of benefits from open access to the Internet because no one company/organization has the ability to “determine which applications, content, or services should be allowed to use the Internet” (Roycroft, 2006)

==== Competition Between Internet Service Providers and Internet Content, Services, and Applications ====
As the common carriage principle implies, one must offer its services if the user is willing and able to pay for those services. According to an example from Professor Lee McKnight, if a ferry carries people across a river and it charges a certain price, then it cannot refuse anyone who is able to pay for the ferry to take them across the river. Similar is the case in the Network Neutrality discussion. An access provider such as AT&amp;T should not be allowed to discriminate against and refuse access to content providers like YouTube and Google. 

However, that is why the Network Neutrality debate has received a great amount of attention and continues to be a hot topic to date. The Internet, for many across the globe, is seen as a gateway to acquire information and be able to educate oneself about current events as well as stay in touch with friends and family across the world. Nonetheless, it is in the Internet access provider’s power-that is, if Network Neutrality is abandoned and regulation is imposed on the Internet-to dictate whether end-users across the globe will be able to freely download and view information on the Internet as it has been done to this day, or whether they will only be able to acquire certain information at certain speeds. Moreover, should Internet regulation be imposed, discriminatory pricing and choice of content providers will surface, thus imposing exclusion. Exclusion occurs when an Internet access provider chooses one content provider over another, YouTube over iFilm for example, thus resulting in the exclusion of iFilm (Hemphill, 2008).

In addition to exclusion, Internet regulation could also prove harmful for innovation and innovators because it could influence potential Internet access providers to use extraction as a way to cash in more money. Due to threats of exclusion, one Internet access provider benefits from applications from competitors and charges both content providers for access to premium Internet connections (Hemphill, 2008). On the other hand, an Internet provider will most likely try to extract rather than to exclude because the benefits from applications are greater and it is more likely that competitors will compete for the number of applications as well as quality, thus fostering competition through extraction. However, the party that benefits most is the Internet access provider. 

==== Risk to Innovation if Net Neutrality Factors Are Abandoned ====
Innovation is a key principle associated with network neutrality and through open and neutral internet access innovation is able to prosper and provide so much more to users around the globe. Innovation with the help of the Internet’s open and unregulated access has been responsible, and continues to be responsible for how we live our lives today. For instance, before the internet was born, many of the tasks were done physically and required a larger number of employees. A retail bookseller, such as Borders would have a physical location which buyers would be able to visit and purchase books. 
	
However, now that the Internet is here, the same buyers are able to purchase the books online and get it faster than ever, especially with the use of a Sony’s Kindle eReader, for example. Also, let us take into consideration Amazon.com, which is the leader when it comes to purchasing products online. Amazon has a great deal of products available, from books to clothing, and buyers are able to sign on the website, without leaving their homes, and purchase any necessities they might require. Such examples are worth mentioning because these innovations would perhaps not be possible on a regulated network. It may have not been possible because in addition to start-up costs for organizations such as Amazon, additional costs from service providers-AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast-could have discouraged the opening of such an online retail giant. 

Abandoning network neutrality factors will certainly alter innovation due to threats of exclusion and extraction. It is perhaps safe to say that the best innovations are produced with open and uncontrollable surroundings, or when the mind is allowed to operate freely without any constraints. Another online giant is worth mentioning here, and that is Google. Google allows its employees to freely work on whatever they please twenty percent of the employees’ time in the day, and in turn the innovations belong to the company. GMail is one example that resulted from such an incentive. However, now that Google is a dominant force in in various aspects, imposing regulation on the Internet would perhaps not slow this Internet giant down. If there is regulation imposed on the content providers, larger organizations like Google will be able to continue to dominate the Internet, and organizations like Yahoo! could be facing the threat of exclusion. 

On the other hand, should there be no regulation imposed on the Internet both companies could continue to innovate and provide users with ways for a more efficient use of the Internet. So, as a result it is evident that when no constraints or regulations are put into place at times, the results can be rewarding to every Internet user in the world. An open and free Internet has been the foundation of innovation and it can certainly continue to benefit users and contribute to innovation. 

==== Economies of Scale, Sunk Costs, and Barriers to Entry ====
It is clear as to why Internet service providers, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast want to see regulation imposed on content providers, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, etc. because these content providers are able to stream content, services, and applications to users and earn a great deal of money, while using the Internet access providers’ lines. Let’s look at how these Internet access providers already earn their revenues. According to a recent analysis by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), it has found a duopoly in the highly concentrated market for broadband access. A closer look at the market reveals that residents of the United States of America get their broadband access from either of the two service companies in the duopoly, one being the telephone company DSL, and the other being the cable company Cable Modem service (Roycroft, 2006).  Due the fact of a duopoly in the broadband market last-mile competition-delivering the final connectivity from an Internet access provider to the customer-is non-existent. Economists believe this is caused by certain entry barriers, which are discussed in more detail below. 

Entry barriers are not necessarily high or low, but there are factors that come into play that certainly play a role in discouraging others from providing last-mile competition. Let’s take some of these factors into consideration. Economies of scale tend to play a vital role that discourages entry into the broadband market. When talking about economies of scale in the broadband market we talk about the proximity of the users, and the best possible solutions to efficiently connect users. Whether the users reside in rural or suburban areas is important because in order to lower the costs of building a network it is better if the users are closer to one another as well as having a larger number of users present in one given area. Such economies of scale will offer certain benefits, it will be cheaper to build one network that will connect more users in one given area, and it will also provide a better incentive to build a network since there are a large number of users in that area.

On the other hand, if there is fewer users and they reside in a rural area, it quickly becomes difficult and expensive to provide connection to these users. To provide connections to users in rural areas it is important to take int consideration certain geographic characteristics, such as the terrain, soil conditions, and weather extremes, and the fact that it will take a significantly large amount of cable that will need to be extended from the network facility to the users, adding to the costs. Geographic characteristics are vital as they represent sunk costs as well. Running cable from the network to the users involves digging into the ground, connecting wires from pole to pole, digging into streets, and so on, which are not recoverable should the business fail. However, if a company is able to succeed in its process to compete in last-mile connectivity, the telephone and cable companies are able to exclude the newcomer by lowering their prices to the users until the new competitor exits the market (Roycroft, 2006). 

It is important to note that not only is it discouraging to enter the broadband market, but also that the current companies have a clear advantage and are reluctant to new competitors. Due to the duopoly in the broadband market, why is it not fair for content providers to fight for open and unregulated Internet access? Do Internet providers have the right to seek regulation? Network neutrality will continue to be a heated debate for years to come and those arguing in the favor of net neutrality will succeed because the Internet has come a long way since its introduction in the mid-90s, and it accounts for a great deal of innovation and success throughout the world.

==== Market Power and the Supply and Demand for Technology and Internet Traffic ====
It is evident that there is an increase in the demand for newer and more efficient technological devices and the complementary Internet use. With the introduction of certain products such as the PDAs and more recently the Blackberry and the iPhone certain tasks have become much simpler, and people are able to be more productive as well. Perhaps it is not always appropriate to use Google as an example, but it is a dominant online giant in many aspects and the name Google certainly cannot be left out when talking about search engines. Although Google is not the first search engine that was introduced to the market, it is definitely the most popular one today. 

Advances in technology have enabled innovations such as the Google search engine, the online auction giant eBay, one of the biggest online retail book sellers Amazon, and so on. In addition to these innovations comes the increase in demand for even newer and more advanced ways in which tasks can be made simpler for everyday Internet users. The introduction of web conferencing, for example, has allowed organizations to lower travel costs and connect its users via the use of the Internet, and similar innovations are needed for organizations to lower costs and increase productivity. The Internet has also made it possible for employees to work from home, which in turn has been responsible for increased employee productivity. There is an increase in the demand for products such as those mentioned above because they are not labeled as luxury products, but rather necessities. Products such as a smartphone certainly is a necessity because it allows users to do various tasks, such as access to e-mail, the Internet, etc. while they are on the go.

Moreover, we are experiencing an increase in the demand for Internet usage. Users from all corners of the world seek equal access to the Internet for educational purposes as well as gaining knowledge of the world’s events. Facebook, a social networking cite that has the ability to connect users from one end of the globe to the other, consistently experiences high volumes of traffic due to the fact that people like to stay connected and be able to communicate to others on different levels. The previous examples are results of competition and innovation with a free Internet and why it is important not to let Internet access providers gain too much market power. 

Should these access providers gain too much market power, users will experience rather slow Internet speeds and connections as well as experience higher rates for accessing the Internet. In addition, with too much market power the ability of doing business with other companies in the market will not exist, and Internet access may be available only to those high-tier users in the market, according to the article “Four nightmares for net neutrality” by Shane Greenstein. Network neutrality is important and it needs to preserved, otherwise changing the Internet as it is now can have various implications, such as excluding a great deal of the population and significantly decreasing the use of the Internet. However, this debate will continue to demand large amount of attention from officials and anyone involved in the process. Satisfying everyone in this market is impossible, and this debate will not be resolved in the near future. It will be interesting to see as to how the Obama administration will try to resolve this debate and provide solutions to the issue. Hopefully the process will not involve Internet access providers spending money on lobbying officials in the government to regulate Internet access.

=== Technicalities of Network neutrality ===
==== Discrimination on Internet ====
The extent to which network operators should be allowed to discriminate among Internet packet to block selectively, adjust price or quality of service is one of the most fundamental issue in the network neutrality debate (Peha,2007).The networks favor some traffic orpacket streams over others by using variety of data differentiation techniques or algorithms.
There are various methods by which the ISP’s are able to discriminate, by determining which types of packets are in the network. The first type is flow classification, ISP’s are able to determine the nature of packet by examining the amount of time since the packet stream began, theamount of time between consecutive packets, and the sizes of packets in astream (Peha,2007). The information about every packetstream going through the network can be maintained by using the second methodcalled as deep packet inspection. It can categorize traffic based, not just on what it can learn from the packet it is currently handling but also on the combination of the content of many consecutive packets (Peha, 2007). Instead of looking only at the information needed to get the packet to its destination, using deep packet inspection a device is aware of the information at the application layer as illustrated in Table 1.1

Table 1.1:Examples of header data showing which information is stored in which data field.

Table is adapted from a table mentioned in 'The Benefits and Risks of Mandating Network Neutrality' by Peha.

==== Types of Discrimination ====
===== Minimal vs. Non-minimal Discrimination =====
This is a type of network discrimination, which discards packets by assigning priorities to the packets, and always discards the packet with lowest priority (Felten, 2006). When it is absolutely necessary a network discards packets it is called minimal discrimination, because only when it can’t serve everybody the network discriminates (Felten, 2006). In minimaldiscrimination if the network is not crowded, lots of low-priority packets canget through; the low-priority packet inconvenienced only when there is anunavoidable conflict with high-priority packets  (Crowcroft, 2007).
In contrast, non-minimal discrimination is more drastic form of discrimination in which even when it is possible to deliver or forward every packet routers discards some low-priority packets (Felten, 2006). For example even if 80% part of network capacity is idle, a router might limit low-priority packets to 20% of thenetwork’s capacity (Felten, 2006).
It is decided which packets to be discarded or not with the help of different traffic control algorithms. The first type is scheduling algorithm in which it determines how often packets from agiven stream are transmitted, and when each waiting packet is actually transmitted (Peha, 2007). Using a dropping algorithm, it will select some packets to be discarded when the number of waiting packets becomes too large (Peha, 2007). In traffic shaping algorithm so that packets are spread out sothat they do not arrive in a single large burst (Peha,2007). And finally an admission control algorithm on the grounds that it would not be possible to meet QoS requirements for the new packet stream if this new stream were admitted and the current streams it may block entire packet streams temporarily (Peha,2007). 
===== Delay Discrimination =====
Discrimination can also work by reordering or delaying packet streams it always doesn’t haveto operate by dropping packets (Felten, 2006). Where a packet should be forwarded next is decided by using routing algorithm thus achieving delay discrimination (Peha, 2007). Some packets with low priority might besent the slow way, while others with high priority may be sent over the mostreliable path and quickest  (Crowcroft, 2007).
“A network operator might discriminate by providing unequal access to various services (Peha,2007).” Delay discrimination is useful for those who broadcast media streams such as music or video to multiple users simultaneously over the Internet (Goldsborough, 2008). Delay discrimination also works giving better access of information caches to some users, so that internet content need not have to be retrieved from remote part of the network but can be done locally (Lehr, Gillet,Sirbu, &amp; Peha, 2007).Other users may be charged more or not even allowed for using that network associated caches (Lehr, Gillet, Sirbu, &amp; Peha, 2007).

==== The Benefits of Discrimination ====
There are several benefits for discrimination and it ranges from securityto quality of service control.
One of the most important benefits of discrimination on network level is security. A network operator can determine whether a packet stream is carrying a virus or a dangerous piece of spyware by using deep packet inspection (Peha, 2007). It would be a huge damage to network security if a network neutrality policy that prohibits networks from dropping dangerous traffic/packet stream of this kind.
The network can prevent customers from using equipment which would hinder their neighbors’ traffic by ensuring that only authorized devices are attached to thenetwork  (Peha, 2007). The devices may access adult-only material contrary, or that consumes more of the shared resources than is allowed contrast to the customer’s stated wishes (Peha,2007). Different applications have different QoS needs so discrimination with respect to QoS is also important (Peha,2007) (Felten, 2006). So it is not required to give equal access to all services.
Pricing also plays an important role in congestion control by using price discrimination. There are quantifiable advantages of price discrimination over more traditional technical approaches; it is done by convincing some users to delay their transmissions by adjusting prices dynamically basedon congestion levels (Peha,2007).
The internet traffic is increasing at tremendous rate. This flow of data/traffic can suffer from congestion at a number of points on the internet. The increasing use of multimedia technology is worsening the congestion of the flow of data/traffic.“An internet user attempting to retrieve a file from a file repository in another country will generally be unable to tell whether the dominant cause ofcongestion is the hardware at the file repository, or the various network links between the repository and the user (Gibson, 1998).” Thus, the effect on internet users isgenerally the same, although the distinction between hardware and data/traffic congestion is important to internet providers  (Gibson, 1998). Thus by discriminating the ISP’s canprovide better service to maximum of the customers.

==== The Risks of Discrimination ====
In the previous section we talked about the benefits but there can be huge consequences to discrimination if it is not properly monitored.
One of the serious risks with discrimination is that it may lead to protecting legacy services from competition. In the current ISP market cable and telephone companies are dominant broadband providers. In this case without any network neutrality the ISP’scan block the traffic or degrade the QoS for rival services (Peha, 2007) (Grossman, 2009). For e.g., a telephone company can degrade the VoIP services forcing customers to use traditional telephone services, as well this can be the case with cable companies for degrading streaming videos (Goldsborough, 2008) (Crowcroft, 2007) (Felten, 2006).
Discrimination may also lead to charging oligopoly rents in the broadband. In this scenario the ISP’s may be able to maximize their profit depending on the will of the customers to pay for particular services (Peha, 2007). This would lead to degrading services for customers who pay less. By using the above statement it can be said that the scenario of internet access without net neutrality regulation would look like as figure shown below:

&lt;/gallery&gt;




As well discrimination may even lead to charging oligopoly rents competitive upstream market. Firstly an upstream market in this situation is ane-commerce market (Peha, 2007). For e.g., an ISP if not restricted can lead to charging extra for every book sold online, just because it is allowing its customers to visit that particular site (Crowcroft,2007).
Too much of discrimination on Internet may lead to stifling of free speech. This would play an important role in political environment for reasons varying from raising campaign donations to extreme cases like avoiding access to sites having contradictory views on certain political candidate (Peha, 2007). 

==== Misleading Characterizations of the Network Neutrality Issue ====
Banning all discrimination should not be a network neutrality policy (Peha, 2007). As we have seen previously discriminating is also used in benefiting customers for improving security, QoS etc.
Protecting the rights or “freedoms” of consumers should not be a network neutrality policy (Peha, 2007). FCC has endorsed freedom for internet user; under which consumers should have the ability to receive meaningful information about their service plans, attach the devices of their choice, run the applications and they can also access any legal content they want  (Powell, 2004). However if regulation for network neutrality is to be approved it has to be based on behavior of network operators and not the freedom of consumers (Peha, 2007).
Not just “who pays” for Internet service or infrastructure should be a clause for network neutrality policy (Peha, 2007). Today, the cost for the last-mile service providedby network operator is paid directly by both consumers and content providers. However,some network operators argue that content providers pay only for their own last-mile connection thus getting a “free ride”  (Peha, 2007). This is the same where both sender and receiver pay for “air time,” using cellular telephone calls in the U.S., which is accepted without any problem.
“Network neutrality should not be about whether network operators can differentiate their services (Peha, 2007).” In regions with only one broadband provider differentiation is not a big issue, but in today’s market situation with rigorous competition a network neutrality policy would turn broadband access into a commodity if it prevents a network operator from offering a unique set of services  (Sidak, 2006).

=== Net Neutrality Regulation ===
==== Telecommunications Regulation ====
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was not the first piece of legislation enacted which directly affected service providers. It was the original act, which in 1934 established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In that act, specific functions and powers were granted to the FCC, which would determine what extent the FCC would be able to promulgate its powers. 
As previously mentioned, in 1996, the United States government affixed the first set of amendments to the Telecommunications Act of 1934. The purpose of the legislation as stated in the bill was to “promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for American telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies” (Telecommunications Act 1996, 1996, §1).  In order to rapidly develop and deploy new technologies, the 1996 bill would set forth rules and guidelines that would facilitate local loop unbundling via facilities-based entry rather than service-based entry. This meant that incumbent service providers who owned landlines would be forced to give access to competing new service providers in order to foster competition and growth. Or least that was the intention of the bill.
However, enforcing such a practice would not go without sharp criticism as Bauer &amp; Bohlin (2008) noted, “ the Act sent mixed signals to regulators and industry, as some of the instruments envisioned to support the transition to local competition invited excessive forms of regulation”(Bauer &amp; Bohlin, 2008, p. 5).

==== First Incidents ====
Granted the issue of “net neutrality” had not risen into the public sphere until the early 21st century. Specific regulation containing language that was either for or against net neutrality, had yet to be constructed in the House or the Senate until mid 2000’s.  The following are some of the major events that would set the stage for how net neutrality legislation would be formulated and FCC policies promulgated.

===== Brand X =====
On June 27, 2005, the United States Supreme Court upheld a decision by the Federal Communications Commission on whether to classify cable companies as telecommunications service providers or information service providers. In that decision, an appellate court’s decision would be overturned, which had initially overturned the FCC’s decision. The Supreme Court in agreement with the findings of the Commission found that based on the functionality of the Internet, that “because Internet access provides a capability for manipulating and storing information, cable companies are classified as information service providers ”(National Cable v. Brand X, p.6, 2005). Quite simply what this means is since cable companies provide access to the Internet (via broadband), that is significantly faster than traditional dial-up services, and that those services allow for the manipulation, retrieval and storage of information, they should be classified as information service providers. Being a telecommunications provider, e.g. Telephone Company, would imply providing a service to customers where the transmission of the data is not manipulated, retrieved, or stored e.g., phone calls. This is important because if the Supreme Court had concluded that cable companies be classified as telecommunications providers, they would then be subject to the regulations of the FCC granted by the Telecommunications Act of 1934 as well as be subject to common carrier legislation that would force local loop unbundling as set forth in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 

===== Madison River =====
In 2005, Madison River Communications, a telephone company operating in North Carolina, blocked port availability to customers using Vonage; an operator of Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phone services. At the behest of complaint filed by Vonage and investigation by the press, the FCC’s enforcement bureau set in motion an investigation on the complaint. The only noticeable action taken upon Madison was a $15,000 fine imposed by t the Federal Communications Commission and the signing of a consent decree by Madison River Communications.
Though resulting in a fine and signing of a consent decree, the settlement by no means indicated that the Madison River was willfully acknowledging any “factual or legal finding regarding any compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of the Act” (Consent Decree, p.3, 2005). This is important because though it would inhibit such future actions from, the decree was not formed as a legaly binding action.
Vonage, a broadband service provider, does not own physical landlines for transmitting phone calls. They operate their service by selling routers and a compatible handset that connects to their customers’ existing DSL modem(s). Vonage does not provide customers with a way to store, retrieve, or manipulate information rather they only provide a service where information is transferred in it original form (phone calls). According to the Supreme Court’s opinion in the Brand X case they might be classified as a telecommunications provider, however since they are operating over a broadband connection they are classified as information service providers.
Though discriminated against, Vonage was not subject to any of the discrete forms of discrimination mentioned in the previous section such as flow classification or deep packet inspection. Rather, it was a more blatant form of discrimination that prevented Vonage’s customers from actually using the service by preventing the Vonage routers from connecting to required servers on Madison Rivers’ network.

===== FCC Policy Statement of 2005 =====
With a model case, the dense and rapid growth of broadband escalated the importance and value of interconnectivity. In August 2005, shortly after the Madison River incident. The Federal Communications Commission released a policy statement in which it referred to The Telecommunications Act of 1934 which it stated that, “In section 706(a) of the Act, Congress charges the Commission with encouraging the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability – broadband – to all Americans” (Policy Statement, 2005, p.2). In its interpretation, the FCC used the Act to reiterate its ancillary authority to regulate domestic telecommunications commerce. In that policy statement, the commission would enforce principles allowing its enforcement of broadband development and deployment. The statement was aimed at fostering competition, such that consumers are able to access the content and services and connect devices; granted they are lawful devices approved by the FCC. For the FCC, fostering competition meant consumers should have the rightful choice of multiple network, application, service and content providers that would appropriately foster a competitive and consumer driven market place. (Policy Statement, 2005, p.3)

===== Comcast =====
In 2007, Comcast replicated a similar action to that of Madison River Communications in which it willfully practiced discrimination. This time it was not against a service provider like Vonage, this time foul was voiced by consumers and operators of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks.  Initially Comcast strongly denied conducting such actions, however at the behest of an investigation by the associated press, Comcast admitted that it had it was in fact practicing reasonable network management. The actions against Comcast did not come swiftly as it did with Madison River. A hearing was held on February 25, 2008 in which Comcast's Executive Vice President defended the network management practices of his company but would deny blocking access to any content, service, or application provider. 
The hearing resulted in the FCC forcing Comcast to change its network management policies and discontinue the discriminatory packet management against P2P networks.
Unlike the Madison River incident, the type discrimination in this incident was deep packet inspection. It was not the reasonable traffic management practices that caught the attention of the FCC; rather it was the throttling of content from the torrent P2P networks. Much of content flowing through those networks was thought to be content that was competing directly with content that Comcast provided e.g. movies, music, and television shows.
Most recently, Comcast has settled a class action lawsuit with the operators of the bit-torrent network and has settled the matter for a sum 16 million dollars. Which results in a sum of roughly 16 dollars per plaintiff involved in the case.

===== Internet Non-Discrimination Act of 2006 (S. 2360) =====
Brought to the Senate by Democratic Senator of Oregon, Ron Wyden, the Non- Discrimination Act was the first piece of legislation introduced in Congress that directly tackled the arising issue of network neutrality. It laid out rules for actions following complaints of violations made to the FCC and it laid out penalties for those violations. Those violations would be punishable and promulgated by the FCC as stated in the Telecommunications Act of 1934.
The bill was ambitious in that it would specifically prevent network providers from offering superior service to companies whom they conduct business with, while providing inferior service to customers. It also set out quality of service provisions preventing network providers from prioritizing packets for customers regardless of geography or service agreements, putting service on a level field.  More importantly, the legislation would force network providers to clearly disclose its network management practices for consumers in its terms and agreements. (Internet Non- Discrimination, 2006, §4)
The proposed legislation, though ambitious, was only referred twice to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The bill failed to gain any ground and did not pick up any co-sponsors. There has been no action on this bill on since, thus it never became law.
===== Network Neutrality Act of 2006 (H.R. 5273) =====
This bill was introduced by Democratic Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts on May 2, 2006. Not introduced as an amendment to prior laws, this bill attempted to pick up where the Internet Non-Discrimination Act left off and contained much of the same non- discriminatory language that bill S. 2360 had contained.
One of the main provisions in this bill not included in the Non-Discrimination Act stated that operators shall have the right to “manage the functioning of its network, on a system wide basis, provided that any such management function does not result in discrimination between content, applications, or services offered by the provider and unaffiliated providers” (Network Neutrality, 2006, §4). It would also allow operators to reserve data prioritization rights in the event of an emergency. Overall, the tone of the bill was to reinforce the principles for regulating telecommunication commerce as stated in the Telecommunications Act of 1934. 
Providing for a little more flexibility than its predecessor, though containing much of the same language, the bill received support from 23 house representatives, including current Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. However, like its predecessor it failed to pick up any ground and was only referred twice, once to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and once to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet. 
===== Internet Freedom and Nondiscrimination Act of 2006 (H.R 5417) =====
Unlike the first two bills, this bill was introduced not as an amendment to the Telecommunications Act but to the Clayton Act, which covers anti-trust regulation. It would make all actions listed under the law illegal as a matter of competition among broadband providers.
The purpose of the act was the facilitation of trade and competition within the communication marketplace, with the aim of protecting consumers, and content providers from discriminatory network management practices. This bill, like the previous ones, contained much of the same non-discriminatory language prohibiting certain actions by broadband network providers. But more specifically, this bill laid out a provision which would allow any person to provide content, applications, or service over a said network, at the same time providing nondiscriminatory protections for those offering the content, applications, or service. (Internet Freedom, 2006, §3) It was an area of network neutrality prior proposed legislation had not covered. Rather than focusing on the establishment of a neutral network from business to customer prospective, it focused on ensuring that the business-to-business connection along with the innovation and growth to could be bred from that competition, would not be hampered by anti-competitive behavior.
===== Communications Opportunity, Preservation, Enhancement Act of 2006 (H.R. 5252) =====
The Communications, Opportunity, Promotion, Enhancement Act was a fairly narrow piece of legislation that covered national franchises, local loop unbundling, restrictions on states municipalities ability to provide cable operations and internet services to the general public, requirements for VOIP operators such as Vonage, but most importantly network neutrality. This was the first piece of legislation to be wholly introduced by a Republican member of the House, Representative Joe Barton of Texas. In Title II of the bill, Congress via this bill,  would reassert the right of the FCC to regulate communications commerce violations and impose reasonable punishments, through the powers granted by the Telecommunications Act of 1934 which stated that “the Commission shall have exclusive authority to adjudicate any complaint alleging a violation of the broadband policy statement or the principles incorporated there- in” (Communications Opportunity, 2006, §201). Though it did not contain any specific non-discriminatory language, the bill would support net neutrality via FCC regulation.
The first version of the bill introduced in the House of Representatives received support from both Democrat and Republican House members, as a result passing with a vote of 321-101. After making it through the House, it moved on to the Senate where it was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation for markup. There were several proposed amendments to the bill, but of those, only four were adopted, none of which contained any specific net neutrality language. Granted that the bill did make it to the Senate, it was reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office, where it was estimated that the bill would cost over 5.2 billion dollars to implement over a ten-year period. That spending would in turn generate revenues of 5 billion over the same period. On September 29, 2006, the bill was put on the Senate calendar for debate, but never was acted on again and fell short of becoming law.
Though the bill did pass in the House of Representatives with a defining majority, it did not come without its criticisms. As mentioned above, the bill did not pass with any specific net neutrality amendments, thus it would be Senators Bryan Dorgan and Olympia Snowe (authors of Internet Freedom Preservation Acts 2006 &amp; 2007 respectively) who would dissent. Subsequently, they would propose an amendment that &quot;prevented cable and telephone companies from assigning priority to Internet traffic based on financial arrangements with Web Sites” (Roberts, 2008, p. 76). It was an amendment, which they felt would strongly uphold and maintain the goals of a competitive telecommunications market place as set out in the Telecommunications Act of 1934.
===== The Internet Freedom Preservation Acts (IFPA) =====
Of all of the regulation that has been proposed, but yet to make it to becoming law, the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, has had the most re-incarnations since the original version of the bill was first introduced in 2006. 
Making the transition back to much of the strong non-discriminatory language of the Internet Freedom Non- Discrimination Acts. It was aimed at amending the Telecommunications Act of 1934, by specifically requiring that broadband operators provide consistent and non-discriminatory service to customers in the same manner that previous legislation would have required. It borrowed language from the C.O.P.E Act, preventing network operators from forcing customers to purchase other network services e.g. telephone and television (known as bundling or the ‘triple play”) as a requirement for receiving Internet Service. 
Similar to the Non-Discrimination and Net Neutrality Acts, this bill would not prevent network providers from conducting ‘reasonable network management’ practices to maintain the quality of its network.  It also would allow service providers to offer different levels of service to customers, but would not allow them to charge for those varying levels of service. Overall, the bill provided consumers protections against discriminatory network practices, but would also give broadband operators provide operators with the ability to ensure in conducting ‘reasonable network management’, much of which includes ensuring proper and secure transmission of data over a providers broadband network. 
To date there have been four versions of the bill under the same name which have either failed or have yet to be enacted into law.

Unlike the prior proposed legislation this bill, would receive support form currentPresident Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as currentSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. However even with the backing whom were at the time presidential candidates, the Freedom Preservation Acts have yet togain any serious ground in the House or the Senate and continues to fight an uphill battle. It remains that network neutrality regulation is seen asgovernment intrusion into an area it has no business being in. And on the otherside, as some say, protecting the very Internet that has flourished because ithas been neutral.

=== Suggestion ===
Suggestions are few and far in between when it comes to net neutrality.  As the two sides are so divided, it makes it very difficult to come to a compromise.  However, there is one suggestion which comes from the Canadian organization, Canarie, which is funded by the Canadian organization.  The suggestion comes from a study which was led by researcher Bill St. Arnaud where he suggests that homeowners pay for the last mile connection.  It is a known within the telecommunications industry that companies do not make any money off of the last mile connection(s).  The initial investment within the last mile connection is so expensive, and the fees at which that they can charge their customers are so competitive.  Because of that, technology lags so much in the last mile connection as they cannot make any money off of it.  This is what makes a non-net neutrality environment to ISPs because it now presents a way in that they can make money off of the last mile connection.  The idea from the study is that it would have the people that actually use the connection and bandwidth to actually pay for the bandwidth.  Once they purchased it, they would be in charge of doing upgrades if they so choose, as well as dealing with maintenance costs.  Once an installation is added on a house, the homeowner may then sell the connection with the house in a future sale.  Though each installation is costly at roughly $2700, a homeowner could bundle it into their mortgage which would allow them to spread the cost out over the length of their mortgage; mitigating the impact of the initial price shock.  Having a high speed connection which is owned by the occupants of the home is also a major selling point. Arnaud also cites that home owners are starting to factor in broadband access when choosing a new home.  Having purchased broadband would be a positive thing within a potential home sale because the investment has already been made for the potential buyer (Johnson, 2008). 
This suggestion also poses several positive side effects for the telecommunications companies.  One being that it allows them to get a depreciating asset off of their books.  Currently the last mile connections are owned by the telecommunication companies.  As they are expensive the install and maintain, the telecommunication company must foot the bill when it comes to installation and maintenance.  It is an investment that they have to make in order to attain a significant customer base, however it is an investment which will depreciate.  Each year as the technology gets older and older it will depreciate which causes their current assets to go down.  By allowing the telecommunications companies to sell these assets to individual owners, it allows them to get rid of these depreciating assets and turn them into a liquid asset (I.e. cash) which helps to enhance their cash flow situation and make a real investment (which can provide a return) into their core competencies like programming and installing and maintaining the major backbone infrastructure.  As the telecommunications companies cannot make money off of the last mile connection(s), they have to subsidize it with their other service offerings.  With them not having to subsidize it anymore, they would have the ability to lower the fees that they charge each month.  It also opens up potential future business because the connections will need to be maintained.  By situating themselves correctly, the telecommunications companies have the potential to do the maintenance work for the homeowners as further maintenance is required.
 
==== Balanced Network Neutrality Policy ====
The debate over network neutrality has two very different points of view. Network neutrality advocates worry about ISP’s discriminating internet traffic andopponents argue that enforcing network neutrality would be difficult and errorprone (Felten, 2006). The solution for this is a balanced policy which would limit the harmful uses of discrimination and allow it’s beneficial uses, because making wrong decision with respect to network neutrality regulation can hamper Internet’s development (Peha, 2007).
For the protection of beneficial discrimination a policy can be designed which might allow the following:
Network operators could provide different QoS to different classes of traffic by using explicit prioritization or other techniques. A stricter QoS requirements for trafficsent using a higher-priced service can be favored using these techniques (Alleven, 2009).
Network operators could charge a different price for both the senders and recipients of data depending on different classes of traffic  (Peha, 2007). The higher price could be charged for traffic which consumes more of a limited resource or which requires superior quality of service and has adverse effect on neighbors traffic (Felten, 2006).
Traffic that can pose a threat to network security or which can be harmful to the network could be blocked by the network operator; it can be either by not following certain protocols or defined algorithms (Crowcroft, 2007). Network operators could also benefit by offering unique services or proprietary content to their customers (Peha, 2007). 
If and only if, the broadband market is not highly competitive, a policy designed to limit harmful uses of discrimination would not allow the following:  (Peha, 2007).
A network operator cannot charge more for a 50kbps VoIP stream than 50kbps gaming application where the QOS requirements are the same (Felten, 2006). One user could not be charged more than another by a network operator whether the user is a service provider, content provider or a consumer for a comparable information transfer or monthly service or even whether the user is the sender or receiver  (Peha, 2007).
Until and unless a network operator has a reasonable belief that certain traffic poses asecurity threat to the network it could not block traffic based on content or application alone (Crowcroft, 2007). Degradation of QoS only on the basis of content alone couldn’t be done by the network operators (Crowcroft,2007)(Alleven, 2009).

A network operator could not offer different QoS and price for traffic that competes witha legacy circuit-switched service  (Peha, 2007).

=== Conclusion ===

Net neutrality is one of the most contested issues today within the Internet forum.  Its impact is over-reaching and is tremendously impactful. Firstly we gave a brief overview of net neutrality.  This discussed where its roots had come from and introduced the polarized sides within the debate of net neutrality.  Next we discussed the economics of net neutrality.  Not only are the ethical issues important within net neutrality, but the economics must make sense and be feasible.  All parties involved within the net neutrality debate want to be sure that outcome should benefit them financially.  Thirdly we discussed the technicalities of net neutrality.  In the previous section we talked about the financial implications (through economics), and now we wanted you, the reader, to have an understanding of how, technically, the routes and switches are able to support or not support net neutrality.  Next we discussed regulations within net neutrality.  This was important because it is imperative to understand the current legal landscape of net neutrality.  It was discussed where this topic is supported and not supported within the legal environment.  After that, we discussed a suggestion of how to solve the debate by having home owners purchasing their broadband connection from the ISP; the last mile.  By the homeowners purchasing the connection it would neutralize the last mile connection and therefore taking a lot of the contention of net neutrality out of the running. 
Net neutrality is a broad topic.  However, though it is broad, there are a lot of nuances and passion that needs to be understood about it.  By having an understanding of this topic it allows one to begin to develop an opinion on where net neutrality should go in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Having Leaf exchange data with other programs can be challenging. This author, Thomas Messerschmidt, working with his robot Robot Betty9 (see http://www.myspace.com/robotbetty9), has created a very simple but quite effective way of allowing Leaf to chat with just about any external (external to LISP) program. 

The methodology consists of passing text message between Leaf/LISP and the outside world by creating and destroying small text (.txt) files. It was originally written so that Leaf could expand his AI using a standard ALICE-BASED (ProgramD) chatbot. 

The first part consists of the function &quot;sendchatout2chatbot&quot;. It writes data out to the &quot;in&quot; file &quot;in.txt&quot;.

The second part consists of the function &quot;readchatbotfile &quot;. It reads text returned from an application, in this case from a chatbot using a file called &quot;out.txt&quot;. 

;;; Start of Chatbot Interface Code -----------------------------------------
;;; Start of Chatbot Interface Code -----------------------------------------
;;; Start of Chatbot Interface Code -----------------------------------------
;;; Code by Thomas Messerschmidt (Please credit me. A link back to Betty9 would be nice.)

(defun sendchatout2chatbot ()
  (print *text-phrase*)
        (setf mytext *text-phrase* )
        (setf mytext (subseq mytext 6))
        (with-open-file 
            (textin &quot;C:/in.txt&quot; :direction :output
                                         :if-exists :supersede)
            (print mytext textin)
        )
        (setf *text-phrase* nil)  )

(defun readchatbotfile ()
 (with-open-file (stream &quot;C:/out.txt&quot;)
   (do ((line (read-line stream nil)
               (read-line stream nil)))
    ((null line))
    (setf x1 line))) 
    (sapi-tts x1)
    (delete-file &quot;C:/out.txt&quot;)   ); and then delete the file

(defun getchatin () ; tts what came back from chatbot and then delete the file
  (if (probe-file &quot;C:/out.txt&quot;) (readchatbotfile))  ) ; Read the file if there is a file to be read.


;;; End of Chatbot Interface Code -------------------------------------------
;;; End of Chatbot Interface Code -------------------------------------------
;;; End of Chatbot Interface Code -------------------------------------------


So to sum it up:
1. A user asks a question of Leaf
2. Leaf sends the question to the chatbot via the sendchatout2chatbot function which writes to &quot;C:/in.txt&quot;
3. The chatbot reads in the question asked in &quot;C:/in.txt&quot; and then deletes the file.
4. The chatbot writes out its response to the question in a file &quot;C:/out.txt&quot;
5. When leaf sees that there exists a C:/out.txt file, he reads it in with the readchatbotfile function which also reads it aloud using Microsoft's standard TTS (Text to Speech) SAPI 5.x.
6. The file &quot;C:/out.txt&quot; is then deleted by Leaf.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sorry about the Gliffy ident on the image, I hadn't realised it did that (in fact, I'm sure I've used Gliffy in the past and it ''hasn't'' done that, which is more or less the reason I was using it over competitors) and I didn't have a way of previewing the file until I uploaded it. I'll try and fix it ASAP, but hopefully it's better than no image at all, which is the only other alternative at the moment. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 19:36, 4 September 2010 (UTC)

== What version ==

Hello, and please correct me if I'm wrong:

In the first page of this book it makes no reference to the version of Python being used within the book.  This strikes me as important information to include in the very beginning of the book.  In my case, I'd like you to imagine my frustration when I go to run my first program as: print 'Hello, World!' and immediately receive a Syntax Error in my version of Python 3.1.3.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page describes &quot;add-ons&quot; to GLPK &amp;mdash; including
unofficial extensions to the GLPK codebase to provide
some special functionality.  As such, these extensions
require a suitable compilation environment.

__FORCETOC__

== BAK: branch-and-bound analysis kit ==

[[Image:Bak_branch_and_bound_tree.png|thumb|Branch and bound tree generated with BAK and rendered with gnuplot]]

BAK is a tool for analyzing the branch-and-bound behavior of GLPK and other solvers.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunsaker|first1=Brady|title=BAK: Branch-and-bound Analysis Kit|year=2009|url=http://www.rosemaryroad.org/projects/BAK/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ozaltin | first1 = Osman Y. | last2 = Hunsaker | first2 = Brady | last3 = Ralphs | first3 = Ted K. | year = 2007 | title = Visualizing branch-and-bound algorithms | url = http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2007/09/1785.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
BAK is distributed with a [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html GPL 2.0] license and a [[w:BSD licenses|BSD]] style license &amp;mdash; the choice of which to employ is left to the user.

=== Adding BAK to GLPK ===

The latest BAK tarball can be downloaded as from [http://www.rosemaryroad.org/bak/download/ www.rosemaryroad.org/bak/download/].

BAK comes with some patched source files for GLPK in the directory &lt;tt&gt;bak/interfaces/GLPK&lt;/tt&gt;.  First copy these files to the normal GLPK source directory and then rebuild GLPK afresh (see chapter [[GLPK/Compiling_GLPK|Compiling GLPK]]).

=== Usage ===

The modified standalone solver GLPSOL writes a file with branching information. The name of this file is specified using command-line option &lt;tt&gt;--bakfile&lt;/tt&gt;, for example:

&lt;pre&gt;
glpsol --bakfile tsp.bak -m tsp.mod
&lt;/pre&gt;

The file contains information about the nodes created, the branching process, the integer infeasabilities encountered, and the run-time progress. The file format is documented at [http://www.rosemaryroad.org/projects/BAK/browser/trunk/grammar_details www.rosemaryroad.org/projects/BAK/browser/trunk/grammar_details]. As an example, this file might start with the following lines.

&lt;pre&gt;
#SOLVER: GLPK
#PROBLEM: (null)
0.002000 branched 1 0 M 6030.000000 6.466667 32
0.002000 candidate 2 1 L
0.002000 candidate 3 1 R
0.004000 branched 2 1 L 6030.000000 6.466667 30
0.004000 candidate 4 2 L
0.004000 candidate 5 2 R
0.006000 branched 4 2 L 6069.000000 7.533333 32
0.006000 candidate 6 4 L
0.006000 candidate 7 4 R
0.008000 branched 7 4 R 6069.000000 7.266667 30
0.008000 candidate 8 7 L
0.008000 candidate 9 7 R
0.009000 infeasible 9 7 R
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

A python script can be used to create intermediate files for visualizing this information with [[w:gnuplot|gnuplot]]:

&lt;pre&gt;
python bak/BAK_visual.py --all tsp.bak
&lt;/pre&gt;

The resultant files can be viewed with a [[w:PNG|PNG]] file viewer, for instance evince:
&lt;pre&gt;
evince tree_alt.004.png
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition ==

[[w:Dantzig-Wolfe_decomposition|Dantzig-Wolfe
decomposition]] is a technique for splitting a suitably
structured LP problem into subproblems &amp;mdash; and then
solving these separately and usually in parallel.  The
underlying constraint matrix needs a certain form of
block structure.  The technique, first proposed in
1960, is attracting renewed interest, given the advent
of inexpensive multi-core personal computers.

The
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dwsolver Dantzig-Wolfe Solver project],
now hosted at
[[w:Source_forge|SourceForge]], provides a general,
parallel implementation of Dantzig-Wolfe using GLPK.
The code was authored by Joey Rios.  The first public
release, version&amp;nbsp;1.0, was uploaded on
15&amp;nbsp;October 2010.

This implementation uses the [[w:Pthreads|Pthreads]]
thread management library.  Small modifications to GLPK
were necessary to allow it to run concurrently.  As a
result, GLPK in its entirety is included in the
Dantzig-Wolfe Solver project codebase.  Aside from
Pthreads, no other specialist libraries are required.

The code has been successfully built on Mac OS&amp;nbsp;X
10.5 and 10.6, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Windows XP
via cygwin.

The author hopes this tool will provide a starting
point for further research into Dantzig-Wolfe
decomposition.  Indeed, while many papers across
several domains have taken advantage of DW, this is
possibly the only project that offers DW source code
for open testing and development.

The software has some limitations.  As at October 2010,
only LP formulations can be used and the subproblems
must be bounded.  There may also be bugs.

The modeler provides CPLEX LP input files for the
master problem and each of the subproblems.  A simple guide
file, that tells a command-line tool where everything
is, also required.  The codebase contains several DW
examples taken from textbooks and websites or developed
by the author.

For an assessment of Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition in general
and under parallel computation, see Tebboth (2001).&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==H.1 Introduction to relativity==

===H.1.1 Describe what is meant by a frame of reference===
A frame of reference refers to a point of view. Physics refers to observational frames of reference, i.e. what is heard, seen, touched, smelt or tasted from a certain point of view.

e.g. you have a frame of reference (in a computer chair) that views the world as stationary. A frame of reference with the sun as stationary would view you as moving around the earth.

===H.1.2 Describe what is meant by a Galilean Transformation===
Galilean is what seems intuitive. The equations do not involve relativity. 

===H.1.3 Solve problems involving relative velocities using the Galilean transformation equations===
This should be easy.
position equation:
x'=x-vt

Velocity equation:
u'=u-v

e.g. You are sitting on a park bench. You see a bike and car moving away from each other. The bike is moving at 5m/s, the car is moving at 20 m/s. How fast is the bike moving in the cars reference frame?
(Ans: 25m/s)

==H.2 Concepts and postulates of special relativity==

===H.2.1 Describe what is meant by an inertial frame of reference===
A reference frame that is moving with a constant velocity.          This really isn't that essential but you might see a fundamental flaw in this definition (just ignore it if you do).

===H.2.2 State the two postulates of the special theory of relativity===
* the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial observers.
* The laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.

===H.2.3 Discuss the concept of simultaneity===
Consult a textbook (or youtube &quot;simultaneity&quot;), best explained with diagrams.

In summary though, simultaneous events that take place at the same point in space will be simultaneous to all observers. However, events that take place at different points in space can be simultaneous for one observer but not for another.

==H.3 Relativistic Kinematics==

===H.3.1 Describe the concept of a light clock===
'''Best described by diagram.''' 
                                                                            
Imagine a clock where light is bounced off two mirrors.           mirror|                   light beam --&gt;                   mirror |

Each time it hits a mirror a &quot;tick&quot; is registered. Since light is the same for all reference frames, this is the most accurate type of clock.

This seams simple for a stationary clock, HOWEVER in a reference frame where the clock moves, it must travel a diagonal distance which is greater than that for a stationary time frame. In this case a &quot;tick&quot; would take longer for one reference frame than the other. Therefore, time is shorter for one reference frame than another.

===H.3.2 Define proper time interval===
Proper time interval is the elapsed time measured between two events when the observer is in an inertial frame of reference.

===H.3.3 Derive the time dilation formula===
The time dilation formula can be derived using pythagoras's theorem. The length of the light clock is l. According to the observer's clocks, the clock in the light clock travels longer (l' = ct'). Horizontal distance traveled by the light clock: vt'.
t = l/c

l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+(vt')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (l')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

t'&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (l')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;


t'&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+(vt')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

After rearranging,
t' = 1/(&amp;nbsp;1-v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;) x t

===H.3.4 Sketch and annotate a graph showing the variation with relative velocity of the Lorentz factor===


===H.3.5 Solve problems involving time dilation===


===H.3.6 Define proper length===


===H.3.7 Describe the phenomenon of length contraction===


===H.3.8 Solve problems involving length contraction===


==H.4 Some consequences of special relativity==

===H.4.1. Describe how the concept of time dilation leads to the &quot;twin paradox&quot;===


===H.4.2 Discuss the Hafele-Keating experiment===

Testing the theory of special relativity, scientists flew two clocks around the world in opposite directions and compared them to a clock that was stationary relative to the earth's surface.  One plane flew eastward and another went westward.  When the planes returned, it was  found that that for the plane flying East, it's clock was slower than the clock on the earth's surface (it was behind by 59 ns).  Since the earth spins to the east and the plane was travelling east relative to the earth's atmosphere, this clock had a greater velocity relative to the stationary frame of reference: the centre of the Earth and so it's clock ticked a little slower. The westward clock ran faster than the clock that remained on the earth's surface as it was moving more slowly relative to the centre of the earth.  This experiment provided evidence of time dilation that was in excellent agreement with relativistic predictions.

===H.4.3 Solve one-dimensional problems involving the relativistic addition of velocities===


===H.4.4 State the formula representing the equivalence of mass and energy===


===H.4.5 Define rest mass===
'''Rest mass''' of an object is defined to be the energy required to produce the object at rest.

===H.4.6 Distinguish between the energy of a body at rest and its total energy when moving===


===H.4.7 Explain why no object can ever attain the speed of light in a vacuum===
According to the classical mechanics, F = ma therefore if the force is applied to an object constantly over a very long time period, the speed of the object must increase without limit. However, this is not true; as the speed of the object increases, ''the relativistic mass of the object increases'', therefore acceleration will gradually decrease. Only the particles with no rest mass (such as photon) can travel with the speed of light.

===H.4.8 Determine the total energy of an accelerated particle===
The total energy E, momentum p, and the rest energy E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (=m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) have a relationship E&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==H.5 Evidence to support special relativity==

===H.5.1 Discuss muon decay as experimental evidence to support special relativity===


===H.5.2 Solve problems involving the muon decay experiment===


===H.5.3 Outline the Michelson-Morley experiment===


===H.5.4 Discuss the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment and its implication===


===H.5.5 Outline an experiment that indicates that the speed of light in vacuum is independent of its source===


==H.6 Relativistic momentum and energy==

===H.6.1 Apply the relation for the relativistic momentum p = γm&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;u of particles===


===H.6.2 Apply the formula E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = (γ-1)m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the kinetic energy of a particle===


===H.6.3 Solve problems involving relativistic momentum and energy===


==H.7 General relativity==

===H.7.1 Explain the difference between the terms gravitational mass and inertial mass===
Gravitational mass is the mass obtained from when a gravitational force acts upon an object. The inertial mass is the mass obtained from when an external force acts upon a body (the mass is resisting the acceleration). Evidently, the gravitational and inertial mass are exactly the same because uniform acceleration is indistinguishable from a gravitational field.

===H.7.2 Describe and discuss Einstein's principle of equivalence===
The principle of equivalence states that there is no difference between an accelerating observer and an observer in a  gravitational field. This principle coincides with General Relativity and the IB exams focus on light being bent by a gravitational field; Einstein stated this idea in respect to his closed elevator thought experiment. Light bent the same way regardless of whether the elevator was at rest or accelerating downward. The second part of the principle of equivalence is that time slows down when an object approaches a massive body such as black holes.

===H.7.3 Deduce that the principle of equivalence predicts bending of light rays in a gravitational field===


===H.7.4 Deduce that the principle of equivalence predicts that time slows down near a massive body===


===H.7.5 Describe the concept of spacetime===
'''Spacetime'''is the 4-dimensional world with three space and one time coordinates.

===H.7.6 State that moving objects follow the shortest path between two points in spacetime===
In the absence of any forces, a moving object will move in spacetime along path with the shortest length. This path is called '''geodesics'''.

===H.7.7 Explain gravitational attraction in terms of the warping of spacetime by matter===

Large masses will warp space-time in such a way that the shortest distance to be travelled between point A and B for a particle is now a curve around the large mass.  As such, this curved path that the particle follows can be thought of as the gravitational attraction.

===H.7.8 Describe black holes===
'''Black hole''' is a singularity of space time, and is a point of infinite density. It causes extreme curvature of spacetime around it.

===H.7.9 Define the term Schwarzschild radius===
'''Schwarzschild radius''' (R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) is sometimes called '''gravitational radius''', or '''event horizon'''. Within R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, no object can escape from the gravitational field (because the escape velocity exceeds c within R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;).

===H.7.10 Calculate the Schwarzschild radius===
R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 2GMc&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, where G is the gravitational constant and M is mass of the black hole (or the star).

===H.7.11 Solve problems involving time dilation close to a black hole===


===H.7.12Describe the concept of gravitational red-shift===


===H.7.13 Solve problems involving frequency shifts between different points in a uniform gravitational field===


===H.7.14 Solve problems using the gravitational time dilation formula===


==H.8 Evidence to support general relativity==

===H.8.1 Outline an experiment for the bending of EM waves by a massive object===

===H.8.2 Describe gravitational lensing===
Assuming a massive galaxy has a large gravitational pull, light from a distant quasar is bent, thereby creating two quasars when viewed through a telescope. The galaxy acts a lens as it bends the incoming light from the quasar.

===H.8.3 Outline an experiment that provides evidence for gravitational red-shift===

Pound-Rebka Experiment where they shot a photon from the ground floor of a building up to the attic.  They found that the frequency of the photon was longer up at the attic then at the ground floor and thus, provides evidence for gravitational red-shift.

==Welcome!==
[[Wikibooks:Welcome|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be directly attributed to you.
* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* A personal user page and [[Help:talk page|talk page]].
* The ability to [[Help:Preferences|customize]] certain aspects of the Wikibooks interface.
* The ability to rename pages.
* The eligibility to become an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Questions with which to focus the responses==

The main focus is to ask the CEO, TM of EDC, and OER Foundation to reflect on the recommendations for what an institution can take from this book. What things stand out to them for their considerations for managing their organisation. What concerns or reservations might they have? 

# Why do you think more than 80% of tertiary educators ''never'' use social media in their work?
# Referring to the section [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education Measuring Open Education] where it is shown to cost $4 000 to train a teacher how to use social media for open education and research, and that it returns over $9 000 in savings and benefits to the organisation, does this motivate you to invest in staff professional development? Why? Do you think it would make a difference to the statistic mentioned in question one?  
# Based on the recommendations made in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Incentives_and_Rewards Incentives and Rewards] - what do you think an institution could feasibly do to encourage the use of social media for open education and research?
# What do you think of the idea to use marketing budgets being more laterally spent, such as helping teachers producing open educational media and publishing it through social media channels? Would this help progress open education? Would it help promote the Institution? Would it deliver better educational services to teachers and their students?
# What new models of education strike you as having the least or most potential in the context of your institution? Why?</text>

This template gives you a way to later prove that you are the person who was in control of your account on the day this template was placed. This is done by putting a code (called a &quot;hash&quot;) on your user page so that, in the event that your account is compromised, you can convince someone else that you are really the person behind your username.

==Why?==
The intended use of this template is to help in the hopefully unlikely event that your account is compromised. If you published your real-life identity, then that identity could be used to reestablish contact with you if your account were compromised; keep in mind, in this scenario contact could not be established with you through your account, since it may be under the control of someone else. However, many Wikipedia users do not disclose their real-life identities, or disclose little enough of them that it may be difficult to establish their identity.

This is not a replacement for having a [[w:Password strength|strong password]], nor for registering an email address for your account. You should still do everything you can to prevent your account being compromised, including using a strong password and remembering to log yourself out when using a computer others may have access to. If you have one, it may also be helpful to post your [[w:Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] public key. But even with the best of precautions, your account could become compromised, for instance, via a [[w:trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] or a brute-force attack on your password. This is intended to be a last resort.

==How==
The idea is to use cryptographic hashes; you choose a secret string known only to yourself, put it through a one-way [[w:Cryptographic hash function|hash function]], and publish the result somewhere. It is infeasible to determine the secret string corresponding to the hash; hence, an attacker compromising an account presumably would not be able to supply the secret string.

=== Syntax ===
:&lt;code&gt;{&lt;nowiki/&gt;{user committed identity|&lt;var&gt;hash&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;var&gt;hash function used&lt;/var&gt;|background=&lt;var&gt;[[w:Web_colors#CSS_colors|CSS color]]&lt;/var&gt;|border=&lt;var&gt;[[w:Web_colors#CSS_colors|CSS color]]&lt;/var&gt;|article=&lt;var&gt;[[w:Article (grammar)|grammatical article]] for the hash function&lt;/var&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;

Italicized text should be replaced with appropriate input, or its parameter should be removed. Parameters are represented by 'parameter=&lt;var&gt;value&lt;/var&gt;&quot;, and separated by vertical bars |.
*Replace &quot;hash&quot; with the hash produced from your secret string. The implicit name of this parameter is &quot;1&quot; (see [[Help:Template#Example: numeric parameter substitution|numeric parameters]]).
*The &quot;hash function used&quot; parameter, if not included, defaults to [[w:SHA-512|SHA-512]]. (This hash function is strongly recommended.)
*The &quot;background&quot; parameter, if not included, defaults to #E0E8FF (&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #E0E8FF;&quot;&gt;light blue&lt;/span&gt;, see [[w:Web colors#Hex triplet|Web colors#Hex triplet]])
*The &quot;border&quot; parameter, if not included, also defaults to #E0E8FF.
*The &quot;article&quot; parameter, if not included, defaults to &quot;a&quot;. The other likely value is &quot;an&quot;.
For example, if your hash is &quot;ef7c4c55a176bd20ed558aaefde21c4803080195&quot; using [[w:SHA-1|SHA-1]], and you want a light orange box with a black border, use the following code
:{&lt;nowiki/&gt;{user committed identity|ef7c4c55a176bd20ed558aaefde21c4803080195|SHA-1|background=#FC9|border=#000}}
to produce
{{user committed identity|ef7c4c55a176bd20ed558aaefde21c4803080195|SHA-1|background=#FC9|border=#000}}

=== Choosing a good secret string ===
# Your secret string should not be easy to guess. ''If your string is easy to guess,'' then the fact that you know the string is not likely to be very persuasive. For example, a string of 'joe' will be less convincing than 'My name is Joe Schmoe, and I can be contacted at: joe@example.com'
# Your secret string should specify enough of your identity that, if the string were revealed, you could unambiguously prove you match that identity. For instance, your secret string could include a telephone number or email address at which you can be reached.
# Try not to choose a secret string that represents your identity that could go completely out of date. So, for instance, it may be bad to choose a string that specifies ''only'' your telephone number as that number might change.
# If you want to change your secret string, do so, but keep track of all your old secret strings. It is best to reveal all of them if you ever want to confirm your identity, as this will establish that you are the same person who used your account from the first moment the committed identity was published.
# Your secret string should not be short. A dedicated attacker could, by brute force, try short strings until they find your secret string, but if your string is longer that attack would be impractical. If your string is 15 characters long, there are around 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; strings of that length, or an [[w:octillion|octillion]] (and that's just counting alphanumeric strings with spaces).
# Your secret string should not only contain an email address, name, or phone number, but should contain hard to guess components. &quot;jsmith@hotmail.com&quot; for example may be vulnerable to both [[w:dictionary attack|dictionary attack]]s and a search of email addresses, enabling attackers to check 'only' those hundred million names against all published hashed identities, which is computationally much easier than trying to identify a randomly chosen string.

=== Getting the hash ===
Be sure to note the ''exact string'' you enter into the form, in case you need to use it later. It is important that this string be both easily remembered exactly by you and hard to guess or find by any intruder - if an intruder knows the secret string, then this scheme is useless and provides no security. One's username is public and trivially guessable; one's password is not a good choice either, as in the event of a compromised account, the password is likely to have been guessed.

On [[w:Unix-like|Unix-like]] operating systems the &lt;code&gt;[[w:md5sum|md5sum]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[w:sha1sum|sha1sum]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sha224sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sha256sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sha384sum&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sha512sum&lt;/code&gt; programs are provided in the [[w:GNU Core Utilities|GNU Core Utilities]]. Windows users may use one of the methods mentioned below; those who have [[w:PowerShell|PowerShell]] installed can generate a hash using the following command. Provide your secret phrase in the location indicated:

&lt;code&gt;[bitconverter]::tostring((new-object security.cryptography.sha512managed).computehash([text.encoding]::utf8.getbytes(&quot;Secret phrase here&quot;))).replace(&quot;-&quot;, &quot;&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

It is recommended that SHA-512 be used, as recent cryptographic research has cast doubt on the long-term security of SHA-1. The template defaults to [[w:SHA-512|SHA-512]] if the hash function parameter is omitted. For security, you should only use locally executed programs, or client-side javascript, to create your hash. Examples of such hash calculators include [http://jssha.sourceforge.net/ jsSHA] and [http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/ HashCalc 2.01].

To verify that you are correctly hashing your secret string, you can try hashing 'My name is Joe Schmoe, and I can be contacted at: joe@example.com' (without the enclosing single-quotes). Your SHA-512 hash should be: b7a84efbbd843545666957384e874c894fdc17f48ced53abd231c2e4d08e45ad10287b1225432e3ed9794c12994ff1e82aecf66a2ded61ad4baf6d8b9c81dab8

== Compromised identities ==

In case your account is compromised, to make use of your committed identity to someone and prove you are the same person who originally controlled the account, give a trusted user the ''exact secret string'' you originally entered into the box. They can then compute the appropriate hash of that same string and verify that it is the same result and that you are who you say you are.

Once you've established your identity, and set up a new account or regained control of the original account, you'll probably want to create a new hash as now someone (possibly multiple someones depending on who and how you told the secret string to) else knows the secret string.

== Weakness ==
This technique of establishing identity by revealing the secret string behind the hash is not inherently attack proof; it increases attacker effort substantially (if the secret string is chosen and handled properly) which is worthwhile, and does so at little effort to the legitimate user. But it is attackable in that anyone can invent their own secret string, hash it, and claim an identity.  

An attacker with access to the account could overwrite the hash with their own one.  They could then say that the previous owner of the account was an attacker who claimed their identity and generated his own hash.

An attacker without access to the account could claim that the current account's owner stole their identity. The attacker could state that they did not publish a hash when they used to own the account, or that they did not register an account and that someone else is using their name.

This weakness does not indicate the [[w:commitment scheme|commitment scheme]] is worthless, because the ''commit phase'' did not apply to all interested parties (the real person and all potential attackers).

The only difference between automatic and manual welcoming is that the human being welcomer may have the page on his or her watchlist. However, if a new user asks for help on his or her own talk page it would appear on RC anyways. Also, I don' think anyone would believe that the welcomers type out the code for {{tl|bigwelcome}} every time, so in a way it is already 'automated'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When the Spanish Civil War ended, the '''Spanish State''' ({{lang|es|'''''Estado Español'''''}}) was created. It was the formal name of Spain from 1939 to 1947 under the authoritarian dictatorship of Francisco Franco and the ''Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS''. In 1947, Spain was reconstituted as a kingdom, which changed the Spanish State into the '''Kingdom of Spain''' ({{lang|es|'''''Reino de España'''''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shneidman |first=Jerome Lee |title=Spain &amp; Franco, 1949-59 |publisher= Facts on File, Inc |year=1973 |page=32 |isbn=0871961806}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Franco was still ''de facto'' in power as an Regent of Spain.

After World War II, Spain was very poor.

14 years after World War II, Spain enjoyed a miracle due to oil, only to be broke more than 10 years after.

With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the King of Spain.

The '''Mapuche''' are the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] inhabitants of Central and Southern [[Chile]] and Southern [[Argentina]]. They were known as '''Araucanians''' (''araucanos'') by the Spaniards. This is now considered pejorative{{Fact|date=September 2008}} by the people and the term Mapuche is the one most often used by people in conversation. Mapuche make up about 4% of the Chilean population,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ine.cl/cd2002/sintesiscensal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who are particularly concentrated in the [[Araucania Region]], while over 60% of Chile's population is believed to possess some Mapuche ancestry.

Contrary to popular belief, the [[Quechua]] word ''awqa'' &quot;rebel, enemy&quot;, is probably not the root of ''araucano'': the latter is more likely derived from the placename ''rag ko'' (Spanish [[Arauco]]) &quot;clayey water&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serindigena.cl/territorios/recursos/biblioteca/monografias/lenguas/monografia_lenguas_mapuche2.htm ''Mapuche o Araucano''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://escuela.med.puc.cl/publ/ArsMedica/ArsMedica4/08Zuniga.html ''Antecedentes históricos del pueblo araucano''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mapuche had an economy based on agriculture; their social organisation consisted of extended families, under the direction of a &quot;[[lonco|lonko]]&quot; or chief, although in times of war they would unite in larger groupings and elect a [[toqui]] (from Mapudungun ''toki'' &quot;axe, axe-bearer&quot;) to lead them.

The Mapuche are a wide-ranging ethnicity composed of various groups which shared a common social, religious and economic structure, as well as a common linguistic heritage.  Their influence extended between the [[Aconcagua River]] and [[Chiloé Island]] and later eastward to the Argentine pampa.  The Mapuche (note that Mapuche can refer to the whole group of [[Picunche]]s (people of the north), Huilliches and [[Moluche|Moluche or Nguluche]] from [[Araucanía]] or exclusively to the Moluche or Nguluche from Araucanía) inhabited the valleys between the [[Itata River|Itata]] and [[Toltén]] Rivers, as well as the [[Huilliche]] (people of the South), the [[Cunco]]s.  In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Mapuches expanded eastward into the Andes and pampas forming with the existing people the [[Poya (tribe)|Poya]]s and [[Pehuenche]].  At about the same time ethnic groups of the pampa regions, the [[Puelche]], [[Ranquel]]es and northern [[Aonikenk]], called [[Patagons]] by [[Ferdinand Magellan]], known now as [[Tehuelche]], made contact with Mapuche groups, adopting their language and some culture (in what came to be called the [[Araucanization]]). 

== History ==
===Origin===
[[Image:MapvsInc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Huamán Poma de Ayala's picture about the confrontation between the Mapuches (left) and the [[Incas]] (right)]]
[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Picture of Mapuches during a [[malón]] raid]]
The origin of the Mapuche is not clear. The Mapuche language [[Mapudungun]], has been classified by some authorities as being related to the [[Penutian languages]] of North America. Others group it among the Andean languages &lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 1987, Key 1978&lt;/ref&gt;, and yet others postulate an Araucanian-[[Mayan]] relationship &lt;ref&gt;Stark 1970, Hamp 1971&lt;/ref&gt;; Croese (1989, 1991) has advanced the hypothesis that it is related to [[Arawak]]. Recent [[DNA]] analysis has found that Mapuche pre-Columbian [[Araucana]] chicken came from [[Polynesia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uv.cl/noti_videos/textos_detalle.php?codigo=716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibam.cl/noticias.asp?id=6478][http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/rapanui/mapuche.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/070604-chickens_2.html Polynesians - And Their Chickens - Arrived in Americas Before Columbus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  suggesting contact between the Mapuche and Polynesia. One of the earliest sites of human occupation in the Americas, [[Monte Verde]], lies within what was later to become [[Huilliche]] territory, although there is currently no demonstrated link between the Monte Verde people and the Mapuche.

===War of Arauco===
{{main|Arauco War}}
The Mapuche successfully resisted many attempts by the [[Inca Empire]] to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organisation. They fought against the [[Sapa Inca]] [[Tupac Yupanqui]] and his army. The result of the bloody three day  confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]].  They fell back to the north behind the [[Rapel River|Rapel]] and [[Cachapoal River]]s where they established a fortified border guarded by fortresses like [[Pucará de La Compañía]] and the [[Pucará del Cerro La Muralla]]. 

After the successful subjugation of the Picunche in the [[Conquest of Chile]] the [[Moluche]] of the area the Spanish called [[Araucania]] fought against the Spaniards for over 300 years. Initial conquests of land by Spain in the late 16th century were repelled by the Mapuche, so effectively that there were areas to which Europeans did not return until late in the 19th century. One of the main geographical boundaries was the [[Bío-Bío River]], which the Mapuche used as a natural barrier to Spanish and Chilean incursion. The 300 years were not uniformly a period of hostility, but often allowed substantial [[trade]] and interchange between Mapuche and Spaniards or Chileans. Nevertheless, the long Mapuche resistance has become primarily known as the [[Arauco War|War of Arauco]], and its early phase was immortalized in [[Alonso de Ercilla]]'s epic poem ''[[La Araucana]]''. 

From the mid 17th century the Mapuches and the governors of Chile made a series of treaties in order to end the hostilities.  By the late eighteenth century many Mapuche [[lonco]]s had accepted the ''[[de jure]]'' soverignity of the Spanish king of their lands while having a ''[[de facto]]'' independence.

When Chile revolted from the Spanish crown, some Mapuche chiefs sided with the royalists of [[Vicente Benavides]]. The aid of the Mapuches were vital to the Spanish since the had lost the control of all cities and ports north of [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]]. Mapuches valued the treaties done with Spanish authorities, however most regarded the matter with indifference and took adventage of both sides. After Chile's independence from Spain, the Mapuche coexisted and traded with their neighbours, who prudently remained north of the Bío-Bío River, although clashes occurred frequently.

===Occupation of the Araucanía===
[[Image:OcupArau.JPG|thumb|right|300px| [[Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez]] in meeting with the main [[lonco]]s of Araucania in [[1869]]]]
{{main|Occupation of the Araucanía}}
Chilean population pressures increased on the Mapuche borders, and by the 1880s Chile extended both to the north and to the south of the Mapuche heartlands. Further, Chile in the 1880s, as a result of its preparation for and its victory in the [[War of the Pacific]] against [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], found itself with a large standing army and a relatively modern arsenal for the period. Finally, in the mid- to late-1880s, partially on the pretext of crushing a French adventurer, [[Orelie-Antoine de Tounens]], who had declared himself '''King of Araucania''', Chile overwhelmed the Mapuche in the course of the so-called &quot;[[pacification of the Araucanía]]&quot;. 

[[Image:Mapuche engraving.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vintage engraving of Mapuche]]

Using a combination of force and diplomacy, Chile's government obliged some Mapuche leaders to sign a treaty absorbing the Araucanian territories into Chile. The immediate impact of the war was widespread [[starvation]] and [[disease]]. It has been claimed that the Mapuche population dropped from a total of half a million to 25,000 within a generation&lt;ref&gt;Ward Churchill, ''A Little Matter of Genocide'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt;, though the latter figure has been called an exaggeration by several authorities. In the post-conquest period, however, there 
was internment of a significant percentage of the Mapuche, the wholesale destruction of the Mapuche herding, agricultural and trading economies, the wholesale looting of Mapuche property (real and personal - including a large amount of silver [[jewelry]] to replenish the Chilean national coffers), and the creation and institutionalization of a system of reserves called [[Indian Reductions|''reducciones'']] along lines similar to North American reservation systems. Subsequent generations of Mapuche live in extreme poverty as a direct result of being conquered and expropriated.

===Recent history===
Mapuche descendants now live across southern [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]; some maintain their traditions and continue living from agriculture, but a growing majority have migrated to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Chile's [[Araucanía|region IX]] continues to have a rural population made up of approximately 80%; there are also substantial Mapuche populations in regions [[Los Lagos Region|X]], [[Bío-Bío Region|VIII]], and [[Maule Region|VII]].  

In recent years, there has been an attempt by the Chilean government to redress some of the inequities of the past, by, for example, validating the Mapudungun language and culture by including them in the curriculum of elementary schools around [[Temuco]]. Nevertheless, land disputes and violent interactions do continue in some Mapuche areas, particularly in the northern sections of the IX region between and around Traiguén and Lumaco - where a history of conflict continues into the present.

Representatives from Mapuche organisations joined the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation]] (UNPO) seeking recognition and protection for their cultural and land rights.

Though Japanese and Swiss interests are active in the region that Chileans call &quot;Araucanía&quot; and the Mapuche call &quot;Ngulu Mapu&quot;, both of the main forestry companies are Chilean-owned. On land the Mapuche claim is theirs, the firms have planted hundreds of thousands of acres with Monterey pine and eucalyptus trees, species that are not native to the region and that consume large amounts of water and fertilizer.

Chilean exports of wood to the United States, almost all of which come from this southern region, are about $600 million a year and rising. Though an international campaign led by the conservation group Forest Ethics resulted in the Home Depot chain and other leading wood importers agreeing to revise their purchasing policies, to &quot;provide for the protection of native forests in Chile,&quot; some Mapuche leaders were not satisfied.

In an effort to defuse tensions, a special government body, the Commission for Historical Truth and New Treatment, issued a report in 2003 calling for drastic changes in Chile's treatment of its indigenous people, more than 80 percent of whom are Mapuche. The recommendations included the formal recognition of political and &quot;territorial&quot; rights for aboriginal peoples, as well as efforts to promote their cultural identity. 

In recent years, Mapuche activists have been prosecuted under counter-terrorism legislation originally introduced by the military dictatorship, under [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]. The law allows prosecutors to withhold evidence from the defense for up to six months, and to conceal the identity of witnesses, who may give evidence in court behind screens. There are several violent activist groups, which utilize various tactics, including the destruction of private property, including, but not limited to, the burning of structures and pastures. Protesters from Mapuche communities have engaged in these tactics against multinational forestry corporations [http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/antialone.html?page=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20051111/pags/20051111124708.html] and private individuals, all of which possess and occupy territories originally owned by Mapuche communities.

== Culture ==
[[Image:Flag of the Mapuches.svg|thumb|right|250px|Flag of the Mapuche]]
According to genetic studies, most Chilean Mapuche possess some non-aboriginal ancestry, and over 60% of Chile's non-aboriginal population possess [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry, in varying degrees, although until recently very few Chileans would admit their Native American admixture. There were 604,349 Mapuche according to the census of 2002, making up approximately 4% of the Chilean population, while an estimated 300,000 living in Argentina. Due to the loss of their lands, many Mapuche now live in impoverished conditions in large cities such as [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. ''See also: [[Demographics of Chile]]''. Mapuche resistance continues, especially against the large [[forestry]] companies exploiting traditional lands. [[Pinochet]]-era anti-[[terrorism]] laws have frequently been used in recent years against certain community leaders and Mapuche political activists. 

At the time of the arrival of Europeans, the Mapuche were capable of sufficiently organizing themselves to create a network of forts and complex defensive buildings but also ceremonial constructions such as some [[mound]]s recently discovered near Purén.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dillehay, Tom]], ''[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521872621&amp;ss=fro Monuments, Empires, and Resistance: The Araucanian Polity and Ritual Narratives]'' (Cambridge University Press, Washington, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly adopted [[iron]] [[metal-working]] (they already worked [[copper]]&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Mariño de Lobera, in '''Crónica del Reino de Chile''', Cap. XXXI and XXXIII mentions copper points on the Mapuche pikes in the [[Battle of Andalien]] and [[Battle of Penco]]. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru from around the beginning of the first millennium AD. Possibly Mapuche copper metal working was learned from the prior interaction with the [[Inca Empire]] or prior Peruvian cultures or was a native craft (copper being common in Chile).&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[horseback-riding]] and the use of [[cavalry]] in war from the [[Spaniards]], along with the cultivation of [[wheat]] and [[sheep]]. In the long 300 year coexistence between the Spanish colonies and the relatively well-delineated autonomous Mapuche regions, the Mapuche also developed a strong tradition of trading with the Spanish/Chileans. It is this which lies at the heart of the Mapuche silver-working tradition, for it was from the large and widely-dispersed quantity of Spanish and Chilean silver coins that the Mapuche wrought their elaborate jewelry, head bands, etc. 

===Mapuche languages===
{{Main|Mapudungun}}

Mapuche languages are spoken in Chile and to a smaller extent in Argentina. They have two branches: [[Huillice language|Huilliche]] and [[Mapudungun]]. Although not related, there is some discernible lexical influence from [[Quechua]]. It is estimated that only about 200,000 full-fluency speakers remain in Chile, and the language still receives only token support in the educational system. In recent years it has started to be taught in rural schools of [[Bío-Bío Region|Bio-Bio]], [[Araucanía Region|Araucanía]] and [[Los Lagos Region|Los Lagos]] Regions.

===Mythology and beliefs===
{{Main|Mapuche mythology}}

Central to Mapuche [[belief]]  is the role of the ''[[Machi (Shaman)|machi]]'' &quot;shaman&quot;. It is usually filled by a woman, following an apprenticeship with an older Machi, and has many of the characteristics typical of [[shaman]]s. The machi performs ceremonies for curing diseases, warding off evil, influencing weather, harvests, social interactions and dreamwork. Machis often have extensive knowledge of Chilean [[medicinal herbs]], though as biodiversity in the Chilean countryside has declined due to commercial agriculture and forestry, the dissemination of such knowledge has also declined but is in revival. Machis also have an extensive knowledge of sacred stones and the sacred animals.

A book by [[investigative journalist]] [[Patrick Tierney]], ''The Highest Altar: Unveiling the Mystery of Human Sacrifice'' (1989) ISBN 9780140139747 , documents a possible modern ritual human sacrifice during the devastating [[1960 Valdivia earthquake| earthquake and tsunami of 1960]] by a machi of the Mapuche in the [[Budi Lake| Lago Budi]] community. The victim, 5 year old José Luis Painecur, had his arms and legs removed by Juan Pañán and Juan José Paincur(the victims grandfather), and was stuck into the sand of the beach like a stake. The waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]] then carried the body out to sea. The sacrifice was rumored to be at the behest of local machi, Juana Namuncurá Añen. The 2 men were charged with the crime and confessed, but later recanted. They were released after 2 years. A judge ruled that those involved in these events had &quot;acted without free will, driven by an irresistible natural force of ancestral tradition.&quot; The story is also mentioned in a Time Magazine article from that year, although with much less detail.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869529,00.html] 

The most important beliefs of the Mapuche are expressed in the tale [[Trentren Vilu y Caicai Vilu]], and manifest in the [[Ngen]] and [[Pillan]] spirits, the [[Kalku]] and [[Wekufe]] (evil/illness) spirits, the [[Chonchon]], the [[Piguchen|Piuchen]], the [[Nguruvilu]], and the Calchona.

An equally important part of Mapuche belief and society is the remembered history of independence and resistance from 1540 (Spanish and then Chileans) and of the treaty with the Chilean government in the 1870s. In that perception, it is important to include not exclude Mapuches in the Chilean culture. Having said that, memories, stories, and beliefs, often very local and particularized, are a significant part of the Mapuche traditional culture. To varying degrees, this history of resistance continues to this day amongst the Mapuche, though at the same time a large majority in Chile would also strongly include themselves as Chilean similarly to a large majority in Argentina including themselves as Argentines.

The territory of [[Chile]] has been populated since at least 12,000 BCE. In the 16th century the Spanish [[conquistador]]s began to subdue and colonize the region of present-day Chile, and the territory became a colony from 1540 to 1818, when it gained independence from Spain. Chile's economic development was successively marked by the export of first agricultural produce, then [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] and later [[copper]] until the 1980s. The wealth of raw materials led to an economic upturn, but also led to dependency, and even wars with neighboring states. The country was governed during most of its first 150 years of independent life by different forms of restricted democracy, where the electorate was carefully vetted and controlled by an elite.

The [[Chile under Pinochet|17-year military-led government]] was marked by severe human-rights violations and deep market-oriented economic reforms. In 1988, Chile made a peaceful [[Chilean transition to democracy|transition to democracy]]. 

==Early history==
About 12,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] settled in the fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present day Chile. Pre-Hispanic Chile was home to over a dozen different Amerindian societies. The current prevalent theories are that the initial arrival of humans to the continent took place either along the Pacific coast southwards in a rather rapid expansion long preceding the [[Clovis culture]], or even trans-Pacific migration. These theories are backed by findings in the [[Monte Verde]] archaeological site, which predates the Clovis site by thousands of years. Specific early human settlement sites from the very early human habitation in Chile include the [[Cueva del Milodon]] and the [[Pali Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]]&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite book |title=Pali Aike |last=Hogan |first=C. Michael |authorlink= |coauthors=Andy Burnham ed. |year=2008 |publisher=Megalithic Portal |location= |language= |isbn= |chapter= |page= |pages= |quote= |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18657}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Tulor Settlement Chile.jpg|thumb|200px|left|&quot;Tulor&quot; settlement near [[San Pedro de Atacama]], a Pre-Columbian [[Atacameño]] culture (800 BE - 1100 BC).]]
Despite such diversity, it is possible to classify the indigenous people into three major cultural groups: the northern people, who developed rich handicrafts and were influenced by [[Cultural periods of Peru|pre-Incan cultures]]; the Araucanian culture, who inhabited the area between the river [[Choapa River|Choapa]] and the island of [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]], and lived primarily off agriculture; and the Patagonian culture, composed of various nomadic tribes, who supported themselves through fishing and hunting (and who in Pacific/Pacific Coast immigration scenario would be descended partly from the most ancient settlers). 

No elaborate, centralized, sedentary civilization reigned supreme.&lt;ref name=Mapuches&gt;{{cite book |title= Historia del pueblo mapuche: (siglo XIX y XX)
 |last=Bengoa |first=Jose |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher= |location= |language= Spanish |isbn= 9789562822329|chapter= |page= |pages= |quote= |url= http://books.google.com/?id=k_E3aAiunm8C&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Mapuche+y+su+forma+de+gobierno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Araucanians, a fragmented society of hunters, gatherers, and farmers, constituted the largest native American group in Chile. A mobile people who engaged in trade and warfare with other indigenous groups, they lived in scattered family clusters and small villages. Although the Araucanians had no written language, they did use a common tongue. Those in what became central Chile were more settled and more likely to use irrigation. Those in the south combined slash-and-burn agriculture with hunting. Of the three Araucanian groups, the one that mounted the fiercest resistance to the attempts at seizure of their territory were the [[Mapuche]], meaning &quot;people of the land.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mapuches&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Urville-Araucanians.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Mapuche]] were the original inhabitants of central and southern Chile.]]
The [[Inca Empire]] briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, where they collected tribute from small groups of fishermen and oasis farmers but were not able to establish a strong cultural presence in the area&lt;ref name=Chile&gt;{{cite book |title=Chile |last=Minnis |first=Natalie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Langenscheidt Publishing Group |location= |language= |isbn=9812348905, 9789812348906 |chapter= |page= |pages=381 |quote= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=inca+did+not+conquer+araucanians}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As the Spaniards would after them, the Incas encountered fierce resistance and so were unable to exert control in the south. During their attempts at conquest in 1460 and again in 1491, the Incas established forts in the Central Valley of Chile, but they could not colonize the region. The [[Mapuche]] fought against the Sapa [[Tupac Inca Yupanqui]] (AD 1471-93)&lt;ref name=Garcilaso&gt;{{cite book |title=Comentarios reales |last=De la Vega |first=Garcilaso |authorlink=Inca Garcilaso de la Vega |coauthors= |year=1616 |publisher= |location= |language=Spanish |isbn= |chapter=Segunda Parte: Libro VII Cap. 18, 19 &amp; 20 |page= |pages= |quote= |url=http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Comentarios_reales}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1981.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, which subsequently became the boundary between the Incan empire and the Mapuche lands until the arrival of the Spaniards.

Scholars speculate that the total Araucanian population may have numbered 1 million at most when the Spaniards arrived in the 1530s; a century of European conquest and disease reduced that number by at least half. During the conquest, the Araucanians quickly added horses and European weaponry to their arsenal of clubs and bows and arrows. They became adept at raiding Spanish settlements and, albeit in declining numbers, managed to hold off the Spaniards and their descendants until the late nineteenth century. The Araucanians' valor inspired the Chileans to mythologize them as the nation's first national heroes, a status that did nothing, however, to elevate the wretched living standard of their descendants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mapuches&quot; /&gt;

==Spanish conquest and colony==
[[Image:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pedro de Valdivia]]]]
The first European to sight Chilean territory was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who crossed the [[Strait of Magellan]] on November 1, 1520. However, the title of discoverer of Chile is usually assigned to [[Diego de Almagro]]. Almagro was [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s partner, and he received the Southern area.('''Nueva Toledo'''). He organized an expedition that brought him to central Chile in 1537, but he found little of value to compare with the gold and silver of the Incas in Peru. Left with the impression that the inhabitants of the area were poor, he returned to Peru, later to die in a Civil War.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

After this initial excursion there was little interest from colonial authorities in further exploring modern-day Chile. However, [[Pedro de Valdivia]], captain of the army, realizing the potential for expanding the Spanish empire southward, asked Pizarro's permission to invade and conquer the southern lands. With a couple of hundred men, he subdued the local inhabitants and founded the city of Santiago de Nueva Extremadura, now [[Santiago de Chile]], on February 12, 1541&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Carta a sus apoderados en la corte |last=Valdivia |first=Pedro de |authorlink=Pedro de Valdivia |coauthors= |date=October 15, 1550 |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |quote=...y llegado al valle de Copiapó, lo que trabajé en hacer la guerra a los naturales e fuertes que les rompí y la guerra que hice por todos los valles adelante, hasta que llegué al valle de Mapocho, que es cien leguas de Copiapó, e fundé la cibdad de Sanctiago del Nuevo Extremo, a los veinte e cuatro de hebrero del año de mill quinientos e cuarenta e uno, formando Cabildo, Justicia e Regimiento. |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12593842001258285209068/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although Valdivia found little gold in Chile he could see the agricultural richness of the land. He continued his explorations of the region west of the Andes and founded over a dozen towns and established the first [[encomienda]]s. The greatest resistance to Spanish rule came from the [[Mapuche]] culture, who opposed European conquest and colonization until the 1880s; this resistance is known as the [[Arauco War]]. Valdivia died at the [[Battle of Tucapel]], defeated by [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]], a young Mapuche ''[[toqui]]'' (war chief), but the European conquest was well underway. The Spaniards never subjugated the Mapuche territories; various attempts at conquest, both by military and peaceful means, failed. The Great Uprising of 1598 swept all Spanish presence south of the [[Bío-Bío River]] except Chiloé (and Valdivia which was decades later reestablished as a fort), and the great river became the frontier line between Mapuche lands and the Spanish realm.
North of that line cities grew up slowly, and Chilean lands eventually became an important source of food for the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].

Valdivia became the first governor of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]]. In that post, he obeyed the viceroy of Peru and, through him, the King of Spain and his bureaucracy. Responsible to the governor, town councils known as [[Cabildo (council)|''Cabildo'']] administered local municipalities, the most important of which was Santiago, which was the seat of a Royal Appeals Court ({{lang-es|Real Audiencia}}) from 1609 until the end of colonial rule.

Chile was the least wealthy realm of the Spanish Crown for most of its colonial history. Only in the 18th century did a steady economic and demographic growth begin, an effect of the reforms by Spain's [[Bourbon Spain|Bourbon dynasty]] and a more stable situation along the frontier.

==Independence (1810-1826)==
[[Image:ohiggins.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]]]]
The drive for independence from Spain was precipitated by usurpation of the Spanish throne by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. The Chilean War of Independence was part of the larger [[Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish American independence movement]], and it was far from having unanimous support among Chileans, who became divided between independentists and royalists. What started as an elitist political movement against their colonial master, finally ended as a full-fledged civil war between pro-Independence [[Criollo people|Criollos]] who sought political and economic independence from Spain and [[royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] Criollos, who supported the continued allegiance to and permanence within the [[Spanish Empire]] of the [[Captaincy General of Chile|Kingdom of Chile]]. The struggle for independence was a war within the upper class, although the majority of troops on both sides consisted of conscripted mestizos and native Americans.

The beginning of the Independence movement is traditionally dated as September 18, 1810 when a national junta was established to govern Chile in the name of the deposed king [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]. Depending on what terms one uses to define the end, the movement extended until 1821 (when the Spanish were expelled from mainland Chile) or 1826 (when the last Spanish troops surrendered and [[Chiloé]] was incorporated to the Chilean republic). The independence process is normally divided into three stages: ''Patria Vieja'', ''Reconquista'', and ''Patria Nueva''. 

Chile's first experiment with self-government, the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; (''old republic'', 1810–14), was led by [[José Miguel Carrera]], an aristocrat then in his mid-twenties. The military-educated Carrera was a heavy-handed ruler who aroused widespread opposition. Another of the earliest advocates of full independence, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], captained a rival faction that plunged the Criollos into civil war. For him and for certain other members of the Chilean elite, the initiative for temporary self-rule quickly escalated into a campaign for permanent independence, although other Criollos remained loyal to Spain. Among those favoring independence, conservatives fought with liberals over the degree to which French revolutionary ideas would be incorporated into the movement. After several efforts, Spanish troops from Peru took advantage of the internecine strife to reconquer Chile in 1814, when they reasserted control by winning the [[Battle of Rancagua]] on October 12. O'Higgins, Carrera and many of the Chilean rebels escaped to Argentina.

The second period was characterized by the Spanish attempts to reimpose arbitrary rule during the period known as the ''[[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]]'' of 1814-17 (&quot;Reconquest&quot;: the term echoes the ''[[Reconquista]]'' in which the Christian kingdoms retook Iberia from the Muslims). During this period, the harsh rule of the Spanish loyalists, who punished suspected rebels, drove more and more Chileans into the insurrectionary camp. More members of the Chilean elite were becoming convinced of the necessity of full independence, regardless of who sat on the throne of Spain. As the leader of guerrilla raids against the Spaniards, [[Manuel Rodríguez]] became a national symbol of resistance.

[[Image:Battle of Chacabuco.jpg|thumb|250px|Chilean and Argentinean troops going to the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] (February 12, 1817) lead by [[José de San Martín]].]]
In exile in Argentina, O'Higgins joined forces with [[José de San Martín]]. Their combined army freed Chile with a daring assault over the Andes in 1817, defeating the Spaniards at the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] on February 12 and marking the beginning of the ''Patria Nueva''. San Martín considered the liberation of Chile a strategic stepping-stone to the emancipation of Peru, which he saw as the key to hemispheric victory over the Spanish. Chile won its formal independence when San Martín defeated the last large Spanish force on Chilean soil at the [[Battle of Maipú]] on April 5, 1818. San Martín then led his Argentine and Chilean followers north to liberate Peru; and fighting continued in Chile's southern provinces, the bastion of the royalists, until 1826.

A [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] was officially issued by Chile on February 12, 1818 and formally recognized by Spain in 1840, when full diplomatic relations were established.

==Republican period==
===Constitutional organization (1818-1833)===
From 1817 to 1823, Bernardo O'Higgins ruled Chile as [[supreme director]]. He won plaudits for defeating royalists and founding schools, but civil strife continued. O'Higgins alienated liberals and provincials with his authoritarianism, conservatives and the church with his anticlericalism, and landowners with his proposed reforms of the land tenure system. His attempt to devise a constitution in 1818 that would legitimize his government failed, as did his effort to generate stable funding for the new administration. O'Higgins's dictatorial behavior aroused resistance in the provinces. This growing discontent was reflected in the continuing opposition of partisans of [[José Miguel Carrera|Carrera]], who was executed by the Argentine regime in Mendoza in 1821, like his two brothers were three years earlier.

Although opposed by many liberals, O'Higgins angered the Roman Catholic Church with his liberal beliefs. He maintained Catholicism's status as the official state religion but tried to curb the church's political powers and to encourage religious tolerance as a means of attracting Protestant immigrants and traders. Like the church, the landed aristocracy felt threatened by O'Higgins, resenting his attempts to eliminate noble titles and, more important, to eliminate entailed estates.

O'Higgins's opponents also disapproved of his diversion of Chilean resources to aid San Martín's liberation of Peru. O'Higgins insisted on supporting that campaign because he realized that Chilean independence would not be secure until the Spaniards were routed from the Andean core of the empire. However, amid mounting discontent, troops from the northern and southern provinces forced O'Higgins to resign. Embittered, O'Higgins departed for Peru, where he died in 1842.

After O'Higgins went into exile in 1823, civil conflict continued, focusing mainly on the issues of anticlericalism and regionalism. Presidents and constitutions rose and fell quickly in the 1820s. The civil struggle's harmful effects on the economy, and particularly on exports, prompted conservatives to seize national control in 1830.

In the minds of most members of the Chilean elite, the bloodshed and chaos of the late 1820s were attributable to the shortcomings of liberalism and federalism, which had been dominant over conservatism for most of the period. The abolition of slavery in 1823—long before most other countries in the Americas—was considered one of the liberals' few lasting achievements. One liberal leader from the south, [[Ramón Freire]], rode in and out of the presidency several times (1823–27, 1828, 1829, 1830) but could not sustain his authority. From May 1827 to September 1831, with the exception of brief interventions by Freire, the presidency was occupied by [[Francisco Antonio Pinto]], Freire's former vice president. In August 1828, Pinto's first year in office, Chile abandoned its short-lived federalist system for a unitary form of government, with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches. By adopting a moderately liberal constitution in 1828, Pinto alienated both the federalists and the liberal factions. He also angered the old aristocracy by abolishing estates inherited by primogeniture (mayorazgo) and caused a public uproar with his anticlericalism. After the defeat of his liberal army at the Battle of Lircay on April 17, 1830, Freire, like O'Higgins, went into exile in Peru.

===Conservative Era (1830-1861)===
[[Image:DiegoPortales.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Diego Portales]].]]
Although never president, [[Diego Portales]] dominated Chilean politics from the cabinet and behind the scenes from 1830 to 1837. He installed the &quot;autocratic republic&quot;, which centralized authority in the national government. His political program enjoyed support from merchants, large landowners, foreign capitalists, the church, and the military. Political and economic stability reinforced each other, as Portales encouraged economic growth through free trade and put government finances in order.

Portales was an agnostic who said that he believed in the clergy but not in God. He realized the importance of the Roman Catholic Church as a bastion of loyalty, legitimacy, social control, and stability, as had been the case in the colonial period. He repealed Liberal reforms that had threatened church privileges and properties.

Portales brought the military under civilian control by rewarding loyal generals, cashiering troublemakers, and promoting a victorious war against the [[Peru-Bolivia Confederation]] (1836–39). After defeating Peru and Bolivia, Chile dominated the Pacific Coast of South America. The victory over its neighbors gave Chile and its new political system a psychological boost. Chileans experienced a surge of national enthusiasm and cohesion behind a regime accepted as legitimate and efficacious.

Portales also achieved his objectives by wielding dictatorial powers, censoring the press, and [[electoral fraud|manipulating elections]]. For the next forty years, Chile's armed forces would be distracted from meddling in politics by skirmishes and defensive operations on the [[La Frontera, Chile|southern frontier]], although some units got embroiled in domestic conflicts in [[Revolution of 1851|1851]] and 1859.

The &quot;Portalian State&quot; was institutionalized by the [[Chilean Constitution of 1833]]. One of the most durable charters ever devised in Latin America, the Portalian constitution lasted until 1925. The constitution concentrated authority in the national government, more precisely, in the hands of the president, who was elected by a tiny minority. The chief executive could serve two consecutive five-year terms and then pick a successor. Although the Congress had significant budgetary powers, it was overshadowed by the president, who appointed provincial officials. The constitution also created an independent judiciary, guaranteed inheritance of estates by primogeniture, and installed Catholicism as the state religion. In short, it established an autocratic system under a republican veneer.

The first Portalian president was General [[Joaquín Prieto]], who served two terms (1831–36, 1836–41). President Prieto had four main accomplishments: implementation of the 1833 constitution, stabilization of government finances, defeat of provincial challenges to central authority, and victory over the Peru-Bolivia Confederation. During the presidencies of Prieto and his two successors, Chile modernized through the construction of ports, railroads, and telegraph lines, some built by United States entrepreneur William Wheelwright. These innovations facilitated the export-import trade as well as domestic commerce.

Prieto and his adviser, Portales, feared the efforts of Bolivian general [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]] to unite with Peru against Chile. These qualms exacerbated animosities toward Peru dating from the colonial period, now intensified by disputes over customs duties and loans. Chile also wanted to become the dominant South American military and commercial power along the Pacific. Portales got Congress to declare war on Peru in 1836.

===Liberal era (1861-1891)===
The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDoS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Sinking_of_the_Esmeralda_during_the_battle_of_Iquique.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Battle of Iquique]] - the sinking of the Esmeralda (21 May 1879).]]
Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by persistently suppressing the [[Mapuche]] during the [[Occupation of the Araucanía]]. In 1881, it signed a treaty with [[Argentina]] confirming Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]], but conceding all of oriental [[Patagonia]], and a considerable fraction of the territory it had during colonial times. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] (1879–1883), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third and acquired valuable [[nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.

In the 1870s, the church influence started to diminish slightly with the passing of several laws that took some old roles of the church into the State's hands such as the registry of births and marriages. 

[[Image:JoseManuelBalmaceda.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[José Manuel Balmaceda]]]]
In 1886, [[José Manuel Balmaceda]] was elected president. His economic policies visibly changed the existing liberal policies. He began to violate the [[constitution]] and slowly began to establish a dictatorship. Congress decided to depose Balmaceda, who refused to step down. [[Jorge Montt]], among others, directed an armed conflict against Balmaceda, which soon extended into the [[Chilean Civil War]] of 1891. Defeated, Balmaceda fled to Argentina's embassy, where he committed suicide. Jorge Montt became the new president.

==Parliamentary republic (1891-1925)==
The so-called Parliamentary Republic was not a true parliamentary system, in which the chief executive is elected by the legislature. It was, however, an unusual regime in presidentialist Latin America, for Congress really did overshadow the rather ceremonial office of the president and exerted authority over the chief executive's cabinet appointees. In turn, Congress was dominated by the landed elites. This was the heyday of classic political and economic liberalism.

For many decades thereafter, historians derided the Parliamentary Republic as a quarrel-prone system that merely distributed spoils and clung to its laissez-faire policy while national problems mounted.&lt;ref name=&quot;country-data.com&quot;&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2410.html&lt;/ref&gt; The characterization is epitomized by an observation made by President [[Ramón Barros Luco]] (1910–15), reputedly made in reference to labor unrest: &quot;There are only two kinds of problems: those that solve themselves and those that can't be solved.&quot; At the mercy of Congress, cabinets came and went frequently, although there was more stability and continuity in public administration than some historians have suggested. Chile also temporary resolved its border disputes with Argentina with the [[Puna de Atacama Lawsuit]] of 1899, the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] and the [[1902 General Treaty of Arbitration]]. 

Political authority ran from local electoral bosses in the provinces through the congressional and executive branches, which reciprocated with payoffs from taxes on nitrate sales. Congressmen often won election by bribing voters in this clientelistic and corrupt system. Many politicians relied on intimidated or loyal peasant voters in the countryside, even though the population was becoming increasingly urban. The lackluster presidents and ineffectual administrations of the period did little to respond to the country's dependence on volatile nitrate exports, spiraling inflation, and massive urbanization.&lt;ref name=&quot;country-data.com&quot;/&gt;

In recent years, however, particularly when the authoritarian regime of Augusto Pinochet is taken into consideration, some scholars have reevaluated the Parliamentary Republic of 1891-1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;country-data.com&quot;/&gt; Without denying its shortcomings, they have lauded its democratic stability. They have also hailed its control of the armed forces, it respect for civil liberties, its expansion of suffrage and participation, and its gradual admission of new contenders, especially reformers, to the political arena. In particular, two young parties grew in importance - the Democrat Party, with roots among artisans and urban workers, and the [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]], representing urban middle sectors and provincial elites. By the early twentieth century, both parties were winning increasing numbers of seats in Congress. The more leftist members of the Democrat Party became involved in the leadership of labor unions and broke off to launch the [[Communist Party of Chile|Socialist Workers' Party]] ({{lang-es|Partido Obrero Socialista}} - POS) in 1912. The founder of the POS and its best-known leader, [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], also founded the [[Communist Party of Chile]] ({{lang-es|Partido Comunista de Chile}} - PCCh) in 1922.

==Presidential republic (1925-1973)==
[[File:Arturo Alessandi Palma 2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Arturo Alessandri Palma]].]]
By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]]. Alessandri appealed to those who believed the social question should be addressed, to those worried by the decline in nitrate exports during World War I, and to those weary of presidents dominated by Congress. Promising &quot;evolution to avoid revolution&quot;, he pioneered a new campaign style of appealing directly to the masses with florid oratory and charisma. After winning a seat in the Senate representing the mining north in 1915, he earned the sobriquet &quot;Lion of Tarapacá.&quot; As a dissident Liberal running for the presidency, Alessandri attracted support from the more reformist Radicals and Democrats and formed the so-called Liberal Alliance. He received strong backing from the middle and working classes as well as from the provincial elites. Students and intellectuals also rallied to his banner. At the same time, he reassured the landowners that social reforms would be limited to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2412.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alessandri soon discovered that his efforts to lead would be blocked by the conservative Congress. Like Balmaceda, he infuriated the legislators by going over their heads to appeal to the voters in the congressional elections of 1924. His reform legislation was finally rammed through Congress under pressure from younger military officers, who were sick of the neglect of the armed forces, political infighting, social unrest, and galloping inflation. whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress.

A double military coup set off a period of great political instability that lasted until 1932. First military right-wingers opposing Alessandri seized power in September 1924, and then reformers in favor of the ousted president took charge in January 1925. The ''[[Saber noise]]'' (ruido de sables) incident of September 1924, provoked by discontent of young officers, mostly lieutenants from middle and working classes, lead to the establishment of the [[September Junta]] led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] and the exile of Alessandri.  However, fears of a conservative restoration in progressive sectors of the army led to [[1925 Chilean coup d'état|another coup in January]], which ended with the establishment of the [[January Junta]] as interim government while waiting for Alessandri's return. The latter group was led by two colonels, [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]] and [[Marmaduke Grove]]. They returned Alessandri to the presidency that March and enacted his promised reforms by decree. The latter re-assumed power in March, and a [[Chilean Constitution of 1925|new Constitution]] encapsulating his proposed reforms was ratified in a plebiscite in September 1925. The new constitution gave increased powers to the presidency. Alessandri broke with the [[classical liberalism]]'s policies of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' by creating a [[Chilean Central Bank|Central Bank]] and imposing a [[revenue tax]]. However, social discontents were also crushed, leading to the [[Marusia massacre]] in March 1925 followed by the [[La Coruña massacre]].

The longest lasting of the ten governments between 1924 and 1932 was that of General Carlos Ibáñez, who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a ''de facto'' dictatorship. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. 

The [[Seguro Obrero Massacre]] took place on September 5, 1938, in the midst of a heated three-way election campaign between the ultraconservative [[Gustavo Ross Santa María]], the radical [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]]'s [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]], and the newly-formed Popular Alliance candidate, [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]]. The [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] supported Ibáñez's candidacy, which had been announced on September 4. In order to preempt Ross's victory, the National Socialists mounted a [[coup d'état]] that was intended to take down the rightwing government of [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]] and place Ibáñez in power.

During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez to office for another 6 years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez in 1958.

The [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan &quot;Revolution in Liberty&quot;, the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had accomplished many noteworthy objectives, but he had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.

==Collapse of democracy==
[[File:Allende supporters.jpg|thumb|250px|Marchers for [[Salvador Allende]].]]
In the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 presidential election]], Senator [[Salvador Allende|Salvador Allende Gossens]] won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest. He was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] physician and member of Chile's [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]], who headed the &quot;[[Popular Unity]]&quot; (UP or &quot;Unidad Popular&quot;) coalition of the Socialist, Communist, Radical, and Social-Democratic Parties, along with dissident Christian Democrats, the [[Popular Unitary Action Movement]] (MAPU), and the Independent Popular Action. Allende had two main competitors in the election — [[Radomiro Tomic]], representing the incumbent Christian Democratic party, who ran a left-wing campaign with much the same theme as Allende's, and the right-wing former president [[Jorge Alessandri]]. In the end, Allende received a plurality of the votes cast, getting 36% of the vote against Alessandri's 34% and Tomic's 27%. 

Despite pressure from the government of the United States,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20001113/|title=Chile: 16,000 Secret Documents Declassified|year=2000|publisher=Chile Documentation Project, The National Security Archive|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]], keeping with tradition, conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president [[Jorge Alessandri]]. This procedure had previously been a near-formality, yet became quite fraught in 1970. After assurances of legality on Allende's part, the murder of the Army Commander-in-Chief, General [[René Schneider]] and Frei's refusal to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende - on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers' party and could not make common cause with the oligarchs - Allende was chosen by a vote of 153 to 35. 

The Popular Unity platform included the nationalization of U.S. interests in Chile's major [[copper]] mines, the advancement of workers' rights, implementation of [[land reform]], reorganization of the national economy into socialized, mixed, and private sectors, a foreign policy of &quot;international solidarity&quot; and national independence and a new institutional order (the &quot;people's state&quot; or &quot;poder popular&quot;), including the institution of a unicameral congress. Immediately after the election, the United States expressed its disapproval and raised a number of economic sanctions against Chile.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; In addition, the [[CIA]]'s website reports that the agency aided three different Chilean opposition groups during that time period and &quot;sought to instigate a coup to prevent Allende from taking office&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; The action plans to prevent Allende from coming to power were known as Track I and [[Project FUBELT|Track II]].&lt;ref name=Kornbluh&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kornbluh |first=Peter |date=1998-10-25 |title=The Chile Coup -- The U.S. Hand |journal=If Magazine |url=http://globalresearch.ca/articles/KOR309A.html |accessdate=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, indigenous and peasant forces across the country violently started to take control of agricultural lands, forcibly fulfilling Allende's land redistribution promises. 

In the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Economics Minister [[Pedro Vuskovic]]'s [[Vuskovic plan|expansive monetary policy]] were unambiguously favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, which had the effect of increasing consumer spending and redistributing income downward. Joint public-private [[public works]] projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was [[nationalization|nationalized]]. Many enterprises within the copper, [[coal]], [[iron]], [[nitrate]], and [[steel]] industries were [[expropriation|expropriated]], nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and [[unemployment]] fell during the administration's first year. However, these results were not sustainable and in 1972 the Chilean ''escudo'' had runaway [[inflation]] of 140%. An [[economic depression]] that had begun in 1967 peaked in 1972, exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing led to the rise of [[black market]]s in rice, beans, sugar, and flour, and a &quot;disappearance&quot; of such basic commodities from supermarket shelves&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glamorama.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_178048856_151840537,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a result, the [[Richard Nixon]] administration [[United States intervention in Chile|organized and inserted secret operatives]] in Chile, in order to quickly destabilize Allende's government.&lt;ref name=Kornbluh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch01-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch27-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch05-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Nixon gave instructions to make the Chilean economy scream,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and international financial pressure restricted economic credit to Chile. Simultaneously, the [[CIA]] funded opposition media, politicians, and organizations, helping to accelerate a campaign of domestic destabilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/chile/doc/hinchey.html]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1972, the economic progress of Allende's first year had been reversed, and the economy was in crisis. Political polarization increased, and large mobilizations of both pro- and anti-government groups became frequent, often leading to clashes.

By 1973, Chilean society had grown highly polarized, between strong opponents and equally strong supporters of Salvador Allende and his government. Military actions and movements, separate from the civilian authority, began to manifest in the countryside. A failed military [[coup d'état|coup]] was attempted against Allende in June 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp|title=CIA Activities in Chile|date=September 18, 2000|publisher=Hinchey Report|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In its &quot;[[Wikisource:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Agreement]]&quot;, on August 22, 1973, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile]] asserted that Chilean democracy had broken down and called for &quot;redirecting government activity&quot;, to restore constitutional rule. Less than a month later, on September 11, 1973, the Chilean military deposed Allende, who apparently [[Death of Salvador Allende|shot himself in the head]] to avoid capture&lt;ref name=Kornbluh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allende&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=164983&amp;tabla=notas |title=Admite hija de Allende suicidio de su padre |date=August 17, 2003|publisher=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|location=Mexico City, Mexico |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Palacio de La Moneda|Presidential Palace]] was surrounded and bombed. Subsequently, rather than restore governmental authority to the civilian legislature, [[Augusto Pinochet]] exploited his role as Commander of the Army to [[Chilean coup of 1973|seize total power]] and to establish himself at the head of a [[Military dictatorship|junta]].

After the coup, Chileans witnessed a large-scale repression, which started as soon as October 1973, with at least 70 persons murdered by the [[Caravan of Death]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/07/chile-high-court-allows-pinochet.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/63821.stm] Pinochet's rule: Repression and economic success&lt;/ref&gt; The four-man junta headed by General Augusto Pinochet abolished [[civil liberties]], dissolved the national congress, banned union activities, prohibited strikes and collective bargaining, and erased the Allende administration's agrarian and economic reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/radical_history_review/v085/85.1zarate.pdf] Terrorism and Political Violence during the Pinochet Years: Chile, 1973-1989&lt;/ref&gt; The junta jailed, tortured, and executed thousands of Chileans. According to the [[Rettig Report|Rettig commission]] and the [[Valech Report]], close to 3,200 were executed or &quot;disappeared&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1109861.stm |title=Finding Chile's disappeared |date=10 January 2001|publisher=[[BBC News]]|location=London, UK | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and at least 29,000 imprisoned and tortured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/solotexto/articulo.html?xref=20081203elpepudep_19&amp;type=Tes |title=El campo de concentración de Pinochet cumple 70 años|date=12 April 2009|publisher=[[El País]]|location=Madrid, Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the Latin American Institute on Mental Health and Human Rights (ILAS), &quot;situations of extreme trauma&quot; affected about 200,000 persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chipsites.com/derechos/dictadura_victimas_eng.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/42a/132.html]&lt;/ref&gt;; this figure includes individuals killed, tortured or exiled, and their immediate families. 

[[Image:GDP per capita LA-Chile.png‎|thumb|right|250px|Chilean (blue) and average Latin American (orange) [[GDP per capita]] (1950-2007).]]

The junta embarked on a radical program of [[liberalization]] and [[privatization]], slashing [[tariff]]s as well as government welfare programs and [[deficit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://crs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/17/2/57&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Chile was in shambles - [[inflation]] was hundreds of percents, the country had no [[foreign reserves]], and [[Depression (economics)|GDP was falling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brauchle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecaef.org/klex/user/1/41894820_10_10.ppt|title=Applied Theory: The Reforms in Chile|author=Manfred Bräuchle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to halt the ongoing economic collapse, [[Miracle of Chile|economic reforms]] were drafted by a group of technocrats known as the [[Chicago Boys]] because many of them had been trained or influenced by [[University of Chicago]] professors. The first reforms were implemented in three rounds - 1974-1983, 1985, and 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;brauchle&quot;/&gt;

After the economic crisis of 1982, [[Hernan Buchi]] became Minister of Finance from 1985 to 1989.  He allowed the peso to float and reinstated restrictions on the movement of capital in and out of the country. He introduced banking legislation, simplified and reduced the corporate tax. Chile pressed ahead with privatizations, including public utilities plus the re-privatization of companies that had returned to the government during the 1982–1983 crisis. Under these new policies, the rate of inflation dropped from about 1,000% per year to about 10% per year. While this was still a high rate of inflation, it allowed the economy to start recovering. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent. Chile developed a good export economy, including the export of fruits and vegetables to the northern hemisphere when they were out of season, and commanded high prices.

An important initiative begun in 1981 and carried on until today, aimed at modernizing the use of [[Information and Communication technology]], greatly contributed to disentangle the traditional bureaucratic and cumbersome clerical procedures in all dealings with branches of the government, from [[civil registry]] to import/export documentation, thereby fostering a more agile economy and a more efficient [[public administration]].

The military junta began to change during the late 1970s. Due to problems with Pinochet, Leigh was expelled from the junta in 1978 and replaced by General [[Fernando Matthei]]. Due to the [[Caso Degollados]] (&quot;slit throats case&quot;), in which three [[Chilean Communist Party|Communist party]] members were assassinated, [[César Mendoza]], member of the junta since 1973 and representants of the [[Carabineros de Chile|carabineros]], resigned in 1985 and was replaced by [[Rodolfo Stange]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The next year, [[Carmen Gloria Quintana]] was burnt alive in what became known as the [[Burnt Alive case|Caso Quemado]] (&quot;Burnt Alive case&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}}http://www.cidh.oas.org/annualrep/87.88sp/Chile9755.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems with Argentina coming from the 19th century reached a high in 1978, with disagreements over the Beagle Canal. The two countries agreed to papal mediation over the canal. Chilean-Argentine relations remained bad, however, and Chile helped Britain during the [[Falklands War]].

Chile's [[Constitution of Chile|constitution]] was approved in a national plebiscite held in September 1980. It came into force in March 1981. It established that in 1988 there would be another plebiscite in which the voters would accept or reject a single candidate proposed by the Military Junta. Pinochet was, as expected, the candidate proposed, and he was denied a second 8 year term by 54.5% of the vote.

==Return to democracy==
Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a two-chamber congress on December 14, 1989. Christian Democrat [[Patricio Aylwin]], the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertación]]'', received an absolute majority of votes (55%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DD1E3BF935A25751C1A96F948260|title=Man in the News: Patricio Aylwin; A Moderate Leads Chile|work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=2008-05-02 | first=Shirley | last=Christian | date=December 16, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;. President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period. In February 1991 Aylwin created the [[National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation]], which released in February 1991 the [[Rettig Report]] on human rights violations committed during the military rule. This report counted 2,279 cases of &quot;[[forced disappearance|disappearances]]&quot; which could be proved and registered. Of course, the very nature of &quot;disappearances&quot; made such investigations very difficult. The same problem arose, several years later, with the [[Valech Report]], released in 2004 and which counted almost 30,000 victims of [[torture]], among testimonies from 35,000 persons.

[[File:Edo.Frei.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]].]]
In December 1993, Christian Democrat [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], the son of previous president [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], led the Concertación coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-8257609.html|title=Chile elects new leader Late president's son wins big|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Frei Ruiz-Tagle was succeeded in 2000 by Socialist [[Ricardo Lagos]], who won the presidency in an unprecedented [[runoff election]] against [[Joaquín Lavín]] of the rightist [[Alliance for Chile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/americas/01/17/chile.elex.01/|title=Moderate socialist Lagos wins Chilean presidential election|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=January 16, 2000| accessdate=2008-05-02}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by a very tight score of less than 200,000 votes (51,32%).

In 1998, [[Augusto Pinochet]] traveled to London for back surgery. But under orders of Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]], he was [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial|arrested there]], attracting worldwide attention, not only because of the past history of Chile and South America, but also because this was one of the first arrest of a former president based on the [[universal jurisdiction]] principle. Pinochet tried to defend himself by referring to the [[State Immunity Act of 1978]], an argument rejected by the British justice. However, [[Home Secretary|UK Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] took the responsibility to release him on medical grounds, and refused to extradite him to Spain. Thereafter, Pinochet returned to Chile in March 2000. Upon descending the plane on his wheelchair, he stood up and saluted the cheering crowd of supporters, including an army band playing his favorite military march tunes, which was awaiting him at the airport in Santiago. President [[Ricardo Lagos]] later commented that the retired general's televised arrival had damaged the image of Chile, while thousands demonstrated against him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/665342.stm|title=Thousands march against Pinochet|date=March 4, 2000|publisher=[[BBC News]]|location=London, UK|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:26042007g00010 Bachelet.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Michelle Bachelet]].]]
The ''Concertación'' coalition has continued to dominate Chilean politics for last two decades. In January 2006 Chileans elected their first woman president, [[Michelle Bachelet]], of the Socialist Party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10819903/|title=Chile elects first woman president|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She was sworn in on March 11, 2006, extending the ''Concertación'' coalition governance for another four years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/11/AR2006031101381.html|title=Bachelet Sworn In As Chile's President|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2008-05-02 | first=Monte | last=Reel | date=March 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2002 Chile signed an association agreement with the [[European Union]] (comprising FTA, political and cultural agreements), in 2003, an extensive free trade agreement with the United States, and in 2004 with [[South Korea]], expecting a boom in import and export of local produce and becoming a regional trade-hub. Continuing the coalition's free-trade strategy, in August 2006 President Bachelet promulgated a [[free trade agreement]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] (signed under the previous administration of Ricardo Lagos), the first Chinese free-trade agreement with a Latin American nation; similar deals with Japan and India were promulgated in August 2007. In October 2006, Bachelet promulgated a multilateral trade deal with New Zealand, [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]], the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] (P4), also signed under Lagos' presidency. Regionally, she has signed bilateral free-trade agreements with [[Panama]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]].

After 52 years, Chile is now heading in a new direction.  Over half of the registered voting population of Chile has opted for a change away from center-left politics by electing a right-wing candidate, [[Sebastián Piñera]], during the [[Chilean presidential election, 2009–2010]]; although Pinochet was considered right-wing and was affirmed in the 1980 election. Piñera is also Chile's first billionaire to be elected.''&lt;ref&gt;PBS Newshour [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2010/01/radical-change-in-chile-with-new-right-wing-president.html Chile Elects First Right-Wing President in 52 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;'' The new president has voiced a desire for a government of national unity, and promises to move his coalition to the center, away from the political polarization that has plagued Chilean politics and society since the coup d'état of 1973. Piñera will also inheret a $16 billions USD surplus attained by Chile while copper prices were high.''&lt;ref&gt;The Economist [http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15330886 Piñera promises a gallop]&lt;/ref&gt;''

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter I: Metroland====

The housing developments that lined the Metropolitan Railway line, from Wembley to Harrow... and on to Northwood Hills, started at the behest of the government’s call: to give work to the unemployed building workers, stimulate the national economy, provide new homes for the white collar workers of London, and house the new industrial workers manufacturing the latest home gadgets and electrical tools. Mostly the inhabitants were: young, optimistic, forward thinking and well educated. These were people starting out in life, ready to make a go of it! It was a period, just after the arts and crafts movement; a utilitarian, mass produced construction style, for the masses.There were no factories in such dormitory towns, no large offices, or distribution centres. Most of the men, and the few women, who were working, were white collar workers. The majority of outer London citizens voted Conservative - who was in office. This was the time of Baldwin’s Second Ministry. Two years later, in 1928, women achieved the vote – were enfranchised, at the age of twenty-one.

The General Election in May 1929, brought Ramsey MacDonald, and the Labour Party, into office. Their main programme was to sort out the unemployment problems – to return the nation to work. Their majority was small. MacDonald called on the Liberals to help. They were influenced by the economist thinking of Keynes who advised a massive programme of public works inline with the thinking of the Labour Minister, Oswald Moseley, and the party back benchers. This solution was eminently sensible but was rejected by the cabinet. Sixteen weeks later the Stock Market Crash occurred in New York which, coming on top of Britain’s already critical industrial scene, was immediate and devastating. It is unnecessary to describe how the government and the nation considered this event. By 1930 there were two and a half million unemployed. It did not stop there! In Germany the banking system collapsed. There was a run on the pound. The cabinet would not agree to cuts in spending or in reducing the unemployment benefit.

There was no unemployment… the majority of women stayed at home - looking after the house, and children. No child went to school without shoes or socks; there were no soup kitchens or riots, pickets or disturbances. It was calm and tranquil, clean and bright. The town had a full range of shops, and one cinema. There wasn’t a theatre, factory, office block or car park in sight. The policeman walked his beat; the road sweeper swept the leaves into the gutters – the colourful piles defying the wind. A time when the rag-and-bone-man sang his call… the milkman, coalman, and baker, delivered by horse and cart, and the onion seller, knife grinder and scrap-iron merchant circled the roads, shouting their wares.

Outside many of the houses a coachwork pram is parked with a fringed canopy, its charge asleep, inside – it is outside the front-door, catching the morning sun - creating a shadow on the ground. The frill of the stretched sun-shade flutters gently. Leading off, down the tiled front path, the bow topped gate swings on its hinges. Not a sound disturbs the sleeping youngster… all is at peace. The mother is inside the house preparing a meal feeling secure and content. The picture is complete.

From many sources it has been declared, ‘a time of depression’ - coming from a lowering of workers wages. This industrial slump, or sharp decline, had, as its source, The First World War. Britain lost its position as the worlds leading economy in the late thirties - just before that war. The depression was all that was needed to cast Britain down… to finally lose out to the other main European economies, forty years later - in the 1970s. 

In May 1929, a General Election gave Labour 287 seats, while the Conservatives had 260. Baldwin resigned, and MacDonald took office again. This Labour government needed the support of the Liberals, for on its own it lacked power to affect change - limited radical thinking. Later that year, the Stock Market Crash in New York, saw the beginning of The American Depression which had a knock-on effect to Britain. The main effect was felt in the north where most of Britain’s heavy industry is located. The opposition parties demanded further cuts including the public sector workers wages, putting a brake on government projects. What further hurt the poor was a cut ordered in the payment of unemployment benefits. MacDonald appointed four Ministers – Thomas, Lansbury, Johnston, and Mosley. This special body of politicians had the specific task to deal with the problem of unemployment.

The period from the General Strike in 1926, when the union leaders fully appreciated the political implications of their industrial action wouldn’t lead anywhere, till today, has seen the integration of the unions into all processes of government. State assistance to particular industries integrated the Government into both what the managements and unions wanted. This was necessary with the beginnings of rearmament and ultimately war. The General Strike set the momentum of the unions back, losing half a million members from the congress.

The Government feared complete industrial and social dislocation, which seemed inevitable. There were thousands of trained officers and men in civilian life and a sufficiency of army transport; this body of people would save the country from disaster. The Territorial Army was a considerable force. Plans were made to stock food and petrol. Reliable men drove Underground trains, buses and used their private cars as taxis. The trade unions had been given through the media convincing proof that this was going on, and that the rest of the country was not prepared to see chaos. Arrangements were made for the Territorial Army to act as Auxiliary Police, and even be paid a subsidiary allowance. They had little to do for the strike soon over. However, the trades union were left in no doubt of the effective use which could be made of the Territorial Force.

After WWI the troops returned home – most to return to their previous jobs. As they did so, the women who had been doing some of those jobs were dispensed with – pushing them aside to find work in domestic service, the retail trade, and the clothing industry. Britain had to change from war production to peacetime using worn out machine tools and inappropriate production lines. It was an impossible task; there was no chance of amassing sufficient capital - from a depleted order book, to reach a pre-war investment position. The government was advised by The Bank of England to make the pound the same value as the pre-war dollar, nearly five dollars to the pound –convertible to its value in gold. The result made British exports more expensive, reduced demand, cut productivity and naturally, increased unemployment.

The country already had a large number of unemployed, mainly in the north; employers knew they could replace discontented workers, they also knew they could lower the price of their goods if they reduced wages… which they did! The workers were already paid very little objected to a further reduction. The Trades Union Council called for a General Strike, to support the miners who were already on strike against wage cuts and longer hours. Although it was called a general strike it was only for key workers: in transport, iron and steel, building, printing and electricity. Naturally enough this had the effect of shutting down most union controlled businesses for want of power. Even though the strike was over quickly the effects of this, on top of returning the pound to the Gold Standard was that the country stayed in recession…

Cartage Managers managing the distribution and collection of freight, from main line stations, organized their managers, office workers, and sympathetic university students to carry on moving the freight. When possible they loaded and drove a team of horses, in company with others, all through the strike period. The Transport and General Workers Union’s finances were in a dire straight. Not only was the union losing members but those that were members were not paying their membership fees. This was in keeping with my father’s record, who also drove horse wagons, tractors, and vans to help break the strike. 

When looking at Government Figures of central government spending, to give some sort of overview indicating hard times, and times of plenty, the conclusions can only be an approximation. However, what figures one can research do give an expected graph – the national debt in 1920 was gradually reduced, to rise to the same point twenty-four years later –showing a uniform curve. Thereafter, the rise maintained. What we are interested in are the figures for the end of our period and what they were preparing us for. Over the thirties the government department showing the greatest rise is Social Services. This includes health, welfare and education. That department drops back to allow Military Defence to outstrip all others, peaking out in 1943/4. The drop continues… to an expected result. 

Arguments in the Labour party, including some ministers, split the government. Stock market investors took fright withdrawing their money… destabilizing the economy. The upset, caused by the social welfare cuts, broke up the government. Instead of resigning MacDonald accepted a commission from the King to form a so-called ‘National’ Government, dominated by Tories – particularly by, the Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain. The Labour party objected to this coalition, abandoning MacDonald and his supporters. The weak political strength of the government contributed towards the call for a General Election… the result was a landslide victory for the Tories. The National Party continued in power, still lead by MacDonald, whose efforts - put into restoring national confidence in the government and nation, came to naught… The Liberals withdrew support. The Government started to inject some effort into rearmament which caused a split in the Government ranks. The Party was prepared to provide greater rearmament but only if they had support from the League of Nations. The crisis came over sanctions against Mussolini for invading Abyssinia. Lansbury resigned and Attlee elected Leader of the Labour Party, took his place.

At the start of this period, just before 1930, the country’s unemployment figures rose to one and a quarter million. This figure gradually increased adding a further million; a year later, the figure rose to almost a million a year after that. 1933 was unemployment’s peak, when there were four men for every three jobs. Forty per cent of the unemployed were to be found in coal-mining, iron and steel, shipbuilding, and textiles. After that peak, there was a decline until the 1930. From there, the figures climbed back - to those of the peak, six years later. All these industries were mainly found in the North, Wales and Scotland. The South of England and in the southeast - particularly southern city and town suburbs, the population fared considerably better. Chamberlain forced down interest rates which kicked off the house-building boom. Great Britain started to emerge from the Great Depression…
The budget of 1931 instituted a new round of cuts in public spending and wages, including the pay of the Navy. There was a Naval Mutiny, which created renewed pressure on the pound. The Government abandoned the gold standard. That had an immediate effect of easing pressure – it was a practical decision - allowing exports to compete with prices abroad – that lead the way to an eventual recovery… Gradually employment picked up. Britain was again competitive. 

It is clear that in some parts of the country, and some sections of society, The General Strike and The Years of Depression did not unduly affect some communities. For instance: Middlesex, and particularly Harrow, felt little from the effects of the depression…, perhaps you might included all the Home Counties. To a degree they were cushioned by: the construction of new towns and the production of the necessary materials, and components parts including: the manufacturing of furniture, soft furnishings, kitchen, and household equipment, which had to keep pace. All these commodities continued to flourish stimulated by the low interest rates. There was a demand too: for new electrical gadgets and communication equipment, and as in any new towns it is the furnishing of the baby’s bedroom and the provision of its clothes that has first demand on excess cash. The production of cars, and lorries, also reached an all time high, as did the need for the latest farming equipment.

The Government nationalized London Transport, creating the London Passenger Transport Board - to control buses and trains. This was not the only measure to influence the upturn; the Government started the Marketing Boards which guaranteed farm prices. Later that year, MacDonald resigned, replaced by Baldwin. The governments of both Baldwin [1935-7] and Chamberlain [1937 - 40] were in reality conservative administrations. It is recorded, in a number of books, that the early period [1931-1935] was in fact a coalition. There were many, from all parties, who did not want such an alliance. It was the party leaders who formed a National Government, for this is what it was. The technical advances in transport and communication continued to be advanced by consumer demand and factory mass production methods… These mechanical innovations were slowly adopted by the armed services which tried to keep pace with the call for expansion. This rise in demand was slow to start … but continued throughout the period, pushing forward with increasing urgency…

The 1921 – 1931 censuses show a population increase of eleven per cent for Greater London. Beyond London, in the outer northwest suburbs, the increase was even greater – in Harrow it was fifty per cent. It was estimated that during 1919 – 1928 twelve thousand homes had been built within half a mile of the railway track, and that a further seventeen thousand were planned.
In 1929 a large housing development was started in Rayners Lane called Harrow Garden Village. The development included all the services, population amenities, re-built railway station, and Odeon, art-deco cinema. All the property developed during 1929 – 1936 was substantial, using good materials, not scrimping with meagre wood mouldings and sub-standard doors. The designs are still good today, giving space and amenity to a family of five. The lower middle-class were increasingly to be found in the cities and towns suburbs, during the summer months, clipping hedge, mowing the grass verge, reading the newspaper over a cup of tea and perambulating in the park whilst  listen to the band or watching cricket. In the winter, the population listened to the Light Programme, read Coward, Sayers, Christie, Johns and Blyton. The Garden Suburb of North Harrow was grandly advertised as ‘The suburb in the country’, and was fast filling up. By the time my parents occupied a house there the town had been completed. 

In the main, the population making up the new town were young middle aged couples, about to start a family or had young children… people looking ahead - for a new life - not able to find what they were looking for in the old Victorian/Edwardian estates. Some had experienced being unemployed, some had attended the marches into London - to protest about the economic situation, and the lack of jobs, but in the main, they were white collar workers, drawn from the Home Counties, enticed by the property developers slogans.

This page can easily become a coatrack for promotion, with editors showing up who have only that purpose. A common result is that the whole page gets deleted, as the community loses patience with it. That's a shame. Because any on-line book worth its salt would link to resources useful to those studying or learning about a topic. In particular, patients with some disorder or condition can often find invaluable help from, say, organizations devoted to the topic, or discussion groups. Some of these might be commercial in character, that is not one of the crucial criteria that a book publisher would consider. Rather, a responsible publisher will consider usefulness to patients. A publisher might list controversial treatments and places to find out more about them, but would also warn readers about the controversy.

Wikibooks, which means us, should act as a responsible publisher, and resist efforts to, on the one hand, censor information because it is &quot;commercial&quot; or &quot;fringe,&quot; but, on the other hand, to hide the commercial character of a web site, say, or the lack of general acceptance of a treatment modality or practitioner. Looking at history here, I see a single-purpose account that revert warred to keep information about a controversial practitioner out. Supposedly this was libelous. Properly presented, it would not be. And that's our task. I'll be watching here to help with the process. I have no attachment to any position on treatment, I'm purely interested as an editor and reader. I know a person with Rosacea, that's about the extent of my involvement.

To all who edit this book: please do not revert war, i.e., do not repeatedly remove or restore information. It can lead to warnings and blocks if the warnings are ignored. Instead, ''discuss'' the issue on this page, seek consensus with other editors, and refer controversies that cannot be resolved here to the Wikibooks community. Failure to properly take care of this page could easily result in its total removal, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion&amp;oldid=1930016#Rosacea.2FWebsites_and_Organisations permanent link to deletion discussion] (current as of this comment) --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:51, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

I have removed the following sections from the article, as they appear to be promotional as listed, as if they were advertisements, for for other reasons. I ask that they not be restored to the article without consensus, and especially they should not be unilaterally restored by anyone connected with the organization or web site involved. This is not intended as some strict exclusion of these sites, and I may easily err in my judgment, but please discuss, and if facts about the site or material are involved, please provide references. Thanks. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

Please also note: a few possibly questionable web sites were left in. Just a matter of the time needed to look at everything. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:33, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

===Comments on Australian Sciences===
The booklet looks pretty good. It would help to know more about this company and their position in the Rosacea world. This was the least problematic of all the links I removed today. Perhaps the booklet should be linked directly. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

===Comments on New Rosacea Treatment by Dr. Nase: Rosadyn===
This reads like an ad, and there has been revert warring over this. There may also be undue weight given to this source throughout the book, it should be examined. I see that there is a great deal of controversy of this source; there should be consensus for this to be in the book, caution is required. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

==Rosaceans, Rosacea 101, and the Rosacea Diet==
The ''rosaceans'' yahoo group is the fourth largest online rosacea community. The sister site rosaceans.com is a clearinghouse of commercial information for rosacea. Brady Barrows the webmaster of the site is also the author of the books,&quot;Rosacea 101: Includes the Rosacea Diet,&quot; and the ''Rosacea Diet,'' which are availiable to purchase from the sites.

===Comment on Rosaceans, Rosacea 101, and the Rosacea Diet===
Somewhat questionable as promotional. rosacians.com was a dead link. I left the yahoogroup in, created a yahoogroups section, and adding a larger yahoogroup, but deleted the information about &quot;fourth-largest rosacea community&quot; and the other book promotional material. rosacea-diet-users-support-group appears to be run by the same person as the other yahoogroup listed above, and is almost entirely announcements, and nothing recently. rosacea-101 and rosacea-diet.com were dead links. Presumably if there is a bibliography for this book, and if the book is valuable, it would be listed and perhaps reviewed there. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
*Rosaceans.com is now up. However, this site is linked from the yahoogroup home page. By the way, my removal of a site from the page is not a denigration of the site; and that a site is commercial is not automatic grounds for exclusion. But it does mean that caution is required, and especially we should avoid what amount to multiple links to sites which are closely related and which link to each other, unless there are clear grounds for multiple listings (such as an implementation of some categorization system that would review the sites according to specific criteria). --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 18:01, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
*Rosaceans-101 is also up now. This, however, is really just about the book, it appears, and is (probably properly) linked from [[Rosacea/Books]]. Rosacea-diet.com now redirects to rosaceans.com. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 18:19, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

==International Rosacea Foundation==
The International Rosacea Foundation (IRF) is a information website. The Better Business Bureau reliability report on Bass &amp;amp; Boney listed the IRF website as part of Bass &amp;amp; Boney (the makers of Rosacea-LTD III).

===Comment on International Rosacea Foundation===
Some of the material I looked at seemed poorly written. There is no information about the organization there, which is odd. It looks like Brady Barrows (who is the person behind the Rosaceans yahoo group) may be on to something. But the reference is dead, it was on Barrow's Rosaceans.com web site. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:24, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

==Patient's Guide to Rosacea==
The Patient's Guide offers information about treatment of the symptoms of this common skin condition. The most common sign of rosacea is the formation of tiny blood vessels just under the surface of the skin causing facial redness and flushing. These blood vessels are best treated with laser or IPL as these treatments can effectively destroy the blood vessels.

This appears to be an advertising vehicle. Please discuss here if you would like to restore this to the resources, but, please remember, more links are not necessarily better; emphasis should be on the links of highest quality and usefulness, and sites which largely present information that will also be found elsewhere, perhaps more completely, should be deprecated. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 17:41, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

== Merger ==

I propose merging {{bad link|Rosacea/Books}} and {{bad link|Rosacea/Websites and Organisations}} together and renaming the page [[Rosacea/Resources]]. I think there aren't enough links/resources to justify having books, websites, and organizations split across multiple pages at this time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:29, 18 September 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Parashat D’varim - Deuteronomy 1:1 - 3:22
Isaiah 1:1-27; John 15:1-17

The name “Deuteronomy comes from the Greek (Septuagint), and means “second law”.  It is not actually a “second torah” but a repetition and expansion of commentary on the first four books of Torah.  Therefore it is also called the Mishneh Torah, “repetition of the Torah” which clarifies and explains the first four books (Deut17:18).  The first four books of the Torah were dictated to the prophet Moshe, letter by letter, and written down with precision. Thus they became the foundation for the fifth book.  These five books, that are called the Torah of Moshe, are in turn, the foundation for the rest of the Scriptures. The prophetic books that were later added, beginning with Joshua), doesn’t change anything in the foundation, as it is written in Deuteronomy 4:2,   “You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it”.   The Torah of Moshe, therefore, has the highest level of authority among the inspired Scriptures. Not even the Messiah Yeshua himself came to change or add anything to that which Moshe wrote. His words changed nothing of that which was given by the Eternal through Moshe. Yeshua did not come to break, but to give the true meaning and the final explanation to that which his heavenly Father had in his heart when he gave us the commandments through Moshe, as it is written in Matthew 5:17-19

Deuteronomy is in essence, three sermons, one song, and one blessing!  It can be divided into three sections, which correspond with the three books: Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers.  These are:
*1:1 - 5:5            Morals and Admonitions
*5:6 - 27:8           Diverse Laws
*27:9 - 34:12         Blessings and Curses

This section of the torah reading is a look back at what the Israelites have been through to get to the point they were at,  entering the Promised Land.  Moshe tells about all of the places they went through and the commands that Yahweh gave and they followed to get there. The rebellions of the people when first commanded, and the blessings when they followed the commands.  It is largely for the benefit of the younger generation of Israelites who did not have a clear recollection of what went on in Egypt or in the wilderness either because they were too young or because they had not been born yet.  It was a recitation or synopsis of the Torah commands to prepare the younger generation for entering the Promised Land.   Moshe sets this out to make it as plain as possible and simple to understand.  For this reason it has always been popular and quoted from eighty times in the apostles writings and used widely by the Qumran Essenes. 


'''The Legacy of Moshe'''

“These are the words that Moshe spoke”   (d’varim). ...  ‘words’ - ‘d’var’ is one of the strongest roots in Hebrew and is linked to the words ‘desert’ and ‘plague’ which come from the same root.  Here Moshe delivers a sermon containing strong words of rebuke against Israel.  His words link the hardship of the desert to their failure to hear the ‘word’ of Yahweh, delivered through him.  So before he departs he gives them this ‘sermon’ - the entire book of Devarim is a commentary which he expounded before his death as his last will and testament to them, an exhortation for them to remember and to keep them on the path of life, words to live by for every day of their lives.  This was their memo from their leader and instruction manual for the new advent of their future life in the promised land.  

The book is structured in the same manner as the ancient treaties between an overlord and his subjects of that era contracted a covenantal agreement.  It is similar to others that have been found by archaeologists, from the Hittites and other Oriental peoples of the period 1500 - 1300 BCE. This always included a preamble of background and historical information to the setting up of the treaty - stipulations and conditions of the treaty - its blessings and curses dependant upon keeping the covenant - and the finalising recapitulation.  However, contrary to ancient treaties, this was not a law-code but a true covenant between Yahweh and His people, and all of it is based upon His grace and mercy toward His redeemed people who live by faith and love in Him.

With this introduction Moshe begins his recap of the children of Israel’s long arduous journey to the promised land.  He is speaking to those who have grown up in the wilderness who were either not personal witnesses of the manifestation at Sinai or else were under 20 years of age.  As part of this exhortation, he goes back over their sins at the various places to serve as historical lessons and as a future warning.  He does it tactfully to avoid overwhelming them with a sense of embarrassment and condemnation with their failures, but rather seeks to exhort them to believe His Word in future.
As well as Moshe’s departure from them, the Cloud of His Presence will also leave them at the journey’s end, having overseen their flight from Egypt and guided and protected them through the long wilderness journey to the promised land.   Moshe had done his job, he had accomplished the task Yahweh set out before him.  He must have felt a certain sense of accomplishment with the mission completed.


'''Overcoming in the Wilderness'''

Horeb (i.e. Sinai) (means waste) to Kadesh Barnea (meaning set-apart fruitful fields) was but 11-days journey to the edge of the Promised Land (Kadesh Barnea) yet Israel wandered 40 years because of their unbelief. The statement that the journey from Mt. Sinai to Kadesh-Barnea takes only 11 days is a reminder of the price of sin.  An entire generation missed the Promised Land because of their unbelief and bad conduct (disobedience to Yahweh’s commands, lack of trust and faith in Yahweh’s word evidenced by complaining, murmuring and even outright rebellion). 

Being in the desert is never easy but our encouragement comes from the knowledge of who Messiah is and His Word to them was Deut.1:29 ....'Don’t be fearful, don’t be afraid of them, Yahweh your God, who is going ahead of you, will fight on your behalf, just as He accomplished all those things in Egypt before your eyes’.

We need to discern what is holding us back from going forward in our spiritual walk.  What sin, what fear, what wrong beliefs or false religious concepts are we not letting go, that is a hindrance to going on?  It is a time to be serious about serving Yahweh and to repent and go onward and upward in Yeshua!

Many times in our spiritual walk we are just at the point of spiritual breakthrough, but we receive an evil report about the giants of the land and our resolve to go forward melts.  If we could just see what lies ahead of us how much easier it would be to go forward!  Yet Yeshua said, Blessed are those who haven’t seen, yet still believe in Yahweh’s promises (John 20:29).  We need to have what it takes to go on without being deterred by the world, the flesh and the devil.  To go on without being able to see where one is going, takes faith and it gets down to personal and intimate relationship with your Heavenly Father, through Yeshua and being led by his Spirit.  That involves a walk of constantly abiding in Him.   John 15: 1-17

Edom (Esau, brother of Jacob) and Moab and Ammon (sons of Lot) were blood relatives of the Israelites - 2:2-9.  Often those of our own family will stand in our way as we go in to possess our spiritual, God-given inheritance and spiritual destiny.  What is the lesson from this passage of Scripture on how to deal with less than cooperative family members who fail to recognize the calling on your life?  Are we to make war with them?  Are we in anyway to be beholden to or dependent on them for our physical needs? If we became dependent upon them could this help or hinder our chances of entering our Promised Land?  Yahweh desires our families to be saved (Acts 16:31; 2 Peter 3:9)  How then can we be a light to our families if we are fighting and attempting to destroy those who would spiritually stand in our way?

On the other hand, Yahweh instructed the Israelites to make war with and to destroy some of the Canaanites who were not relatives of Israel.  The Believer’s battle to enter into the Promised Land is a spiritual one (2 Cor. 10:3-5 and Eph. 6:10-18).  Who and what are enemies with whom we must constantly do battle and by the power of the Ruach HaKodesh utterly destroy their influence in our lives? (See 1 John 2:15-17; 1 Peter 5:8; James. 5:7 to name a few.)

Yahweh gave victory to the Israelites over King Og and the 60 cities of his kingdom - 3:1-11.  When Yahweh gives us a mandate to encounter the spiritual forces of this world and the devil, nothing must stand in our way.  What are the weapons of our warfare? (1 John 5:4; Luke 9:1: 10:19)  Israel fought with swords and spears to possess a physical kingdom.  We are taking possession of a spiritual kingdom.  The warfare is just as intense, but the weapons are spiritual.  (Eph.6:10-18)   Are you engaging the enemy, or are you in retreat? Those who are not moving forward spiritually will not encounter the enemy.   At the very least, one should be overcoming the flesh.  That is the greatest battle of all _ to put on the mind of Messiah and to be conformed into His image. 


'''The Seven Main Sins of Israel In the Wilderness''' 

In the opening verses there is a list of place names which various Rabbis take as code words for the main sins which Israel had committed during its time in the wilderness (See Artscroll Stone Edition Chumash, p. 939, notes on verse 1).  “Beyond the  Jordan…in the wilderness…in the Arabah…beside Suph…between Paran and Tophel…Laban and Hazeroth and Di-zahab”  (1: 1)  The Israelites had sinned (in  wilderness, provoked him in the Arabah, murmured beside the Yam Suph [Sea of Reeds], spoke with contempt [tophel] about manna [which was white, laban], and in Hazeroth they angered him with a Calf made from gold [dizahab].  These are the seven most outstanding sins which resulted in Israel being condemned to wander the wilderness for 40 years.

We need to be reminded of our sins and challenged to grow and overcome them or else we will wander in a spiritual wilderness never entering into our spiritual inheritance. Let us not become like the Laodiceans of Revelation 3. We are told that they were rich and increased with goods, yet poor, blind, miserable, naked and lukewarm. We must be constantly overcoming and striving against sin.  There is no place for complacency, apathy, lukewarmness or indifference. That is why many of us are searching out the Hebrew roots of our spiritual faith _ the status quo in the Church has not been acceptable. We are called to be overcomers and more than conquerors through Yeshua. There is nothing in Scripture to justify the position of “pew warmer” (see John 16:33; 1 John 5:4; Rev. 2:7, 11, 26; 3:5, 12).

1- '''Wilderness of Sin''' (meaning thorns located near Mt. Sinai): Here Israel complained about lack of food (Exod. 16:1-3)
• No trust or faith in Yahweh.
• Their perspective is skewed by their carnality. If Yahweh had wanted to kill them he could have easily done so at the Red Sea, but rather he miraculously preserved them there. They did not trust the consistency of the character of Yahweh.
• They encountered their first spiritual pothole in the wilderness road and their faith melts.
• They accused Moshe of planning to starve them. How often a faithless and carnal people turn the good intents of selfless and self-sacrificing leadership into evil and malicious intent against them?
• They undervalued their deliverance and wished they had died in Egypt.  Where would we be if Yahweh had not delivered us from our past?  A praiseworthy and thankful heart-attitude will carry us safely through to the other side of many of life’s trials and adversities.  Never take your eyes off of the goodness of Yahweh and focus them on the complaints of the flesh.

2- '''Arabah''' (meaning desert plain, wilderness); a steppe or narrow plain or valley near the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee extending to the Gulf of Aqaba and to the highlands of the east): Here Israel was seduced by Midianite women (Num. 36:13).
• Spiritual and Physical Whoredoms.
• Israel was enticed by the lusts and appetites of the flesh.  Up to this point Israel had resisted many frontal military attacks and would have done so again had King Balak tried this means to overcome Israel.  But the enemies of Israel attacked her (with help from Balaam, the false prophet) through subtlety and seduction.  If the enemy can’t get us one way, he’ll try another!  Lusts of the flesh can be a real snare, especially for men. To wit: Solomon and his wives or Adam with Eve.

3- '''Opposite the Red Sea''': Here Israel complains that they’re going to die _ they manifest sarcasm and cynicism against Elohim in their statement against Moshe: “...because there were no graves in Egypt...?!” (Exod. 14:11)
• Fear, Faithlessness, False Accusation and Malcontentment.
• The straits of their physical circumstances propel them into fear and accusation (i.e. faithlessness) against God and Moshe.  The comforts of slavery, servitude and bondage in Egypt seemed good to them now, though a short time earlier while suffering in Egypt they had cried out to God for deliverance from the very thing to which they now wanted to return.  The fickleness and vicissitudes of human nature!  The grass is always greener on the other side.  Man is never content with his circumstances.

4- '''Between Paran''' (meaning beauty): The spy incident. (Num. 13-14)
• Again, Walking By Sight and Not By Faith.
• Though Moshe had charged them “to be of good courage,” they were not.  Courage springs from strong faith which Caleb and Joshua alone possessed.  They distrusted God’s power and promise.  Unbelief overlooks the greatness, goodness and power of God and focuses on the human plane.  Fear/faithlessness/unbelief magnifies every danger and difficulty and fills the heart with discouragement and hopelessness.  We must resist that within ourselves.

5- '''Tophel''' (meaning calumny, a reference to the false charges or misrepresentation maliciously calculated to damage another’s reputation) and Laban (white, a reference to the color of manna [Ex. 16:34]): There are no places where Israel camped by these names. Rather, the rabbis teach that these names are references to Israel complaining twice about manna (Num. 10:12; 11:6).
• Lust , Ungratefulness and False Accusation -  There is no pleasing a lustful, carnal, faithless and ungrateful heart!
• Manna, God’s supernatural answer to one of Israel’s first complaints itself becomes a source of complaint and contempt. 

6- '''Hazeroth''' (meaning enclosures) _ Korah’s rebellion (Num. 12:1-16)
• Rebellion Against God-Ordained Authority

7- '''Di-zahab''' (meaning gold) _ God blessed Israel with an abundance of gold when they left Egypt and they used his gifts to make the golden calf.
• Riches Lead to Idolatry.
• God’s overabundant blessings can become a snare.  We become “rich and increased with goods having need of nothing” including God, as was the case with the Laodicean church in Revelation 3.

One of the main purposes of Torah community (the local assembly) is to provoke one another to good works (Hebrews 10:24-25).
The purpose of Torah needs to be reiterated again and again! 

The scripture says, “Beware brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; but exhort one another daily, while it is called ‘today’, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  For we become partakers of Messiah, IF we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end,”  Hebrews 3:12-14


'''Passing the Baton'''

As Moshe prepared to speak to the children of Israel one last time on the first day of the month, he would have understood the significance of this new moon day. Certainly it was symbolic of an ending of one chapter in Israel’s history and the beginning of a new era.  Moshe had been through his time of testing and in the end he had completed the task God had laid out for him.  After taking the nation through 40 years of trial, testing, and purifying in what should have been an eleven day journey, Moshe stood with the prize before him. Yet he couldn’t enter the land. One mistake had cost him the opportunity of a lifetime. 

Moshe did everything Yahweh asked of him, he was a man of honor, courage, character, and obedience, yet during a brief episode of anger he disobeyed his Heavenly Father.  Moshe stood in Yahweh’s stead on this earth and in that brief moment of losing control of his emotions and actions he brought great reproach upon Yahweh’s name and reputation.  Moshe failed to sanctify Yahweh in the eyes of the people.  It could appear God was being harsh because of Moshe’ disobedience in striking the rock instead of speaking to it.  Moshe had become frustrated with the continuing complaining of the Children of Israel. In his anger at the people, Moshe allowed his frustration to get the better of him and in lashing out at the rock it would seem he was lashing out at God.  Could it be Moshe’ old frustration in being called to lead Israel was surfacing and while he may have been tired with the attitude of Israel could it possibly be Moshe was really angry at God?  How many times have we been in the same situation as Moshe and in our anger at some supposed situation, we are really expressing our frustration with God because we had expected something to go the way we planned and it did not turn out the way we had hoped.  Any area of our flesh which we allow to remain undealt with, will someday cause us to stumble.

The time had come for Israel to move into the next phase of God’s plan for them and Moshe was not the one to lead them. He was part of Egypt and the many rebellions in the Wilderness. In his own way he had rebelled against God and was doomed to a similar fate of the generation who had come up out of Egypt. Though Joshua had come out of Egypt and had seen what Israel had done in the Wilderness he had his sights set on the goal and did not rebel against God. His faith had seen him through and he would finish the task Moshe had begun.

As a spiritual father Moshe sought to ensure that this new generation would overcome and enter into their inheritance, even though he had not done so himself.  Only Joshua and Caleb of all that first generation had qualified and were going into the land.


'''Taking the Challenge'''

As Israel had refused to obey Yahweh’s command to fight their way into the land almost 40 years earlier, this new generation had already begun the battle by defeating the two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og.  They were enthusiastic, ready to take what was rightfully theirs, they had embraced their inheritance in this land of promise.   

Joshua as Moshe protege had qualified to the leadership and was prepared to take the baton and lead the new generation through.  Joshua was the right hand man of Moshe.  Moshe knew Joshua was worthy to undertake the task set before him, to take them into the land and he successfully fulfilled his commission and by his strong leadership, led Israel to conquer and inherit the land.

Caleb was a man of a different spirit and had wholly followed Yahweh the scriptures tells us (Numbers 14:24).  He was the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite (one of the tribes of Canaan - probably one of the mixed multitude of slaves that came with them from Egypt) but showed more faith than those from a generational heritage of Israeli blood.   Forty-five years later he comes to Joshua and claims the land promised him,  “Now then, give me this hill country about which Yahweh spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that Anakim were there, with great fortified cities; perhaps Yahweh will be with me, and I will drive them out as Yahweh has spoken.’  So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.  Joshua14:6-15).

Caleb received as an inheritance the land that contained the very caves of Machpelah where the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried with Sarah and Rebecca.  What a remarkable testimony of a faithful son of Israel who had been adopted into the family, risen to a prestigious place as one of the princes of Judah, spied out the land, came back with a good report, and then faithfully waited some forty-five years for his inheritance.

Here on the brink of the promised land the two men who had been faithful and brought back a good report are to take the nation into the land and we see the prophetic significance of this, in that these two men representing the tribes of Judah and Ephraim, Ezekiel later prophesies will join together to bring about a united Israel in the events leading up to the establishment of the Kingdom in these last days.  Ezekiel 37:15-28

Some of the areas mentioned by Moshe  -   commentators suggest that the term from the river Euphrates actually means from the western segment of the river in northern Syria.  This area was conquered in David’s time and was under the dominion of Israel through Solomon’s reign and beyond.  The Captorim are the Philistines who migrated from Crete in approx.1200 BC. and settled Gaza.  The area in Ch.3:8 from Arnon to Hermon which belonged to the king of Bashan, is the modern day Golan Heights.   This is more than Israel at present holds, and includes the disputed areas which confirms that Yahweh gave this territory to them.


'''Bringing Forth New Life'''

Even though the people did not follow what they were told and doubted, Yahweh is forgiving.  We are all in the wilderness journeying to the Promised Land.   Every one can look into their past and find times that they doubted or stumbled in some way or other.  Once you get yourself back on the path, blessings continued to flow.  We must trust that Yahweh will go before us, fight for us, and carry us through this wilderness as he did the Israelites.   (1:30,31) 

In John 15:1-10 Yeshua talks about how we are the vine and Yahweh is the Vine-dresser.  He takes care of all of our needs but we need to produce fruits to justify our staying on the vine.  As each person or branch of the vine grows, the whole vine flourishes and grows stronger, able to withstand the storms that come with this world.  ‘I am the real vine and my Father is the gardener’;  -  ‘No greater love has a person who lays down his life for his friends’.   (Vs.1,3)

When we are born again in Messiah, we become the branches of the vine. The vine dresser carefully lifts the branches and places them so that they may grow to his desire.  Those branches that are delinquent or grow incorrectly are removed by the vine dresser.  The process of pruning is painful and often the plant may go into shock.  We need to rest in the fact the vine dresser knows best and that He is pruning us so that we may produce finer fruit.  Yahweh is glorified by our fruit but only after the process of pruning. We need to stay fixed on Him, the source of life, if not the shock of pruning may end in the death of the plant. The basis of remaining in the vine is by obeying His commands (vs.9-10) Only then will be be partaking of the Tree of life, the sap of the Vine.  The commands of which He speaks are those given to Israel - His Father’s commands.

Yeshua’s command to us was, “(v.12) This is my command: that you keep on loving each other just as I have loved you”. Sometimes the depth of our love for one another is stretched and tested but we have to remember we are commanded to love one another as He loved us.  Love bears all things, believes all things, Love never  fails.  1 Corinthians 13

We are no longer slaves we are free men!  By our exodus from slavery in Egypt and by our salvation by the blood of the Lamb from the law of sin that was at work in us, we are free.  This liberation allows us to obey His Word - we are no longer under bondage to sin that we should serve it, but are now ‘servants’ of righteousness.  Romans 6:15-23

We each have a choice everyday of our lives as to whether we are going to be like a Caleb and press on to the mark and not let the giants of our world intimidate us.  Or we can allow people to move us away from doing what the Scriptures obviously tell us and thereby put the Testimony of Yeshua and obedience to the Torah, off into a future time.

Sometimes our greatest enemies are those like Moab and Edom - of the same heritage, but living outside the promises and indulging in fleshly lusts and idolatrous worship.  These things must be overcome before we can gain an entrance into our inheritance, whether they are within ourselves or coming from without - they are positioned before the entrance to the inheritance and will seek to bring us under their dominion either by subtlety as with Moab or by outright  contest as with Edom.

It is each of our choice, whether we receive a “well done good and faithful servant” at the end of the journey or whether He will say “I never knew you”.  The deciding factor will be our relationship - being in the Vine through an observance of His commands. We need to get to know Him Who is life eternal, for He is the Way the Truth and the Life and no one comes to the Father except through Him.  Only in an ongoing relationship of knowing Him are we ‘branches’ for the flow of His divine life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Va’Etchanan - And I Pleaded Deuteronomy3:23-7:11

This section of the torah begins with a reiteration of Moses’ plea to Yahweh to let him cross into the promised land with the children of Israel.  We know that his plea was rejected and Yahweh instead orders him to strengthen Yehoshua and embolden him.  That does not refer to encouraging him with words, but to building up military strength and ensuring that Yehoshua develops a bold and aggressive strategy for taking the land, “for he shall cross over before this kinfolk” leading them into battle.   Moshe has prepared and trained Yehoshua beforehand to assume the leadership,  and is now instructed to pass on the ‘baton’ and equip Yehoshua for the task ahead, of leading Israel in conquering the land.

The overwhelming theme of Va’aetchanan  or “And I Pleaded” is obedience to Yahweh.  In this portion, Moshe reemphasizes the need for the Israelites to obey Yahweh and be blessed, or not obey Him and be cursed.  Certainly, as he writes, Moshe is reminded of his own mistake and urges the Israelites not to disobey, lest they be ejected from the Promised Land.


'''The Re-iteration of the Law'''

What Moses clearly understood in repeating and emphasizing all of these commandments to the children of Israel just before they were to cross into the land, is that Yahweh’s ways are superior to any man-made laws or rules, and he wanted to ensure that his words made a deep impression upon them. Life and authority over wickedness are the very essence of our Father’s Torah.  Yahweh revealed His law to Israel for their benefit and edification. When they followed His ways they were blessed.  When they went their own way, or followed the practices of the nations around them, they were cursed.

We read in Deut. 4:1-2, “And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, is giving you.  You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim which I command you.”

The rest of this section deals with the laws, statues, and ordinances Israel was to abide by once they entered into their promised inheritance.  There are two benefits Israel will reap by doing the statutes and ordinances of Yahweh.  

Firstly they will live.  Remember what Deut. 8:3 says, “.....man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh does man live.”  The very words of our Elohim are life to us.  It’s a promise we see put forth many times in the inspired scriptures.

The second benefit to the Israelites for keeping the words of Yahweh was that they would possess the land He was giving to them.  Israel was going into a land that already had a population of various nations and peoples.  Yahweh promised them that they would be able to drive out these wicked nations if they would follow His words.  The Bible testifies of Israel’s many successes and failures in this regard. 

Moshe counsels them to hearken to the statutes (khuqim) and to the commandments (mishpatim) which I Myself teach you, to do so in order that you shall live, i.e. be quickened to life. ( takhayu, the hiphil, means “your lives shall be restored - enlivened or resurrected) His Words are life-giving to those who live by them and hence the warning not to change them by adding or taking from them.  Moshe puts upon the words which he has delivered to Israel the seal of perfection and prohibits any additions or subtractions from it (4.2) — “Don’t add to the Saying which I myself order (metzaveh)you as a commandment (mitzwah), and don’t diminish from it; but be watchguarding (shomeir) the commandment of Yahweh your God that I Myself order you.” (literal interpretation)   
Not one additional word was to be thereafter legislated nor one word of original Torah thereafter eliminated. Henceforth the adaptation of application to situations of life called “halakhah” was limited to the interpretation of earlier legislations of the Torah as by a Beit Din, the governing body of elders such as the Sanhedrin.  


'''Learning From Experience'''

Finally, in 4:32-39, Moshe summarizes all the great wonders that the nation has witnessed since the Exodus, to encourage them to solidify their belief in God - and properly face the challenges that await them:   “For ask now of the days past... since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?  Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?    Has God ever taken a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm...    “This was shown to you that you should know that Yahweh,    He is God; there is none else beside Him.   Out of heaven He made you hear His voice...   “And because He loved your fathers... he brought you out of Egypt with His presence, with great power... to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day;  Therefore, know this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else.”  (see 4:32-39)

This speech introduces the lengthy speech of laws that will follow in chapter five and Moshe reminds them:  “And you shall keep [God’s] laws and commandments which I  command you this day, that it will be good for you and your children, and so that you may prolong your days upon the land, which Yahweh has given you, for ever.” (see 4:40)


'''The Judgement on Idolatry'''

In the final section of his speech (4:25-40), Moshe warns that should Bnei Yisrael follow other gods, He will exile them for their land:  
“When you shall have children, and children’s children, and be living for along time in the land, and shall deal corruptly, and make a graven image, even the form of any thing....     I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land....    And God will scatter you among the peoples...  And there you shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands...”     (see 4:25-28)  “But from there you will seek Yahweh your God and you will find him if you search for him with all your heart and all your soul” (Deuteronomy 4:29).

Moshe is speaking prophetically here making it quite clear that the covenant will not be broken but in being ‘forsaken’ by Yahweh because of their sin - that their exile could be ‘misunderstood’ by the people that God has left them for ever.  Hence, Moshe must explain in 4:29-31 that no matter how severe their punishment may be, Yisrael will remain forever God’s nation His covenant with them remains eternal as well, and ultimately He will return them to the Promised Land after they come to true repentance.
“Then you will seek Yahweh and find Him, if you search after Him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.  In your distress, when all these things will come, in the end of days, you will return to Yahweh and hearken unto His voice... (see 4:29-31)
“In the latter days you will return to Yahweh your God”  --  

This has yet to have its complete fulfillment.
This is alluding to them coming to full repentance and restoration and fulfilling the Shema -- 
“You shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength (ability).”  (6: 5)
“With all your soul” - This means being willing to give one’s life in love for him and to live only for him.
“With all your ability” - The Hebrew word that is normally translated as “might” is “meodecha”, which does not only mean “your might”, but also “your ability”, “your possessions”, and it comes from the word “meod”, “much”.   This word is not primarily speaking of physical strength, but of all that we are and have, which also includes material possessions. Love for the Eternal is also expressed in the way we administer our material possessions, but love always begins on the inside from our heart and works its way out in all that we do.


'''The Ten Commands'''

In Hebrew tradition, a thing is encompassed by the mere speaking of it.  This is derived from the description that Yahweh spoke things into being.  He said “Let there be ... “ and it was so (Genesis Ch 1).   Hence, it would also be quite correct to render this phrase as the “Ten Matters” that Yahweh ordered as commands (mitzwot) in that these ten “matters” are that which He spoke into being and they are ten entities which He created.  

Yeshua said, “The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life” (John 6:63), Paul also carrying this forward said that the Torah (given at Sinai) is spiritual (Romans 7:14).  These ten words of Yahweh impart life to those who live by them.

The first of the Aseret ha-Dibrot is “You shall have no other gods before Me (al-panai; on/over My Face) (5: 7).  This phrase is an Hebrew idiom meaning “on the surface of.” This phrase implies that physical likenesses of the non-physical Creator are like a mask, “over His Face,” that intervenes between the worshipper and Yahweh.  Since Yahweh is spirit, those who insist on a physical semblance to worship, have only the mask (the image), the only physical thing they can visualize and “focus on” to worship. 

No matter what the worshipper may claim that the physical image “symbolizes,” it is idolatry.  No physical mask can symbolize the non-dimensional Being of Yahweh.  It can only interfere and prevent the worship of the true God.  In 4:12 Moshe said to the people, “Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire.  You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; you only heard a voice.”   The Hebrew word that is translated “form” is “temunah”, which means “picture”, “figure”, “image”, “silhouette”, “impression”. This teaches us that Yahweh does not have a form perceptible to our physical senses.

5.8  - Making a ‘likeness’ -- A 2-dimensional depiction or a picture isn’t equivalent to a “likeness” ( temunah).  Early Judaic practice is that, as long as depictions or pictures weren’t objects of worship, 2-dimensional representations of actual things in the heavens or on earth aren’t prohibited by this passage.  The prohibited images are those that are, or have been, worshipped - but not all pictures, photographs, paintings, sculptures and the like, are idols.

We can ask ourselves some questions to see if we have any other gods in our lives:   Who rules my life?  Who or what is the source of my enjoyment in life?   Who or what do I place my trust in?     What is my passion or interest in life?   Who do I praise?

5.9 — “Who visits the sins...” -- “Visits” is not a good rendering of the Hebrew word ‘poqeid’ (he musters, monitors, audits).  Contrary to the English, this doesn’t imply that sons are punished for the misdemeanors of the fathers.  Rather, it states clearly that, like a concerned Father, Yahweh especially monitors, not “punishes,” sons for the misdemeanors their fathers did.  So it has the sense of Yahweh monitoring the posterity to see that the offspring don’t follow the parent’s example in that trespass.

5:11 — “Do not bear the Name of Yahweh your God vainly, for Yahweh will not cleanse whomever bears His Name vainly.”   “Don’t take the name...,” as if it meant “Don’t cuss using the Name.”  But, although that would be included, that isn’t what the it means!  This has two meanings:

1. swearing by the name of Yahweh was an intrinsic element of testifying in a Beit Din (Elders Council) or today in a court of law - i.e. giving testimony as a witness.

2. doing something in the name of Yahweh entails crediting Yahweh for an action, such as claiming His direction in what you do.  When a “believer” is doing nothing - i.e. not practicing the faith, and he or she bears the Name of Yahweh,  that’s bearing/carrying the Name is for nothing, in vain.  Since one who carries the name is not living/practicing the Word, he isn’t “cleansed,” and therefore forfeits his inheritance in the age to come, unless he repents.  Yahweh’s command “Do not mention My name in vain,” in a sense means “Do not exploit My ‘name’ “ - by religion - as a means of justification for your iniquities.  Do not attempt to cover them up with a veil of righteousness and virtue.  Therefore when people are led to follow the teachings of man, they also are worshipping Him in vain, for their ‘worship’ will have no redemptive value, even if well-intentioned.  For this reason Yeshua strongly condemned those false teachers of His day who were leading the people astray.  Matthew15.9 quoting from Isaiah 29:13

5:12  -  Resting one day a week makes sense to many people, since even a machine needs rest, and how much more so a human body.  Moreover, thanks to the rest period, the person functions better when he works, compensating for any loss caused by the day of rest. While this makes sense, Shabbat was not given to Yahweh’s people as a mere day off.   In the wilderness the Jews did not have to work to earn a livelihood since their food and all basic needs were provided. Nonetheless, at Marah, Yahweh already gave them the commandment of Shabbat before He gave them the totality of His Torah.  There is a twofold purpose for the observance of Shabbat:
1) To remind us that Yahweh created the entire world in six days and rested on the seventh.
2) To remind us that we were freed from Egyptian and spiritual bondage by Yahweh in order to keep His commands.

To keep entails having an attitude of watchfulness, of not doing anything that the Torah forbids for Shabbat. We are watchful not to go over the time with our work and not to begin work before the sun has gone down at the end of the Shabbat.  In this way we can keep the Shabbat and be careful not to profane it.  By this we make sure that it is consecrated, set apart for the exclusive use of Yahweh and occupy ourselves with Him in a special way. 
5:20  --  “And don’t answer your companion with a nothing / vain witness, unreliable testimony”.  This command prohibits falsely claiming “I didn’t see it” to evade one’s responsibility as a witness.  This also involves turning a blind eye to your brother’s sin and failing to correct him out of your love for him.

5:21  -- “and don’t yearn for the wife of your companion. The operative verb here is khamad; he yearned for, longed for, desired, lusted after sexually; (and don’t you long for) the house of your companion.  In this mitzwah, the operative verb is (ivah; he craved, desired, longed for, lusted after).  Here the prohibition is not against admiring something belonging to your companion, but rather, against being obsessed with it and plotting or scheming to get it.
“And these words which I command you this day shall be in your heart.” (5: 6)  -  we are responsible for the Word to be in our heart and therefore the performing of the commands to come forth from our hearts out of love for Yahweh God.


'''Hearing the Word in our Heart'''

Yeshua gave the parable of the Sower in Mark 4:3-20,  and explained it to them with these words  “The farmer sows the word. These are the ones by the road, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them. These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy. They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble. Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. These are those which were sown on the good ground: such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.'&quot;(HNV)

In verse 3, the Messiah says, “Listen!” (shema), which hails from the “Shema” (6: 4-9) and he ends with the words, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear”. He points out the importance of listening, just as Moshe does in the Shema text.
In verse 20, it is written,  “These are those which were sown on the good ground: such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.&quot;(HNV)

The great mystery in the Kingdom is to receive the seed that the farmer sows.  The ground is man, who was once made from the dust of the earth.  Depending on how the seed enters the ground, it will bear fruit.  The great mystery of the Kingdom is to make sure that the Torah enters into the depths of the heart. According to this parable, there are four kinds of people:

1.      Those who are like the road - who are hard around their hearts so that the seed cannot enter. The roads that existed at that time had been made by people walking on them many times. The more people walked on the road, the harder it became. The traditions of men are, therefore, the first hindrance to receiving the seed into the heart. We are used to walking where everyone walks, and we do not want to make the changes that the Torah demands, so satan comes and removes the precious seed.

2.      Those who have rocks - who have a positive, receptive attitude in their minds, but in their innermost being, are obstacles and objections and they are not willing to change its lifestyle. They like to listen and they receive the word with great emotion, but when the moment of truth comes and there is persecution because of the Torah, they pull back since they are only looking for pleasure and do not want to suffer for the sake of the Kingdom.

3.      Those who have thorns - who have heard and obeyed the Torah, but are more interested in the things of this world than the Kingdom. They seek to fulfill their own desires, the cares of this life consume them, rather than the desires of the heavenly Father. With time they loose the zeal for the Kingdom because they are more interested in what will bring short term pleasure than in obeying the commandments, which will produce greater long term pleasure.

4.      Those who are good soil - who hear the Torah and receive it with all of its consequences, with inner conflicts and persecution from the outside. They allow the Torah to penetrate deep into their hearts and adapt their lives according to its teaching, in spite of the pain that comes because of it. They are not temporary, but they last and with time there will be a lovely result because of their faithfulness to the Word that was sown inside of them. They give harvest on three different levels, which shows us that there are three different kinds of people who are faithful to the Kingdom.

In Mark 4:24, it is written, “Take heed what you hear.&quot;(HNV)
The secret of the Kingdom is to put the Torah in our hearts. We can find the same thing in Mark 4:26-28, where it is written,
“He said, ‘The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth, and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn’t know how. For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.&quot;(HNV revised)

When you have succeeded in getting the seed down into your heart, you will have a unique experience.  The seed will bear fruit on its own. You are not the one who must produce fruit in your life; the Torah will produce fruit on its own. Your worry is not whether or not you will bear fruit, but how you will get the seed down into your heart.  The rest will come by itself.

How much fruit do you want in your life? Thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold? 
It depends on the measure of seed you manage to put into your heart, as it is written in Mark 4:24b,
“With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.&quot;(HNV)

How are we to deposit the seeds into our hearts?  The Shema answers this question: “you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.”  (5: 7)   This is instructing us to constantly relate everything in life to the Torah, every minute of every day, from the moment you arise to the moment you go to bed.  The next verse goes on to bind them as a sign upon your hand and between your eyes and on your door-posts.  This is identifying everything we do and everything we are and all our possessions as belonging to Yahweh for all the world to see, i.e. nothing which gives an appearance of evil or unrighteousness.  It involves giving a clear testimony to what we are before the world, labelling ourselves as observant followers of the Most High God, either by fulfilling the commands literally and/or by lifestyle.


'''Wearing Tefillin'''

“You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.” (Deuteronomy 6:8) This statute has been traditionally interpreted as the law of tefillin (phylacteries).   Tefillin consist of small, hollow, black leather boxes that contain several parchments of relevant Scripture verses: Exodus 13:1–10; 13:11–16; Deuteronomy 6:4–9; 11:13–21. The small black boxes are bound on the arm and forehead by means of long, black leather straps, thus literally fulfilling the commandment of binding the Torah on the hand and the forehead.

The Master criticized certain Pharisees for broadening their tefillin, but it should go without saying that the Master Himself wore tefillin.  In the days of the Master, the straps of the tefillin were far less encumbering than the modern version, and they were worn all day long.  During the Hadrianic persecutions in the Second Century CE, Rome outlawed the wearing of tefillin.  During those days, “Many Jews risked their lives in order to wear tefillin.”  (b.Shabbat 130a)  As a result, Jews began wearing tefillin only during the morning prayers, a practice which continues to this day.
The tefillin boxes bear the Hebrew letter shin ש, a sign indicating God’s Name. This has a connection with those passages of Revelation which speak of the saints who bear God’s Name upon their foreheads and the wicked who take the name of the beast on their arm and forehead.
There is some argument over whether the commandment of tefillin was meant to be taken literally, or if it is just a figurative language. In the Near East, it was once common for blood covenant partners to exchange amulet-like pouches which contained tokens, or even full copies, of their covenant obligations to one another.   These were worn as bracelets or necklaces. The commandment of tefillin is consistent with that ancient ritual, especially when one considers the rabbinic tradition that God Himself has ‘tefillin’ with Israel’s name on them.  In that sense, the tefillin are similar to wedding rings.  In fact, while a Jew winds the black leather straps for tefillin of the hand about his middle finger like a ring, he recites the betrothal passage from the book of Hosea:   “I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, in lovingkindness and in compassion, a I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know Yahweh.” (Hosea 2:19–20)   The binding on of tefillin is a tangible, ritual reminder of our obligation to bind God’s commandments on our very lives. God’s Word is to be between our eyes, filtering all that we see and think. It is to be bound on our hands, weighing all that we set our hands to do.


'''Stewards of the Counsel of God'''

“See, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do thus in the land where you are entering to possess it.  So keep and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’  For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is Yahweh our God whenever we call on Him?  Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole Torah which I am setting before you today?

Being that the Torah comes from God it must contain the wisdom of God. 
Moshe tells the Israelites that if they keep God’s commandments and His Torah that they will become a very wise and understanding people.  They will become so wise that the heathen nations around them will say, “What other nation is as wise and prudent as this!” (New Living Translation).  This is something extremely important to grasp,  Yahweh tells us that if we want to be wise, and have the heathen astonished at us, that we must obey His commandments.  If we obey His commandments, then those outside of us will see how blessed we are and will hopefully want to enter in.  They will want to know why we are blessed and it should give us the chance to minister the good news of Yeshua.  Those that would reject His Torah and keeping its commandments demonstrate that they are not wise, and don’t desire to be a real witness to others.  As individual Believers empowered by the Holy Spirit and who want to emulate Messiah Yeshua, we have a serious responsibility to be that example and that light to other people.  

The keeping and doing of God’s commands were to be the wisdom and understanding of Israel in the eyes of the nations”  History has confirmed this.  Not only did the wisdom of a Solomon astonish the queen of Sheba (1Ki 10:4), but the divine truth which Israel possessed in the law of Moshe attracted all the more earnest minds of the heathen world to seek the satisfaction of the inmost necessities of their heart and the salvation of their souls in Israel’s knowledge of God.”  The Torah is the source of all that His people need to keep close to Him.  When they took their eyes off the Torah they wandered around and lost sight of God. 

Moses reminds the sons of Israel that they were a small number of people but that Yahweh separated out a people chosen by Him to be His possession among the nations of the earth.  The Almighty made an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that He is bound to keep so that His Name will be glorified (Deuteronomy 7:6-8).  We need to be those faithful bearers of the light to the rest of the world.  We tend to take Yahweh lightly because we can not see Him.  Seeing is believing to many, but if that is what God desired, I am sure He would have done it.  When Yeshua came 2,000 years ago and walked the earth He was God in the flesh and yet most of mankind saw Him but did not believe in Him.  Yet the remnant that did, held fast to their faith and spread the truth of Yeshua throughout the world.  Yeshua is the heart, soul and spirit of Scripture because He is the living Word of His Father.  

We need to search the Torah, as well as the New Covenant scriptures, to find ways we can please our Father and reap the blessings He has in store for us.  Sometimes following the seemingly most insignificant commandments may bless us in ways we can’t imagine and give us fullness of life.  May you be blessed as you search His word and follow His ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ekev (As a Result)  Deuteronomy 7:12-11:25


The Ekev portion falls literally “on the heels” of the last exhortation from the Va’ethanan portion where Moshe commands the children of Israel to “faithfully observe the instructions or the commandments, statutes and judgments” that he has received and, in turn, given to Israel.  The conjunctive word ekev, which means “on the heels of” from which this portion gets its title, is translated as “if” or “because” or “as a result of” in different translations and it indicates the results of obedience to the list of instructions or the Torah.  The opening verses describe many of the blessings that flow from listening to and doing the commandments of God:

'''Because --'''''Italic text''

“So now, Israel, all that Yahweh your El asks from you is to fear Yahweh your El, follow all his ways, love him and serve Yahweh your El with all your heart and all your being; to obey,…….” 
WHY? BECAUSE  .... it’s “for your own good, the mitzvoth and regulations of Yahweh which I am giving you today.” 
BECAUSE… “Only Yahweh took enough pleasure in your ancestors to love them and choose their descendants after them---yourselves---above all peoples, as he still does today. Therefore, circumcise the foreskin of your heart; and don’t be stiff-necked any longer!” 
BECAUSE… “Yahweh your El is Elohim of El and Lord of lords, the great, mighty and awesome Elohim, who has no favorites and accepts no bribes. You are to fear Yahweh your El, serve him, cling to him and swear by his name.” 
BECAUSE….”He is your praise, and he is your El, who has done for you these great and awesome things,…”
“No one will be able to withstand you;” 
BECAUSE… “Yahweh your El will place the fear and dread of you on all the land you step on, as he told you.”  

He gives us some reasons to obey his commandments. He tells us why he has chosen Israel.  In these scriptures we have the reasons to obey our Father.  And “because” we obey we have some promises of blessings.
Starting with verse 12: Yahweh will keep the covenant he made with our ancestors BECAUSE we are listening to the rulings, keeping and obeying them. Do not show the enemy any pity, and do not serve their gods, BECAUSE that will become a trap for us. (verse 16)  We are not to be frightened of them, BECAUSE Yahweh our El is there with us, a El great and fearsome. (v. 21)  We are to remember Yahweh our El, BECAUSE it is He who is giving us the power to get wealth, in order to confirm His covenant….. (ch.8 v.18)   

We will perish just like the nations, BECAUSE we have not heeded the voice of Yahweh our El. (ch.8 v.20)
It is BECAUSE of the wickedness of these nations that Yahweh your El is driving them out ahead of you, and also to confirm the word which Yahweh swore to your ancestors, Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya’akov.” Therefore, understand that it is not BECAUSE of your righteousness that Yahweh is giving you this good land to possess. (ch.9 vs. 4-6)


'''The Grace and Mercy of Yahweh'''

The overwhelming theme of Ekev is that the Israelites have been preserved and protected BECAUSE of their God and Who He is -not because of themselves. Devarim/Deuteronomy- 9:3-6
“Know therefore today that it is Yahweh your God who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire.  He will destroy them and He will subdue them before you, so that you may drive them out and destroy them quickly, just as Yahweh has spoken to you.  Do not say in your heart when Yahweh your God has driven them out before you, - ‘Because of my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land,’ but it is BECAUSE of the wickedness of these nations that Yahweh is dispossessing them before you.  It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land, but it is BECAUSE of the wickedness of these nations that Yahweh your God is driving them out before you, in order to confirm the oath which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham,Isaac and Jacob.  Know, then, it is not BECAUSE of your righteousness that Yahweh your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people. “

In the excerpt above from Ekev, Yahweh clearly tells us why the heathen peoples occupying the Promised Land are to be destroyed and driven from it.  It is not because of the overwhelming righteousness of the Israelites, who we know consistently disobeyed Him while in the desert.  It is because the heathen peoples occupying the Land are in great sin and unrighteousness and they must be purged from the covenant territory.  Moshe warned Israel here against thinking that their own righteousness merited their success and not to become haughty and proud so as to think that it is because of “them” that He will do all this for them.

We would do well to take the same warning. Though there are always blessings for obedience and punishments for disobedience, it would be foolish of us to assume that our righteousness amounts to anything.  A person busily engaged in keeping the commandments might assume that he is a pretty righteous person and that God owes him some reward.  It’s a wrong assumption.  

Moshe reminded Israel that if not for his own intercession on their behalf, they would not have survived the trip from Sinai to the Promised Land. Therefore, they should not imagine that their righteousness amounted to anything.  In the same way, if we are ever tempted to imagine that our own righteousness has amounted to something, we had best remind ourselves that if not for Yeshua’s intercession on our behalf, we would never survive the journey.

Even if one’s righteousness did accumulate enough to merit a reward, that is God’s business, not ours. We are not supposed to keep Torah (His commandments) for the sake of receiving a reward.  The Master teaches us to obey God simply on the basis that it is what we are supposed to do.   Our obedience to God does not deserve any special accolades.  It is what we were created to do.  We are his servants, and a servant’s job is to obey his master.  Yeshua said that when we have done all the things which are commanded that we are to say, “We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.” (Luke 17:7–10)

Among many Believers today there are many who believe that they are called to “do things for God. “ Such individuals believe that they are called to “do this” or “do that” to please God. While many are indeed called, we as humans with a fallen sin nature are not supposed to necessarily “do things” for God.  This will gender pride in what ‘we’ have done.  On the contrary, we are called to serve Him.  We serve God because we love Him, and our obedience to Him comes naturally because we love Him.  We are not supposed to do things in our own strength -&quot;for Him,” deciding ourselves what we think we should to do for Him.  Rather, we are supposed to diligently obey Him and do what He tells us, as His Spirit leads, and do those things.  Many are led by their own spirit and do not truly seek Yahweh diligently to know His will. 

Pride has many dangers.   It can cause us to be lifted up in our own heart, by our own reasonings, and go astray from the way of His paths, presumptuously assuming we have His blessing and are doing His will.   His Word alone is the measuring rod of truth.

Pride is evidenced in many ways -  
“The people of Israel are compared to a vine to teach us that just as a vine has large and small clusters of grapes, the larger ones hanging lower than the smaller ones, the greater a person is (the heavier his wisdom), the profounder his humility” (A Torah Commentary For Our Times, p. 120-121, UHAC Press).
“King Solomon teaches that pride causes a person to speak dishonestly.  It forces a person to deviate from the truth and to make accusations that are unfounded.  God weeps over those who are filled with pride” (ibid. p. 121).


'''Serving God Acceptably'''

After reviewing some of the details of his intercession because of their waywardness, Moshe, poses a rhetorical question and the answers to his question as,  “And now, O Israel, what does Yahweh your God demand of you?”  In the NASB version it reads: “Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require from you?”  giving us the list of requirements that our Father demands and requires of us, His children.  It is these admonitions that summarize not only what God requires of His people, but also how the sons of Israel can actually do certain things to fulfill these requirements.  Let’s first look at the passage from Deuteronomy 10:12-22 from the NASB:  “Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require from you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep Yahweh’s commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good?  “Behold, to Yahweh your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it.  “Yet on your fathers did Yahweh set His affection to love them, and He chose their descendants after them, even you above all peoples, as it is this day.  “So circumcise your heart, and stiffen your neck no longer.  “For Yahweh your God is the God of gods and Yahweh of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God who does not show partiality nor take a bribe. “He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.  “So show your love for the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.  “You shall fear Yahweh your God; you shall serve Him and cling to Him, and you shall swear by His name.  “He is your praise and He is your God, who has done these great and awesome things for you which your eyes have seen.  “Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons in all, and now Yahweh your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven” (Deuteronomy 10:12-22).

This is the sum total of the whole of the Torah, the essence of it all  -  love God and love your neighbour, as Yeshua reiterated it in Matthew 22.37 - 40  -  “Yeshua said unto him, You shall love Yahweh your God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” and “You shall love your neighbour as yourself”, and all the gospel writers likewise. 

James refers to this scripture when he exhorts the believers  to be doers of the Word, keeping themselves from being defiled by worldliness and to exercise “pure and undefiled religion” in meeting the needs of the orphans and widows.  (1:22-27)           

Moshe says to them, “Fear Yahweh your God” (10:12).  There are two levels of fearing God. The higher of the two is the sense of awe and reverence, and that is what Moshe calls for here.  Such fear is easy to imagine, hard to walk out.  The second fear, and the lesser of the two, is the fear of physical punishment because of disobedience to Yahweh. Motivated by love we can achieve this higher level of fear and maintain it as a constant force in our lives which will keep us on the straight and narrow path of righteousness,  walking in intimacy with our heavenly Father.

John says, “And this is love, that we walk after his commandments.  This is the commandment, that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.”  (2 John 6)   The “beginning” that John is referring to is the beginning at Mount Sinai (Har Sinai) where Yahweh gave Torah to Yisrael.  

We love Him because He first loved us and brought us to Himself.  (1 John 4: 9-11)   Out of that love we keep His commandments and thereby abide in Him through the Spirit He has given us.  (John 14:15; 1 John 3:24)  Maintaining a reverential fear of Yahweh will guard us against becoming contaminated with the things of this world and allowing our love to grow cold.  1 John 2:15-17

“Here is how we know that we love Yahweh’s children: when we love Yahweh, we also do what he commands. For loving Yahweh means obeying his commands. Moreover, His commands are not burdensome, BECAUSE everything which has Yahweh as its Father overcomes the world. And this is what victoriously overcomes the world: our trust.” And then back to chapter 4 verse 19: “We ourselves love now BECAUSE He loved us first.”   I John 5:2-4 

Hebrews 12.28 exhorts us  -  “Wherefore, receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve Yahweh acceptably with reverence and godly fear”


'''Yeshua - the Living Word''' 

Yeshua is a tree of life to those who take hold of Him,  His ways are ways of pleasantness and all of His paths are shalom.  
In the study of the Torah let us never forget that YESHUA THE MESSIAH is the Living Torah, the Torah-Word of Elohim made flesh.  He is the way, truth and life – the Living Manna sent from heaven.  Without Him living in our lives through the indwelling Presence of his Set-apart/Kadosh Spirit (Who leads us into all truth and revelation) the Written Torah can become the dead letter of the law!   The written Word is a modern invention, His Word needs to be in our heart so He can make it alive and we ‘hear’ it.

In 11:13, the Hebrew this phrase literally reads, “If hearken, you will hearken...”  Rashi interprets the double usage of this verb to mean, “If [you] listen to the old, you will listen to the new” meaning that if one listens to what one has already learned by taking care to review and understand it, one will gain new insights or fresh insights into the Torah (ArtScroll Sapirstein Edition Rashi – Devarim, p. 110; AS Chumash, p. 995).   This requires consistent study and an attentive ear to His Spirit.
Yahweh gave the Israelites fresh (not stale) manna every day and watered the land of Israel with the early and latter rains so that it would be fruitful without the need of man-made irrigation.  Manna and rain both came from heaven and are used as figures of speech to represent Torah-truth.  Our spiritual life needs to be renewed regularly with fresh revelation and insights into the Word of Yahweh, entering into His very heart and character.  Fresh manna refreshes, nourishes and sustains the ground of our lives so that it yields an abundant spiritual crop of joy, shalom, intimacy with the Father and anointing. 

“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life.  Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down out of Heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down out of Heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread also which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.’ John 6:40-66).

Yeshua was teaching that He was their source of spiritual sustenance - He was the living Word of the Father which would be given for their eternal life.   In living by faith and in union with Him, we have life!
But in order to feast on the words that come forth from the mouth of the Holy One, a person really needs to make a choice.  After all, the flesh and its desire for gratification is a strong advocate of feasting on the tangible things in the earthly realm to those who are operating in the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life (1 John 2:16).  

When you think about it, the things that attract you and get your attention and time are things that originate in the world system in which we live.  The devil knew this, because as the prince of the power of air and the god of this world (Ephesians 2:2), he was used to watching mankind succumb to his wily ways.  When you review the account of the “Wilderness Temptation of Yeshua,” you can see that the enemy of our souls did his utmost for the physically weakened Son of God to fall under his dominion.
His victory, even when in His weakened condition, is a great example of how we can also meet with the tests, trials and tribulations that we know we will have in our lifetime.  The question we have to ask ourselves is whether we belief enough in the promises and do we have enough faith to take our time and invest it in feasting on the Word of God.  After all, there are a number of other things we could be doing with our time and the enemy of our souls will offer many seemingly legitimate alternatives.

It is a matter of placing our priorities on the things above, on the eternal things of the kingdom.
“Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require from you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep Yahweh’s commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good? . . . . So circumcise your heart, and stiffen your neck no longer”   Deuteronomy 10:12-16.

This passage stipulate that we serve with BOTH — heart and nephesh.  This takes in the two facets of our being: [1] our physical heart and body in this physical universe and [2] our spiritual nephesh in the spiritual realm.  Both need to be brought into subjection to His commandments.   This is the relationship between faith and works. A literal translation of verse 12 would read 
“And now Yisrael, what is Yahweh your God, asking of you; other than to revere Yahweh your God, to walk in every one of His Ways and for the love of Him, to serve Yahweh your God, with all of your heart and with all of your soul; .. .. .. “  

This reveals a thought not usually recognized  ‘to walk’    
1. in all of His Ways
2. for the love of Him

If we truly want to walk in His ways and love Him and serve Him with all of our heart and soul, we are going to have to prioritize what we are going to do with our time.  Are we going to let the washing of the water of the Word penetrate into our spirits, so that we can begin to truly have the mind of the Messiah?  For it is when we have the mind of the Messiah that we can deal with the temptations of life with the Word that has proceeded out of the mouth of God.  He knows just what temptations are going to come our way and at each one, we are all individually going to have to make a decision.  Are we going to react the way Yeshua reacted or are we going to react out of our own strength and inclination, responding according to our own nature?
The Scriptures admonish us to make sure that we are in the faith.  “Test yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith.  Examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Yeshua the Messiah is in you, unless indeed you fail the test?  But I hope that you will know that we ourselves do not fail the test” (2 Corinthians 13:5-6).
Remember “you are what you eat.”  Our life depends on what we eat.


'''What God Requires: Faith'''

Do we walk by faith or by sight (i.e. by logic - our own reasonings)?  Was it logical to think that Israel could dispossess a fortified land full of people mightier and greater in number than themselves?  Fear and logic are often the enemies of faith in Yahweh’s Word and promises.  (7:17-18)  

Without faith it is impossible to please Yahweh (Heb. 11:6),  and the just shall walk by faith (Heb. 10:38).  What is faith? (see Heb. 11:1).  By faith the physical creation came into existence (Heb. 11:3), therefore, faith preceded the physical creation and is the “mother” of it.  From the “womb” of faith, if you will, came forth all that we see and know. That “womb” is the very heart, character and mind of Yahweh Elohim.  It is spiritual.  We live in a physical dimension.   The new heaven and the new earth, and the Jerusalem from above, will be spiritual dimensions.   Those who plan on being there have got to learn to walk in that dimension here and now by trusting in the Word and promises of Yahweh for all of their needs. 

Remember! An essential element of a strong faith in the promises of Yahweh (7:18; 8:2,11)  --   is to remember Yahweh’s past accomplishments in your life: how he has healed you, prospered you, answered your prayers, transformed your life, delivered you from enemies and troubles, given meaning, hope and purpose to your life.   Some of these promises for Israel are --- 
prosperity - verse 13; fruitfulness of womb - verse 14; healing - verse 15; victory over enemies - verse 16; etc.  

We need faith to go forward spiritually – to trust in Yahweh’s leading when it means going out of our comfort zone into unknown, unchartered areas where we are completely dependant upon Him (8:7-9).   If we harden our heart we will find ourselves in a spiritual wilderness wandering around the same old mountain.   It is this attitude that kept the older generation of Israelites out of the Promised Land (9:6-7; Heb. 4:1-7). 

Faith is a matter of loving God and our fellow man after that, but it is not a works based salvation but salvation that evidences works caused by turning to the ways of God.   Torah was not given by God to show us how sinful we are.   It was given because God loved us so much He wanted us to see what it was that would please Him and cause Him to bless us if we did what He wanted us to.   On the other hand He presented us with curses that come on us as a consequence if we break His laws.  
The subsequent blessings for our obedience are stated in Deuteronomy 7:12-24 in which we see what a great and awesome God the sons of Israel have as their Provider, Protector and Champion against all of the other gods of the world.  But while rejoicing in all of the wonderful things that the Holy One will do for this nation of priests, there is the conditional “if” that qualifies it in v.12.

Lack of faith in Yahweh is the root of disobedience as Moshe has seen with the entire generation which perished in the desert because of their rebellion, stiff necks and unbelief, in spite of the visible presence of the Most High in their midst.  Even with the daily provision of manna for bread, quail for meat, water from various rocks, protection and victory over the enemies of Israel and a myriad of other miracles during the desert journey, Moshe has witnessed the unbelief and the consequences of disobedience.  Seeing is not necessarily believing, it takes faith to be born in the heart to obey and faith comes by hearing the Word of God.

That is why Moshe continually exhorts them ‘to listen/hear’ the word of Yahweh so that they will come to faith.  Romans 10:9-10. Moshe’ concern is further heightened by the visions he received about the future scattering of the sons of Israel due to their collective disobedience.  Just a few chapters earlier we can read a statement that describes what Moshe has already perceived:
“Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where Yahweh drives you” (Deuteronomy 4:27).  When you combine this realization with the fact that Moshe also recognizes that his limited days are coming to an end, the urgency of his appeal is better understood.  With some of his last activities on earth, as the Rabbis believe that Deuteronomy was written over a period of thirty or so days, he continues to exhort the children of Israel to obey the commandments in order to receive the blessings that are promised.  The heart of a shepherd over his flock is evident.  Almost to his last breath, Moshe continues to repeat the words of instruction that lead to life and the promises of blessings.


'''Walking in Faith and Love'''

Paul tells us that each man has been given a measure of faith (Romans 12:3).  But let us also by reminded that our faith in Yeshua does not exempt us from loving, serving, obeying, and clinging to the Living God.  Those actions come as a result of our faith in the accomplished work of the Messiah, since we are unable to comply perfectly with the dictates of Torah in our own strength.

The apostles understood when they came to faith in Yeshua’s atoning work for sin that it did not however, change their need to continue in the Torah obedient life that they had lived prior to the Resurrection.  In a like manner, as those of us in the 21st Century return to our Hebraic Roots, it is critical to understand that we likewise need to be following the dictates of the Torah with all of our heart, mind, souls and strength.  With the Comforter and Teacher indwelling our now circumcised heart, we should understand more clearly what Moshe is saying when we read this section of Deuteronomy.  Through the comforting promptings of the Ruach, we can each appreciate what truly fearing and revering Yahweh is all about, as we pursue Him in prayer and supplication.   We should desire to walk in His ways so that we can please our Heavenly Father as we are being conformed to the image of Yeshua.  We can learn to love Him more, as we understand the greater depths of His love for us and seek to serve Him with all of our heart, mind, soul and strength, knowing that we can literally be living sacrifices  so that our spiritual service of praise and worship ministers to Him.  As we each seek to obey His commandments, He can bless us according to His Word, recognizing that in Messiah, our sins are forgiven as we confess and repent from our misdeeds.

Through service to the Holy One, in whatever capacity, you are putting His interests ahead of your own and learning to be sensitive to what His demands are for your usefulness in the work of the Kingdom.  By serving Him, you display a willingness to let Him use you in the circumstances of life that you find yourself.  

Whatever our circumstances, whatever our stage of spiritual growth, Yahweh can use us in His kingdom.  He does not expect immediate cleansing from all the contaminating effects of sin in our lives straight away.  He gives us time to drive out the enemy.  Yahweh said to the Israelites entering the land, “Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.&quot;(HNV revised) - The children of Israel had to experience many adjustments when they entered into the land. When you make major changes, it is better to do it bit by bit, in order not to be overcome by strategies of the enemy directed against you.  (7:22)  The conquest may take a long time, where there has been a strong entrenchment of the enemy, to battle them until they are eliminated from our territory.  But this is not an excuse for not obeying.  

“Moreover Yahweh your God will send tzirah among them (our enemies), until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.&quot;(7:20) - The Hebrew word that is normally translated as “hornets”, and sometimes as “panic” is “tzirah”, which, according to Rashi, is a type of flying insect that sprays poison on its enemies which paralyzes and blinds them, no matter where they are hiding. Yahweh’s presence in our lives has a paralysing effect upon the enemy’s perceptions and activities in our lives and will enable us to overcome and drive them out of our ‘territory’ and claim the total inheritance which we have been given.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter II: The Town====

After the war, many of the families owning large country estates - holding positions of responsibility and likely to be future heads of the family, were dead... in many cases their younger brothers were dead too. In time, their parents became too old and impoverished to retain and manage the family home, business, and estate. These were then broken up and sold to maintain their only home which ultimately became too much for them too – this was also broken up and sold. In this way the countryside lost the traditional squire in his manor house and the once fine estate sold to be split up and got rid of piecemeal, some to be for building land. The countryside was never the same again... and this is what happened, starting gradually after WWI, until the older, moneyed population, had died. By about 1938 – twenty-years after the war ended, the class structure had lost its top tier. The bottom layer too, had been removed – the very poor and the destitute had been taken care of by The State.

The reduced class levels speeded up what was likely to take place by natural evolution. Taxation in the form of death duties saw to it that over a period of time there would be a redistribution of wealth. The enclosure act forced some of the poor off the land. They gravitated, as did others, to the towns and factories. The agricultural depression at the end of the nineteenth century changed the balance of the working population between town and country. The war hurried this change along. The 1919 budget raised death duties to forty per cent to estates over two million. A million acres of land was sold over that year. By the end of 1921 a quarter of England had changed hands… A quarter of agricultural land had passed from being tenanted into that of the farmer-owner. Land sales had reached their peak - three years of land sales, now the new owners totted up what their purchases had given them… The repeal of the Corn Production Act saw massive grain imports from Canada, America and Russia. The price of cereals plummeted. What large estates had survived started again to be split up and houses attached to them sold to become detached dwellings. A quarter of country houses were torn down or left derelict. By the first years of the Second World War there was less arable land. What land there was, was not being farmed properly. It took the war and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to take Britain close to self sufficiency. 

The result of all this was, a large reduction of wealth owned by the top one per cent of the population – mainly the landed gentry. This land found its way to the next social layer down. Seventy-five per cent of Britain’s population still held less than one hundred pounds in their estate. The change in the population’s occupations – from country to town – from working the land to working the production line, gave an opportunity for skills to be learned and entrepreneurship to blossom. This flattened-out the social class graph, and reduced the layers. Within this now reduced, or flattened out, layer of wealth is accorded a class position defined by occupation, background, education, speech, fashion and hobby – giving social structure.

For those who are interested in class and where they fit into the structure the concept is of interest… for it is a perceived thing. You may like to think of yourself as belonging to one class but your neighbours may not agree with you. In the period and setting we are discussing, 1929 – 1939, in suburban Harrow, class was not of over-riding concern. There were no aristocrats, gentry or Gentlemen – rich men, without occupation. It was a working environment – of mainly men, travelling to and from their work, mostly by rail. There were very few cars and the local bus routes took prospective rail passengers to access a different rail network. It was not an area of heavy industry, textiles, mining or farming, but one of light engineering, service industries, office, and shop work.

North Harrow did not have any grand houses… Its premier houses lined the Pinner Road leading to Harrow. They had an extra living room and bedroom above, were detached, and designed in a similar style to all the rest of the town. If North Harrow had no houses for the very rich it neither had houses for the very poor… the town was made up of similar houses. Some streets had a better place upon the map – close to the park. Others had trees that lined the road. Those that backed upon the railway, positioned next to the shops, or linked to the council houses, had a disadvantage. But in the main, all were very much like each other… held a suburban likeness… there was very little to separate each individual family.

The first railway to be opened locally was The London &amp; Birmingham Railway, later to be called the London &amp; North Western, in 1837. It ran from Euston to Boxmore passing through Harrow, later to be called Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station. A second line, the Metropolitan, originally ran from Paddington to Farringdon, operating in 1863, as the first underground railway. Over the next twenty years was extended linking up with the District Railway and the Inner Circle in 1884. During this time, branch lines ran from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage in 1868, and Willesden to Harrow in 1880. This was extended to Pinner five years later, a station being built there within the year. It took a further twelve years to push the tack-laying to Chesham, Chalfont, Watford, Amersham and Aylesbury. By the turn of the century the company stretched over fifty miles from central London – out to Buckinghamshire. The whole railway was electrified by 1905, and by 1927 North Harrow station was up and running. The electric Metropolitan District line, inaugurated 1904 operated between Park Royal and Roxeth - which included a halt at Rayners Lane. The company was not slow in planning the purchase of additional land for more lines, sidings and depots. This land was negotiated on the principle that the land could be used for other purposes. In the event it was used for housing instead. The first housing estates were built at Wembley and Pinner in the early 1900s. A few years later more land was let go all along the line which was only bought to a halt by The First World War.

However, the start of the war did not stop the railway company’s publicity department continuing to operate - before its operations temporarily closed down. Its declared policy aim was to publicise the line. It had adopted the brand name of Metro-Land to title an advertising brochure aimed at promoting the company’s land for development. This was not a one-off publication… for it continued publication for another twelve years - until the Metropolitan Railway ceased trading as an independent company, before becoming part of London Transport. A year after the war, a property company called The Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited [MRCE] was set up to manage and develop the railway’s holdings. It was this company’s policy to plan and built residential estates all along the line, including Pinner, North Harrow, Rayners Lane, Northwick Park and Eastcote. The scale of the enterprise required the services of local property developers who were allowed to build to their own specifications. To advertise the housing projects all the railway’s route maps, timetables and station posters carried detailed accounts of the sites, plans and local facilities. This was done under the slogan ‘a better way of life’, and, ‘rural traditions with civilized progress’. This marketing ploy worked and the houses were soon snapped up not just for owner occupation but by investors renting out property.

Tramways were laid at the end of the nineteenth century – they were company owned horse tramways. By 1897 electric tramways were operated, a number of tramway companies formed the Tramways and Light Railway Association. It wasn’t long before the Omnibus Owners Association was formed to look after the interests of the horse drawn public transport. In the 1920s and 1930s the three forms of public transport – buses, trolleybuses and trains operated in and around London. The Road Traffic Act 1930 regulated road transport. There were two bus routes which served North Harrow. The 183 ran from Golders Green Bus Station to either Pinner or Northwood Terminus…, and the 230, which covered Wealdstone Bus Station to Rayners Lane Terminus. In 1930. Both routes operated single Decker buses with a driver and conductor. Tickets were obtained from a ticket stick by the conductor, punched when the passenger first boarded the bus… these had to be shown to any Inspector when demanded. During rush hours both routes operated a ten minute service using regular stopping places and request stops. Passengers could stop the bus at request stops by operating a bell. Orderly queues formed beside each bus and request stop.

North Harrow did not appear on the map by chance. It was ordained by the government of the day and the local authority planning department… to cater for the increase in population, and expanding businesses in and around the capital city. The problems of mass unemployment and the need to stimulate the economy lead the government to press local councils for the need to produce residential schemes for house building, and instigate ancillary projects to service that increase in population. The Government Acts of 1919 – 1925 ordered ten council-house estates to be built. Amongst these was one of fifty-three houses to be erected in North Harrow.

The need for workers houses close to their work, the location of the country’s capital city London on a main river, with warehouses and dockland facilities, turned the southeast of England into Britain’s most populous place. People and goods need to be moved from home to work, from factory to warehouse. Rivers, canals, roads, and railways are essential for moving troops, supplying goods, communication and personal travel. The direction of city developments happened along its lines of communication, both the roads and railways. As the city expanded farmland was built over. In 1929 the most desirable land left close to London of easy access to a railway was in Middlesex and Hertfordshire. The suburban sprawl of settlements along the railways came to Harrow, North Harrow and Pinner following the main Harrow and Pinner Road in the early thirties. It was not a geographical feature that suggested a settlement but an existing railway network. 

Before The First World War most people and goods travelled by the power of the horse. After the war the use of steam and then petrol - to power motors accelerated – the development of paved highways and improvements in road construction continued apace. The unemployed were given relief work which further accelerated what had begun. This government sponsored unemployment relief pushed forward road construction. More vehicles were manufactured giving a stimulus to proposals for arterial routes and side roads. Under the Local Government Act 1929 County Councils became responsible for County Highways in their areas. They in turn proposed the building of town and city bypass to ease congestion. As the new garden towns were built in Metro-Land so the road layouts progressed to cover all the open fields.

It wasn’t many years after the town was started that the Ministry of Transport directed the introduction of road markings, road signs and pedestrian crossings. By 1934 the Road Traffic Act placed a speed limit of thirty miles per hour for all town and city roads throughout Britain. The outbreak of War in 1939 brought an end to the expansion of trunk road construction but towards the end of the War the Ministry favoured the provision of a network of high standard routes. Post War saw the enactment of the 1946 Trunk Road Act. North Harrow lies between Harrow and Pinner, on the Metropolitan Railway - which runs on an east to west bearing. Harrow, a main railway junction - services three railway companies. Pinner, in the north-eastern corner of Harrow parish, was a large medieval hamlet in 1750… enlarged to village status a hundred years later… then town, by the turn of the century. Pinner Town had an existing railway station built at the sometime the track was laid. Both these towns are situated on the A404, Pinner Road.

The development of farmland started in the 1920s and 30s. The electrification of the London &amp; North Western Railway in 1917, and permission given for the Piccadilly Line to run over the Metropolitan District line in 1932 gave access to most of that land. By 1933 there were twenty-one stations including North Harrow available for commuters. Baker Street station was the company’s headquarters incorporating the largest and most luxurious apartment block in London – completed in 1929. Land speculation and property development operated over the whole area continuously from 1925 till 1939. By 1926 the road layout was mapped out and road building started, provisions made for main services included, and by 1939 the network was complete. In 1933 Harrow Urban District Council produced residential schemes for house building using the existing main access roads of Harrow Road and Pinner Road to accommodate Alexandra Avenue, Imperial Drive, and George V Avenue. Side roads lead off main thoroughfares, giving today’s existing road layout.

On a north south axis, North Harrow lies between Wealdstone – to the north, and, Rayners Lane, to the south - on the A4090, situated on the crossroads of two main arterial roads. The local authorities appreciated the need to build a new town with all its attendant services at this place. Private house building flourished in the 1920s and 30s. By 1932 building was continuous alongside the railway, referred to a ribbon development, and main roads laid from Harrow to Pinner, Wealdstone to Rayners Lane. Most of the countryside between Pinner and Roxeth was built during the 30s. By 1938 North Harrow was complete in all respects.

It is difficult now to explain the average workers feelings and opinions regarding house ownership prior to The First World War and shortly afterwards. Only a very small percentage of the population owned their own house. This ten per-cent of owner-occupiers bought because they had the money to do so without needing a loan. Many aristocrats, landed gentry and upper classes rented either their own home or a second home in the country – it was the done thing. There was no shame in not owning your own home, the rent was low and you had the benefit of being able to move quickly as a job became available. As inflation was low and static there was no point in buying to hedge inflation, or to use as a long-term investment. To a degree this attitude was accepted as ‘normal’ and not questioned. There was a certain amount of ‘what’s the point of owning a house and having to maintain it – then, having to pass it on – why should I save for another generation?’ With a growing family you could move to increase the number of bedrooms without over extending your income. Then, where the children left, you could rent something smaller as your income became smaller in retirement. At least ten per-cent of the population lived in tied accommodation – policeman, firemen, estate workers, mill workers, railway workers, servants, miners, land workers, the armed services and teachers – the house went with the job. In the twenties, houses held about one-quarter of the country’s annual fixed-capital security. Ten years later the amount was one-third.

During this period over three million homes were built. The architectural style of the period was Arts and Crafts – a style of decoration with a romantic return to previous ages using solid wood panelling, and Georgian windows; Mock Tudor, aping the Tudor period with sham wooden framing and leaded lights, and Cottage Style, long- sloping tiled roofs and divided windows. The lower outer walls were built of red brick, above, pebbledash with half-timbering. Red clay tile roofs and tile hung bays. Georgian small windows set in metal casements with wooden frames and cills. Previous craftsmanship gave way to machine made products. Furniture used white wood and ply stained to resemble polished walnut. Carpet squares surrounded by lino. Parquet hall floors and decorated stair spindles. All treated with dark oak stain. Quarry tile kitchen floors, butler sinks, fire-back water boilers and gas cookers. Open fires in all living rooms, with wood mantle above tile surrounds. Bedrooms had iron fire grates and fitted wardrobes. Sash windows, landing lights, front door lights and side windows leaded with stained glass.

Between large scale building sites of semi-detached houses, Bungalows, Modern and Art Deco Styles existed, dividing the more conventional style with their flat roofs, ziz-zag and fan window patterns, painted concrete bays and sun-trap curved windows. The construction sites were organized for multiple building techniques on a grand scale that gave a quick turn round of work completing large sites in a four year period – mostly all before 1936.

The majority houses built in North Harrow were Cutler homes. Albert Benjamin Cutler came from Tottenham. He began building in 1909 but most of his work was in North Harrow and Pinner during the early thirties. His son Horace took over becoming Mayor of Harrow, then Leader of the Greater London Council finally knighted in 1979. Albert Cutler lived in Beresford Road, Marsh Road and lastly in Eastcote Road. He was closely associated with the Imperial Properties Investment Company then Amalgamated London Properties. During the period, 1925-1939 T F Nash Ltd., had three large estates for developing. One was at Eastcote where he lived, another at Kenton and a third at Rayners Lane… they the most economical… then on the way to Pinner that ranged from £595 to £750 – four up and two down, with a garage.

Depending on the industry, production started to push ahead in the early thirties. The first factories to set the wheels in motion were the new electric consumer goods – cookers, refrigerators, irons, toasters and vacuum cleaners. Radios, telephone equipment and cameras also felt greater sales being recorded. All these items needed ancillary parts to be manufactured. Indeed this was not ‘heavy industry’ but it had to start somewhere. Steel output rose from a low five million tons in 1932, to thirteen by 1937. Coal production had stabilized and productivity started to rise at a steady pace to reach its old peak by 1938. It was a marked change in textiles. Cotton never succeeded in reaching its previous high but woollens did. Generally the thirties, in comparison to other European countries, are described as being an improvement on the previous era – in the twenties.

When the local council were asked to submit schemes for land development in the late 1800s they considered the supply of water. These concerns were passed onto the Coln Valley Water Company who undertook to supply the necessary piped water as early as 1884. Ten years later the then local authority had installed a new sewage system. The house building schemes thirty years later gratefully used these provisions, altering the gauge and pipe material whilst retaining the essential main service. As the dwellings were being designed and built provision had to be made for recreation and open spaces to give health and a green environment for its inhabitants. This was first investigated at the time of The Great Exhibition. By 1910, a Local Board of Health committee of the Harrow Urban District Council gave consideration for recreation grounds for Harrow and Roxeth. By 1925 Headstone Park was acquired, then Pinner Park in 1930. In 1938 Harrow reserved 962 acres for a green belt. The 1894 Harrow sewage farms were turned into Kenton’s recreation ground after a larger site found. West Harrow Park and Streamside Walk, [or Yeading Walk], joined the others, as the building estates grew.

Property speculators and house buyers could obtain a mortgage with an interest rate of 4.25 per cent. These Building Societies did not require large deposits. Abbey National, then called Abbey Road, registered a seven-hundred per cent increase in borrowers, in the ten years, 1926 – 1936. This allowed most of the lower middle class and better off working class the opportunity to buy. The interest rate was set at this low point to stimulate the market, which is what it did. The population of Harrow Weald raised from fifteen hundred to eleven thousand and that of Pinner three thousand to twenty-three. North Harrow was, prior to 1919, undeveloped. Twenty years later all the farmland was gone – the one-time farmland built over. Due north of Harrow, lies the village of Stanmore. The gas-works were opened there in 1859, supplying Harrow through a private contractor named John Chapman - whose business was called Stanmore Gas Company. In 1894, it was joined with Harrow District Gas Company – the two becoming Harrow and Stanmore Gas Company, the gas holders were sited at South Harrow. This company was later taken over by Brentford Gas Company in 1924 - formed part of the Gas Light and Coke Company - two years later.

This growth coming from these new enterprises entailed electricity, in one form or another. The development of the electricity supply was the most important industrial event of that period. Legislation was required to carry forward a bill that became the Electricity Supply Act of 1925. This created the Central Electricity Board formed at the time of the General Strike – in 1926. The Boards task was to rationalize the myriad local power stations into larger units – to build a new generation of power stations, all connected to a national grid - of high-power transmission lines. By 1933 this goal was almost complete. It was a world-wide first - having the most advanced system of electrical supply available produced by coal fired power stations. Prior to The First World War, the use of electricity was for the very few. In 1920 there being almost three-quarters of a million users rising to nine million by 1939. In 1927 one house in seventeen, using electricity… by 1930 one house in three rises to two out of three, by 1939.

It is difficult to imagine the difference having electricity made to the population, particularly to those living in the country. Before electricity, illumination in the towns was by gas, commonly used by the time of The Great Exhibition in 1851. Gradually, by the turn of the twentieth-century, in the country cottage, candle power gave way to oil, then oil to gas [In country towns close to a supply]. It took until the nineteen thirties for the majority of homes to be lit by electricity. At my grandmothers cottage in Somerset I went to bed, in the 1940s, by candle light, leaving the family below playing cards by the light of an oil lamp. The radio was powered by an accumulator and the milk was kept in the stream.

After all wars there is a surge of new inventions and discoveries… brought onto the market. The First World War was no different. In the nineteen-twenties electricity and gas appliance started to appear. Cookers, refrigerators, water heaters and all sorts of household gadgets including vacuum cleaners, radio sets, record players and toasters appeared first in advertising then in the shops. Prior to WWI cooking and water heating was achieved on a kitchen range, with an open fire next to a bread oven. The fuel would have been wood and coal. Many outhouses were built or converted to kitchen use using paraffin. Similarly lighting was by candle and oil. Gas was being used extensively for street lighting. By the middle of the nineteenth century domestic lighting and heating was a matter of fact. However, this relied upon the nearness of the gas line and gas holder - to ensure continuous pressure. The nearest gas holders servicing North Harrow was at South Harrow, on the way to Northolt. 

When the Garden Suburbs were being planned and executed gas was laid on and customers could have a choice of which power to use – Coal, Gas or Electricity - for water and space heating, and cooking. Most domestic water and space heating was by burning coal – welsh nuts and coke – burnt coal, high grade coal, or steam-coal, was the preserves of the industrial sector. Delivery was by horse and cart from coal depots – normally at the local railway siding, the coal was carried in hundred-weight sacks, on the back of the coalman who deposited in your coal-bunker. Fires were started either by mentholated [soaked] fire lighters, gas-irons or kindling – chopped wood. If the coalman had spare coal he would call at each house to see if he could sell some. During this ten year period coal began to become scarce. The shortage of coal was the result of increased demand. Throughout the thirties, into the fifties, the production of coal continued to escalate, until oil fired power stations took up the strain. It was the Clean Air Act and over capacity that ultimately saw the demise of this once proud industry.

Domestic coal became low grade either slack – coal dust, or quantities of slate. Increasingly coal briquettes were made industrially, to supplement the coal that was rationed. Normally coal-sheds were filled during the summer to last the winter. Whatever the grade of coke, and there were at least two, coke needed a good draught - to make the fire ‘keep-in’ - a mixture of coke and coal was used. The coalman judged to a nicety how much bagged coal the horse could pull unloading as near to the coal depot as possible, early on his round. The coalman was a very important member of pre-war society his produce a very necessary item, particularly during winter. Carrington’s were the largest hauliers and distributers. 

The mass extraction of coal was a development of the mid-nineteenth century – eighty years before. The advent of the steam engine thirty years later made coal a more viable product – transportable. Fortunately the coal produced was high grade, very profitable. By the nineteen-thirties the miners were some of the highest paid workers in British industry. When manufacturing suffered a decline so too did the coal industry – there were too many mines producing too much coal. Closures were inevitable. The government compelled firms to participate in a marketing quota scheme to maintain price levels. The 1930 Coal Mines Act established price controls… the following year the government compelled coal-owners to use a central marketing agency. By 1938 the possibility of war, the rearmament programme, and higher industrialisation, all prompted the government to insist upon amalgamations which ultimately lead to Nationalization, eight years later.

Hi, I'm not an academic but I'm always fascinated by science. Sadly, there are things I don't understand but your text is very compelling for people like me, helped by practical examples and comparison with &quot;real and mundane&quot; things except in a few cases. Here it is:

&quot;Negatively curved surfaces also exist - they are shaped somewhat like an infinitely extended saddle - and Euclidean geometry does not apply to these surfaces either.&quot;

&quot;For example, the angles of a triangle add up to less than 180o.&quot;

&quot;If we extend these ideas to three dimensions, (do not be worried if you can't imagine a three-dimensional surface of a sphere...&quot;

&quot;Space (...) it is shaped as a hypersphere(3D spherical surface)&quot;

&quot;Space (...) it is shaped like a so-called hypersaddle&quot;

&quot;This predicts that if a giant triangle was to be constructed around the sun (***) these lines are in fact the straightest lines possible (geodesics) in this warped geometry&quot;

&quot;This local curvature can be described in mathematical terms using tensor calculus, an incredibly elegant tool which provides consistent results, regardless of the chosen frame of reference.&quot;

The quotations above could be easier with some examples. Maybe there's no examples for that (and I have no idea about what I'm talking about :) but maybe an illustration or an animated gif could make your writings even more tasteful. Informations or pictures of this &quot;tensor calculus&quot; would be amazing! 

For instance, a &quot;hypercube&quot;. Shamefully I read a lot about it and didn't get it at all. But an simple animation of a 4 dimensional cube rotation make it possible to read about it again with a better understanding and then the impossible, to assimilate it and make it understandable in the naive mind.

Thank you!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''invention''' is a new composition, [[device]], or process. An invention may be derived from a pre-existing model or [[idea]], or it could be independently conceived in which case it may be a radical breakthrough. In addition, there is '''[[cultural invention]]''', which is an [[innovative]] set of useful [[social behavior]]s adopted by people and passed on to others.&lt;ref&gt;Artificial Mythologies: A Guide to Cultural Invention by Craig J. Saper (1997); Review of Artificial Mythologies. A Guide to Cultural Invention, Kirsten Ostherr (1998) http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_199810/ai_n8821092&lt;/ref&gt; Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge or experience.  An invention that is [[novelty (patent)|novel]] and [[inventive step and non-obviousness|not obvious]] to [[person skilled in the art|others skilled in the same field]] may be able to obtain the legal protection of a [[patent]].

== Process ==
Invention is a [[creative process]]. An open and curious mind enables one to see beyond what is known. Seeing a new possibility, a new connection or relationship can spark an invention. Inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together. Sometimes inventors skip over the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields. Ways of thinking, materials, processes or tools from one realm are used as no one else has imagined in a different realm.

[[Play (activity)|Play]] can lead to invention. Childhood curiosity like playing in a sand box, experimentation and imagination can develop one's play instinct—an inner need according to [[Carl Jung]]. Inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them, and to explore, and this internal drive brings about novel creations.&lt;ref&gt;The Lemelson Center's website, Invention at Play: Inventors' Stories, http://www.inventionatplay.org/inventors_main.html; and Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors (2004), p.14-15 by Evan I. Schwartz.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Edison]]: &quot;I never did a day's work in my life, it was all fun&quot;. Inventing can also be an obsession.

To invent is to see anew. Inventors often envision a new idea, seeing it in their mind's eye. New ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem; or when the focus is on something else; or even while relaxing or sleeping. A novel idea may come in a flash - a [[Eureka]]! moment. For example, after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity, the solution came to Einstein suddenly in a dream &quot;like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein: A Life by Denis Brian p.159 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Inventions can also be accidental, such as in the case of [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon).

Insight is also a vital element of invention. It may begin with questions, doubt or a [[Intuition (knowledge)|hunch]]. It may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration. For example, the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties, inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic-—an invention that won the Nobel Prize in 2000 and has led to innovative lighting, display screens, wallpaper and much more (see [[conductive polymer]], and [[organic light-emitting diode]] or [[PLED]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nobelprize.org, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/public.html ''The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Invention is often an exploratory process, with an outcome that is uncertain or unknown. There are failures as well as successes. Inspiration can start the process, but no matter how complete the initial idea, inventions typically have to be developed. Inventors believe in their ideas and they do not give up in the face of one or many failures. They are often famous for their perseverance, confidence and passion. 

Inventors may, for example, try to improve something by making it more effective, healthier, faster, more efficient, easier to use, serve more purposes, longer lasting, cheaper, more [[ecological]]ly friendly, or [[aesthetic]]ally different, e.g., lighter weight, more [[ergonomic]], structurally different, with new light or color properties, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Countless examples can easily be found by searching patents, such as on http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html &lt;/ref&gt;  Or an entirely new invention may be created such as the [[Internet]], [[email]], the [[telephone]] or [[electric light]]. Necessity may be the mother of invention, invention may be its own reward, or invention can create necessity.  Nobody ''needed'' a phonograph before Edison invented it, the need for it developed afterward. Likewise, few ever imagined the telephone or the airplane prior to their invention, but many people cannot live without these inventions now.&lt;ref&gt;Forks, Phonographs, and Hot Air Balloons: A Field Guide to Inventive Thinking p. 8 (1992), by Robert J. Weber, also from Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors, p. 13 (2004) by Evan I. Schwartz&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for an invention may be developed on paper or on a computer, by writing or drawing, by [[trial and error]], by making models, by [[experiment]]ing, by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form. As the dialogue between Picasso and Braque brought about Cubism, collaboration has spawned many inventions. Brainstorming can spark new ideas.  Collaborative creative processes are frequently used by designers, architects and scientists. Co-inventors are frequently named on patents. Now it is easier than ever for people in different locations to collaborate.  Many inventors keep [[inventor's notebook|records]] of their working process - [[inventor's notebook|notebooks]], photos, etc., including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and Albert Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;The Inventor's Notebook by Fred Grissom and David Pressman (2005); Leonardo da Vinci: Artist, Scientist, Inventor by Simona Cremante (2005), http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/jefferson_papers/; http://www.alberteinstein.info/about/&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of developing an invention, the initial idea may change. The invention may become simpler, more practical, it may expand, or it may even ''morph'' into something totally different. Working on one invention can lead to others too. There is only one country in the world that will grant patent rights for an invention that continues part of an invention in a previously filed patent—the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0200_201_08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of an invention and its use can be affected by practical considerations.  Some inventions are not created in the order that enables them to be most useful.  For example, the [[parachute]] was invented before powered [[flight]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Lynn: The Invention of the Parachute, ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 9, No. 3, (Jul., 1968), pp. 462-467&lt;/ref&gt;  There are inventions that are too expensive to produce and inventions that require scientific advancements that have not yet occurred.&lt;ref&gt;See US Patent #5,461,114 and D11,023 as well as Leonardo da Vinci: Artist, Scientist, Inventor by Simona Cremante (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  These barriers can erode or disappear as the economic situation changes or as science develops.  But history shows that turning an invention that is only an idea into reality can take considerable time, even centuries as demonstrated by inventions originally conceived by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] which are now in physical form and commonplace in our lives.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo da Vinci: Artist, Scientist, Inventor by Simona Cremante (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Interestingly, some invention that exists as only an idea and has never been made in reality can obtain patent protection.&lt;ref&gt;Patent It Yourself by David Pressman (2000), particularly section 9/2, as a specific example refer to 1879, F. Auguste Bartholdi U.S. Patent D11,023&lt;/ref&gt;

An invention can serve many purposes, these purposes might differ significantly and they may change over time.  An invention or a further developed version of it may serve purposes never envisioned by its original inventor(s) or even by others living at the time of its original invention.  As an example, consider all the kinds of [[plastic]] developed, their innumerable uses, and the tremendous growth this material invention is still undergoing today.&lt;ref&gt;Most information is directly from the Smithsonian Institution's Lemelson Center for Invention and Innovation, http://www.invention.smithsonian.org/home/, e.g., Invention at Play: Inventors' Stories,  http://www.inventionatplay.org/inventors_main.html and Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors (2004) by Evan I.

== Artistic invention ==

Invention has a long and important history in [[the arts]].  Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the [[creative process]].  While some inventions in the arts are [[patentable]], others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them.  (see [[patent]]).

=== Art, design and architecture ===

[[Art]] is continuously reinvented.  Many artists, designers, and architects think like inventors.  As they create, they may: explore beyond that which is known or obvious, push against barriers, change or discard conventions, and/or break into new territory.  Breaking the rules became the most valued attribute in art during the 20th century, with the highest acclaim going to conceptual innovation which frequently involved the invention of new genres.  For the first time the idea within the artwork was unmistakably more important than the tangible art object.  All kinds of artists have been inventing throughout history, and among their inventions are important contributions to visual art and other fields.

Some visual artists like [[Picasso]] become inventors in the process of creating art.  Inventions by other artists are separate from their art, such as  the scientific inventions of [[Leonardo da Vinci]].  Some inventions in visual art employ prior developments in science or technology.  For example, Picasso and [[Julio Gonzalez (sculptor)|Julio Gonzalez]] used welding to invent a new kind of sculpture, the form of which could be more open to light and air, and more recently, computer software has enabled an explosion of invention in visual art, including the invention of [[computer art]], and invention in [[photography]], [[film]], [[architecture]] and [[design]].  Like the invention of welded sculpture, other inventions in art are new mediums, new art forms, or both.  Examples are: the [[collage]] and the construction invented by Picasso, the [[Readymade]] invented by [[Marcel Duchamp]], the [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] invented by [[Alexander Calder]], the combine invented by [[Robert Rauschenberg]], the shaped painting invented by [[Frank Stella]], and the motion picture, the invention of which is attributed to [[Eadweard Muybridge]].&lt;ref&gt;www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Eadweard_Muybridge.aspx#1E1-Muybridg, and see www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/399928/Eadweard-Muybridge&lt;/ref&gt;  Art has been reinvented by developing new processes of creation.  For example, [[Jackson Pollock]] invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping, pouring, splashing and splattering paint onto unstretched canvas laying on the floor.  A number of art movements were inventions often created collaboratively, such as [[Cubism]] invented by Picasso and [[Braque]].  Substantial inventions in art, design and architecture were made possible by inventions and improvements in the tools of the trade.  The invention of [[Impressionist]] painting, for example, was possible because the prior invention of collapsible, resealable metal paint tubes facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors.  Inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses, as Alexander Calder's mobile is commonly used over babies' cribs today.  Funds generated from patents on inventions in art, design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work.  [[Frederic Auguste Bartholdi]]'s 1879 patent on the [[Statue of Liberty]] helped fund the statue currently in New York harbor because it covered small replicas.&lt;ref&gt;1879, F. Auguste Bartholdi U.S. Patent D11,023&lt;/ref&gt;.

Among other artists, designers and architects who are or were inventors are: [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Naum Gabo]], [[Frederick Hart (sculptor)|Frederick Hart]], [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], [[John La Farge]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Man Ray]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Henry N. Cobb]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Kenneth Snelson]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Chuck Hoberman|Chuck (Charles) Hoberman]] and Ingo Maurer.  Some of their inventions have been patented.  Others might have fulfilled the requirements of a patent, like [[Cubism|the Cubist image]].  There are also inventions in visual art that do not fit into the requirements of a patent.  Examples are inventions that cannot be differentiated from that which has already existed clearly enough for approval by government patent offices, such as Duchamp's Readymade and other conceptual works. Invention whose inventor or inventors are not known cannot be patented, such as the invention of [[abstract art]] or [[abstract painting]], [[oil painting]], [[Process Art]], [[Installation art]] and Light Art.  Also, when it cannot or has not been determined whether something was a first in human history or not, there may not be a patentable invention even though it may be considered an invention in the realm of art.  For example, Picasso is credited with inventing collage though this was done earlier in cultures outside of the western world.

Inventions in the visual arts that may be patentable might be new materials or mediums, new kinds of images, new processes, novel designs, or they may be a combination of these.  Inventions by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Frederick Hart (sculptor)|Frederick Hart]], [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], [[John La Farge]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Henry N. Cobb]], [[Chuck Hoberman|Chuck (Charles) Hoberman]] and others received patents.  The color, [[International Klein Blue]] invented by [[Yves Klein]] was patented in 1960 and used two years later in his sculpture.  Inventions by [[Kenneth Snelson]] which are crucial to his sculptures are patented.  R. Buckminster Fuller's famous [[geodesic dome]] is covered in one of his 28 US patents.  Ingo Maurer known for his lighting design has a series of patents on inventions in these works.  Many inventions created collaboratively by designers at [[IDEO]] Inc. have been patented.  Countless other examples can easily be found by searching patents at the websites of the Patent Offices of various countries, such as http://www.USPTO.gov.  Inventions in design can be protected in a special kind of patent called a &quot;[[design patent]]&quot;.  The first design patent was granted in 1842 to [[George Bruce (industrialist)|George Bruce]] for a new font.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2008/11/06/the-first-design-patent-2/id=242/&lt;/ref&gt;  See a database of patents in the arts at http://www.patenting-art.com/database/dbase1-e.htm.

== Implementation ==

Inventions get out into the world in different ways.  Some are sold, licensed or given away as products or services.  Simply exhibiting visual art, playing music or having a performance gets many artistic inventions out into the world.  Believing in the success of an invention can involve risk, so it can be difficult to obtain support and funding.  Grants, inventor associations, clubs and [[business incubator]]s can provide the mentoring, skills and resources some inventors need.  Success at getting an invention out into the world often requires passion for it and good [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;Inventors Assistance League http://www.inventions.org/; License Your Invention by Richard Stim (2002); http://inventorspot.com/; United Inventors Association, http://www.uiausa.org/; The Inventor's Bible: How to Market and License Your Brilliant Ideas by Ronald Louis Docie (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economic theory]], inventions are one of the chief examples of &quot;[[externality|positive externalities]]&quot;, a beneficial side-effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity.  One of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalized—unless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties, the parties will be under-rewarded for their inventions, and systematic under-rewarding will lead to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions.  The [[patent]] system captures those [[externality|positive externalities]] for the inventor or other patent owner, so that the economy as a whole will invest a more-closely-optimum amount of resources in the process of invention.

== Invention and innovation ==
In the social sciences, an innovation is anything new to a culture, whether it has been adopted or not.  The theory for adoption (or non-adoption) of an innovation, called [[diffusion of innovations]], considers the likelihood that an innovation will ever be adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or spur its adoption. This theory was first put forth by [[Everett Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;Diffusion of Innovations, 5th Edition by Everett Rogers (2003), also see http://www.ciadvertising.org/studies/student/98_fall/theory/hornor/paper1.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriel Tarde]] also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his ''Laws of Imitation''.&lt;ref&gt;Les lois de l'imitation Gabriel Tarde (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Etymology */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Creativity''' is the ability to generate innovative [[ideas]] and manifest them from [[thought]] into [[reality]]. The process involves original thinking and then producing.

The process of [[creation]] was historically reserved for [[deity|deities]] creating &quot;from nothing&quot; in [[Creationism]] and other [[creation myths]]. Over time, the term '''creativity''' came to include human [[innovation]], especially in [[art]] and [[science]] and led to the emergence of the [[creative class]].

==Etymology==
Creativity comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō&quot;, &quot;to create, make&quot;. The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of creativity have changed throughout history, as has the term itself. Originally in the [[Christianity|Christian]] period: ''creatio''&quot; came to designate God's act of ''[[Ex nihilo]]'', &quot;creation from nothing&quot;. &quot;&quot;Creatio''&quot; thus had a different meaning than &quot;''facere''&quot; (&quot;to make&quot;) and did not apply to human activities. The ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity persisted during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz80&quot;&gt;(Tatarkiewicz, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the term and the concept===
A shift occurred in modern times. [[Renaissance]] men developed a sense of their own independence, freedom, and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense. The first to actually apply the word, &quot;creativity&quot;, was the Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]], who applied it exclusively to poetry. For more than a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance because of the fact that the term &quot;creation&quot; was reserved for creation &quot;from nothing&quot;. [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) only would venture to write: &quot;Art is the completion of nature, as if it were ''a second Creator''...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greek concept of [[art]] (in Greek, τέχνη, ''téchnē''—the root of &quot;technique&quot; and &quot;technology&quot;), with the exception of [[poetry]], involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''. In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], this Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], pp. 244–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neither the Greek nor the Roman language had a word that directly corresponded to the word, &quot;creativity&quot;, Greco-Roman art, architecture, music, inventions, and discoveries provide numerous examples of what today would be described as creative works. The Greek scientist of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Archimedes]], experienced the creative moment in his [[Eureka (word)|Eureka]] experience, finding the answer to a problem he had been wrestling with for a long time. At the time, the concept of an external creative &quot;[[daemon]]&quot; (Greek) or &quot;[[genius]]&quot; (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine, probably came closest to describing the creative talents that brought forth such works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert99&quot;&gt;(Albert &amp; Runco, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory, and had been linked with the concept of [[imagination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz80&quot;/&gt;

The Western view of creativity can be contrasted with the Eastern view. For [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Confucianist]]s, [[Taoist]]s and [[Buddhist]]s, creation was at most a kind of discovery or mimicry, and the idea of creation &quot;from nothing&quot; had no place in these philosophies and religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert99&quot;/&gt;

In the West, by the 19th century not only had art come to be regarded as creative, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion of creativity in the sciences (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in nature (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was taken generally as the transference to the sciences of concepts that were proper to art.&lt;ref name= &quot;Tatarkiewicz80&quot;/&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes, and these insights were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]] (1926) and [[Max Wertheimer]] (1945).

However,the formal starting point to the scientific study of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[psychological]] literature, is generally considered to have been [[J.P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternberg99&quot;&gt;(Sternberg, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity and measuring it [[psychometric]]ally.

In parallel with these developments, other investigators have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are:
* [[Alex Osborn]]'s &quot;[[brainstorming]]&quot; (1950s to present),
* [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present),
* and [[Edward de Bono]]'s &quot;[[lateral thinking]]&quot; (1960s to present).

==Creative thought==
Creative thought is a mental process involving [[creative problem solving]] and the discovery of new [[idea]]s or [[concept]]s, or new associations of the existing ideas or concepts, fueled by the process of either conscious or unconscious [[insight]].

From a scientific point of view, the products of creative thought (sometimes referred to as [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thought]]) are usually considered to have both originality ''and'' appropriateness.

Although intuitively a simple phenomenon, it is in fact quite complex. It has been studied from the perspectives of [[behavioral psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[psychometrics]], [[cognitive science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[design research]], [[business]], and [[management]], among others. The studies have covered everyday creativity, exceptional creativity and even [[artificial creativity]]. Unlike many phenomena in science, there is no single, authoritative perspective or definition of creativity. And unlike many phenomena in psychology, there is no standardized measurement technique.

Creativity has been attributed variously to [[miracle|divine intervention]], [[cognitive]] processes, the [[social]] environment, [[trait theory|personality traits]], and [[randomness|chance]] (&quot;accident&quot;, &quot;[[serendipity]]&quot;). It has been associated with [[genius]], [[mental illness]], [[humor]] and [[REM sleep]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai&quot;/&gt; Some say it is a [[trait (biological)|trait]] we are born with; others say it can be taught with the application of [[creativity techniques|simple techniques]]. Creativity has also been viewed as a beneficence of a muse or [[muse]]s.

Although popularly associated with [[art]] and [[literature]], it is also an essential part of [[innovation]] and [[invention]] and is important in professions such as [[business]], [[economics]], [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[advertising]], [[game design]], [[mathematics]], [[music]], [[science]] and [[engineering]], and teaching.

Despite, or perhaps because of, the ambiguity and multi-dimensional nature of creativity, entire [[creative industries|industries]] have been spawned from the pursuit of creative ideas and the development of [[creativity techniques]].

[[File:Leonardo da Vinci helicopter and lifting wing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] is well known for his creative works.]]
Creativity has been associated with [[right brain|right or forehead brain activity]] or even specifically with [[lateral thinking]].

Some students of creativity have emphasized an element of [[randomness|chance]] in the creative process. [[Linus Pauling]], asked at a public lecture how one creates [[theory|scientific theories]], replied that one must endeavor to come up with ''many'' ideas, then discard the useless ones.

Another adequate definition of creativity, according to [[Otto Rank]], is that it is an &quot;assumptions-breaking process.&quot; Creative ideas are often generated when one discards preconceived assumptions and attempts a new approach or method that might seem to others unthinkable.

==Distinguishing between creativity and innovation==
It is often useful to explicitly distinguish between ''creativity'' and ''innovation''.

Creativity is typically used to refer to the act of producing new ideas, approaches or actions, while innovation is the process of both generating ''and applying'' such creative ideas in some specific context.

In the context of an organization, therefore, the term ''innovation'' is often used to refer to the entire process by which an organization generates creative new ideas and converts them into novel, useful and viable commercial products, services, and business practices, while the term ''creativity'' is reserved to apply specifically to the generation of novel ideas by individuals or groups, as a necessary step within the innovation process.

For example, Amabile et al. (1996) suggest that while [[innovation]] &quot;begins with creative ideas,&quot;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...creativity by individuals and teams ''is a starting point for innovation''; the first is a necessary ''but not sufficient'' condition for the second.&quot;&lt;ref name='(Amabile et al., 1996 p. 1154-1155, emphasis added)'&gt;{{cite journal |author=Amabile, T.M., R. Conti, H. Coon, et al. |year=1996 |title=Assessing the work environment for creativity |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=1154–1184 |doi=10.2307/256995 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/256995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the two words are novel, they go hand in hand. In order to be innovative, employees have to be creative to stay competitive.

==Creativity in psychology and cognitive science==
The study of the mental representations and processes underlying creative thought belongs to the domains of [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

A [[psychodynamic]] approach to understanding creativity was proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]], who suggested that creativity arises as a result of frustrated desires for fame, fortune, and love, with the energy that was previously tied up in frustration and emotional tension in the neurosis being sublimated into creative activity. Freud later retracted this view.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

===Graham Wallas===
[[Graham Wallas]], in his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a &quot;feeling&quot; that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness); and
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).

In numerous publications, Wallas' model is just treated as four stages, with &quot;intimation&quot; seen as a sub-stage. There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of &quot;incubation&quot; in Wallas' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref&gt;(Ward, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables &quot;forgetting&quot; of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name=&quot;Simonton99&quot;&gt;(Simonton, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

===J.P. Guilford===
[[J.P. Guilford|Guilford]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Guildford67&quot;&gt;(Guilford, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; performed important work in the field of creativity, drawing a distinction between [[convergent and divergent production]] (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.

===Arthur Koestler===
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Koestler64&quot;&gt;(Koestler, 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; lists three types of creative individual - the ''Artist'', the ''Sage'' and the ''Jester''.

Believers in this trinity hold all three elements necessary in [[business]] and can identify them all in &quot;truly creative&quot; [[company (law)|companies]] as well. Koestler introduced the concept of ''bisociation''—that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.

===Geneplore model===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the &quot;Geneplore&quot; model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Weisberg&lt;ref&gt;(Weisberg, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

===Conceptual blending===
In the '90s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]] and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M.J. Byrne|Byrne, R.M.J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological examples from science and mathematics==

===Jacques Hadamard===
[[Jacques Hadamard]], in his book ''Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field'', uses [[introspection]] to describe mathematical thought processes. In contrast to authors who identify [[language]] and [[cognition]], he describes his own mathematical thinking as largely wordless, often accompanied by [[mental images]] that represent the entire solution to a problem. He surveyed 100 of the leading physicists of his day (ca. 1900), asking them how they did their work. Many of the responses mirrored his own.

Hadamard described the experiences of the [[mathematician]]s/[[theoretical physicist]]s [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Henri Poincaré]] and others as viewing entire solutions with &quot;sudden spontaneity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hadamard, 1954, pp. 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same has been reported in literature by many others, such as Denis Brian,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian, 1996, p. 159&quot;&gt;Brian, 1996, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[G.H. Hardy]],&lt;ref&gt;G.H. Hardy cited how the mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] had &quot;moments of sudden illumination.&quot; See Kanigel, 1992, pp. 285-286.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Heitler]],&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Walter Heitler by John Heilbron (March 18, 1963. Archives for the History of Quantum Physics), as cited in and quoted from in Gavroglu, Kostas ''[[Fritz London]]: A Scientific Biography'' p. 45 (Cambridge, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[B.L. van der Waerden]],&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, 1992, p. 297 and 314. Cited work: B.L. van der Waerden, ''Einfall und Überlegung: Drei kleine Beiträge zur Psychologie des mathematischen Denkens'' (Gasel &amp; Stuttgart, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; and Harold Ruegg.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, 1992, p. 297 and 314. Cited work: Harold Ruegg, ''Imagination: An Inquiry into the Sources and Conditions That Stimulate Creativity'' (New York: Harper, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

To elaborate on one example, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], after years of fruitless calculations, suddenly had the solution to the general theory of relativity revealed in a dream &quot;like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian, 1996, p. 159&quot;/&gt;

Hadamard described the process as having steps (i) preparation, (ii) incubation, (iv) illumination, and (v) verification of the five-step [[Graham Wallas]] creative-process model, leaving out (iii) intimation, with the first three cited by Hadamard as also having been put forth by Helmholtz:&lt;ref&gt;Hadamard, 1954, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marie-Louise von Franz===
[[Marie-Louise von Franz]], a colleague of the eminent psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], noted that in these unconscious scientific discoveries the &quot;always recurring and important factor ... is the simultaneity with which the complete solution is intuitively perceived and which can be checked later by discursive reasoning.&quot; She attributes the solution presented &quot;as an [[archetypal]] pattern or image.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, 1992, pp. 297-298.&lt;/ref&gt; As cited by von Franz,&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, 1992 297-298 and 314.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Jung, &quot;Archetypes ... manifest themselves only through their ability to ''organize'' images and ideas, and this is always an unconscious process which cannot be detected until afterwards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, 1981, paragraph 440, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity and affect==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence.

===Creativity and positive affect relations===
According to Isen, positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

Fredrickson in her [[Broaden and Build Model]] suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

===Creativity and negative affect relations===
On the other hand, some theorists have suggested that negative affect leads to greater creativity. A cornerstone of this perspective is empirical evidence of a relationship between affective illness and creativity. In a study of 1,005 prominent 20th century individuals from over 45 different professions, the University of Kentucky's Arnold Ludwig found a slight but significant correlation between [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and level of creative achievement. In addition, several systematic studies of highly creative individuals and their relatives have uncovered a higher incidence of affective disorders (primarily [[bipolar disorder]] and depression) than that found in the general population.

===Creativity and affect at work===
Three patterns may exist between affect and creativity at work: positive (or negative) mood, or change in mood, predictably precedes creativity; creativity predictably precedes mood; and whether affect and creativity occur simultaneously.

It was found that not only might affect precede creativity, but creative outcomes might provoke affect as well. At its simplest level, the experience of creativity is itself a work event, and like other events in the organizational context, it could evoke emotion. Qualitative research and anecdotal accounts of creative achievement in the arts and sciences suggest that creative insight is often followed by feelings of elation. For example, Albert Einstein called his 1907 general theory of relativity &quot;the happiest thought of my life.&quot; Empirical evidence on this matter is still very tentative.

In contrast to the possible [[incubation (psychology)|incubation]] effects of affective state on subsequent creativity, the affective consequences of creativity are likely to be more direct and immediate. In general, affective events provoke immediate and relatively-fleeting emotional reactions. Thus, if creative performance at work is an affective event for the individual doing the creative work, such an effect would likely be evident only in same-day data.

Another longitudinal research found several insights regarding the relations between creativity and emotion at work. First, a positive relationship between positive affect and creativity, and no evidence of a negative relationship. The more positive a person's affect on a given day, the more creative thinking they evidenced that day and the next day—even controlling for that next day's mood. There was even some evidence of an effect two days later.

In addition, the researchers found no evidence that people were more creative when they experienced both positive and negative affect on the same day. The weight of evidence supports a purely linear form of the affect-creativity relationship, at least over the range of affect and creativity covered in our study: the more positive a person's affect, the higher their creativity in a work setting.

Finally, they found four patterns of affect and creativity affect can operate as an antecedent to creativity; as a direct consequence of creativity; as an indirect consequence of creativity; and affect can occur simultaneously with creative activity. Thus, it appears that people's feelings and creative cognitions are interwoven in several distinct ways within the complex fabric of their daily work lives.

==Creativity and intelligence==
{{Cerebrum map|Cerebral Cortex|caption=The [[frontal lobe]] (shown in blue) is thought to play an important role in creativity}}
There has been debate in the psychological literature about whether [[intelligence]] and creativity are part of the same process (the conjoint hypothesis) or represent distinct mental processes (the disjoint hypothesis). Evidence from attempts to look at correlations between intelligence and creativity from the 1950s onwards, by authors such as Barron, Guilford or Wallach and Kogan, regularly suggested that correlations between these concepts were low enough to justify treating them as distinct concepts.

Some researchers believe that creativity is the outcome of the same cognitive processes as intelligence, and is only judged as creativity in terms of its consequences, i.e. when the outcome of cognitive processes happens to produce something novel, a view which Perkins has termed the &quot;nothing special&quot; hypothesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHara99&quot;&gt;(O'Hara &amp; Sternberg, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

A very popular model is what has come to be known as &quot;the threshold hypothesis,&quot; proposed by [[Ellis Paul Torrance]], which holds that a high degree of intelligence appears to be a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary but not sufficient condition]] for high creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guildford67&quot;/&gt; This implies that, in a general sample, there will be a positive [[correlation]] between creativity and intelligence, but this correlation will not be found if only a sample of the most highly intelligent people are assessed. Research into the threshold hypothesis, however, has produced mixed results ranging from enthusiastic support to refutation and rejection.&lt;ref&gt;(Plucker &amp; Renzulli, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative perspective, Renzulli's three-rings hypothesis, sees giftedness as based on both intelligence and creativity. More on both the threshold hypothesis and Renzulli's work can be found in O'Hara and Sternberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHara99&quot;/&gt;

==Neurobiology of creativity==
The [[neurobiology]] of creativity has been addressed&lt;ref name=&quot;NeuroPsychiatry&quot;&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf (Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. &quot;Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms&quot; Neurocase (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; in the article &quot;Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms.&quot; The authors write that &quot;creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected.&quot; Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitters]] such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;(Flaherty, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working memory and the cerebellum===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the &quot;aha&quot; experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;) According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in &quot;forward&quot; cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

===REM sleep===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner U., Gais S., Haider H., Verleger R., Born J. (2004). Sleep inspires insight. Nature. 427(6972):352-5. PMID 14737168&lt;/ref&gt; [[REM sleep|REM]] rather than [[NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai&quot;&gt;Cai D.J., Mednick S.A., Harrison E.M., Kanady J.C., Mednick S.C. (2009). REM, not incubation, improves creativity by priming associative networks. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106: 10130–10134. PMID 19506253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker M.P., Liston C., Hobson J.A., Stickgold R. (2002). Cognitive flexibility across the sleep-wake cycle: REM-sleep enhancement of anagram problem solving. Brain Res Cogn Brain Res. 14(3):317-24. PMID 12421655&lt;/ref&gt; This has been suggested to be due to changes in [[cholinergic]] and [[noradrenergic]] neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai&quot;/&gt; During this period of sleep, high levels of acetylcholine in the [[hippocampus]] suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the [[neocortex]], and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hasselmo|Hasselmo M.E]]. (1999). Neuromodulation: acetylcholine and memory consolidation. Trends Cogn Sci. 3(9):351-359. PMID 10461198&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. It is proposed that REM sleep would add creativity by allowing &quot;neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cai&quot;/&gt;

==Creativity and mental health==
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm ([http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 Actual paper])&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, [[ambidexterity]] is also associated with [[schizotypal]] and [[schizophrenic]] individuals.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in '''[[writers]]''', '''[[poets]]''' and '''[[artists]]'''. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]].

==Measuring creativity==

===Creativity quotient===
Several attempts have been made to develop a ''creativity quotient'' of an individual similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ), however these have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;(Kraft, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Most measures of creativity are dependent on the personal judgement of the tester, so a standardized measure is difficult, if not impossible, to develop.

===Psychometric approach===
[[J.P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guildford67&quot;/&gt; which pioneered the modern [[psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966. They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

The [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach has been criticized by [[Robert Sternberg]] for falling &quot;short of distinguishing imagination from fantasy, relevant from irrelevant material, and contextually valid from rambling associations&quot;.

===Social-personality approach===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternberg99&quot;/&gt; Other researchers&lt;ref&gt;for example McCrae (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; have related creativity to the [[Big Five personality traits|trait]], ''openness to experience''.

===Other approaches to measurement===
[[Genrich Altshuller]] in the 1950s introduced approaching creativity as an ''exact science'' with [[TRIZ]] and a [[Level of Invention|Level-of-Invention]] measure.

The creativity of thousands of Japanese, expressed in terms of their problem-solving and problem-recognizing capabilities, has been measured in Japanese firms.&lt;ref&gt;Info: http://iccincsm.at.infoseek.co.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Gruber]] insisted on a case-study approach that expresses the existential and unique quality of the creator. Creativity to Gruber was the product of purposeful work and this work could be described only as a confluence of forces in the specifics of the case.

==Creativity in various contexts==
Creativity has been studied from a variety of perspectives and is important in numerous contexts. Most of these approaches are undisciplinary, and it is therefore difficult to form a coherent overall view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternberg99&quot;/&gt; The following sections examine some of the areas in which creativity is seen as being important.

===Creativity Profiles===
Creativity comes in different forms. There are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. There are four &quot;Creativity Profiles&quot; that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

===Creativity in diverse cultures===
Francois Jullien in &quot;Process and Creation, 1989&quot; is inviting us to look at that concept from a Chinese cultural point of view. Fangqi Xu&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cct.umb.edu/fangqi.pdf [[Fangqi Xu]], et al. ''A Survey of Creativity Courses at Universities in Principal Countries'']&lt;/ref&gt; has reported creativity courses in a range of countries. Todd Lubart has studied extensively the cultural aspects of creativity and innovation.

===Creativity in art and literature===
[[Image:HenryMoore RecliningFigure 1951.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Henry Moore]]'s ''Reclining Figure'']]
Most people associate creativity with the fields of [[art]] and [[literature]]. In these fields, ''originality'' is considered to be a sufficient condition for creativity, unlike other fields where both ''originality'' and ''appropriateness'' are necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabile98&quot;&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the different modes of artistic expression, one can postulate a continuum extending from &quot;[[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]&quot; to &quot;innovation&quot;. Established [[art movements|artistic movements]] and [[genre]]s pull practitioners to the &quot;interpretation&quot; end of the scale, whereas original thinkers strive towards the &quot;innovation&quot; pole. Note that we conventionally expect some &quot;creative&quot; people (dancers, actors, orchestral members, etc.) to perform (interpret) while allowing others (writers, painters, composers, etc.) more freedom to express the new and the different.

Contrast alternative theories, for example:
* [[artistic inspiration]], which provides the transmission of [[vision (religion)|visions]] from divine sources such as the [[Muse]]s; a taste of the Divine. Compare with [[invention]].
* artistic [[evolution]], which stresses obeying established (&quot;classical&quot;) rules and imitating or [[appropriation (art)|appropriating]] to produce subtly different but unshockingly understandable work. Compare with [[crafts]].
* artistic conversation, as in [[Surrealism]], which stresses the depth of communication when the creative product is the language.

In the [[art]] practice and [[theory]] of [[Davor Dzalto]], human creativity is taken as a basic feature of both the personal [[existence]] of [[human being]] and [[art]] production. For this thinker, creativity is a basic cultural and anthropological category, since it enables human manifestation in the world as a &quot;real presence&quot; in contrast to the progressive &quot;virtualization&quot; of the world.

===Creative industries and services===
Today, creativity forms the core activity of a growing section of the [[world economy|global economy]]—the so-called &quot;[[creative industries]]&quot;—capitalistically generating (generally non-tangible) [[wealth]] through the creation and [[exploitation]] of [[intellectual property]] or through the provision of [[creative services]]. The [http://www.culture.gov.uk/global/publications/archive_2001/ci_mapping_doc_2001.htm Creative Industries Mapping Document 2001] provides an overview of the creative industries in the UK. The [[creative professional]] workforce is becoming a more integral part of industrialized nations' economies.

Creative professions include writing, art, design, theater, television, radio, motion pictures, related crafts, as well as marketing, strategy, some aspects of scientific research and development, product development, some types of teaching and curriculum design, and more. Since many creative professionals (actors and writers, for example) are also employed in secondary professions, estimates of creative professionals are often inaccurate. By some estimates, approximately 10 million US workers are creative professionals; depending upon the depth and breadth of the definition, this estimate may be double.

===Creativity in other professions===
[[Image:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Isaac Newton]]'s [[law of gravity]] is popularly attributed to a ''creative leap'' he experienced when observing a falling apple.]]
Creativity is also seen as being increasingly important in a variety of other professions. [[Architecture]] and [[industrial design]] are the fields most often associated with creativity, and more generally the fields of [[design]] and [[design research]]. These fields explicitly value creativity, and journals such as ''Design Studies'' have published many studies on creativity and creative problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;for a typical example see (Dorst et al., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fields such as [[science]] and [[engineering]] have, by contrast, experienced a less explicit (but arguably no less important) relation to creativity. Simonton&lt;ref name=&quot;Simonton99&quot;/&gt; shows how some of the major scientific advances of the 20th century can be attributed to the creativity of individuals. This ability will also be seen as increasingly important for engineers in years to come.&lt;ref&gt;(National Academy of Engineering 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting has also been associated with creativity with the popular euphemism ''[[creative accounting]]''. Although this term often implies unethical practices, Amabile&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabile98&quot;/&gt; has suggested that even this profession can benefit from the (ethical) application of creative thinking.

===Creativity in organizations===
Amabile&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabile98&quot;/&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[extrinsic motivation]] – [[external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a [[reward]],
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right [[assignment]]s;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisory]] encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonaka91&quot;&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T.M. (1998). &quot;How to kill creativity&quot;. Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic views of creativity===
In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new.

Creativity is also seen by economists such as [[Paul Romer]] as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with &quot;3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance&quot; also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|creativity techniques}}
Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought).

Nickerson&lt;ref&gt;(Nickerson, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as &quot;stifling&quot; of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[pre-school]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children. Compare [[Waldorf School]].

A growing number of psychologists are supporting the idea that there are methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Several different researchers have proposed approaches to prop up this idea, ranging from [[psychological]]-cognitive, such as:
* Osborn-Parnes [[Creative Problem Solving Process]]
* [[Synectics]];
* Inventium and science-based creative thinking;
* Purdue Creative Thinking Program;

and
* [[lateral thinking]] (courtesy of [[Edward de Bono]]),

to the highly-structured, such as:
* [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving);
* [[Algorithm of Inventive Problems Solving|ARIZ]] (the [[Algorithm of Inventive Problems Solving|Algorithm of Inventive Problem-Solving]]), both developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]; and
* Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological analysis]].

==Understanding and enhancing the creative process with new technologies==
A simple but accurate [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WGR-4G65VJ1-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2005&amp;_alid=527112635&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=6829&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3ad4369ed718542426a8f4ace61c7d8f review] on this new Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) angle for promoting creativity has been written by Todd Lubart, an invitation full of creative ideas to develop further this new field.

Groupware and other Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) platforms are now the stage of Network Creativity on the web or on other private networks. These tools have made more obvious the existence of a more connective, cooperative and collective nature of creativity rather than the prevailing individual one. [http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Letaief:Rafik.html Creativity Research on Global Virtual Teams] is showing that the creative process is affected by the national identities, cognitive and conative profiles, anonymous interactions at times and many other factors affecting the teams members, depending on the early or later stages of the cooperative creative process. They are also showing how NGO's cross-cultural virtual team's innovation in Africa would also benefit from the pooling of best global practices online. Such tools enhancing cooperative creativity may have a great impact on society and as such should be tested while they are built following the Motto: &quot;Build the Camera while shooting the film&quot;. Some European FP7 scientific programs like [http://www.paradiso-fp7.eu/ Paradiso] are answering a need for advanced experimentally-driven research including large scale experimentation test-beds to discover the technical, societal, and economic implications of such groupware and collaborative tools to the Internet.

On the other hand, creativity research may one day be pooled with a computable metalanguage like [http://www.ieml.org IEML] from the University of Ottawa Collective Intelligence Chair, Pierre Levy. It might be a good tool to provide an interdisciplinary definition and a rather unified theory of creativity. The creative processes being highly fuzzy, the programming of cooperative tools for creativity and innovation should be adaptive and flexible. [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/em/publications/papers/091 Empirical Modelling] seems to be a good choice for Humanities Computing.

If all the activity of the universe could be traced with appropriate captors, it is likely that one could see the creative nature of the universe to which humans are active contributors. After the web of documents, the Web of Things might shed some light on such a universal creative phenomenon which should not be restricted to humans. In order to trace and enhance cooperative and collective creativity, Metis Reflexive Global Virtual Team has worked for the last few years on the development of a [http://www.iamot.org/conference/index.php/ocs/10/paper/view/1351/604 Trace Composer] at the intersection of personal experience and social knowledge.

Metis Reflexive Team has also identified a paradigm for the study of creativity to bridge European theory of &quot;useless&quot; and non-instrumentalized creativity, North American more pragmatic creativity and Chinese culture stressing more creativity as a holistic process of continuity rather than radical change and originality. This paradigm is mostly based on the work of the German philosopher Hans Joas, one that emphasizes the creative character of human action. This model allows also for a more comprehensive theory of action. Joas elaborates some implications of his model for theories of social movements and social change. The connection between concepts like creation, innovation, production and expression is facilitated by the [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=45339 creativity of action] as a metaphore but also as a scientific concept.

The Creativity and Cognition conference series, sponsored by the ACM and running since 1993, has been an important venue for publishing research on the intersection between technology and creativity. The conference now runs biennially, next taking place in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}}

==Social attitudes to creativity==
Although the benefits of creativity to society as a whole have been noted,&lt;ref&gt;(Runco 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; social attitudes about this topic remain divided. The wealth of literature regarding the development of creativity&lt;ref&gt;see (Feldman, 1999) for example&lt;/ref&gt; and the profusion of [[creativity techniques]] indicate wide acceptance, at least among academics, that creativity is desirable.

There is, however, a dark side to creativity, in that it represents a ''&quot;quest for a radical autonomy apart from the constraints of social responsibility&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;(McLaren, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, by encouraging creativity we are encouraging a departure from society's existing norms and values. Expectation of conformity runs contrary to the spirit of creativity. Sir Ken Robinson argues that the current education system is &quot;educating people out of their creativity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cod5az5EcX0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mddD1yGREKQ&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, employers are increasingly valuing creative skills. A report by the Business Council of Australia, for example, has called for a higher level of creativity in graduates.&lt;ref&gt;(BCA, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to &quot;[[think outside the box]]&quot; is highly sought after. However, the above-mentioned paradox may well imply that firms pay lip service to thinking outside the box while maintaining traditional, hierarchical organization structures in which individual creativity is not rewarded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sudoku are logic puzzles in which an array of boxes, each an array of numbers or other unique symbols, has been designed, so that each row and column in the overall array contains the complete list of allowed symbols, and each box also contains that same complete list.

The original and most common Sudoku consists of a 9 x 9 grid of cells, divided into nine 3 x 3 boxes, and the unique symbols are the numbers from one to nine. However, this is not a mathematical puzzle, and letters or other symbols could be used.

In the puzzle as presented, symbols are missing, and the object of the game is to find the unique pattern of symbols that satisfies the conditions, using logic. A presented puzzle with more than one possible solution would usually be considered defective.

#[[/4 by 4/]] (4 boxes of 4 cells, 2 x 2 each)
#[[/6 by 6/]] (6 boxes of 6 cells, 2 x 3 each)
#[[/9 by 9/]] (9 boxes of 9 cells, 3 x 3 each)
#[[/Sudoku X/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Books of Sudoku puzzles are very common, and typically categorize the Sudoku into Easy, Difficult, and Very Difficult. There is no clear standard for classification, and the Very Difficult puzzles of some books can be solved by relatively elementary techniques. However, all Sudoku require that the solver make no mistakes, or the puzzle becomes a mess and can be difficult to clean up.

The instructions found in these books all point out that one should never simply guess, except with very difficult Sudoku where one may choose one of two options, to solve by some variation of [[w:Ariadne's thread|Ariadne's thread]].

One approach to solving Sudoku is given at [[/Approach to solutions/]].

The following is an example of a relatively easy or moderate 9 x 9 Sudoku.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Temperature and Thermal Equilibrium ==

Seems appropriate start talking about thermodynamics defining the concept of '''Temperature''', however we should first note some intuitive notions from everyday life.

First of all, humans have awareness of temperature; we can sense cold and hot things, and we historically set a numerical value to that sensation (we'll see later how).

Then, we have to look at how evolve temperature. Let say that we have two litres of water separated and at different temperatures, say &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;. When we mix them, together they will get to a new temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;T_3&lt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;. So, we can say that the evolution of temperature have a direction towards equality. Note that although is not always this way, we are saying that a whole body have a temperature, so the two litres together are a perfect mix between the two litres separated.

We don't need to mix bodies to have equality of temperatures; experience tell us that bodies touching each other tend to equalize. So, we can say that two bodies are at the same temperatures when they don't change temperature if touching each other. It may seem obvious, but it's worth to put it that way. We are talking here of '''Thermal Equilibrium'''.

== Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics ==

As a direct consequence of the definition of thermal equality, is that temperature measure is ''transitive''; so, if we have three bodies, A,B and C, such that
:&lt;math&gt;T(A)=T(B)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;T(B)=T(C)&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;T(A)=T(C)&lt;/math&gt;.
This is known as '''Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics'''.

== The Thermometer ==

We should say that this property allow us to build a ''thermometer'', if we are able to translate temperature to a repeatable numeric value.
In the above example (two litres of water evolving to a new temperature), we used the same quantity of water. The temperature scale is based in taking the final temperature as
:&lt;math&gt;T_3=\frac{T_1+T_2}2&lt;/math&gt;
for different masses of water we would have the weighted average
:&lt;math&gt;T_3=\frac{m_1 T_1+ m_2 T_2}{m_1+m_2}&lt;/math&gt;
By changing the masses of water of known temperatures &lt;math&gt;T_1, T_2&lt;/math&gt; we could achieve by this mechanism every temperature between them and calibrate another (more comfortable) device that translates temperature to a repeatable numeric value.
The most common device of this kind is the mercury thermometer, which is practically a bulb connected to a thin tube (a capilar). It was seen that the space that the mercury occupies in the tube increases with temperature lineally, so
:&lt;math&gt;l-l_0=l_0\alpha(T-T_0) \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the occupied space, and &lt;math&gt;l_0&lt;/math&gt; is the space occupied at a reference temperature &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant (the ''linear thermal expansion coefficient''). Celsius chose the temperatures &lt;math&gt;T_1,T_2&lt;/math&gt; as the temperatures of solidification and condensation of water, setting them as &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;100&lt;/math&gt; and took the measure of a degree as a division of this range by 100. Fahrenheit instead, used the temperature of freezing brine as the &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; of the scale and the human temperature as 96 (the water solidification was set to 32°F). Later this scale was modified to have the condensation of water exactly 180°F above the solidification.

Note that to build a temperature scale, one used a thermal stable mixture, a mixture that maintain constant temperature for a while. This is easily achieved using a compound which is changing state, like melting ice: the water is at the temperature of the ice, because they are at thermal equilibrium; the water then tend to get hotter (to reach equilibrium with air), and also the ice is in this process; when the ice melts, it turns into more water, that stabilizes the equilibrium with the existing water. Additionally, it was seen that there's an anomaly at change of states: thermal equilibrium between water and ice, for example, can be reached above (liquid) or beneath (solid) the solidification temperature, but also at the very solidification temperature, having as the final product a mixture between liquid and solid, or just liquid or just solid. This phenomenon is known as '''latent heat''', and will be described further.


We have not given yet a definition of temperature. That's another story.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:9dots.svg|thumb|right|The &quot;nine dots&quot; puzzle. The goal of the puzzle is to link all 9 dots using four straight lines or less, without lifting the pen. One solution appears below.]]
'''Thinking outside the box''' (sometimes erroneously called &quot;[[Out of the box|thinking out of the box]]&quot; or &quot;thinking outside the square&quot;) is to think differently, unconventionally or from a new perspective.  This phrase often refers to novel, creative and smart thinking. 

This is sometimes called a process of [[Lateral thinking|lateral thought]].  The [[catchphrase]], or [[cliché]], has become widely used in business environments, especially by [[management consultant]]s and executive coaches, and has spawned a number of [[advertising slogan]]s. To think outside the box is to look further and try not to think of the obvious things, but try and think beyond that.

== Analogy==
A simplified definition for ''[[paradigm]]'' is a habit of reasoning or a [[conceptual framework]]. 

A simplified analogy is &quot;the box&quot; in the commonly used phrase &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;. What is encompassed by the words &quot;inside the box&quot; becomes analogous with what we know or what we assume.

Conservationist [[Lawrence Anthony]] acknowledges and rejects the paradigm analogy.  He argues &quot;I have never understood the saying 'To think outside the box.' Why would anyone sit inside of a box and then think outside of it. Rather just get out of the box.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

== Nine dots puzzle ==
[[Image:Ninedots.svg|thumb|right|One of many solutions to the puzzle at the beginning of this article is to go beyond the boundaries to link all dots in 4 straight lines.]]
The notion of something outside a perceived &quot;box&quot; is related to a traditional [[topography|topographical]] [[puzzle]] called the ''nine dots puzzle''.&lt;ref&gt;Kihn, Martin. [http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/95/debunk.html &quot;'Outside the Box': the Inside Story,&quot;] ''FastCompany'' 1995; Random House: [http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20000204 &quot;Outside the Box Thinking&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The origins of the phrase &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; are obscure; but it was popularized in part because of a nine-dot puzzle, which [[John Adair]] claims to have introduced in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;The Art of Creative Thinking: How to Be Innovative and Develop Great Ideas&lt;/ref&gt; [[Management consultant]] [[Mike Vance]] has claimed that the use of the nine-dot puzzle in consultancy circles stems from the [[corporate culture]] of the [[Walt Disney Company]], where the puzzle was used in-house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativethinkingassoc.com/mikevance.html Biography of Mike Vance] at Creative Thinking Association of America.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The puzzle proposed an intellectual challenge&amp;mdash;to connect the dots by drawing four straight, continuous lines that pass through each of the nine dots, and never lifting the pencil from the paper.  The [[conundrum]] is easily resolved, but only if you draw the lines outside the confines of the square area defined by the nine dots themselves.  The phrase &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; is a restatement of the solution strategy.  The puzzle only seems difficult because we imagine a boundary around the edge of the dot array.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kies, [http://papyr.com/hypertextbooks/comp2/9dots.htm  &quot;English Composition 2: Assumptions: Puzzle of the Nine Dots&quot;], retr. Jun. 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The heart of the matter is the unspecified barrier which is typically perceived.

[[Image:Eggpuzzle.jpg|thumb|right|''Christopher Columbus's Egg Puzzle'' as it appeared in [[Sam Loyd]]'s ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles''.]]
The nine dots puzzle is much older than the slogan. It appears in [[Sam Loyd]]'s 1914 ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles''.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Loyd, ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles''. (The Lamb Publishing Company, 1914)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1951 compilation ''The Puzzle-Mine: Puzzles Collected from the Works of the Late [[Henry Ernest Dudeney]]'', the puzzle is attributed to Dudeney himself.&lt;ref&gt;J. Travers, ''The Puzzle-Mine: Puzzles Collected from the Works of the Late Henry Ernest Dudeney''. (Thos. Nelson, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sam Loyd's original formulation of the puzzle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpuzzle.com/loyd/cop300-301.html Facsimile from ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles'' - Columbus's Egg Puzzle is on right-hand page]&lt;/ref&gt; entitled it as &quot;[[Christopher Columbus]]'s egg puzzle.&quot;  This was an allusion to the story of [[Egg of Columbus]].

==Metaphor of a &quot;box” is real==
&quot;The &quot;box&quot; in the phrase &quot;outside the box&quot; is not only a metaphor&amp;mdash;it is real, measurable. Speculating beyond its restrictive confines the box can be both: 
:(a) positive&amp;mdash; fostering creative leaps as in generating wild ideas (the conventional use of the term);&lt;ref&gt;Lupick, Travis. [http://www.straight.com/article-158377/clone-wars-galactic-task &quot;Clone Wars proved a galactic task for production team.&quot;] ''[[The Georgia Straight]]'', August 21, 2008; &quot;...  budgetary constraints forced the production team to &lt;u&gt;think outside the box in a positive way&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and 
:(b) negative&amp;mdash; penetrating through to the &quot;bottom of the box.&quot; This could result in a frank and insightful re-appraisal of a situation, oneself, the organization, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;bandrowski&quot;&gt;Bandrowski, James F. ''et al.'' (2009). ''Discover Your Inner Strength'', p. __.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the process of thinking &quot;inside the box&quot; isn't always a bad thing. It is crucial for accurately parsing and executing a variety of tasks &amp;mdash; making decisions, analyzing data, and managing the progress of standard operating procedures, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;bandrowski&quot;/&gt;

Hollywood screenwriter [[Ira Steven Behr]] appropriated this concept to inform plot and character in the context of a television series.  Behr imagined a core character:
:He is going to be &quot;thinking outside the box,&quot;, you know, and usually when we use that cliche, we think outside the box means a new thought. So we can situate ourselves back in the box, but in a somewhat better position&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiumhollywood.com/2009/08/03/tca-tour-you-asked-for-it-ira-steven-behrs-opening-remarks TCA Tour – You Asked For It: Ira Steven Behr’s opening remarks]&lt;/ref&gt;
Behr also speculated about what happens next in a multi-stage [[design thinking]] process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of [[creativity]] have changed throughout history, as has the [[terminology|term]] itself.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concept of art (in Greek, &quot;''techne''&quot; — the root of &quot;technique&quot; and &quot;technology&quot;), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''.  In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].

Under [[medieval]] [[Christianity]], the [[Latin]] &quot;''creatio''&quot; came to designate [[God]]'s act of &quot;''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''&quot; (&quot;creation from nothing&quot;); thus &quot;''creatio''&quot; ceased to apply to human activities.  The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status:  it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.

[[Renaissance]] men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity.  The first to apply the word &quot;creativity,&quot; however, was the 17th-century Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] — but he applied it only to poetry.  For over a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance, due to the fact that the term &quot;creation&quot; was reserved for creation &quot;from nothing.&quot;

In the 19th century, art took its revenge:  now not only was art recognized as creativity, but ''it alone'' was.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[sciences]] and in [[nature]], this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.

==Term and concept==
[[Image:Platon-2.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Plato]]]]
The [[ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to &quot;to create&quot; or &quot;creator.&quot;  The expression &quot;''poiein''&quot; (&quot;to make&quot;) sufficed.  And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or &quot;maker&quot;) who ''made'' it.  [[Plato]] asks in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', &quot;Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?&quot; and answers, &quot;Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]].&quot;  To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules.  Art (in Greek, &quot;''techne''&quot;) was &quot;the making of things, according to rules.&quot;  It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it ''had''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas:  an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of art had a distinct premise:  [[Nature]] is [[perfection|perfect]] and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that ''optimum'' which he can attain.  The artist was a [[discovery (observation)|discoverer]], not an [[inventor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245&quot;&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:M-T-Cicero.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Cicero]]]]
The sole exception to this Greek view — a ''great'' exception — was poetry.  The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely ''imitated''.  And the poet, unlike the artist, was ''not'' bound by laws.  There were no terms corresponding to &quot;creativity&quot; or &quot;creator,&quot; but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates.  And only he was so understood.  In music, there was no freedom:  melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as &quot;''nomoi''&quot; (&quot;laws&quot;).  In the [[visual arts]], freedom was limited by the [[Body proportions|proportions]] that [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]] had established for the human frame, and which he called &quot;the canon&quot; (meaning, &quot;measure&quot;).  [[Plato]] argued in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model.  Later the [[Roman Republic|Roman]], [[Cicero]], would write that art embraces those things &quot;of which we have knowledge&quot; (&quot;''quae sciuntur''&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Quintus Horatius Flaccus.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Horace]]]]
Poets saw things differently.  Book I of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' asks, &quot;Why forbid the singer to please us with singing ''as he himself will?''&quot;  [[Aristotle]] had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth:  it was, rather, the realm of that &quot;which is neither true nor false.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken.  [[Horace]] wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to (&quot;''quod libet audendi''&quot;).  In the declining period of antiquity, [[Philostratus]] wrote that &quot;one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have [[imagination]] in common.&quot;  [[Callistratos]] averred that &quot;Not only is the art of the poets and [[prose|prosaist]]s inspired, but likewise the hands of [[sculptor]]s are gifted with the blessing of divine [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]].&quot;  This was something new:  [[classical Greece|classical Greeks]] had not applied the [[concept]]s of [[imagination]] and inspiration to the [[visual arts]] but had restricted them to poetry.  [[Latin]] was richer than Greek:  it had a term for &quot;creating&quot; (&quot;''creatio''&quot;) and for &quot;''creator'',&quot; and had ''two'' expressions — &quot;''facere''&quot; and &quot;''creare''&quot; — where Greek had but one, &quot;''poiein''.&quot;  Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gesta Theodorici - Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus (c 485 - c 580).jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Cassiodorus]]]]
A fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period:  &quot;''creatio''&quot; came to designate [[God]]'s act of &quot;creation from nothing&quot; (&quot;''creatio ex nihilo''&quot;).  &quot;''Creatio''&quot; thus took on a different meaning than &quot;''facere''&quot; (&quot;to make&quot;), and ceased to apply to human functions.  As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure [[Cassiodorus]] wrote, &quot;things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247&quot;&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this new, [[religion|religious]] interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Later [[medieval]] men such as [[Hraban the Moor]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]] in the 13th century, thought much the same way.  The [[Middle Ages]] here went even further than [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; they made no exception of poetry:  it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore [[craft]] and not creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Michelango Portrait by Volterra.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Michelangelo]]]]
All this changed in modern times.  [[Renaissance]] men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity.  The philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] wrote that the artist &quot;thinks up&quot; (&quot;''excogitatio''&quot;) his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, [[Leon Battista Alberti]], that he &quot;preordains&quot; (&quot;''preordinazione''&quot;); [[Raphael]], that he shapes a painting according to his idea; [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that he employs &quot;shapes that do not exist in nature&quot;; [[Michelangelo]], that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; [[Giorgio Vasari]], that &quot;nature is conquered by art&quot;; the Venetian art theoretician, [[Paolo Pino]], that painting is &quot;inventing what is not&quot;; [[Paolo Veronese]], that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; [[Federico Zuccari]] (1542–1609), that the artist shapes &quot;a new world, new paradises&quot;; [[Cesare Cesariano]] (1483–1541), that architects are &quot;demi-gods.&quot;  Among musicians, the [[Holland|Dutch]] composer and musicologist [[Jan Tinctoris]] (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as &quot;one who produces ''new'' songs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Sarbiewski.gif|thumb|left|70px|[[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski|Sarbiewski]]]]
Still more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry:  [[G.P. Capriano]] held (1555) that the poet's invention springs &quot;from nothing.&quot;  [[Francesco Patrizi]] (1586) saw poetry as &quot;fiction,&quot; &quot;shaping,&quot; &quot;transformation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248&quot;&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, &quot;creation.&quot;  He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640), known as &quot;the last Latin poet.&quot;  In his treatise, ''De perfecta poesi'', he not only wrote that a poet &quot;invents,&quot; &quot;after a fashion builds,&quot; but also that the poet &quot;''creates anew''&quot; (&quot;''de novo creat''&quot;).  Sarbiewski even added:  &quot;in the manner of God&quot; (&quot;''instar Dei''&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Baltasar-gracian.gif|thumb|100px|[[Baltasar Gracián|Gracián]]]]
Sarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists.  &quot;Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject.&quot;  As late as the end of the 17th century, [[André Félibien]] (1619–75) would write that the painter is &quot;so to speak [a] creator.&quot;  The Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski:  &quot;Art is the completion of nature, as it were ''a second Creator''...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Voltaire.jpg|thumb|left|90px|[[Voltaire]]]]
By the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory.  It was linked with the concept of [[imagination]], which was on all lips. [[Joseph Addison]] wrote that the imagination &quot;has something in it like creation.&quot;  [[Voltaire]] declared (1740) that &quot;the true poet is creative.&quot;  With both these authors, however, this was rather only a ''comparison'' of poet with creator.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Greuze Portrait of Diderot.jpg|thumb|right|60px|[[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]]]
Other writers took a different view.  [[Denis Diderot]] felt that imagination is merely &quot;the memory of forms and contents,&quot; and &quot;creates nothing&quot; but only combines, magnifies or diminishes.  It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance.  [[Charles Batteux]] wrote that &quot;The human mind ''cannot create'', strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature.&quot;  [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues]] (1715–47), and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249&quot;&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source.  The expression, &quot;creation,&quot; was then reserved for creation ''ex nihilo'' ({{lang-la|from nothing}}), which was inaccessible to man.  Second, creation is a mysterious act, and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] psychology did not admit of mysteries.  Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules.  The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by [[Houdar de la Motte]], 1715) that rules ultimately are a ''human invention''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Henri Bergson.jpg|thumb|left|70px|[[Henri Bergson|Bergson]]]]
In the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity.  Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but ''it alone'' was so regarded.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[science]]s (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in [[nature]] (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249&quot;/&gt;

The start of the ''scientific'' study of creativity is sometimes taken as [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the subject.

Other students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are [[Alex Osborn]]'s &quot;[[brainstorming]]&quot; (1950s to present), [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present), and [[Edward de Bono]]'s &quot;[[lateral thinking]]&quot; (1960s to present).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Creativity techniques''' are methods that promote original thoughts by facilitating divergent and/or convergent thinking.  Some techniques require groups of two or more people while other techniques can be accomplished alone.  These methods include word games, written exercises and different types of improvisation.  Creativity techniques can be used to develop new materials for artistic purposes or to solve problems.

Most creativity techniques use associations between the goal (or the problem), the current state (which may be an imperfect solution to the problem), and some stimulus (possibly selected randomly). There is an [[analogy]] between many creativity techniques and methods of [[evolutionary computation]].

==Randomness==

[[Randomness]], or [[aleatory]], is the introduction of [[chance]] elements. Aleatory is commonly found in music, art, and literature, particularly in poetry.  In film, [[Andy Voda]] made a movie in 1979 called &quot;Chance Chants&quot; which he produced by a flip of a coin, or roll of a dice. In music, [[John Cage]], an avant-garde musician, composed music by superimposing star maps on blank sheet music, by rolling dice, and by preparing open ended scores that depended on the spontaneous decisions of the performers. (1) Other ways of practicing randomness include coin tossing, picking something out of a hat, or selecting random words from a dictionary.

In short, aleatory is a way to introduce new thoughts or ideas into a creative process.

==Improvisation==

[[Improvisation]] is a creative process which can be spoken, written, or composed without prior preparation.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/improvisation&lt;/ref&gt;
Improvisation, also called extemporization, can lead to the discovery of new ways to act, new patterns of thought and practices, or new structures. Improvisation is used in the creation of music, theatre, and other various forms.  Many artists also use improvisational techniques to help their creative flow.

Here are two significant methods:

* '''Improvisational Theater''' is a form of theater in which actors use improvisational acting techniques to perform spontaneously. Many “improv” techniques are taught in standard drama classes. The basic skills of listening, clarity, confidence, and performing instinctively and spontaneously are considered important skills for actors to develop.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cognos.com/newsletter/decisions/st_070307_01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Free Improvisation''' is real time composition. Musicians of all kinds “improv” music; this music is not limited to particular genre. Two contemporary musicians that use free improvisation are [[Anthony Braxton]] and [[Cecil Taylor]].  Through free improvisation, musicians can develop increased spontaneity and fluency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musilosophy.com/jazz-improvisation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Each type of improvisation improves the thinking and acting skill of the actor, this is made by using no practise, a similar set of techniques is called  ''[[Alienation]]'' since one of its many techniques uses actors that haven't rehearsed or even read the play, improvisation is an acting skill where actors make up a storyline, start and ending on the spot and actors have to try their best to keep in character.

==Problem Solving==

In [[problem-solving]] contexts, the random word creativity technique is perhaps the simplest method. A person confronted with a problem is presented with a randomly generated word, in the hopes of a solution arising from any associations between the word and the problem. A random image, sound, or article can be used instead of a random word as a kind of creativity goad or [[provocation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ideaflow.corante.com/archives/2003/05/09/more_on_idea_generation_tools_and_techniques.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic Applications==

[[Projective therapy]] is a form of psychotherapy which uses synthesis to produce original interpretation and problem solving strategies. Fiction is read in the form of a novel or observed in the form of a film. In this therapeutic technique, patients analyze the fictional work and immerse themselves in this fictional world. Rather than focusing on their problems, they analyze the author- or actors- motivation, plot-development and cinematography during the group process. By reading/viewing many consecutive works during this process, the patients are able to achieve a creative link between their own issues and those of the fictional characters. This synthesis is usually unique to each individual since it bypasses the conscious and directly accesses the  unconscious by linking with semiotic objects and archetypes which populated this otherwise inaccessible part of the mental process.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini. Use of fiction in therapy. Psychiatric Times. 18(7):56-57,2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was first used by Dr. A James Giannini  at Yale University using the [[World of Tiers]] science-fiction series written by [[Philip Jose Farmer]]. A later novel in this series, [[Red Orc's Rage]], was produced by both Farmer and Giannini. This particular novel reviewed the technique of projective therapy; the use of the creativity unleashed in this process: and the evolution of the Tiers series itself.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini. Afterword. In PJ Farmer, Red Orc's Rage. New York, NY. Tor Press, 1990. Pp. 280-282.ISBN 0-312-85036-0&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Creative problem solving''' is the mental process of creating a solution to a problem. It is a special form of [[problem solving]] in which the solution is independently created rather than learned with assistance.

Creative problem solving always involves [[creativity]]. However, creativity often does not involve creative problem solving, especially in fields such as music, poetry, and art. Creativity requires newness or novelty as a characteristic of what is created, but creativity does not necessarily imply that what is created has value or is appreciated by other people.

To qualify as creative problem solving the solution must either have value, clearly solve the stated problem, or be appreciated by someone for whom the situation improves.&lt;ref name =&quot;Fobes1993&quot;&gt;Richard Fobes, ''The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox: A Complete Course in the Art of Creating Solutions to Problems of Any Kind'' (1993) ISBN 0-96-322210-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation prior to the solution does not need to be labeled as a problem. Alternate labels include a challenge, an opportunity, or a situation in which there is room for improvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

Solving school-assigned homework problems does not usually involve creative problem solving because such problems typically have well-known solutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

If a created solution becomes widely used, the solution becomes an innovation and the word [[innovation]] also refers to the process of creating that innovation. A widespread and long-lived innovation typically becomes a new tradition. &quot;All innovations [begin] as creative solutions, but not all creative solutions become innovations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt; Some innovations also qualify as inventions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

[[Inventing]] is a special kind of creative problem solving in which the created solution qualifies as an invention because it is a useful new object, substance, process, software, or other kind of marketable entity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

==Techniques and tools==
Many of the techniques and tools for creating an effective solution to a problem are described in [[creativity techniques]] and [[problem solving]].

Creative-problem-solving techniques can be categorized as follows:
* Creativity techniques designed to shift a person's mental state into one that fosters creativity. These techniques are described in [[creativity techniques]]. One such popular technique is to take a break and relax or sleep after intensively trying to think of a solution.
* Creativity techniques designed to reframe the problem. For example, reconsidering one's goals by asking &quot;What am I really trying to accomplish?&quot; can lead to useful insights.
* Creativity techniques designed to increase the quantity of fresh ideas. This approach is based on the belief that a larger number of ideas increases the chances that one of them has value. Some of these techniques involve randomly selecting an idea (such as choosing a word from a list), thinking about similarities with the undesired situation, and hopefully inspiring a related idea that leads to a solution. Such techniques are described in [[creativity techniques]].
* Creative-problem-solving techniques designed to efficiently lead to a fresh perspective that causes a solution to become obvious. This category is useful for solving especially challenging problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt; Some of these techniques involve identifying independent dimensions that differentiate (or separate) closely associated concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt; Such techniques can overcome the mind's instinctive tendency to use &quot;oversimplified associative thinking&quot; in which two related concepts are so closely associated that their differences, and independence from one another, are overlooked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

The following formalized and well-known methods and processes combine various creativity and creative-problem-solving techniques:
* [[TRIZ]], which is also known as Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS), was developed by [[Genrich Altshuller]] and his colleagues based on examining more than 200,000 patents.&lt;!--40,000 is mentioned in TRIZ article--&gt; This method is designed to foster the creation and development of patentable inventions, but is also useful for creating non-product solutions.
* [[Mind mapping]] is a creativity technique that both reframes the situation and fosters creativity.
* [[Brainstorming]] is a group activity designed to increase the quantity of fresh ideas. Getting other people involved can help increase knowledge and understanding of the problem and help participants reframe the problem.
* [[Edward de Bono]] has published numerous books that promote an approach to creative problem solving and creative thinking called [[lateral thinking]].
* The [[Creative Problem Solving Process]] (CPS) is a six-step method developed by [[Alex Osborn]] and [[Sid Parnes]] that alternates convergent and divergent thinking phases.

A frequent approach to teaching creative problem solving is to teach [[critical thinking]] in addition to creative thinking, but the effectiveness of this approach is not proven. As an alternative to separating critical and creative thinking, some creative-problem-solving techniques focus on either reducing an idea's disadvantages or extracting a flawed idea's significant advantages and incorporating those advantages into a different idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fobes1993&quot;/&gt;

Creative-problem-solving tools typically consist of software or manipulatable objects (such as cards) that facilitate specific creative-problem-solving techniques. [[Electronic meeting system]]s provide a range of interactive tools for creative-problem-solving by groups over the Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Creative Problem Solving Process''' (CPS), also known as the Osborn-Parnes CPS process, was developed by [[Alex Osborn]] and [[Sid Parnes|Dr. Sidney J. Parnes]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://creativeproblemsolving.com/ |title=Creative Problem Solving: Resources for CPS Practitioners |accessdate=2010-06-08 |publisher=OmniSkills, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; CPS is a structured method for generating novel and useful solutions to problems. CPS follows three process stages, which match a person's natural creative process, and six explicit steps:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeeducationfoundation.org/?page_id=41 What is CPS?]. Creative Education Foundation, 2010. Retrieved on 2010-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
! Process Stage !! Steps
|-
| rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | Explore the Challenge || Objective Finding (identify the goal, wish or challenge)
|-
| Fact Finding (gather the relevant data)
|-
| Problem Finding (clarify the problems that need to be solved in order to achieve the goal)
|-
| Generate Ideas || Idea Finding (generate ideas to solve the identified problem)
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Prepare for Action || Solution Finding (move from idea to implementable solution)
|-
| Acceptance Finding (plan for action)
|}

CPS is flexible, and its use depends on the situation. The steps can be (and often are) used in a linear fashion, from start to finish, but it is not necessary to use all the steps. For example, if one already has a clearly-defined problem, the process would begin at Idea Finding.

What distinguishes the Osborn-Parnes CPS process from other &quot;creative problem solving&quot; methods is the use of both divergent and convergent thinking during each process step, and not just when generating ideas to solve the problem. Each step begins with divergent thinking, a broad search for many alternatives. This is followed by convergent thinking, the process of evaluating and selecting.

This method is taught at the [[International Center for Studies in Creativity]],&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.buffalostate.edu/creativity/graduatecourses.xml |title=ICSC Course Descriptions |accessdate=2007-12-22 |publisher=International Center for Studies in Creativity }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Creative Problem Solving Institute,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://cpsiconference.com/ |title=Creative Problem Solving Institute |accessdate=2007-12-22 |publisher=Creative Education Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Creativity European Association|CREA Conference]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.creaconference.com/EN/core-programs.html |title=Programs |accessdate=2008-01-07 |work=CREA Conference |publisher=[[Creativity European Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is specifically acknowledged as a key influence for the [[Productive Thinking Model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hurson | first = Tim | coauthors = | title = Think Better: An Innovator's Guide to Productive Thinking | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages = xii | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0071494939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Mind map guidelines */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Guru Mindmap.jpg|thumb|300px|A hand-drawn mind map]]
A '''mind map''' is a [[diagram]] used to represent [[words]], [[idea]]s, tasks, or other items linked to and arranged around a central key word or idea. Mind maps are used to [[generation|generate]], [[creative visualization|visualize]], [[structure]], and [[taxonomic classification|classify]] ideas, and as an aid to [[study skills|studying]] and [[organization| organizing]] information, [[problem solving|solving problems]], [[decision making|making decisions]], and writing.

The elements of a given mind map are arranged intuitively according to the importance of the concepts, and are classified into groupings, branches, or areas, with the goal of representing [[semantic]] or other connections between portions of information. Mind maps may also aid recall of existing [[memory|memories]].

By presenting ideas in a radial, graphical, non-linear manner, mind maps encourage a [[brainstorming]] approach to planning and organizational tasks. Though the branches of a mindmap represent hierarchical tree structures, their radial arrangement disrupts the prioritizing of concepts typically associated with hierarchies presented with more linear visual cues. This orientation towards brainstorming encourages users to enumerate and connect concepts without a tendency to begin within a particular conceptual framework.

The mind map can be contrasted with the similar idea of [[concept mapping]]. The former is based on radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s denoting relationships with a central governing concept, whereas concept maps are based on connections between concepts in more diverse patterns.

==Characteristics==
Mind maps are, by definition, a graphical method of taking notes. Their visual basis helps one to distinguish words or ideas, often with colors and symbols. They generally take a hierarchical or tree branch format, with ideas branching into their subsections. Mind maps allow for greater creativity when recording ideas and information, as well as allowing the note-taker to associate words with visual representations. Mind maps differ from concept maps in that mind maps focus on ''only'' one word or idea, whereas concept maps connect multiple words or ideas.

A key distinction between mind maps and modelling graphs is that there is no rigorous right or wrong with mind maps, relying on the arbitrariness of [[mnemonic]] systems. A [[UML Diagram]] or a [[Semantic network]] has structured elements modelling relationships, with lines connecting objects to indicate relationship. This is generally done in black and white with a clear and agreed iconography. Mind maps are for a different purpose, being collections of words structured by the mental context of the author with visual mnemonics to help in memory and organisation; therefore, though the use of colour, icons and visual links is informal, it is necessary to the proper functioning of the mind map.

==Mind map guidelines==
[[Image:MindMapGuidlines.JPG|thumb|300px|Mind map of mind map instructions]]
In his books on Mind Maps author [[Tony Buzan]] gives the following instructions for creating Mind Maps:

#Start in the centre with an image of the topic, the size of a large wristwatch or &quot;OK&quot; hand-gester, using at least 3 colours. 
#Draw a curved line out from the centre image, the same length as the word/image that will go on the line.
#On this line either draw the image you want or write the word using upper or lower case letters.
#Each word/image must be alone and sitting on its own line, this unleashs your creativity. 
#The lines must be organic, flowing and connected to each other lines and the central image. The central lines are thicker, becoming thinner as they radiate out from the centre. 
#Use colours &amp;#8211; your own symbols and code &amp;#8211; throughout the Mind Map. 
#Develop your own personal style of Mind Mapping. 
#Use images, symbols, numbers, codes and dimensions throughout your Mind Map. 
#Use emphasis and show associations in your Mind Map. 
#Keep the Mind Map clear by using radiant hierarchy.

==History==
Pictorial methods for recording knowledge and modelling systems have been used for centuries in learning, [[brainstorming]], memory, [[visual thinking]], and [[problem solving]] by educators, engineers, psychologists, and others. Some of the earliest examples of such graphical records were developed by [[Porphyry of Tyros]], a noted thinker of the 3rd century, as he graphically visualized the concept categories of [[Aristotle]]. Philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] (1235–1315) also used such techniques.

The [[semantic network]] was developed in the late 1950s as a theory to understand human learning and developed further by [[Allan M. Collins]] and [[M. Ross Quillian]] during the early 1960s.

[[United Kingdom|British]] [[popular psychology]] author [[Tony Buzan]] claims to have invented modern mind mapping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 Buzan claims mind mapping his invention in interview.] ''KnowledgeBoard'' retrieved Jan. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the idea was inspired by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]] as popularized in science fiction novels, such as those of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[A.E. van Vogt]]. Buzan argues that while &quot;traditional&quot; outlines force readers to scan left to right and top to bottom, readers actually tend to scan the entire page in a non-linear fashion. Buzan also uses popular assumptions about the [[cerebral hemispheres]] in order to promote the exclusive use of mind mapping over other forms of note making.

The mind map continues to be used in various forms, and for various applications including learning and education (where it is often taught as &quot;webs&quot;, &quot;mind webs&quot;, or &quot;webbing&quot;), planning, and in engineering diagramming.

When compared with the [[concept map]] (which was developed by learning experts in the 1970s) the structure of a mind map is a similar radial, but is simplified by having one central key word.

==Uses==
[[Image:Mindmap.gif|thumb|Rough mindmap notes taken during a course session]]
A mind map is often created around a single word or text, placed in the center, to which associated ideas, words and concepts are added.

Mind maps have many applications in personal, family, [[education]]al, and [[business]] situations, including [[notetaking]], brainstorming (wherein ideas are inserted into the map radially around the center node, without the implicit prioritization that comes from hierarchy or sequential arrangements, and wherein grouping and organizing is reserved for later stages), summarizing, revising, and general clarifying of [[thought]]s. One could listen to a lecture, for example, and take down notes using mind maps for the most important points or keywords. One can also use mind maps as a [[mnemonic techniques|mnemonic technique]] or to sort out a complicated idea. Mind maps are also promoted as a way to collaborate in color pen creativity sessions.

Mind maps can be used for:
* problem solving
* outline/framework design
* anonymous collaboration
* marriage of words and visuals
* individual expression of creativity
* condensing material into a concise and memorable format
* team building or synergy creating activity
* enhancing work morale

Despite these direct use cases, data retrieved from mind maps can be used to enhance several other applications, for instance [[expert system|expert search systems]], [[search engine|search engines]] and search and tag query recommender&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Jöran | last=Beel | first2=Bela| last2=Gipp | first3=Jan-Olaf |last3= Stiller | contribution=Information Retrieval On Mind Maps - What Could It Be Good For? | contribution-url=http://www.sciplore.org/publications_en.php | title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom'09) | year=2009 | publisher=IEEE | place=Washington | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;[[Category:Articles with inconsistent citation formats]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. To do so, mind maps can be analysed with classic methods of [[information retrieval]] to classify a mind map's author or documents that are linked from within the mind map&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mindmaps can be drawn by hand, either as &quot;rough notes&quot; during a lecture or meeting, for example, or can be more sophisticated in quality. An example of a rough mind map is illustrated. There are also a number of [[List_of_mind_mapping_software|software packages]] available for producing mind maps.

==Effectiveness in learning==
Buzan&lt;ref name=&quot;buzan&quot;&gt;[[Tony Buzan|Buzan, Tony]]. (2000). ''The Mind Map Book'', [[Penguin Books]], 1996. ISBN 978-0452273221&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the mind map is a vastly superior note taking method because it does not lead to a &quot;semi-hypnotic trance&quot; state induced by other note forms. Buzan also argues that the mind map uses the full range of left and right human cortical skills, balances the brain, taps into the alleged &quot;99% of your [[common misconceptions about the brain|unused mental potential]]&quot;, as well as [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] (which he calls &quot;superlogic&quot;). However, scholarly research suggests that such claims may actually be [[marketing]] [[Promotion (marketing)|hype]] based on [[common misconceptions about the brain#About function|misconception]]s about the [[brain]] and the cerebral hemispheres. Critics argue that hemispheric specialization theory has been identified as pseudoscientific when applied to mind mapping.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2000) [[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]]. Facts on file. ISBN 978-0816033515&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrand, Hussain, and Hennessy (2002) found that [[spider diagram]]s (similar to concept maps) had a limited but significant impact on memory recall in undergraduate students (a 10% increase over baseline for a 600-word text only) as compared to preferred study methods (a 6% increase over baseline). This improvement was only robust after a week for those in the diagram group and there was a significant decrease in motivation compared to the subjects' preferred methods of note taking. Farrand et al. suggested that learners preferred to use other methods because using a mind map was an unfamiliar technique, and its status as a &quot;memory enhancing&quot; technique engendered reluctance to apply it. Nevertheless the conclusion of the study was ''&quot;Mind maps provide an effective study technique when applied to written material. However before mind maps are generally adopted as a study technique, consideration has to be given towards ways of improving motivation amongst users.&quot;''&lt;ref name= Farrand2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farrand, P. |coauthors=Hussain, F.; Hennessy, E. |year=2002 |title=The efficacy of the mind map study technique |journal=Medical Education |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=426–431 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118952400/abstract |accessdate=2009-02-16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01205.x |pmid=12028392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressley, VanEtten, Yokoi, Freebern, and VanMeter (1998) found that learners tended to learn far better by focusing on the content of learning material rather than worrying over any one particular form of note taking.&lt;ref&gt;Pressley, M., VanEtten, S., Yokoi, L., Freebern, G., &amp; VanMeter, P. (1998). &quot;The metacognition of college studentship: A grounded theory approach&quot;. In: D.J. Hacker, J. Dunlosky, &amp; A.C.

==Tools==
[[List of mind mapping software|Mind mapping software]] can be used effectively to organize large amounts of information, combining [[spatial]] organization, dynamic hierarchical structuring and node folding. Software packages can extend the concept of mind mapping by allowing individuals to map more than thoughts and ideas with information on their computers and the internet, like spreadsheets, documents, internet sites and images.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Brainstorming''' is a [[creativity technique|group creativity technique]] designed to generate a large number of [[ideas]] for the solution of a [[problem]]. In 1953 the method was popularized by [[Alex Faickney Osborn]] in a book called ''Applied Imagination.'' Osborn proposed that groups could double their creative output with brainstorming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborn, A.F. 1963&quot;&gt;Osborn, A.F. (1963) ''Applied imagination: Principles and procedures of creative problem solving'' (Third Revised Edition). New York, NY: Charles Scribner’s Son.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent politically-correct movement is claiming the word &quot;brainstorm&quot; is offensive to epileptics, whose attacks are sometimes referred to as such, so the expression &quot;ideas shower&quot; has been suggested.

Although brainstorming has become a popular group technique, when applied in a traditional group setting, researchers have not found evidence of its effectiveness for enhancing either quantity or quality of ideas generated. Because of such problems as distraction, [[social loafing]], evaluation apprehension, and [[production blocking]], conventional brainstorming groups are little more effective than other types of groups, and they are actually less effective than individuals working independently.&lt;ref&gt;Nijstad, B. A., Stroebe, W. Lodewijkx, H. F. M. (2003). Production blocking and idea generation: Does blocking interfere with cognitive processes? ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', ''39'', 531-548.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, M., &amp; Stroebe, W. (1991). Productivity loss in idea-generating groups: tracking down the blocking effect. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''61'', 392-403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, B., Johnson, C., &amp; Salas, E. (1991). Productivity loss in brainstorming groups: a meta-analytic integration. ''Basic and Applied Social Psychology''. ''12'', 3-23.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Encyclopedia of Creativity, [[Tudor Rickards]], in his entry on brainstorming, summarizes its controversies and indicates the dangers of conflating productivity in group work with quantity of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Rickards, T., (1999) Brainstorming, M Runco &amp; S Pritzker, Eds, Encyclopedia of Creativity, San Diego: Academic Press Vol 1 219-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although traditional brainstorming does not increase the productivity of groups (as measured by the number of ideas generated), it may still provide benefits, such as boosting morale, enhancing work enjoyment, and improving [[team work]]. Thus, numerous attempts have been made to improve brainstorming or use more effective variations of the basic technique.

Professor Olivier Toubia of Columbia University has conducted extensive research in the field of idea generation and has concluded that incentives are extremely valuable within the brainstorming context.&lt;ref&gt;Toubia, Olivier, &quot;Idea Generation, Creativity, and Incentives,&quot; ''Marketing Science'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

From these attempts to improve brainstorming, [[electronic meeting system|electronic brainstorming]] stands out. Mainly through [[anonymity|anonymization]] and [[parallelization]] of input, electronic brainstorming enforces the ground rules of effective brainstorming and thereby eliminates most of the deleterious or inhibitive effects of [[group work]].&lt;ref&gt;Nunamaker, J., Dennis, A. R., Valacich, J. S., Vogel, D. R. and George, J. F. (1991), &quot;Electronic Meeting Systems to Support Group Work,&quot; Communications of the ACM, Vol. 34, No. 7, pp. 40-61&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects of electronic brainstorming become more pronounced with group size.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, A. R. and Valacich, J. S. (1993), &quot;Computer Brainstorms:  More Heads are Better than One,&quot; Journal of Applied Psychology, Vol. 78, No. 4, pp. 531-537.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ground Rules==
There are four basic rules in brainstorming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborn, A.F. 1963&quot;&gt;Osborn, A.F. (1963) ''Applied imagination: Principles and procedures of creative problem solving'' (Third Revised Edition). New York, NY: Charles Scribner’s Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; These are intended to reduce social inhibitions among group members, stimulate idea generation, and increase overall creativity of the group.
#'''Focus on quantity''': This rule is a means of enhancing divergent production, aiming to facilitate problem solving through the maxim ''quantity breeds quality''. The assumption is that the greater the number of ideas generated, the greater the chance of producing a radical and effective solution.
#'''Withhold criticism''': In brainstorming, [[criticism]] of ideas generated should be put 'on hold'. Instead, participants should focus on extending or adding to ideas, reserving criticism for a later 'critical stage' of the process. By suspending judgment, participants will feel free to generate unusual ideas.
#'''Welcome unusual ideas''': To get a good and long list of ideas, unusual ideas are welcomed. They can be generated by looking from new perspectives and suspending assumptions. These new ways of thinking may provide better solutions.
#'''Combine and improve ideas''': Good ideas may be combined to form a single better good idea, as suggested by the slogan &quot;1+1=3&quot;. It is believed to stimulate the building of ideas by a process of [[Association (psychology)|association]]..

[[Image:Activity preperation.svg|thumb|300px|right|Process of preparing for a brainstorming session]]

==Method==
===Set the problem===
Before a brainstorming session, it is critical to define the problem. The problem must be clear, not too big, and captured in a specific question such as &quot;What service for mobile phones is not available now, but needed?&quot;. If the problem is too big, the facilitator should break it into smaller components, each with its own question.

===Create a background memo===
The background memo is the invitation and informational letter for the participants, containing the session name, problem, time, date, and place. The problem is described in the form of a question, and some example ideas are given. The memo is sent to the participants well in advance, so that they can think about the problem beforehand.

===Select participants===
The facilitator composes the brainstorming panel, consisting of the participants and an idea collector. A group of 10 or fewer members is generally more productive. Many variations are possible but the following composition is suggested.

* Several core members of the project who have proved themselves.
* Several guests from outside the project, with affinity to the problem.
* One idea collector who records the suggested ideas.

===Create a list of lead questions===
During the brainstorm session the creativity may decrease. At this moment, the facilitator should stimulate creativity by suggesting a lead question to answer, such as ''Can we combine these ideas?'' or ''How about looking from another perspective?''. It is best to prepare a list of such leads before the session begins.

===Session conduct===
The facilitator leads the brainstorming session and ensures that ground rules are followed. The steps in a typical session are:

# A warm-up session, to expose novice participants to the criticism-free environment. A simple problem is brainstormed, for example ''What should be the CEO's retirement present?'' or ''What can be improved in Microsoft Windows?''.
# The facilitator presents the problem and gives a further explanation if needed.
# The facilitator asks the brainstorming group for their ideas.
# If no ideas are forthcoming, the facilitator suggests a lead to encourage creativity.
# All participants present their ideas, and the idea collector records them.
# To ensure clarity, participants may elaborate on their ideas.
# When time is up, the facilitator organizes the ideas based on the topic goal and encourages discussion.
# Ideas are categorized.
# The whole list is reviewed to ensure that everyone understands the ideas.
# Duplicate ideas and obviously infeasible solutions are removed.
# The facilitator thanks &lt;shubham&gt; and gives each a token of appreciation.

===The process===
* Participants who have ideas but were unable to present them are encouraged to write down the ideas and present them later.
* The idea collector should number the ideas, so that the chairperson can use the number to encourage an idea generation goal, for example: ''We have 44 ideas now, let’s get it to 50!''.
* The idea collector should repeat the idea in the words he or she has written verbatim, to confirm that it expresses the meaning intended by the originator.
* When many participants are having ideas, the one with the most associated idea should have priority. This is to encourage elaboration on previous ideas.
* During a brainstorming session, managers and other superiors may be discouraged from attending, since it may inhibit and reduce the effect of the four basic rules, especially the generation of unusual ideas.

===Evaluation===
Brainstorming is not just about generating ideas for others to evaluate and select. Usually the group itself will, in its final stage, evaluate the ideas and select one as the solution to the problem proposed to the group.
* The solution should not require resources or skills the members of the group do not have or cannot acquire.
* If acquiring additional resources or skills is necessary, that needs to be the first part of the solution.
* There must be a way to measure progress and success.
* The steps to carry out the solution must be clear to all, and amenable to being assigned to the members so that each will have an important role.
* There must be a common decision making process to enable a coordinated effort to proceed, and to reassign tasks as the project unfolds.
* There should be evaluations at milestones to decide whether the group is on track toward a final solution.
* There should be incentives to participation so that participants maintain their efforts.

==Variations==
===Nominal group technique===
The nominal group technique is a type of brainstorming that encourages all participants to have an equal say in the process. It is also used to generate a ranked list of ideas.

Participants are asked to write their ideas anonymously. Then the [[Chairman|moderator]] collects the ideas and each is voted on by the group. The vote can be as simple as a show of hands in favor of a given idea. This process is called distillation.

After distillation, the top ranked ideas may be sent back to the group or to subgroups for further brainstorming. For example, one group may work on the color required in a product. Another group may work on the size, and so forth. Each group will come back to the whole group for ranking the listed ideas. Sometimes ideas that were previously dropped may be brought forward again once the group has re-evaluated the ideas.

It is important that the facilitator be trained in this process before attempting to facilitate this technique. The group should be primed and encouraged to embrace the process. Like all team efforts, it may take a few practice sessions to train the team in the method before tackling the important ideas.

===Group passing technique===
Each person in a circular group writes down one idea, and then passes the piece of paper to the next person in a clockwise direction, who adds some thoughts. This continues until everybody gets his or her original piece of paper back. By this time, it is likely that the group will have extensively elaborated on each idea.

The group may also create an &quot;Idea Book&quot; and post a distribution list or routing slip to the front of the book. On the first page is a description of the problem. The first person to receive the book lists his or her ideas and then routes the book to the next person on the distribution list. The second person can log new ideas or add to the ideas of the previous person. This continues until the distribution list is exhausted. A follow-up &quot;read out&quot; meeting is then held to discuss the ideas logged in the book. This technique takes longer, but it allows individuals time to think deeply about the problem.

===Team idea mapping method===
This method of brainstorming works by the method of [[Association (psychology)|association]]. It may improve collaboration and increase the quantity of ideas, and is designed so that all attendees participate and no ideas are rejected.

The process begins with a well-defined topic. Each participant brainstorms individually, then all the ideas are merged onto one large idea map. During this consolidation phase, participants may discover a common understanding of the issues as they share the meanings behind their ideas. During this sharing, new ideas may arise by the association, and they are added to the map as well. Once all the ideas are captured, the group can prioritize and/or take action.

===Electronic brainstorming===
Electronic brainstorming is a computerized version of the manual brainstorming technique. It is typically supported by an [[electronic meeting system]] (EMS) but simpler forms can also be done via email and may be browser based, or use peer-to-peer software.

With an electronic meeting system, participants share a list of ideas over the Internet. Ideas are entered independently. Contributions become immediately visible to all and are typically [[anonymiz]]ed to encourage openness and reduce personal prejudice. Modern EMS also support asynchronous brainstorming sessions over extended periods of time as well as typical follow-up activities in the [[creative problem solving|creative-problem-solving]] process such as categorization of ideas, elimination of duplicates, assessment and discussion of prioritized or controversial ideas.

Electronic brainstorming eliminates many of the problems of standard brainstorming, such as production blocking and evaluation apprehension. An additional advantage of this method is that all ideas can be archived electronically in their original form, and then retrieved later for further thought and discussion. Electronic brainstorming also enables much larger groups to brainstorm on a topic than would normally be productive in a traditional brainstorming session.&lt;ref&gt;Gallupe, R. B., Dennis, A. R., Cooper, W. H., Valacich, J. S., Bastianutti, L. M. and Nunamaker, J. F. (1992), &quot;Electronic Brainstorming and Group Size,&quot; Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 35, No. 2, pp. 350-369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some web based brainstorming techniques allow contributors to post their comments anonymously through the use of avatars.  This technique also allows users to log on over an extended time period, typically one or two weeks, to allow participants some &quot;soak time&quot; before posting their ideas and feedback.  This technique has been used particularly in the field of new product development, but can be applied in any number of areas where collecting and evaluating ideas would be useful.

===Directed brainstorming===
Directed brainstorming is a variation of electronic brainstorming (described above). It can be done manually or with computers. Directed brainstorming works when the solution space (that is, the criteria for evaluating a good idea) is known prior to the session.  If known, that criteria can be used to intentionally constrain the [[Ideation (Idea Generation)|ideation]] process.

In directed brainstorming, each participant is given one sheet of paper (or electronic form) and told the brainstorming question. They are asked to produce one response and stop, then all of the papers (or forms) are randomly swapped among the participants. The participants are asked to look at the idea they received and to create a new idea that improves on that idea based on the initial criteria. The forms are then swapped again and respondents are asked to improve upon the ideas, and the process is repeated for three or more rounds.

In the laboratory, directed brainstorming has been found to almost triple the productivity of groups over electronic brainstorming.&lt;ref&gt;Santanen, E., Briggs, R. O., &amp; de Vreede, G-J. (2004). Causal Relationships in Creative Problem Solving: Comparing Facilitation Interventions for Ideation.  ''Journal of Management Information Systems''. ''20(4)'', 167-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual brainstorming===
&quot;Individual Brainstorming&quot; is the use of brainstorming on a solitary basis. It typically includes such techniques as [[free writing]], free speaking, word association, and drawing a [[mind map]], which is a visual note taking technique in which people diagram their thoughts. Individual brainstorming is a useful method in [[creative writing]] and has been shown to be superior to traditional group brainstorming.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A., &amp; Yazdanpanahi, T. (1995). Personality differences and group versus individual brainstorming. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', ''19'', 73-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Question Brainstorming===
This process involves brainstorming the ''questions'', rather than trying to come up with immediate answers and short term solutions. This technique stimulates creativity and promotes everyone's participation because no one has to come up with answers. The answers to the questions form the framework for constructing future action plans. Once the list of questions is set, it may be necessary to prioritize them to reach to the best solution in an orderly way.&lt;ref&gt;Ludy, Perry J. Profit Building: Cutting Costs Without Cutting People. San Francisco: Berret-Koehler, Inc, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another of the problems for brainstorming can be to find the best evaluation methods for a problem.

Brainstorming all the questions has also been called ''questorming''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pynthan.com/vri/questorm.htm Questorming: An Outline of the Method], Jon Roland, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Brainstorming is a popular method of group interaction in both educational and business settings. Although it does not provide a measurable advantage in creative output, conventional brainstorming is an enjoyable exercise that is typically well received by participants. [[Electronic meeting system|Electronic brainstorming]] effectively overcomes barriers inherent in group work like [[production blocking]] mainly through anonymization and parallelization of contributions.&lt;ref&gt;McFadzean, E. S. (1997), “Improving Group Productivity with Group Support Systems and Creative Problem Solving Techniques”, Creativity and Innovation Management, Vol. 6, No. 4, pp. 218-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Other variations of brainstorming that do not require an electronic system may also prove superior to the original technique. How well these methods work, and whether or not they should be classified as brainstorming, are questions that require further research.

==Controversy over term==

Some governmental organisations (The Welsh Development Agency and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast) have reached the conclusion that the term 'brainstorming' is offensive to people with [[epilepsy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Epilepsy Action, 2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/node/1078] Epilepsy Action, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[political correctness]]) and have suggested the alternative &quot;thought-showers&quot;. However, research by the National Society for Epilepsy found of those affected by epilepsy questioned, 93% considered the term inoffensive. A specific comment states that changes need not be made since that could promote an undesirable image of epileptics being easily offended&lt;ref name=&quot;Epilepsy Action, 2005&quot;/&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''6-3-5 Brainwriting ''' (also known as the 6-3-5 Method, or Method 635) is a group creativity technique used in marketing, advertising, design, writing and product development originally developed by Professor Bernd Rohrbach in 1968&lt;ref&gt;''Rohrbach, Bernd'': &quot;Kreativ nach Regeln – Methode 635, eine neue Technik zum Lösen von Problemen&quot;. ''Creative by rules - Method 635, a new technique for solving problems'' first published in the German sales magazine &quot;Absatzwirtschaft&quot;, Volume 12, 1969. p73-75 and Volume 19, 1 October 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Based on the concept of [[../Brainstorming/]], the aim of 6-3-5 Brainwriting is to generate 108 new ideas in half an hour. In a similar way to brainstorming, it is not the quality of ideas that matters but the quantity.

The technique involves 6 participants who sit in a group and are supervised by a moderator. Each participant thinks up 3 ideas every 5 minutes. Participants are encouraged to draw on others' ideas for inspiration, thus stimulating the creative process. After 6 rounds in 30 minutes the group has thought up a total of 108 ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''TRIZ''' ({{pron-en|ˈtriːz}})  is a [[Romanization of Russian|romanized]] [[acronym]] for {{lang|ru|Теория решения изобретательских задач}} (''{{transl|ru|ALA|'''T'''eoriya '''R'''esheniya '''I'''zobretatelskikh '''Z'''adatch}}'') meaning &quot;The theory of solving inventor's problems&quot; or &quot;The theory of inventor's problem solving&quot;. It was developed by a Soviet engineer and researcher [[Genrich Altshuller]] and his colleagues starting in 1946. It has been evolving ever since.

Today,  TRIZ is a [[methodology]], tool set, [[knowledge base]], and model-based technology for generating innovative ideas and solutions for [[problem solving]]. TRIZ provides tools and methods for use in problem formulation, [[system analysis]], [[failure analysis]], and patterns of system evolution (both 'as-is' and 'could be'). TRIZ, in contrast to techniques such as [[brainstorming]] (which is based on random idea generation), aims to create an [[algorithm|algorithmic approach]] to the invention of new systems, and the refinement of old systems.

Some TRIZ is in the public domain. Some TRIZ resides in knowledge bases held by commercial consulting organizations. A complete and open TRIZ development process is not yet evident. Various camps vie for control of TRIZ and interpretation of its findings and applications.

== History ==

Since childhood, Altshuller showed his talents as an inventor. When he was just 15 years old he received his first certificate of the authorship of invention for an underwater apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;The USSR did not issue [[patent]]s to its citizens because it outlawed private property. Instead it issued certificates of authorship as an acknowledgment of the fact that a person is the author of an invention.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, at the age of 20, Altshuller developed his first mature invention - a method for escaping from an immobilized submarine without diving gear. In the late 1940s he worked in the &quot;Inventions Inspection&quot; department of the [[Caspian Sea]] [[flotilla]] of the [[Soviet Navy]] in [[Baku]]. Altshuller's job was to inspect invention proposals, help document them, and help others to invent. By 1969 he reviewed about 40,000 [[patent]] abstracts in order to find out in what way the [[innovation]] had taken place. He eventually developed [[40 Principles of Invention]], several [[Laws of Technical Systems Evolution]], the concepts of technical and physical [[contradiction]]s that creative inventions resolve, the concept of [[Ideality (TRIZ)|Ideality]] of a system and numerous other theoretical and practical approaches; together, this extensive work represents a unique contribution to the development of [[creativity]] and inventive [[problem-solving]].

By examining a large database of his own and other people's inventions, Altshuller soon arrived at his most important observation:
:''Inventing is the removal of a technical contradiction with the help of certain principles''

To develop a method for inventing, he argued, one must scan a large number of inventions, identify the contradictions underlying them, and formulate the principle used by the inventor for their removal. His process utilizes both [[inductive reasoning]] and [[abductive reasoning]] to arrive at general laws and principles for inventive systems based on the empirical data for patents.

His results are being applied to solve creative invention problems not just within all branches of [[engineering]], but within many other technical and non-technical fields as well.



The tools developed under Altshuller's leadership were
* [[40 Principles of Invention|40 Principles]] 1946-1971
* [[ARIZ]] - Algorithm of Inventive Problems Solving, 1959–1985
* [[Separation Principles]] 1973-1985
* [[Substance-Field Analysis]] 1973-1985
* [[Standard Solutions]] 1975-1985
* [[Natural Effects]] (Scientific Effects) 1970-1980
* [[Patterns of Evolution]] 1975-1980
The different schools for TRIZ and individual practitioners have continued to improve and add to the methodology.

==Effectiveness==

According to commercial promoters of TRIZ, as a collage of concepts and tools TRIZ has been employed by many [[Fortune 500]] companies in the United States and other countries to solve manufacturing problems and create new products. These promoters claim that companies such as [[BAE Systems]],  [[Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Boeing]], [[Philips Semiconductors]], [[Samsung]], [[LG Electronics]], and many others have used TRIZ concepts to systematically solve complex technical and organizational problems. They also claim that the use of TRIZ has been expanding into other areas, and that TRIZ has been used successfully in [[biomedicine|biomedical research]], [[medicine]], [[computer programming]], [[business management]], etc. These claims have not been independently confirmed. TRIZ is being used in Intel [http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2008/03/inside_innovation_at_intel.php] and GE [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2008/tc20081223_490913.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_technology] and P&amp;G[http://www.insightcentre.com/triz.html] and more examples can be found in press.

== Structure of TRIZ ==
'''[[ARIZ]]''' consists of a program (sequence of actions) for the exposure and solution of contradictions, i.е. the solution of problems. ARIZ includes: the program itself, information safeguards supplied by the knowledge base (shown by an arrow in fig.1.1), and methods for the control of psychological factors, which are a component part of the methods for developing a creative imagination. Furthermore, sections of ARIZ are predetermined for the selection of problems and the evaluation of the received solution.

Su-Field Analysis (structural substance-field analysis) produces a structural model of the initial technological system, exposes its characteristics, and with the help of special laws, transforms the model of the problem. Through this transformation the structure of the solution that eliminates the shortcomings of the initial problem is revealed. Su-Field Analysis is a special language of formulas with which it is possible to easily describe any technological system in terms of a specific (structural) model. A model produced in this manner is transformed according to special laws and regularities, thereby revealing the structural solution of the problem.

Classification of a system of standard solutions for inventive problems, as well as the standards themselves, is built on the basis of ''Su-Field Analysis'' of technological systems. Su-Field Analysis is also a component part of the program ARIZ (shown by arrows in fig. 1).

The use of different elements of TRIZ for specific functions are shown in Table 1: &quot;Functions and Structure of TRIZ.&quot; A system of laws for the development of technology, a system of standards for the solution of inventive problems, and Su-Field Analysis are used to forecast the development of technology, to search for and select problems, and to evaluate the received solution. For the development of a creative imagination, all elements of TRIZ can be used, although particular stress is given to methods for developing a creative imagination.
The solution of inventive problems is realized with the help of laws for the development of technological systems, the knowledge base, Su-Field Analysis, ARIZ, and, in part, with the help of methods for the development of a creative imagination.

By means of TRIZ, both known and unknown types of problems could be solved. Known (standard) types of inventive problems are solved with the use of the knowledge base, and unknown (nonstandard) – with the use of АRIZ. As experience grows, solutions for a class of known types of problems increase and exhibit a structure.

At the present time, computer programs have been developed on the basis of TRIZ that try to provide intellectual assistance to engineers and inventors during the solution of technological problems. These programs also try to reveal and forecast emergency situations and undesirable occurrences.

=== Identifying a problem: contradictions ===
Altshuller believed that inventive problems stem from [[contradiction]]s (one of the basic TRIZ concepts) between two or more elements, such as, &quot;If we want more acceleration, we need a larger engine; but that will increase the cost of the car,&quot; that is, more of something desirable also brings more of something less desirable, or less of something else also desirable.

These are called Technical Contradictions by Altshuller. He also defined so-called physical or inherent contradictions: More of one thing and less of the same thing may both be desired in the same system. For instance, a higher temperature may be needed to melt a compound more rapidly, but a lower temperature may be needed to achieve a homogeneous mixture.

An inventive situation might involve several such contradictions. The inventor typically ''trades'' one contradictory parameter for another; no special inventiveness is needed for that. Rather, the inventor would develop some creative approach for ''resolving'' the contradiction, such as inventing an engine that produces more acceleration without increasing the cost of the engine.

=== Inventive principles and the matrix of contradictions===
Altshuller screened patents in order to find out what kind of contradictions were resolved or dissolved by the invention and the way this had been achieved. From this he developed a set of 40 inventive principles and later a [[Matrix of Contradictions]]. Rows of the matrix indicate the [[39 system features]] that one typically wants to improve, such as speed, weight, accuracy of measurement and so on. Columns refer to typical undesired results. Each matrix cell points to principles that have been most frequently used in patents in order to resolve the contradiction.

For instance, Dolgashev mentions the following contradiction: Increasing accuracy of measurement of machined balls while avoiding the use of expensive microscopes and elaborate control equipment. The matrix cell in row &quot;accuracy of measurement&quot; and column &quot;complexity of control&quot; points to several principles, among them the Copying Principle, which states, &quot;Use a simple and inexpensive optical copy with a suitable scale instead of an object that is complex, expensive, fragile or inconvenient to operate.&quot; From this general invention principle, the following idea might solve the problem: Taking a high-resolution image of the machined ball. A screen with a grid might provide the required measurement.

===Laws of technical system evolution===
{{Main|Laws of Technical Systems Evolution}}

Altshuller also studied the way technical systems have been developed and improved over time. From this, he discovered several trends (so called Laws of Technical Systems Evolution) that help engineers predict what the most likely improvements that can be made to a given product are. The most important of these laws involves the ideality of a system.

===Substance-field analysis===
One more technique that is frequently used by inventors involves the analysis of substances, fields and other resources that are currently not being used and that can be found within the system or nearby. TRIZ uses non-standard definitions for substances and fields. Altshuller developed methods to analyze resources; several of his invention principles involve the use of different substances and fields that help resolve contradictions and increase ideality of a technical system. For instance, [[videotext]] systems used television signals to transfer data, by taking advantage of the small time segments between TV frames in the signals.

===ARIZ - algorithm of inventive problems solving===

ARIZ (Russian acronym of Алгоритм решения изобретательских задач - АРИЗ) - Algorithm of Inventive Problems Solving - is a list of about 85 step-by-step procedures to solve complicated invention problems, where other tools of TRIZ alone (Su-field analysis, 40 inventive principles, etc.) are not sufficient.

Various TRIZ software (see Invention Machine, Ideation International...) are based on this algorithm (or an improved one).

Starting with an updated matrix of contradictions, semantic analysis, subcategories of inventive principles and lists of scientific effects, some new interactive applications are other attempts to simplify the problem formulation phase and the transition from a generic problem to a whole set of specific solutions.

There are several other approaches that purportedly help develop inventive power. Most of them are quite [[heuristic]]al:

# [[Trial-and-error]]
# [[Brainstorming]]
# [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological analysis]]
# [[Method of focal objects]]
# [[Lateral thinking]]
# [[C-K theory]]

== Approaches which are modifications/derivatives of TRIZ ==

# [[Unified Systematic Inventive Thinking|USIT]] (Unified Systematic Inventive Thinking)
# [[Japanese version of Unified Systematic Inventive Thinking|JUSIT]] ([http://www3.sympatico.ca/karasik/toru_nakagawa_gospel.html Japanese version of Unified Systematic Inventive Thinking])
# [[Southbeach notation]]

== Honours ==
In the last year of his life Altshuller established a two-level form of certification:
# a &quot;TRIZ Master&quot; Diploma, issued and signed by Altshuller; he granted it to several most proven persons in TRIZ community (according to his own list).
# a &quot;TRIZ Specialist&quot; and &quot;TRIZ Expert&quot; Certificates, issued by International Association of TRIZ and signed by a TRIZ-master; these certificates are intended to be granted to people which need a confirmation of their credentials as TRIZ teachers (because people complained that without a certificate they faced obstacles in teaching TRIZ)



== Controversies ==

'''Effectiveness''' : The effectiveness of TRIZ is in dispute in many Engineering circles.  Claims by some inventors that they arrived at their inventions with the help of TRIZ cannot be independently verified. Very often managers try to introduce TRIZ into their organizations in order to not be blamed for failures (a kind of &quot;due diligence&quot; and a means of preventing such accusations as &quot;why have you not used TRIZ ?&quot;){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

'''Applicability in non engineering fields''' : Frequently, TRIZ is also sold to people outside of engineering disciplines as a way to 'produce' creativity in any field of human activity without any grounds for that and ignoring the fact that traditionally TRIZ has grown up in the domain of engineering.



'''TRIZ Titles''' : Some of the TRIZ-masters interpreted titles given by Altshuller as a confirmation of their outstanding contribution to TRIZ, whereas others claimed that it was not exactly Altshuler's intent.[http://www.triz-ri.ru/forum/mess.asp?thr=20409&amp;cat=67 (rus)] The latter claim is based on the fact that the original list of masters [http://www.aitriz.org/ai/index.php?page=altshuller&amp;article=letter#trizmasters] did not include the well known outstanding contributors to TRIZ such as his wife Valentina Zuravliova, the co-author of SuField Analysis, Irina Flikstein and many others simply because they had not been teaching TRIZ and thus required no certification.

After Altshuller's death some of TRIZ masters started promoting the first interpretation of the title and claiming to be heirs to TRIZ with a right to pass their diploma to their disciples (possibly saving an overall number of masters) and even claiming their entitlement to financial support from International Association of TRIZ (V. V. Mitrofanov is the most outspoken representative of such claimants [http://www.metodolog.ru/00406/00406.html (rus)].) Others considered these claims as a devaluation and discreditation of the TRIZ-master title.

To counter the inflation of a prestige of the TRIZ-master title and to foster the real TRIZ research, [http://www3.sympatico.ca/karasik Anti TRIZ-Journal] established the [http://www3.sympatico.ca/karasik/altshuller_prize_announcement.html Altshuller Prize] for outstanding contribution to TRIZ in 2006. TheAltshuller Prize winners for 2007 were [http://www3.sympatico.ca/karasik/altshuller_prize_winners_2007.html Mr. Perelstein and Mr. V. Gutnik]. The Altshuller Prize winners for 2008 were [http://www3.sympatico.ca/karasik/altshuller_prize_winners_2008.html Ms. Irina Flikstein and Mr. Yuri Khotimlyanski].

'''Training''' : There is controversy whether a TRIZ certification is required to train people on TRIZ.
There is a controversy on what extent TRIZ trainers should know the subject matter of the invention domain.


'''Scientific basis''' : There have been various rationales proposed for why TRIZ works rooted in physics, psychology, sociological and evolutionary theories which are currently under debate.

'''Modern and Classical TRIZ''' : There seems to be debate regarding the fixity of the TRIZ canon as to whether it is stable (classical) or whether it is open to change (modern). TRIZ methods can reflexively study themselves to answer such questions

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Lateral thinking''' is a term coined by [[Edward de Bono]] in the book ''New Think: The Use of Lateral Thinking'' published in 1967; it refers to solving problems through an [[indirect speech|indirect]] and [[creativity|creative]] approach. Lateral thinking is about [[reasoning]] that is not immediately obvious and about ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step-by-step [[logic]].

==Methods==
[[Critical thinking]] is primarily concerned with judging the true value of statements and seeking errors. Lateral thinking is more concerned with the movement value of statements and ideas. A person would use lateral thinking when they want to move from one known idea to creating new ideas. Edward de Bono defines four types of thinking [[tool]]s:
* Idea generating tools that are designed to break current thinking patterns—routine patterns, the [[status quo]]
* Focus tools that are designed to broaden where to search for new ideas
* Harvest tools that are designed to ensure more value is received from idea generating output
* Treatment tools that are designed to consider real-world constraints, resources, and support&lt;ref&gt;''Lateral Thinking: The Power of Provocation'' manual: Published in 2006 by de Bono Thinking Systems&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Random Entry Idea Generating Tool''': Choose an object at random, or a [[noun]] from a [[dictionary]], and associate that with the area you are thinking about.

For example imagine you are thinking about how to improve a [[web site]]. Choosing an object at random from an office you might see a [[fax machine]]. A fax machine transmits images over the phone to paper. Fax machines are becoming rare. People send faxes directly to phone numbers. Perhaps this could be a new way to embed the web site's content in [[email]]s and other sites.

'''Provocation Idea Generating Tool''': choose to use any of the provocation techniques—wishful thinking, [[exaggeration]], reversal, escape, or arising. Create a list of provocations and then use the most outlandish ones to move your thinking forward to new ideas.

'''Challenge Idea Generating Tool''': A tool which is designed to ask the question &quot;Why?&quot; in a non-threatening way: why something exists, why it is done the way it is. The result is a very clear understanding of &quot;Why?&quot; which naturally leads to fresh new ideas. The goal is to be able to challenge anything at all, not just items which are problems.

For example you could challenge the handles on [[coffee cup]]s. The reason for the handle seems to be that the cup is often too hot to hold directly. Perhaps [[coffee]] cups could be made with insulated finger grips, or there could be separate coffee cup holders similar to [[beer]] holders.

'''Concept Fan Idea Generating Tool''': Ideas carry out concepts. This tool systematically expands the range and number of concepts in order to end up with a very broad range of ideas to consider.

'''Disproving''': Based on the idea that the majority is always wrong ([[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Galbraith]]{{Who|date=May 2010}}), take anything that is obvious and generally accepted as &quot;goes without saying&quot;, question it, take an opposite view, and try to convincingly disprove it.

The other focus, harvesting and treatment tools deal with the output of the generated ideas and the ways to use them.

==Lateral thinking and problem solving==
'''Problem Solving''': When something creates a problem, the performance or the status quo of the situation drops. Problem solving deals with finding out what caused the problem and then figuring out ways to fix the problem. The objective is to get the situation to where it should be.

For example, a production line has an established run rate of 1000 items per hour. Suddenly, the run rate drops to 800 items per hour. Ideas as to why this happened and solutions to repair the production line must be thought of.

'''Creative Problem Solving''': Using [[creativity]], one must solve a problem in an indirect and unconventional manner.

For example, if a production line produced 1000 [[book]]s per hour, creative problem solving could find ways to produce more books per hour, use the production line, or reduce the cost to run the production line.

'''Creative Problem Identification''': Many of the greatest non-technological [[invention|innovations]] are identified while realizing an improved process or design in everyday objects and tasks either by [[serendipity|accidental chance]] or by studying and documenting real world experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Creative Class''' is a socioeconomic class that economist and social scientist [[Richard Florida]], a professor and head of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the [[Rotman School of Management]] at the [[University of Toronto]], identifies as a key driving force for economic development of [[post-industrial]] [[cities]] in the [[United States]]. 

Florida describes the Creative Class as comprising 40 million workers—30 percent of the U.S. workforce—and breaks the class into two broad sections, derived from [[Standard Occupational Classification System]] codes:
* [[Super-Creative Core]]: This group comprises about 12 percent of all U.S. jobs. It includes a wide range of occupations (e.g. science, engineering, education, computer programming, research), with arts, design, and media workers forming a small subset. Florida considers those belonging to this group to “fully engage in the creative process” (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69). The Super-Creative Core is considered innovative, creating commercial products and consumer goods. The primary job function of its members is to be creative and innovative. “Along with problem solving, their work may entail problem finding” (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69).
* [[Creative Professional]]s: These professionals are the classic [[Knowledge workers|knowledge-based workers]] and include those working in healthcare, business and finance, the legal sector, and education. They “draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems” using higher degrees of education to do so (Florida, 2002).

In addition to these two main groups of creative people, the usually much smaller group of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]s is also included in the Creative Class.

Florida concludes that the Creative Class will be the leading force of growth in the economy, and is expected to grow by over 10 million jobs in the next decade.

== Background ==
The social theories advanced by Florida have sparked much debate and discussion. Florida's work proposes that a new or emergent class—or demographic segment made up of knowledge workers, intellectuals and various types of artists—is an ascendant economic force, representing either a major shift away from traditional agriculture- or industry-based economies or a general restructuring into more complex economic hierarchies.

The theses developed by Florida in various publications were drawn from, among other sources, U.S. Census Bureau demographic data, focusing first on economic trends and shifts apparent in major U.S. cities, with later work expanding the focus internationally.

The nebulous Creative Class has been on the rise for at least four decades, with a shift towards technology, research and development, and the internet (and related fields) occurring in the postwar economies of many countries.  

A number of specific cities and regions (including [[California]]'s [[Silicon Valley]], [[Boston]]’s [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]], [[Research Triangle|The Triangle]] in North Carolina, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Bangalore, India]], [[Dublin, Ireland]] and [[Sweden]]) have come to be identified with these economic trends. In Florida's publications, the same places are also associated with large Creative Class populations.

Florida argues that the Creative Class is socially relevant because of its members' ability to create and increase economic outcomes in the form of new ideas, new high-tech businesses, and regional growth (2002).

== Creative Class occupations ==
Florida says that the Creative Class is a class of workers whose job is to create meaningful new forms (2002). It is composed of scientists and engineers, university professors, poets and architects, and also includes &quot;people in design, education, arts, music and entertainment, whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology and/or creative content” (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;8). The designs of this group are seen as broadly transferable and useful. Another sector of the Creative Class includes positions that are [[Knowledge economy|knowledge intensive]]; these usually require a high degree of formal education (Florida, 2002). Examples of workers in this sector are health professionals and business managers, who are considered part of the sub-group called Creative Professionals. Their primary job is to think and create new approaches to problems. [[Creativity]] is becoming more valued in today’s global society. Employers see creativity as a channel for self-expression and job satisfaction in their employees. About 38.3 million Americans and 30 percent of the American workforce identify themselves with the Creative Class. This number has increased by more than 10 percent in the past 20 years.

The Creative Class is also known for its departure from traditional workplace attire and behavior. Members of the Creative Class may set their own hours and dress codes in the workplace, often reverting to more relaxed, casual attire instead of business suits and ties. Creative Class members may work for themselves and set their own hours, no longer sticking to the 9–5 standard. Independence is also highly regarded among the Creative Class and expected in the workplace (Florida, 2002).

== The Creative Class and the global economy ==
The Creative Class is not a class of workers among many, but a group believed to bring economic growth to countries that can attract its members. The economic benefits conferred by the Creative Class include outcomes in new ideas, high-tech industry and regional growth. Even though the Creative Class has been around for centuries, the U.S. was the first large country to have a Creative Class dealing with information technology, in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s less than five percent of the U.S. population was part of the Creative Class, a number that has risen to 26 percent. Seeing that having a strong Creative Class is vital in today’s global economy, Europe is now almost equal with America's numbers for this group. Inter-city competition to attract members of the Creative Class has developed.

Following an empirical study across 90 nations, Rindermann, Sailer and Thompson (2009) argued that high-ability classes (or smart classes) are responsible for economic growth, stable democratic development, and positively valued political aspects (government effectiveness, rule of law, and liberty).

== Places of high Creative Class populations ==
Florida's use of census and economic data, presented in works such as ''The Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002), ''Cities and the Creative Class'' (2004), and ''The Flight of the Creative Class'' (2007), as well as ''[[Bobos in Paradise]]'' by David Brooks (whose &quot;bobos&quot; roughly correspond to Florida's Creative Class), and [http://www.amazon.com/dp/192121502X NEO Power] by Ross Honeywill (which introduces the NEO Neighborhood), has shown that cities which attract and retain the Creative Class prosper, while those that do not stagnate. This research has gained traction in the business community, as well as among politicians and urban planners. Florida and other Creative Class theorists have been invited to meetings of the National Conference of Mayors and numerous economic development committees, such the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] mayor's [http://www.denvergov.org/economicdevelopment/template328864.asp Task Force on Creative Spaces] and [[Michigan]] governor [[Jennifer Granholm]]'s [[Cool Cities Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/gov/0,1607,7-168--75516--,00.html|title=Governor Partners with Local Communities to Develop &quot;Cool Cities,&quot; Spur Economic Growth|accessdate=2003-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cities and the Creative Class'', Florida devotes several chapters to discussion of the three main prerequisites of creative cities (though there are many additional qualities which distinguish creative magnets). For a city to attract the Creative Class, he argues, it must possess &quot;the three 'T's&quot;: Talent (a highly talented/educated/skilled population), Tolerance (a diverse community, which has a 'live and let live' ethos), and Technology (the technological infrastructure necessary to fuel an entrepreneurial culture). In ''Rise of the Creative Class&quot;, Florida argues that members of the Creative Class value meritocracy, diversity and individuality, and look for these characteristics when they relocate (2002).

As Florida demonstrates in his books, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New Orleans]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] are examples of cities which have tried to attract the Creative Class but, in comparison to cities which better exemplify the &quot;three 'T's&quot;, have failed. Creative Class workers have sought out cities that better accommodate their cultural, creative, and technological needs, such as  [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Toronto, Ontario]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]. Florida also notes that [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] have the ingredients to be a &quot;leading city in a new economy&quot;.

The “Creativity Index” is another tool that Florida uses to describe how members of the Creative Class are attracted to a city. The Creativity Index includes four elements: “the Creative Class share of the workforce; innovation, measured as patents per capita; high tech industry, using the Milken Institute's widely accepted Tech Pole Index…; and diversity, measured by the Gay Index, a reasonable proxy for an area’s openness&quot; (2002, pp. 244–5). Using this index, Florida rates and ranks cities in terms of innovative high-tech centers, with San Francisco being the highest ranked (2002).

Florida and others have found a strong correlation between those cities and states that provide a more tolerant atmosphere toward culturally unconventional people, such as gays, artists, and musicians (exemplified by Florida's &quot;Gay Index&quot; and &quot;Bohemian Index&quot; developed in ''The Rise of the Creative Class''), and the numbers of Creative Class workers that live and move there (2002). 

Research involving the preferences and values of this new socioeconomic class has shown that where people choose to live can no longer be predicted according to conventional industrial theories (such as &quot;people will go to where the jobs/factories are&quot;). Sociologists and urban theorists have noted a gradual and broad shift of values over the past decade. Creative workers are looking for cultural, social, and technological climates in which they feel they can best &quot;be themselves&quot;.

==Lifestyle==
The diverse and individualistic lifestyles enjoyed by the Creative Class involve active participation and experiential activities that are multidimensional. Florida (2002) uses the term Street Level Culture to define this kind of stimulation. Street Level Culture may include a “teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians, and small galleries and bistros, where it is hard to draw the line between participant and observer, or between creativity and its creators” (p.&amp;nbsp;166). Members of the Creative Class enjoy unique experiences like traveling and antique shopping, and outdoor activities like bike riding and running, and would rather be participants than spectators (Florida, 2002).

==Criticisms==
Numerous studies have found fault with the logic or empirical claims of the Creative Class theory. Hoyman and Faricy (2009), using Florida’s own indices, find no statistical evidence that cities with higher proportions of Creative Class workers correlated with any type of economic growth from 1990–2004. In &quot;Urban Development and the Politics of the Creative Class&quot;, Ann Markusen (2006) argues that workers qualified as being in the Creative Class have no concept of group identity, nor are they in occupations that are inherently creative. Markusen also notes that the definition of the Creative Class is based largely on educational attainment, suggesting that Florida’s indices become insignificant after controlling for education (p.&amp;nbsp;1923). Jamie Peck's (2005) &quot;Struggling with the Creative Class&quot; argues that the Creative Class theory offers no causal mechanism and suffers from circular logic. John Montgomery (2005) writes that “what Florida has devised is a set of indices which simply mirror more fundamental truths about creative milieux or dynamic cities” (p.&amp;nbsp;339). Montgomery also disagrees with the cities that Florida designates as most creative, writing that London, not Manchester and Leicester, should be one of the top in the U.K. A critique of Florida's research and theoretical framework has been developed by Matteo Pasquinelli (2006) in the context of Italian [[Operaismo]].

Creative Class Struggle, a Toronto-based collective, has brought these criticisms outside academic circles, challenging Florida's Creative Class theories as well as their widespread adoption into urban policy. The group manages an online clearinghouse for information about creative city strategies and policies, publishes a newsletter and other materials, and works to engage the media and public in critical discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creative Class Struggle.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativeclassstruggle.wordpress.com|title=Creative Class Struggle.|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Creative Class Struggle and art magazine ''Fuse'' organized a public forum in Toronto to debate these issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyte, Murray.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''creative industries''' refers to a range of economic activities which are concerned with the generation or exploitation of knowledge and information. They may variously also be referred to as the [[cultural industry|cultural industries]] (especially in Europe {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=14}}) or the creative economy {{harv|Howkins|2001}}.

Howkins' creative economy comprises [[advertising]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[crafts]], [[design]], [[fashion]], [[film industry|film]], [[music industry|music]], [[performing arts]], [[publishing]], [[research and development|R&amp;D]], [[software]], [[toys]] and [[game]]s, [[Television|TV]] and [[radio]], and [[computer games|video games]] {{harv|Howkins|2001|p=88-117}}. There remain, however, different definitions of the sector {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv| DCMS| 2006}}.Yet so far Howkins has not been internationally recognized.

The creative industries have been seen to become increasingly important to economic well-being, proponents suggesting that &quot;human creativity is the ultimate economic resource,&quot; {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002|p=xiii}} and that “the industries of the twenty-first century will depend increasingly on the generation of knowledge through creativity and innovation,&quot; {{Harv|Landry|Bianchini|1995|p=4}}. 

== Definitions of the creative industries ==
Various definitions on what activities to include in the creative industries have been suggested {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}{{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv|Howkins|2001|p=88-117}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|p=11-12}} and even the name itself is a contested issue - there being significant differences and overlap between the terms 'creative industries', 'cultural industries' and 'creative economy' {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=11-14}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|p=12}}. 

Lash and Urry suggest that each of the creative industries has an 'irreducible core' concerned with &quot;the exchange of finance for rights in intellectual property,&quot; {{harv|Lash|Urry|1994|p=117}}. This echoes the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) definition which describes the creative industries as:
:''“those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property.”'' {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}

The current DCMS definition recognises eleven ''creative sectors'', down from fourteen in their 2001 document. They are:

* [[Advertising]]
* [[Architect]]ure
* [[Antiques|Arts and antique markets]]
* [[Handicraft|Crafts]]
* [[Design]] (see also [[communication design]])
* Designer [[Fashion]]
* [[Film industry|Film]], [[Videography|video]] and [[photography]]
* [[Software]], [[computer games]] and [[electronic publishing]]
* [[music industry|Music]] and the visual and [[performing arts]]
* [[Publishing]]
* [[Television]]
* [[Radio]] {{harv|DCMS|2006}}

('Film and video' became 'Film, video and photography; 'Music' and 'performing arts' were combined to form 'Music and the visual and performing arts'; 'Interactive leisure software' was combined with 'Computer services' to form 'Software, computer games and electronic publishing')

To this list John Howkins would add [[toys]] and games, and also include the much broader area of [[research and development]] in science and technology {{harv|Howkins|2001|p=88-117}}.

Hesmondhalgh reduces the list to what he terms 'the core cultural industries' of [[advertising]] and marketing, [[broadcasting]], [[Film industry|film]], internet and [[Music industry|music]] industries, [[publishing|print]] and [[electronic publishing]], and [[computer games|video and computer games]]. His definition only includes those industries that create 'texts' or 'cultural artefacts' and which engage in some form of industrial reproduction {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12-14}}.

The DCMS list has been influential, and many other nations have formally adopted it. It has also been criticised. It has been argued that the division into sectors obscures a divide between [[lifestyle business]], non-profits, and larger businesses, and between those who receive state subsidies (e.g., film) and those who do not (e.g., computer games). The inclusion of the antiques trade is often questioned, since it does not generally involve production except of reproductions and fakes. The inclusion of all computer services has also been questioned {{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=13}}.

Some nations, such as [[Hong Kong]], have preferred to shape their policy around a tighter focus on copyright ownership in the [[value chain]]. They adopt the [[WIPO]]'s classifications, which divide the Creative Industries up according to who owns the copyrights at various stages during the production &amp; distribution of creative content.

Others have suggested a distinction between those industries that are open to mass production and distribution (film and video; videogames; broadcasting; publishing), and those that are primarily craft-based and are meant to be consumed in a particular place and moment ([[visual arts]]; [[performing arts]]; cultural heritage).

== How creative workers are counted ==
The DCMS classifies enterprises and occupations as creative according to what the enterprise primarily produces, and what the worker primarily does. Thus, a company which produces records would be classified as belonging to the music [[industrial sector]], and a worker who plays piano would be classified as a [[musician]].

The primary purpose of this is to quantify - for example it can be used to count the number of firms, and the number of workers, creatively employed in any given location, and hence to identify places with particularly high concentrations of creative activities.

It leads to some complications which are not immediately obvious. For example, a security guard working for a music company would be classified as a creative employee, although not as creatively occupied.

The total number of creative employees is then calculated as the sum of:

*all workers employed in creative industries, whether or not creatively occupied (e.g. all musicians, security guards, cleaners, accountants, managers, etc. working for a record company)

*all workers that are creatively occupied, and are not employed in creative industries (for example, a piano teacher in a school). This includes people whose second job is creative, for example somebody who does weekend [[Gig (musical performance)|gigs]], writes books, or produces artwork in her spare time

== Properties or characteristics of creative industries ==
[[File:Township Cat.JPG|thumb|200px|A toy cat produced in a South-African township, made from used plastic bags and old wire]]

According to Caves (2000), creative industries are characterized by seven economic properties:

#''Nobody knows principle'': Demand uncertainty exists because the consumers' reaction to a product are neither known beforehand, nor easily understood afterward.
#''Art for art’s sake'': Workers care about originality, technical professional skill, harmony, etc. of creative goods and are willing to settle for lower wages than offered by 'humdrum' jobs.
#''Motley crew principle'': For relatively complex creative products (e.g., films), the production requires diversely skilled inputs. Each skilled input must be present and perform at some minimum level to produce a valuable outcome.
#''Infinite variety'': Products are differentiated by quality and uniqueness; each product is a distinct combination of inputs leading to infinite variety options (e.g., works of creative writing, whether poetry, novel, screenplays or otherwise).
#''A list/B list'': Skills are vertically differentiated. Artists are ranked on their skills, originality, and proficiency in creative processes and/or products. Small differences in skills and talent may yield huge differences in (financial) success.
#''Time flies'': When coordinating complex projects with diversely skilled inputs, time is of the essence.
#''Ars longa'': Some creative products have durability aspects that invoke [[copyright]] protection, allowing a creator or performer to collect rents.

The properties described by Caves have been criticized for being too rigid (Towse, 2000). Not all creative workers are purely driven by 'art for art's sake'. The 'ars longa' property also holds for certain noncreative products (i.e., licensed products). The 'time flies' property also holds for large construction projects. Creative industries are therefore not unique, but they score generally higher on these properties relative to non-creative industries.

== Difference from the 'cultural industries' ==
There is often a question about the boundaries between creative industries and the similar term of '''[[Cultural industry|cultural industries]]'''. Cultural industries are best described as an adjunct-sector of the creative industries. Cultural industries include industries that focus on [[cultural tourism]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]], [[sports]] and [[outdoor activities]], and a variety of 'way of life' activities that arguably range from local pet shows to a host of [[Hobbies|hobbyist]] concerns. Thus cultural industries are more concerned about delivering other kinds of value—including cultural wealth and social wealth—rather than primarily providing monetary value. (See also [[Cultural Institutions Studies|cultural institutions studies]].)

== The creative class ==
Some authors, such as the American [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]], argue for a wider focus on the products of [[knowledge workers]], and judge the '[[creative class]]' (his own term) to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services. 
=== Difference from the 'knowledge industries' ===

The term creative industries begins to elide with [[knowledge economy]] and questions of [[intellectual property]] ownership in general.

=== The creative class and diversity ===
Florida's focus leads him to pay particular attention to the nature of the creative [[workforce]]. In a study of why particular US cities such as San Francisco seem to attract creative producers, Florida argues that a high proportion of workers from the '[[creative class]]' provide a key input to creative production, which enterprises seek out. He seeks to quantitatively establish the importance of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[multiculturalism]] in the cities concerned, for example the existence of a significant public gay community, ethnic and religious variety, and tolerance. {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002}}

== Economic contribution ==
Globally, Creative Industries excluding software and general scientific [[research and development]] are said to have accounted for around 4% of the world's economic output in 1999, which is the last year for which comprehensive figures are currently available. Estimates of the output corresponding to scientific [[Research and Development]] suggest that an additional 4-9% might be attributable to the sector if its definition is extended to include such activities, though the figures vary significantly between different countries.

Taking the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as an example, in the context of other sectors, the creative industries make a far more significant contribution to output than [[hospitality]] or [[utilities]] and deliver four times the output due to [[agriculture]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. In terms of employment and depending on the definition of activities included, the sector is a major employer of between 4-6% of the UK's [[working population]], though this is still significantly less than employment due to traditional areas of work such as [[retail]] and [[manufacturing]].

Within the creative industries sector and again taking the UK as an example, the three largest sub-sectors are [[design]], [[publishing]], and [[television]] and [[radio]]. Together these account for around 75% of revenues and 50% of employment.

The complex [[supply chains]] in the creative industries sometimes make it challenging to calculate accurate figures for the [[gross value added]] by each sub-sector. This is particularly the case for the service-focused sub-sectors such as [[advertising]], whereas it is more straightforward in product-focused sub-sectors such as [[crafts]]. Not surprisingly, perhaps, competition in product-focused areas tends to be more intense with a tendency to drive the production end of the supply chain to become a [[commodity business]].

There may be a tendency for publicly-funded creative industries development services to inaccurately estimate the number of creative businesses during the mapping process. There is also imprecision in nearly all tax code systems that determine a person's profession, since many creative people operate simultaneously in multiple roles and jobs.  Both these factors mean that official statistics relating to the Creative Industries should be treated with caution.

== Wider role ==
As some first world countries struggle to compete in traditional markets such as [[manufacturing]], many now see the creative industries as a key component in a new [[knowledge economy]], capable perhaps of delivering [[urban regeneration]], often through initiatives linked to exploitation of [[cultural heritage]] that leads to increased [[tourism]]. It is often argued that, in future, the ideas and imagination of countries like the [[United Kingdom]] will be their greatest asset; in support of this argument, a number of universities in the UK have started to offer [[creative entrepreneurship]] as a specific area for study and research. Indeed, UK government figures reveal that the UK's creative industries account for over a million jobs and brought in £112.5 billion to the UK economy (DCMS ''Creative Industries Mapping Document'' 2001), although the data sets underlying these figures are open to question.

In recent years, creative industries have become ‘increasingly attractive to governments outside the developed world’&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stuart, Ryan, Mark David, Keane, Michael &amp; Ordonez, Diego (2008), ‘Financing Creative Industries in Developing Countries’, in Diana Barrowclough and Zeljka Kozul-Wright eds, Creative Industries and Developing Countries: Voice, Choice and Economic Growth, Routledge, London and New York, pp. 65-110.&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2005, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) XI High Level Panel on Creative Industries and Development commissioned several studies to identify challenges and opportunities facing the growth and development of creative industries in developing industries. As Cunningham ''et al.'' (2009) put it, ‘the harnessing of creativity brings with it the potential of new wealth creation, the cultivation of local talent and the generation of creative capital, the development of new export markets, significant multiplier effects throughout the broader economy, the utilisation of information communication technologies and enhanced competitiveness in an increasingly global economy’. A key driver of interest in creative industries and development is the acknowledgement that the value of creative production resides in ideas and individual creativity, and developing countries have rich cultural traditions and pools of creative talent which lay a basic foundation for creative enterprises.

R., ''Manic Depressive Illness'', Oxford University Press (Oxford, 1990), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the association between bipolar disorder and creativity first appeared in literature in the 1970s, the idea of a link between &quot;madness&quot; and &quot;genius&quot; is much older, dating back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], and reinforced by the views of the [[Romanticism]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;simonton2005&quot;&gt;

== Creativity and bipolar disorder ==
Many famous historical figures gifted with creative talents may have been affected by bipolar disorder. In many instances, creativity and psychopathology share some common traits, such as a tendency for &quot;[[thinking outside the box]].&quot; In addition, many people with bipolar disorder may feel very powerful emotion, potentially aiding in creativity. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/52456?pageNumber=3&lt;/ref&gt; Because (hypo)mania decreases social inhibition, performers are often daring and bold. As a consequence, creators commonly exhibit characteristics often associated with mental illness. The frequency and intensity of these symptoms appear to vary according to the magnitude and domain of creative achievement. At the same time, these symptoms are not equivalent to the full-blown psychopathology of a clinical manic episode which, by definition, entails significant impairment.&lt;ref name=&quot;simonton2005&quot;/&gt; Many of these have been posthumously diagnosed as suffering from bipolar or unipolar disorder based on biographies, letters, correspondence, contemporaneous accounts, or other anecdotal material, most notably in [[Kay Redfield Jamison]]'s book ''[[Touched with Fire|Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TWF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament|author=Kay Redfield Jamison|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0684831831|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Touched With Fire'' presents the argument that bipolar disorder, and affective disorders more generally,&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, K. R., ''Touched with Fire'', Free Press (New York, 1993), pp 82 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; may be found in a disproportionate number of people with creative talent such as [[actors]], [[artist]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[musician]]s, [[author]]s, [[Performing arts|performer]]s and [[poet]]s.

Several recent clinical studies have also suggested that there is a positive [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] between creativity and bipolar disorder, although the relationship between the two is unclear.&lt;ref name=santosa2006&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Landseer Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|420px|right|''Scene From A Midsummer Night's Dream, Titania and Bottom'' by [[Sir Edwin Landseer]]]]
The majority of studies on '''[[sleep]] and [[creativity]]''' have shown that sleep can facilitate insightful behavior and flexible reasoning, and there are several hypotheses about the creative [[Dreams#Functional_hypotheses|function of dreams]]. On the other hand, a few recent studies have supported a theory of creative insomnia, in which creativity is significantly correlated with sleep disturbance.

==Anecdotal accounts of sleep and creativity==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}
* [[Jack Nicklaus]] had a dream that allowed him to correct his golf swing.
* German chemist [[Friedrich August Kekulé]] stated that the idea for the ring structure of [[benzene]] came to him in a day-dream, in which he saw snakes biting their own tails. This story has been disputed.
* [[Jasper Johns]] was inspired to paint his first flag painting as a result of a dream.
* [[Aphex Twin]] wrote much of the music on his album ''[[Selected Ambient Works Volume II]]'' by going to sleep in the studio, and then recreating the sounds he heard in dreams as soon as he woke up.
* [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] came up with the plot of ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' during a dream.
* [[Paul McCartney]] discovered the tune for the song &quot;[[Yesterday (song)|Yesterday]]&quot; in a dream and was inspired to write &quot;[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]&quot; during [[hypnogogia]].
* [[Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' was inspired by a dream at [[Lord Byron]]'s villa.
* British poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote &quot;[[Kubla Khan]]&quot; after finding inspiration from an opium induced dream. 
*[[Otto Loewi]], a German physiologist, won the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1936 for his work on the chemical transmission of nerve impulses. He discovered in a dream how to prove his theory.

==Sleep and creativity studies==

===REM sleep as a state of increased cognitive flexibility===
In a study on cognitive flexibility across the sleep-wake cycle, researchers discovered that when woken from [[REM sleep]], participants had a 32% advantage on an [[anagram]] task (when compared with the number of correct responses after [[NREM]] awakenings).&lt;ref&gt;Walker P., Liston C., Allan Hobson J., and Stickgold R. (2002) Cognitive flexibility across the sleep-wake cycle: REM-sleep enhancement of anagram problem solving. ''Cognitive Brain Research'' 14, 317-324&lt;/ref&gt; This was consistent with the hypothesis that due to the lack of aminergic dominance in REM sleep, this particular sleep state is highly conducive to fluid reasoning and flexible thought. Interestingly, participant performance after awakening from REM sleep was not better than participants who stayed awake, which indicates that in REM sleep, there is an alternative (but just as effective) mode of problem solving that differs from the mechanism available while awake.

===Sleep facilitates insight===
Participants in a study were asked to translate a string of digits using two simple rules that allowed the string to be reduced to a single digit (number reduction task). Out of three groups of participants (those who slept, those who stayed awake during the day, and those who stayed awake during the night), participants who got eight hours of sleep were two times as likely during retesting to gain insight into a hidden rule built into the task.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, U., Gals, S., Halder, H., Verleger, R., and Born, J. (2004) Sleep inspires insight. ''Nature'' 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of sleep impairs creativity===
Some participants in a study went 32 hours without sleep while the control participants slept normally. When tested on flexibility and originality on figural and verbal tests, the sleep-deprived participants had severe and persistent impairments in their performance.&lt;ref&gt;Home, J.A. (1988) Sleep loss and &quot;divergent&quot; thinking ability. ''Sleep: Journal of Sleep Research &amp; Sleep Medicine'' 11;6, pp. 528-536.&lt;/ref&gt;

===More creativity in humor while asleep===
Under hypnotic induced sleep, participants were much more likely to produce paraphrases of jokes that they had heard before and to spontaneously create new jokes (when compared with their performance while awake).&lt;ref&gt;Dittborn, J.M. (1963) Creativity during suggested sleep. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'' 16:3, pp. 738.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration of relational memory===
Recent studies have also shown that sleep not only helps consolidate memory, but also integrates relational memories. In one study, the participants were tested to see if sleep helped in this aspect (Ellenbogen et al., 2007, as cited in Walker, 2009). The subjects of the experiment were taught five &quot;premise pairs&quot;, A&gt;B, B&gt;C, C&gt;D, and D&gt;E. They were not aware of the overall hierarchy, where A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D&gt;E. The subjects were split into 3 separate groups. The first group was tested 20 minutes after learning the pairs, the second was tested 12 hours later without sleep, and the third was tested 12 hours later with sleep in between. The groups were tested in both first degree pairs (A&gt;B, C&gt;D, etc.) and 2nd degree pairs (A&gt;C, B&gt;D, or C&gt;E). The results were that with the first degree pairs, the first group only performed at around chance levels, and the second and third groups had significantly better performances. With the 2nd degree pairs, the first group still performed at around chance levels, and the second group performed at about the same level as in the 1st degree pair test. However, the third group performed even better than before, gaining a 25% advantage over the group without sleep. The results of this study showed that sleep is a significant factor in integrating memories, or gaining the bigger picture.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M.P. &quot;The Role of Sleep in Cognition and Emotion.&quot; Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. 1156. (2009): 181-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creative insomnia==
''Creative insomnia'' refers to the idea that [[insomnia]] can actually spark creativity.

===Anecdotal accounts of creative insomnia===
* [[Marcel Proust]] wrote most of his À la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time) while staying awake in the night due to a chronic illness. In ''Sodome et Gomorrhe'', he suggests that &quot;Un peu d'insomnie n'est pas inutile pour apprécier le sommeil, projeter quelque lumière dans cette nuit. [A little insomnia is useful for appreciating sleep, for projecting some light into this night.]&quot;
* Film maker [[Alan Berliner]] made a documentary on his lifelong insomnia and its complex role in his creative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/wideawake/interview.html HBO: Wide Awake - Interviews&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Insomnia is almost an oasis in which those who have to think or suffer darkly take refuge.&quot; – [[Colette]]
* &quot;It's at night, when perhaps we should be dreaming, that the mind is most clear, that we are most able to hold all our life in the palm of our skull. I don't know if anyone has ever pointed out that great attraction of insomnia before, but it is so; the night seems to release a little more of our vast backward inheritance of instincts and feelings; as with the dawn, a little honey is allowed to ooze between the lips of the sandwich, a little of the stuff of dreams to drip into the waking mind. I wish I believed, as J. B. Priestley did, that consciousness continues after disembodiment or death, not forever, but for a long while. Three score years and ten is such a stingy ration of time, when there is so much time around. Perhaps that's why some of us are insomniacs; night is so precious that it would be pusillanimous to sleep all through it! A 'bad night' is not always a bad thing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.quotatio.com/a/aldiss-brian-w-quotes.html Brian W Aldiss Quotations Index: Quotes at Quotatio&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Brian W. Aldiss]]
* ''Acquainted with the Night: Insomnia Poems'' (edited by Lisa Russ Spaar) is a collection of over eighty poems by famous poets and writers like Walt Whitman, Emily Bronté and Robert Frost, all inspired by sleepless nights. Fifteen of the poems actually have &quot;insomnia&quot; in the title.
* &quot;Si les insomnies d'un musicien lui font créer de belles oeuvres, ce sont de belles insomnies. [If the insomnia of a musician allows him to create beautiful pieces, it is a beautiful insomnia.]&quot; – [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]
* [[Vladmir Nabokov]] believed that insomnia was a positive influence on his work. He once remarked that &quot;sleep is the most moronic fraternity in the world, with the heaviest dues and the crudest rituals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotegarden.com/sleep.html Sleep Quotes, Sayings about Sleeping&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies that support creative insomnia===
Although no studies have actually shown a causal relationship yet, various studies have suggested that the positive relationship between sleep and creativity to be more complicated and less clear-cut than previously thought.
* One study with children (ages 10-12) in New Zealand demonstrated a correlation between insomnia and creative thought. This study looked at the incidence of sleep disturbances in thirty ''highly creative children'' when compared with thirty ''control children''. The hypothesis was that there would be a higher incidence of sleep disturbance in the highly creative children than in the control children. Results showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups, with the creative children reporting more sleep disturbance, therefore suggesting that creative ability may indeed affect an individual's sleep patterns. More specifically, out of the sixty children tested on a standard creativity test, seventeen of the ''highly creative'' children indicated that they had higher levels of sleep disturbance (compared to only eight of the ''control'' children).&lt;ref&gt;Healey, D. and Runco, M. (2006). Could Creativity be Associated with Insomnia? ''Creativity Research Journal'' 18:1, 39-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In another study that examined the interactive relationships between sleep, fatigue, creativity and personality, participants were given the Sleep Questionnaire, the Fatigue Inventory, the Remote Association Test and the Probabilistic Orientation Test. The researchers found that arousal measures of sleep and fatigue were meaningfully related to one another, but not to measures of thinking and of attitudinal orientations. Most importantly, they found that creativity was not significantly related to any of the dimensions of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan, S., Vijayakumar, P. and Govindarasu, S. (1992).

===Studies that reject creative insomnia===
* In a series of three studies that analyzed the link between creativity, dreams, and sleep behaviors, researchers discovered that: (1) participants who were classified as &quot;fast sleepers&quot; (those who fell asleep quickly) were more likely to score highly on a creativity test, (2) participants who scored highly on a creativity test were more likely to solve their problems through dreams and to fall asleep quickly, and (3) adults in creative occupations have significantly more dream distortion, visual mentation, and regressive dream content.&lt;ref&gt;Sladeczek, I. and Domino, G. (1985) Creativity, sleep and primary process thinking in dreams. ''Journal of Creative Behavior'' 19:1, pp. 38-46, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Re’eh  Deuteronomy 11:26- 16:18

From the beginning of the scripture in Deuteronomy 11:26 to Deuteronomy 16:17,  there is a pattern of life for the believer’s life in worship through obedience, selflessness, and maybe most of all, the pathway to Yahweh’s eternal kingdom.  It all starts with a choice to be either obedient or disobedient to His commandments. 

Re’eh is translated “see”.  The complete understanding of this word is, “sight, the inheritance of God by the Ruach”.  An exegesis of Re’eh from the word etymology of the Hebrew gives the understanding of, “light of God brought down to man as an inheritance” and indicates light as an energy source which comes from God as an inheritance imparting “sight” the gift of God. It takes light to see.  Without the Light of God, mankind could not see or perceive truth. Moshe is telling us to “See”


'''Living in the Light of His Word'''

Moshe says to them “Behold (Re’eh) I set before you today a blessing and a curse.  The blessing if you obey/hearken (shema)... and the curse if you do not obey/hearken (shema)”.  As the rabbis point out, to hear (shema) is a metaphor for blessing, while to not hear (lo-shema) is a metaphor for cursing (Artscroll Stone Edition Chumash, p. 999).

Many today do not “see” obedience to Yahweh’s commandments as a blessing.  They truly think that they will be more blessed by following their own understanding of what is to their profit, therein disobeying Him.   It becomes selective hearing. The choice is always ours as to what we inherit.   Our misguided self-centred thinking will make choices that we perceive to be to good in that they satisfy our desires, but we will reap destruction from disobedience - i.e. refusing His instruction and going off according to our own understanding.  Galatians 6: 7-8

In Hebraic thought and according to the meaning of the Hebrew word ‘shema’, hearing and doing, are synonymous.   If one hears, but does not do what he has heard, then he has not heard.  Obviously, hearing, Hebraically, is more than an auditory function, but involves the heart resulting in corresponding actions resulting in either blessing (if one hears and obeys Yahweh’s Word) or cursing (if one does not hear and obey Yahweh’s Word).  (11:27-28)

Scripture prophesies that in the future a problem would arise among the people of Yahweh.  The problem would not be a famine of food and water, but of the ability to hear (shema) and to do the Word of God (Amos 8:11).  Likewise,  Isaiah prophesied that there would be those who would say (or “draw near with their mouths”) but who would not do (“but their hearts are far from me”) (Isa. 29:13).  Yeshua accused the religious people of that time of the same thing (Matt. 15:8-9).  We need to examine our words and corresponding actions to judge ourselves, as to whether our actions perfectly align to our profession of faith, or do we stand convicted before Yahweh of disobedience and/or hypocrisy?


'''The Blessing and the Curse'''

This week the Reeh portion continues Moshe’s admonitions to the sons of Israel by listing a number of commandments that keep one spiritually orientated and which when obeyed results in blessings, but when disobeyed cause us to become disconnected from Yahweh and the result is that we become a recipient of the curses.  

The opening verses spell out the dire warnings and establish this theme for the balance of the reading:   “See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse: the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I am commanding you today; and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, by following other gods which you have not known” (Deut. 11:26-28).

A choice is presented to them, the way of blessing or the way of the curse.  What they reap will depend on how they ‘shema’ (hear) His Word and do it.  The two mountains which would signify the blessing and the curse are Eval and Gerizim. The mountain Eval, 940 meters above sea level, faces the north, and Gerizim, 880 meters above sea level, faces the south. In the valley between the two mountains is the city of Shechem. There was an important road that led through that valley. It was Israel’s line of contact with the rest of the world. It was a meeting place for travelers who came from the north, south, east, and west. This was the place where Avraham built his first altar, see Genesis 12:6-7, and where Yosef was buried, see Joshua 24:32.

Moshe just cannot get away from his mantra to the children of Israel regarding the necessity to obey the commandments, statutes and ordinances of the Eternal One.  Without a doubt, Moshe is most concerned about the propensity for the sons of Israel to follow after strange gods, having witnessed how readily the sons of Israel succumbed to the temptations provided by the Midianite and Moabite women as they had enticed the men of Israel into the sexual sins of Baal-Peor.  Now that the time had arrived for Israel to cross the Jordan River into the Land of Promise, Moshe expands upon the types of temptations that will meet the children of Israel upon their crossing, and introduces them to even more insidious temptations of the eventuality of various people arising in their midst who will be either adding to or taking away from His teachings,  
“Whatever I command you, you shall be careful to do; you shall not add to nor take away from it” (Deuteronomy 12:32).


'''Tests from Within and Without'''

Moshe again exhorts the people to abstain from socializing with the idol-worshippers, from giving credence to pagan ideas and influences.  For this purpose they are to cut down any trees, statues and altars which have been used in pagan worship and finally he assures them that God is always near and will always hear a contrite and repentant heart which seeks forgiveness.

“If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,’ you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your God is testing you to find out if you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.  “You shall follow Yahweh your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him.  “But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has counseled rebellion against Yahweh your God who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, to seduce you from the way in which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from among you” (Deuteronomy 13:1-5).

The first groups of people that Moshe warns the children of Israel about are the false prophets and dreamers of dreams that will arise among the followers of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  These deceived people will actually come from within the ranks of the faithful.  Many may not even know that they are deceived, but truly believe that they are speaking for God.  They might have “heard a voice” or “had a vision” or “received a call” that they swear is from the Most High.  These self-deceived prophets are some of the most difficult to encounter because they speak their words with such personal conviction.  If you have ever been exposed to people like this you can understand how convincing they appear.  But that does not excuse the children of Israel from following their words that subtly moves them away from the Torah of Moshe.  To make things even more difficult for the sons of Israel, some of these false prophets and dreamers will actually be known for various “signs and wonders” that accompany their messages.  Once someone has personally witnessed a sign or wonder, the perceived credibility of the prophet or dreamer is elevated in the eyes of the witness.  People then naturally have a tendency to let their spiritual defenses down and begin to believe the words of the false prophet.   Once a degree of credibility is attained, the insidious teaching is introduced.  This can be very confusing to the faithful because visible signs and wonders are difficult to refute.  But the teachings that they profess will subtly direct people away from the Almighty.   The test of a messenger of God, is in what they speak, it must be according to the Word, not in the demonstration of signs and powerful gifts.

Yeshua Himself warned His disciples about this -   “For false Messiahs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect” (Matthew 24:24).
“You shall follow Yahweh your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him” (Deuteronomy 13:4).  After Yahweh, your God, shall you go – and not after idols.  Do not accept upon yourself to follow other gods, but rather commit yourself wholeheartedly to obey only Yahweh. “Going” involves decision.

And Him shall you fear – and not idols.  “Fear”, and reverence of Yahweh must be exclusive -- not coming under the fear of man.  And His commandments shall you observe – and not the dictates of the other practices, even if they are not actual idol-worship.  “Observing” refers to paying homage to the customs associated with idolatry.  

And to His Voice shall you listen – and not to the teachings of idolatry. “Listening” is learning, i.e. the truth in the Torah.  And Him shall you serve – No “service,” no worship, is due any but Yahweh. One must not even accede to the prophet’s recommendation to worship differently.  

And to Him shall you cleave  -- “Cleaving” to Yahweh means attaching oneself to Him and His Word, and not to those who have gone astray.  By following Yahweh, fearing Him, keeping His commandments, listening to His voice, serving Him and clinging to  Him, one should be able to avoid the pitfalls of the deception that is destined to come to every generation of followers of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  The false ‘prophets’ or proponents of the Word are of a worldly mind-set and are not subject to the Word of truth.  By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.   Whatever does not agree with His Word is not of Him.  Such a person is of the spirit of an anti-messiah.  (See 1 John 4: 4-6)  Yeshua said, “By their fruits you will know them”  	Matt.7:15-20

While the false prophets and dreamers are dealt with by just retribution (capital punishment), there is another group of tempters that come much closer to home.  These are the immediate relatives that test our allegiance to the Holy One of Israel:   
“If your brother, your mother’s son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods ' .. .. .. .. you shall not yield to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him.  “But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people”  (Deuteronomy 13: 8-11).   

Yahweh is absolutely concerned about the subtle ability of loved ones to turn people away from loving Him.  Remember He is a jealous God.  One’s devotion to Yahweh must be complete and uncompromising.   He expects us to love Him more than we do our own family members.   We need to remember that Yahweh is longsuffering in His love and desires that no one should perish but rather come to the knowledge of the truth through repentance.   There is no recorded instance of this having been literally carried out.

Yeshua also taught this principle, saying,   “If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple” (Luke 14:26-27).

Yeshua is saying is that one must place his love and allegiance to Him above his or her love for one’s family members or even one’s very own life.   Here Yeshua essentially says that it is going to cost you all that you have.  In other words, it is going to cost you your entire life, if you are going to be a true disciple of the Messiah of Israel.  Understanding what Moshe had to say to his listeners can be summarized by this statement which Yeshua made.

In the gospel according to Luke, Yeshua uses a parable to describe the complete surrender that is required by the faithful to become a disciple of His and enter into His kingdom.  (Luke 14:16-35).  In this parable, the head of the household who is preparing a big banquet is likened to our Heavenly Father who is calling all who will listen to come and partake.  Note that the “Master” sends out his slaves or bondservants to make the declarations to all who would hear that they are invited to attend the meal.  This could be compared to the Holy One using various Prophets and servants like Moshe to make declarations about what is required to maintain the proper relationship with the Creator, or this can mean each one of us who is called to be a bondservant of the Most High and give total allegiance to Him.  

In this parable, the results of inviting different people to the banquet are explained.  Some are caught up in the business affairs of the world.  Others have recently married and are more concerned about their honeymoon and relationship building with their new spouse.  All are legitimate responsibilities in life, but none should take precedence over the call to attend our Master’s call. 


'''The High Places'''   12: 1-7

We do not today have literal ‘high places’ where idolatry is enacted, but what are the present-day high places where the world has placed its altars to its gods that as a called-out people and a set-apart nation Yahweh is calling us to cast down and to destroy.  The love of the things of this world are idols and spiritual strongholds which hinder and/or prevent us from serving and obeying Yahweh with all our heart.  What is it that causes us to be insensitive to Him?  We need to examine what things keep us from hearing His voice and honouring all His commandments, from prayer and intimate times with Him.   

Make a check list - is it television, sports, your job and work schedule, family and peer pressure, fear, sinful habits and addictions, lust, greed, materialism and so on - What changes need to made to dethrone the ‘high places’, the things which have pre-eminence in our lives which are not centred on worship of Yahweh?
We must ask ourselves the question, “Do I have anything in my life that is connected to idolatry? Do I watch, or allow my children to watch television programs that have anything to do with sorcery, occult or new age themes? 

If we see anything in our lives that can give room for idolatry, we must be ruthless with ourselves, as Yeshua said in Matthew 5:29a,  “If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you.&quot;(HNV)

“You shall obliterate [destroy, put to death] their names” [the names of pagan gods].  As the Art Scroll Edition Chumash points out, not only was Israel to remove the idols themselves, but they were not even to refer to them by their proper names


'''The Place of Worship'''

The Targums Onkelos and Johnathan both say to go  “to the house of His Shekinah”, that is, the place where His Presence dwells.  He will dwell and presence Himself in the place of His appointment.  The place of choice is where to bring your tithes and offering and worship before Him.  Verse 8 says, “You shall not do as we are doing here today - every man doing what is right in his own eyes.”  We are to follow His instructions as to where to worship.


'''Honouring God With Our Substance'''

The pattern of tithes and offerings were set in place for the benefit of the people as they came to worship Yahweh.   
“These are the statutes and judgements which you shall be careful to observe” (12: 1).

When there is a hesitancy or reluctance to give, it is overcome by continually making it a practice to do so,  in obedience to Torah.  They also teach that giving based upon an emotional response to someone’s need is not true ‘tzedakah’, but rather a satisfying of one’s own heart and that the ‘exalted way of giving’ is with a pure heart in obedience to Torah and not because your own heart is grieved.   
King Shlomo (Solomon) says, “Honor God with your wealth” (Proverbs 3:9) and this is done by giving.  “Every man according to what he can give according to the blessing which Yahweh your God gives you.” (16:17)

Our finances are tight so we look to “see” where we can cut corners.   We think we can have this much more money in our budget if we quit giving God His tithe.  Yet, God tells us that withholding the tithe brings curses (Malachai 3).  Then they establish their icons, a fancy new automobile or other sacred possession, as a replacement for God, by paying their tithes to the title holder of that sacred idol.  Do not think you will be blessed for doing this!  If you want God’s favor you have to obey Him.

“These are the decrees and the ordinances that you shall observe… Destroy all the places where… worshipped their gods… bring your offerings, your tithes … your vow offerings and your free will offerings…. You may not eat the tithe… “ Deut 12:1-17;12:5ff, 

These tithes and offerings were those brought to the place of worship.
Proverbs 3: 9-10 says, “ Honour Yahweh with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: so that your barns be filled with plenty...” 

Luke 6:38 says, “Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.” Giving (tithes and offerings) is a spiritual, kingdom principle and a key to blessings and success.

Earlier He told them, “But you shall remember Yahweh your God for it is He that gives you the power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant ….” Deuteronomy 8:18


'''The Voice of the Hireling'''

If there arise - “a prophet or a dreamer”... “a sign or a wonder”. 
A prophet may claim to receive his vision or “word from Yahweh” while he was awake in a vision or in a dream while asleep (ASE Chumash, , p. 1007). A sign is a supernatural event in heaven while a wonder is a miraculous event on earth.  There are those among the people of Yahweh who, as Adam Clark states in his commentary on this verse, “pretend to have a Divine influence, so as to be able to direct others in the way of salvation”,  or shows some “miraculous proof of his mission...or some type of representation of what he wishes to bring you over to” (Vol. 1, p. 774).  (13:2-6) 

“You shall walk after Yahweh your Elohim, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice, and you shall serve Him, and cleave unto Him.”  (13:4)   Only by following this will we be preserved from hearing a false ‘prophet’ and be able to discern the difference between truth and error, from that which agrees with the Word and that which is contrary.   Yeshua said “My sheep hear My voice”  (John 10: 4-5)  If we know the voice of the Master, we will not follow the voice of strangers.  His voice is that which sounded out at Sinai of which Moshe is reminding them to ‘hear’ again, His commandments to them.

The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible quoting the Dead Sea Scrolls renders this verse as follows: “You shall walk after Yahweh your Elohim, and you shall serve Him, and listen to His voice, and cling to Him, and fear Him, and keep His commandment.&quot;

The editors of The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible comment that the syntactically (word order) variation between the two versions is significant since the latter reading offers a definition of what it means to follow Yahweh and a sequence in which the specified actions should be undertaken (p. 166, translated by Abegg, Flint and Ulrich).  These commentators state that the order in the DSSB gives us a better definition and a more accurate sequence of steps in the Believer’s growth in their walk with Yahweh.

Yeshua warned about false prophets in the latter days who would deceive many (Matt. 24:11) and false Messiahs who might even deceive the “very elect” (v. 24).  Paul talks about a “man of sin” that would arise showing signs and lying wonders such that some would fall from the truth of the salvation message of the Gospel (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12).

Paul warns, “do not be soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word... let no man deceive you by any means” (verses 2-3).  He then (in verses 15-17) encourages the brethren to stand fast in the simple truths of the Gospel of Yeshua:
“Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. Now our Master Yeshua the Messiah himself, and Elohim, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.&quot;

We need to take care that we are not being led astray from the simple Word of Yahweh, whether as found in the Tanakh (OT) or in the Apostolic Scriptures (NT) by people claiming to speak as an oracle from heaven.  Deuteronomy 13:3 says that Yahweh proves his people “to know whether you love Yahweh your Elohim with all your heart and with all your soul” by allowing such.

Jude, the half brother of Yeshua, speaking of the spiritual delusion to occur in the last days exhorts us to “earnestly contend for the faith which was once and for all delivered unto the saints” (Jude 1:3).  We must stand firm and earnestly contend every day for the true faith and not be allured by the siren’s song of the false prophets and teachers with demonstrations of ‘power’ in signs and wonders who lead people away from the Gospel truth into spiritual delusion and eternal oblivion.

And what is the voice of the Yahweh?  Is it not the Torah commandments that he audibly thundered from Mt. Sinai to the Israelites?  We do not have the right to be selective in our hearing and be one who “does what is right in his own eyes” (12:8).  

Do you make excuses why Yahweh’s words do not apply to you, why you are an exception to the rule and why your situation is unique and special?  Perhaps your finances, your marriage, your health, your family relationships and other areas in your life are a in disorder because you are not obeying Yahweh’s voice.  Stop and reflect for a moment on this.  Let the Ruach speak to you on this matter.  Then repent and resolve before Yahweh to change your attitude and course of life today!  (13:18)

“Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did.  Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.” [Exodus 32:6, 32:19]  We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.  We must not put Messiah to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents,  nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.  Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come.”   1 Corinthians 10:6 
The way of life is like a path between fire and ice.  The slightest bend in either direction is fatal.  What to do?  Walk in the middle…(Mishnah)   There is no room for God in those who are full of themselves…(Chassidic)

 
'''His Holy Sanctuary and Treasured Possession'''

“You are...a peculiar/treasured people unto Himself”. The term treasured people/am segulah is used several times in the Torah: in Exodus 19:4-6 when Yahweh betrothed Himself to and married the people of Israel they became  am segulah or treasured possession among all the peoples of the nation, a kingdom of priests and a kadosh/set-apart nation; then again in the present verse under analysis Moshe restates this same idea to the younger generation Israelites about to enter the Promised Land; and finally in Deuteronomy 26:17-19 where He again calls them  “treasured people” and admonishes them to keep His Torah-commands that He might “make you high above all the nations which he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor, and that you may be a set-apart people unto Yahweh your God.”   The prophet Malachi (3:17) uses the term.  So does the Psalmist who, singing in the Jerusalem Temple, praises God for having ‘chosen Jacob – Israel – as a treasured possession’” (135:3-4).  

With humility and gratefulness we should own this identity and make it a part of our innermost being.  This is brought forward by Peter for the Spirit-filled believers in 1 Peter 2:9.  Note that Yahweh has chosen us from among all the peoples of the earth as an ‘am segulah’ - a treasured possession, His holy dwelling place  - 

“Do you not know that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?  For you were bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s” 1 Cor.6:19-20

If we know that we are a special treasure and a called-out people destined for great things in the kingdom of God will not the reality of who we are and whose we are and what we are to become, effect our walk of righteousness here and now and inspire us to walk a little higher, a little more set-apart, a little closer to Yahweh, and to be a better spiritual light through our words, thoughts and deeds to the unbelievers around us?  It should, if we love Him.

“Only at the place that Yahweh will choose...to place His name there....shall you seek out His Presence [habitation] and come there.” (12:5)   The word Presence (as translated in the AS Edition Chumash) is the Hebrew word sheken/!kv (Strong’s H7933/TWOT 2387) and as a verb means to dwell or tabernacle, as a noun it means dwelling, or tabernacle.  According to TWOT the verb is used 129 times in the Tanakh (OT) of which 43 times Yahweh is the subject; that is, it describes where he dwells (e.g., on Mt. Zion [Psa. 74:2], among his people [Exod. 25:8], or in Jerusalem [Zech. 8:3]).  On several occasions it refers to His divine and glorious Presence dwelling among His people (e.g., Exod. 24:16; Psa. 85:9).  

The word mishkan which was the portable tabernacle, sanctuary or earthly dwelling place of the glorious Presence of Yahweh among His people is derived from this word.  Yahweh is saying  NOT to go just anywhere to worship Him, but to go only to where he has placed His name.  That will be where his manifest glory and Presence is to be found!  Where you fellowship and worship Him collectively with other Believers is the manifest glory and Presence of Yahweh. 

When David hungered and thirsted for Yahweh he would seek the Presence of Yahweh in the Set-apart Place where Yahweh’s name and glorious manifest Presence was to be found.  There he would literally experience the Presence and gain prophetic insight and understanding.   Those who are indwelt by His Spirit  today form His corporate ‘tabernacle’  in which He can manifest His Shekinah glory and Presence.   Yeshua said “where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in the midst”   
The criteria is in it being in His name  --  all that He is and all that He represents, for His Presence to be manifest.


'''Living As His Set Apart People'''

We are to be the kadosh, set apart and peculiar or treasured people of Yahweh. What we eat is a key factor in being set-apart unto Yahweh (14:2) .   We need to learn to live by the “whole counsel of the Word of God” (Acts 20:27) and come away from the paganized practices of other religious institutions.   Eating the true spiritual food of the Word goes hand-in-hand with eating ‘kosher’ (sanctified) physical food.  Yahweh calls these unclean foods  an “abominable thing” (verse 3).   Do we have strongholds and altars to pagan gods of pleasure and self-satisfaction --   Is our ‘belly’ our god” ?  Philippians 3:19

Yahweh has given very strict guidelines for eating.  In Deuteronomy 14 Yahweh clearly states what is clean and unclean. The observance of these food laws is a means of worship and showing respect to our God.   Of course, there is a health perspective also, as the eating of carnivores is inherently dangerous; their flesh carries more parasites and enzymes that cause physical problems.   There is a popular adage, “Man is what he eats.” The character of a person is affected and ultimately molded by his diet.  For instance, eating very spicy foods makes one excitable and temperamental while bland foods are calming and relaxing. Eating blood makes a person insensitive and even cruel.  Children inherit the character traits of their parents, so avoiding certain foods not only benefits the parents, but also prevents the children from inheriting undesirable character traits.

Yahweh has appointed set-apart times for His people to gather and worship Him and remember the covenant and His plan of redemption.  Three times a year He has ordained for them to appear before Him. (16:16)
The Israelites and first-century Messianic Believers planned their entire year’s schedule around them – they were that important to them.  The Feast Days are the skeletal framework of Yahweh’s entire plan of redemption (salvation) of Israel.  One cannot in good conscience keep the weekly Sabbath without keeping Yahweh’s annual Sabbaths.  They stand or fall together. 

Chapter 16 describes the appropriate means of observing Passover.  We need reminders of what our Father has done for us, and of Yeshua’s marvelous sacrifice for our sins.  Just as the Father tells us how to observe Passover, we are reminded in 1 Cor. 5: 9-13 of the importance of sanctification and separation.  Here reference is made to Deuteronomy 22:21,24, saying “Root out the wrongdoer from your community.”  The picture of leaven comes to mind, as we examine ourselves. Deuteronomy discusses eating with foreigners, slaves and family, but points out that there are times when, in order to please Yahweh,  one must be cautious about eating with unbelievers. 1 Cor. 5:11 (Oxford Study Bible) says “I meant that you are to have nothing to do with any so-called Christian who leads an immoral life, or is extortionate, idolatrous, a slander, a drunkard, or a swindler; with anyone like that you should not even eat.”  So, let us be careful.  It may seem that Yahweh has many rules for his people, but it all seems to come back to relationships.  

Our relationship with him, through Messiah Yeshua, our relationship with the brethren and our separateness from the world’s ways. 

An exemplification of His love in His people is characterised by their expressions of love for the poor and the needy. (15:7–11) Charity is one of the central pillars of Torah.  It is a reflection of God’s very nature.  It is grace itself.  The Master quotes the Deuteronomy 17:11 saying, “You always have the poor with you,” (John 12:8), and He expects us to give generously to them.  A majority of the Master’s teachings have to do with the subject of giving charity.  He assumes that we will give charity, saying, “When you give to the poor…” (Matthew 6:2)  He points out that even the hypocrites give charity. After all, the giving of charity is a commandment of the Torah.  Conversely, there is a prohibition, “not to deny charity to the poor.”  We are under obligation to ‘freely open our hand to our brother, to the needy and the poor.’ (15:11)
Knowing the natural heart of man, Moshe says, “your heart should not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing Yahweh your God shall bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand to”  (15:10)

Yahweh Himself will repay those who give to the ones He cares for and protects.  Some excuse themselves as having insufficient themselves, and therefore are not able to give.   The Talmud states it this way: “Everybody is obliged to give charity; even one who himself is dependent on charity should give to those less fortunate than himself.” (b.Gittin 7a)  It is a fact that you can always find someone less fortunate.

All of the Apostolic Scriptures, and especially the Pauline epistles, are packed with encouragements to give to those in need and to give generously.  Giving generously was a natural reflex of the First Century believers.  Paul regards giving generously as a proper response of gratitude for the grace which God has bestowed upon us.
When we give charity, it should be done subtly and quietly.  Yeshua tells us that when we give, we are not to announce with trumpets, i.e. we are not to make a show out of it, “that your giving be in secret.” (Matthew 6:4)  The true disciple asks “How much more can I give?  How can I find a way to give more?”
In the Midrash Rabbah it says, “The poor man does more for the giver than the giver does for the poor man.” (Leviticus Rabbah 34:8).  In Acts it says, “It is more blessed to give than to receive”  (Acts 20:35)   When we come across those in need, our hearts should leap with joy because suddenly we have the opportunity to return to Yahweh some of the wealth he has bestowed upon us.

When we celebrate our feasts we are instructed to share with the “stranger, the fatherless and the widow that is within our gates” This related to going up to the three festive occasions at Jerusalem.   We are to invite the needy to our festive meals and assure that they too rejoice in Yahweh’s goodness.  Consequently, one must “send for the poor” - either invite them to rejoice together with him, or send food to them so that they may rejoice in their own homes.  (14:28-29)

A person’s spiritual character is tested by how he keeps Yahweh’s commandments.   As with all we do, we need to align our actions and our lifestyle by the Torah - His set of instructions for us.
“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Messiah Yeshua is in you-- unless indeed you fail the test?  But I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test”.  For all of our lives we are each going to be tested from within and without.   (2 Corinthians 13:5-6)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shoftim-Judges  Deuteronomy 16:18-21:9

A detailed description is given in this parasha of the government which is to be set up to rule over the people and to guide them. Defined in the Scriptures are: the status of judges, how they are to be appointed, the principle by which they are to serve, the judicial system, the qualifications and selection of the king, the roles of the prophets, priests and Levites. These include the requirements for a judicial system, specific guidelines for a government headed by a king or regent, inheritance for the priesthood, prohibitions against various forms of false worship, how to deal with true or false prophets, the establishment of cities of refuge, laws regarding boundaries, commands for military warfare, and how to handle the discovery of a slain person in any tribal territory.

The main theme of this portion of Torah is summed up in one of the first verses: “Justice, only justice, you must pursue;…” Whether discussing the testimony of witnesses or the support of the Levites or the cities of refuge; justice has to be pursued in our lives.  Moving boundary markers or going to war or cutting down trees; we must know what is just.  And the purpose of providing judges is that if we aren’t sure, because sometimes the issue can get muddled, then Yahweh has provided that there be men and women (i.e. Deborah) with wisdom who sit in the position of ‘judges’.


'''Justice'''

The Shoftim portion concentrates on justice and what God requires of His people as they enter the Land of Promise.  The Creator, who is absolutely righteous and just, is very concerned that His chosen people maintain justice as they establish a governing system in Canaan.  For without righteous justice, God knows that any society will fail due to the human inclination toward evil inherited in the fallen nature.  Yahweh is very specific about these different areas of concern, because He recognizes that conflict is inevitable and that people need absolute rules and regulations in order to resolve conflict.  By detailing these ordinances from God, Moshe is giving the sons of Israel some fundamental guidelines for handling the different issues that will arise in the life of the nation.  Chapter 20 deals with the national army and war, a natural continuation of the subject of government in Israel. 

Israel has been called to be a “light unto the nations.”  Now, as the sons of Israel are preparing to enter into the Promised Land, Moshe will no longer be the person to turn to for resolution of conflict as he did in the wilderness.  As the different tribes inherit their specific territories, it will be incumbent upon each tribe to appoint judges to handle the conflict that is inevitable in human affairs and then over all a high court (the Sanhedrin) where matters which are not resolved by the lower courts in each locality may be taken.

Moshe lists a number of commands and criteria for the people who are to be appointed by the various tribes to function as judges and officers over disputes between people.  Yahweh God has designed man to be self-correcting and self-governing in order to maintain a testimony before Him in order to not incur His stricter judgment.

These principles were that they were to “judge the people with righteous judgment”, “not distort justice; .. not be partial, .. not take a bribe, .. ..  “Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue, that you may live and possess the land which Yahweh your God is giving you” (Deuteronomy 16:18-20).

The three basic criteria that Jethro originally counseled Moshe to discern in a judge were:  “men who fear God, men of truth and those who hate dishonest gain.”  (Exodus 18:13-24)   In many respects, these are similar character traits that Moshe is instructing the sons of Israel to find in the judges that will preside over conflict in each of the cities that will be established in the tribal territories about to be conquered.   

The first attribute that a judge must have is a healthy fear of Yahweh.  In selecting judges, one must understand that the fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.   (Proverbs 9:10).
Therefore, in the selection of judges, the people must discern that the judges truly fear the Holy One of Israel.  Fear generates wisdom, which in turn gives one knowledge and then understanding of the Holy One.  By fearing the Creator, one recognizes that His justice is absolutely perfect in all of its ways.  The goal is then to attempt to emulate His perfect justice and be partial toward the wealthy or the poor. 

The second attribute that a judge must have is to be a man of truth.  In other words, one needs to recognize that truth comes from the very Word of God embodied in the covenants and the testimonies of the Almighty.  By studying and applying the absolutes of the written Word, a judge is not relying upon his own standards but the standards of the Holy One.   (Psalm 25:9-10).   

The third attribute that is required of a judge is that he hates dishonest gain.  Moshe elaborates this point in this portion to further qualify the perversion of justice that comes from a bribe:  “and you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous” (Deuteronomy 16:18).  In this statement Moshe indicates that even the wise and righteous will be blinded if he is bribed.  Therefore, the need to hate dishonest gain is paramount.

The etymology of the Hebrew word for bribery “shochad”  is “chad” - “one.”  When a judge accepts bribery from a litigant he becomes “one” with him and he can no longer judge objectively the argument of the other litigant.  (according to the Gemara (Ketubot 105b)  Alternatively, according to the Gemara (Shabbat 10a), when a judge rules a case honestly he becomes a partner with Yahweh God.  An honest judge is one who has a mind of his own.  He does not permit people to influence him, nor does he waiver one iota from Torah teaching.  An improper judge is one who permits himself to be easily influenced by the whims and wills of those around him.  He is compared to a tree since he bends and sways to all sides in the wind of public opinion, trying to satisfy the group with the most potential for advancing his interests.  The Torah must be the basis of all judgement and although Rashi advocates obedience even if the authorities are in error this is not the meaning of the scripture. 

The bottom line for Israel is that God requires His judges to exercise, to the best of their human ability, justice that is a reflection of His perfect justice.  By placing the above criteria upon the judges selected for the different cities, Israel, or any subsequent society has the best chance of administering justice in a fair and equitable manner.


'''The Legal System'''

“Judges (Shophtim) and  police (or officers - shotrim) shall you give yourselves in all of your gates...” (16:18).  If a matter arises which is too complex [lit. too wonderful] for them to adjudicate and there was a controversy or disagreement which arose as to the guilt or punishment to be executed in the lower court of an area, then they were to get up and go to the Place, where Yahweh had placed His name to the priests and presiding judge there of the high court (the Sanhedrin) and bring the matter to them for them to make a ruling which then would be binding upon the lower court to execute.

Thus, the lower courts would not dispute with one another and the High Court would take final responsibility for transmitting the laws accurately.  Hence the Torah prescribes a legal system that consists of two circles. The outer circle involves the establishment of courts in “all of your gates,” while the inner circle describes a court that is located in the “place that God will choose” (i.e. the Temple), which serves as the final arbiter in all matters of doubt arising in the courts that are “in your gates.”  
“...for out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of God from Jerusalem (Isaiah 2:3).”  A full measure of justice can take place only in the ‘presence’ of God -  “...in the midst of the judges, He gives judgment” (Psalms 82:1).

There were three types of courts in Israel.  One had three judges, another had 23 judges, and the last one had 71 judges.  Cities with a population of less than 120 people had a court, beit din, with three judges.  Cities with a population greater than 120 people had a beit din that consisted of 23 judges, which was called “a little  sanhedrin”.  Courts consisting of three judges could only judge cases concerning money . There had to be a court with 23 judges in order to pass judgments concerning life and death.  In Yerushalayim there were three courts, two with 23 judges and one with 71, where the high priest presided as the leader.  The one with 71 judges was called “the great Sanhedrin”, and is often translated as “the Sanhedrin”.  The men who made up the great Sanhedrin had a designated gathering place in the temple.


'''Authorities Ordained by Yahweh'''

In Exodus 21:22 and 22: 8 instructions for courts to resolve disputes was taught.  Now a formal command is given that they be established in every city of Israel.   In addition to judges (shoftim),  ‘shoterim’ also are required which function as officers of the court to carry out the court’s decisions and enforce the laws of the shoftim (judges).  These would circulate in the public places and summon violators and bring them to the court for adjudication.   A modern counterpart would be the function of sheriffs and deputies as officers of the peace (i.e. - police)  Officers are necessary to execute the decisions of the courts of justice.

These men were to serve Yahweh and teach the people according to Torah.  The Father was so sure of His appointments that He told the people they should be put to death if the people did not “then act according to what they (the Judges) have told you.”   And, it was to be the hand of the witness to the offence that was to be the first to execute the judgement, thus making that person responsible for their testimony, knowing that they would have to follow through and put their hand to the person, making a witness more careful to be correct in his testimony, understanding that it would mean the person’s life if they made wrong assumptions or their ‘evidence’ was not valid.  The life sentence also deters offenders.

When we come to the new covenant, the apostles were chosen by our Messiah Himself. Those apostles then fasted and prayed before laying hands on others, thus imparting to them the ordained authority to judge.  In our scriptures in Timothy, Paul warns “Do not be hasty in granting s’mikhah to anyone,” S’mikhah is the granting of authority by the laying on of hands, a Hebrew custom.  Yeshua referred to this system of justice in Matthew 18:15-20 where two or three are to decree the judgement.

 We are supposed to be able to trust the authorities Yahweh places over us if they have been divinely appointed.  Yeshua transferred the role of the ‘shoftim’ and ‘shoferim’ from the scribes and Pharisees who had continued the line of succession and sat in “Moshe’s seat” of authority,  to His chosen ministry of apostles and prophets.  (Matthew 18:15-20; 16:19; 23:2-3)

We see the exercise of this authority in Acts 15 regarding regulations for the believers coming to the faith from the “Gentiles”. We must begin to pray for mature men to arise in our assemblies and fellowships.  People who are humble, but sure of the place Yahweh has chosen for them to serve Him.  Older women also are to have a role in teaching the younger women - Titus 2:4
Let us seek after the wisdom of Yahweh for the controversies in our lives.   He has set up those to be judges.   Let us not presume to know what is best.   1 Timothy 5:17-21

“If a case comes before you at your city gate which is too difficult for you to judge, concerning bloodshed, civil suit, personal injury or ANY OTHER controversial issue; you are to get up, go to the place which Yahweh your God will choose, and appear before the priests, who are Levites, and the judge in office at the time.  Seek their opinion, and they will render a verdict for you. You will then act according to what they have told you there in that place which Yahweh will choose; you are to take care to act according to all their instructions.  In accordance with the Torah they teach you, you are to carry out the judgment they render, not turning aside to the right or the left from the verdict they declare to you.  Anyone presumptuous enough not to pay attention to the priest appointed there to serve Yahweh your Elohim or to the judge---that person must die.  Thus you will exterminate such wickedness from Isra’el---all the people will hear about it and be afraid to continue acting presumptuously.”  (17:8-13) 
Moshe is teaching respect and obedient to the spiritual leaders Yahweh has placed over us.   We must follow their wise counsel at all times and not only when it suits our fleshly nature, understanding of course that the leader’s appointment is legitimate.  


'''Establishing Evidence'''

Evidence is to be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses  (17:6 and 19:15).  One could not be accused of a crime without the testimony of two or three eyewitnesses.  This admonition is repeated in the apostolic scriptures.

• Matthew 18:16, “But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.&quot;

• 2 Corinthians 13:1, “This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.&quot;

• 1 Timothy 5:19, “Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.&quot;

• Hebrews 10:28, “He that despised Moshe’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses.”


Most gossip and slander would stop if this commandment were followed, and hence much division and strife within the Body of Believers.  How many times have you repeated hearsay and gossip without checking the source. Even if you know it to be true, is it beneficial and righteous to report it to others?  One Jewish rabbi goes so far as to say that Messiah has not come back because of all our gossip and slander.  At the very least, the Ruach is greatly grieved, our intimacy with Yahweh God is diminished, our marriages, families, friendships and congregations are hurt or destroyed because we speak things which should not be uttered.

How often do we accuse, slander, gossip about other people through use of the “evil tongue” (lashon hora) without going through proper channels and following proper protocols as Yeshua instructed in Matthew 18?  How often do we attack others and spread our evil reports and accusations about others when we were not eyewitnesses to what occurred or were not even involved in the matter?  How often do we attack Yahweh’s leaders and accuse them of evil when there are no other witnesses?  Yahweh hates those who sow discord among brethren and lying false witnesses   (Prov. 6:16-17,19). 


'''Cities of Refuge'''

Our parasha details the command to establish cities that are intended so that “anyone who has killed may flee there.”  The parasha is quite similar to the command to establish cities of refuge found in parashat Mas’ei (Numbers 35). 

In the Numbers portion, the definition of intentional murder and unintentional murder is made (35: 3-28).    In Numbers, the impression is that the city of refuge has legal significance, and that it serves two functions.  Firstly, it serves as a sort of detention center, facilitating protection of the slayer until he is brought to justice: “The cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger, so that the slayer shall not die before he stands before the congregation in judgment.”  Secondly, after the trial, it serves as a sort of prison, where the slayer must stay – even against his will – until the death of the Kohen Gadol.   During this period, he benefits from the protection that the city of refuge provides from the avenger of the blood who is threatening him but also it is a form of punishment, and even if he wishes to leave, he may not.  It appears that, in principle, even an unintentional slayer is deserving of death, and under certain conditions he may in fact be put to death by the court – if he leaves the city of refuge.  Because he killed unintentionally, the Torah treats him leniently and allows him to exchange the death penalty – which he deserves – for a punishment of imprisonment.  It would seem, according to the Torah’s approach in this parasha, that a person is always held responsible for causing another person’s death, even if he did so unintentionally.  Therefore, the city is referred to as a “city of refuge,” serving as a “refuge from the avenger.”  This is based on the view that an unintentional slayer needs a city where he will be protected from the avenger, who is entitled to kill him.   The congregation is to make judgement on the situation and restore his to the city of refuge where he fled after the incident,   if he is not found guilty of actual murder.  Numbers 35: 5-6   He must remain there  - until the death of the High Priest which then serves as an atonement for his life.  Numbers 35:25-28

In contrast, in our parasha here, it seems that the city of refuge is not a punishment, but rather – on the contrary – a privilege for the unintentional slayer.  The difference is that this passage covers a more accidental situation which were not so much a matter of negligence or events which were not premeditated.  Society is obligated to attend to the unfortunate plight of these truly unintentional slayers – similarly to the institutions that exist today, such as shelters for women who fear husbands who seek to harm or even kill them.  This, then, is a public obligation: to ensure convenient access to the cities of refuge.  No mention is made of the prohibition of not being able to leave the city here,  this arrangement arises from the wishes of the slayer and his fear of the avenger; if he so wishes, he may leave the city.  This is a type of amendment to cover more accidental types of manslaughter - compare negligent or drunken driving to an accident that occurred from lack of visibility or an unexpected heart attack.

The entire unit is intended precisely to prevent the shedding of the innocent blood of the unintentional slayer, and this is the reason for the establishment of the cities of flight and the signposting of the way to them.  Bloodshed has a particular power to corrupt and pollute the earth.  (Genesis 4:10;  Numbers 35:33)  Therefore, aside from the demands of justice that murder be punished, there is a social necessity first of all prevent unintentional murderer,  and secondly to atone for the blood spilled without any murderer apprehended. This is the responsibility of society as a whole, as part of the mechanism of setting up a working responsible government whose role is to protect the foundations of society.  No other sin (other than idolatry) has this social effect, this degree of social perniciousness.

Numbers 35.30 and Deuteronomy 17.6-7and 19.15 require that the death penalty not be imposed unless there are at least two eyewitnesses who identify the murderer.  Criminals convicted of murder without the required two eyewitnesses were sentenced to life without parole, actually living out their life and dying in prison. 
The requirement of two eyewitnesses was likely to avoid executing an innocent person based on false testimony of a lone vindictive enemy of the accused.  Complicity of two false witnesses was considerably more difficult and risky. Police today know, however, that eyewitnesses are notoriously inaccurate.  In the panic of the moment eyewitnesses often misperceive what actually transpired, later disagreeing with one another.  Modern standards of DNA pattern-matching, fingerprinting and the like arguably make murder convictions more certain than the testimony of two eyewitnesses. 


'''A King in Israel'''  (17:14-20). 

It was Yahweh’s will for Israel to be ruled by a king, although when they did ask for a king it was born out of their fleshly desires and was therefore a rejection of Yahweh’s direct reign over them.  It was the desire to have a king ‘like’ the nations around them, according to secular law, rather than have a king Of God’s appointment ruling according to His Torah.  They were in effect, in rebellion against Yahweh and His laws.  Their first king Saul was the people’s choice, the second, David, was God’s choice. 

We see in the negative things outlined in this passage,  its fulfilment in Solomon, through his spiritual decline. 1 Kings 4:26 Solomon also had 40,000 stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen.
1 Kings 11:3 He had seven hundred royal wives and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned his heart away. Not only is this passage talking about Solomon but it is also talking about anyone who would sit on the throne of Israel who is not part of Israel (v.15)  “you may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your brother.”  (05237  nokri (648d)  Meaning: foreign, alien  Origin: from the same as 5235b)  A perfect example of this is Herod. He was not a native son of Israel but was a “nokri”, a foreigner.  

Yahweh ordained righteous leadership to help guide His people in the ways of truth and righteousness.  When there is no leadership everyone does what is right in his own eyes as occurred during the time of the judges. 
The king was to know the Torah so that he could rule righteously based on the Word of Yahweh (vs.18-19).   He was to make two copies of the Torah and he was do this in the presence of the Priests and keep it with him and study it all the days of his life.  He was to keep one in his treasure chamber and the other was to go with him when he wherever he went so he would read from it daily and follow it in all that he did so that all would be well with him and his sons who would follow after him.

We might take this for granted but we know from reading the books of 1 and 2 Kings and Chronicles that the kings of Israel and then Judah and Ephraim, in most cases, did not do what the Torah said to do here.  Had the kings followed the Torah as Moshe had instructed at the command of God, things might have turned out differently.  

The book of Revelation says that the saints will be kings and priests ruling with Yeshua in the Millennium.  To be in that position of leadership we need to be preparing ourselves now.  The study of Yahweh’s Word needs to be a priority in our lives so that we may know how to execute righteous judgement in His kingdom.   How we prepare now for the future by our study and practice of Torah - His commandments, will determine our level of reward in Yahweh’s kingdom.  See  Matthew 5:19


'''The Office of the Levites'''

Moshe outlines the support for the Levites (18:1-8) who are to serve the people and then goes on to define the abominable practices practices by which the idolatrous people round about them seek guidance for their lives in contrast to the system He has established through the general instructions in His Word and officers and judges for specific needs.  (18:9- )

The listed abominations are  --
By Divination through 
*An Astrologer:-  an observer of clouds,: a star gazer, :and a soothsayer.  A horoscope reader today.
*An Enchanter:-  an omen reader or a fortune teller, this also includes superstitions
*A Sorcerer :-  one who uses drugs or herbs to cure or inflict disease
*A Charmer:-  one who casts spells
*A Spiritualist:-  one who consults spirits or who impersonates the dead - a medium.
*A Wizard/Witch::	-  one who consults familiar spirits or who has a spirit guide, i.e. occult practices
*A Necromancer	-  one who enquires of the dead

Yahweh makes it very clear that He has not appointed this form of spiritual guidance and that it was the cause of His judgement on the nations inhabiting the land prior to them.   But that He will raise up a Prophet like unto Moshe and to Him we are to listen.  The prophetic word of Yahweh would come through that One to guide  and teach them in the way they should go. 


'''The Prophet Like Moshe'''

In Deuteronomy 18:15–19 Moshe told the Children of Israel that Yahweh would one day raise a prophet “like me from among you, from your own countrymen.”  
The greatest of the prophets is Moshe, therefore the Torah is the greatest source of revelation. Yet the Torah itself speaks of another prophet, a prophet equal to Moshe… Messiah is the prophet like unto Moshe.  Therefore the life and ministry of Moshe serve as a Messianic prototype that the ultimate Messiah is expected to reflect.  The Jewish commentaries often refers to Moshe and Messiah, respectively, as the First Redeemer and the Ultimate Redeemer.  As a prophet like Moshe, the life and work of Messiah must reflect the pattern set by Moshe.

Both Moshe and Messiah are born in a time of national bondage.  Both redeemers appear after Israel waits generations for redemption.  Both redeemers are destined to break the bondage of Israel and lead her into the promised land.  Both perform unparalleled signs and wonders to validate their ministry.  Both act in the role of Law-giver and singular authority of Torah.  Both fill the role of intercessor between God and the nation.  Both do the work of reconciliation, renewing God’s covenant relationship with Israel when that covenant is compromised.

Through the course of His ministry, Moshe filled all three of the ‘Messianic’ offices for which a person received anointing with oil: prophet, priest and king.  He was the quintessential prophet, speaking on God’s behalf to the entire nation.  He served in the priesthood, sacrificing and performing the rites of a priest before Aaron and his sons were ordained.  As leader, judge and law-giver, Moshe served as a sort of king over Israel.  As with the First Redeemer, so too the Ultimate Redeemer.  
Yeshua is prophet, priest and king!

Moshe was unlike all other prophets because God spoke directly to him: conversationally, without riddles or mysteries.  Because of this unique level of revelation, when Moshe spoke as a prophet, his voice was the equivalent of the voice of God.  No other prophet attained the level of prophecy in which Moshe operated.  But the writer of the book of Hebrews demonstrates that Messiah’s revelation supersedes even that of Moshe.  Messiah is like unto Moshe in that He alone speaks directly for the Father.

Therefore, it is a command to listen to and obey the words of Messiah as if they were the words of Moshe—and even greater.  By calling Him a prophet like unto Moshe, and instructing us to heed Him, the Torah grants its own authority to Yeshua the Messiah. In inaugurating the new covenant,  He imparted the spirit of the Father (Ruach haKodesh) to His people to guide and teach them.

This was the ultimate fulfilment of this prediction, where every man would “know Yahweh” and discern His will, through the prophetic guidance of the Ruach Ha Kodesh (the holy Spirit)   John 16:12-15


'''Idolatrous Practices'''

Idolatry was singled out in this parasha as transgressing the covenant.  (17:2-3).  It is not so much as having violated a specific commandment, but that he is undermining the covenant in the Land of Israel. 

The second section states the prohibition of planting an ‘ashairah’ which was a grove of trees that was planted by the ancients for the purposes of idolatry. “Do not plant for yourselves an ashairah (i.e. a grove) of any tree...”.   There is an ancient custom to plant trees at the entrance of pagan temples, see Judges 6:30.  For this reason it is forbidden to plant trees on the temple mount. 

In Canaanite culture the placement of the tree next to an altar signified the presence of this goddess  to whom the sacrifices were offered.  The same thing was done in Baal worship.   The tree thus represented the presence of the ‘god’ to whom the sacrifice was offered on the altar beside it.  The tree planted is like any other tree.  It is the concept attached to it that transforms it into a forbidden object.
The literal meaning of the text seems to indicate a connection between the tree and the act of calling in God’s Name.  It is therefore likely that the planting of the tree was meant to indicate the sanctity of the place, as an expression of a god’s presence.  Thus, we are forbidden to erect objects even if they are meant only to represent the presence of God, as it were, and not Yahweh Himself.  Even if this action is meant to indicate to Whom we are offering our sacrifices or make the place itself sanctified/holy. 
 

'''Child Sacrifice'''

Child sacrifice (the ancient form of modern abortion/infanticide) though a pagan practice that Yahweh abhorred was practiced by both Houses of Israel as they drifted into syncretism with the heathen cultures around them (see 1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:10,13; 2 Kings 16:3;21:6; Jer. 7:31; 11:5; Ezek. 16:20; 23:37).  Baal appears to be a synonym of Molach (see Jer. 19:5) (Ency. Britan. eleventh edit, vol. 18, p. 676).  The dead bodies of sacrificed children were thrown into the garbage dump of the Valley of Hinnom or Tophet just below the Temple Mount in Jerusalem (Jer. 7:31; 19:5-6).  Apparently, the children were not burned alive, but were slain (by knife) like any other sacrifice before being thrown into the fire and then into the garbage dump
  
The ancients sacrificed their children to appease their blood thirsty gods of prosperity, sensuality and fertility (The Story of Civilization, vol 1, by Will Durant, pp. 66-67, 297). 
It was done in honor of their deity, i.e., that which was the king of their lives, i.e. it ruled their lives.  The chief deities of the modern world are Money and wealth - Sex and pleasure - Fun and entertainment.   Today parents abort their babies for much the same ‘gods’  as those of the ancients:  prosperity, greed, hedonism and so on.  Are we any different or any more “civilized” than the ancients? Yahweh called abortion an abomination (which means disgusting, abominable, abhorrent, detestable or loathsome) (Deut. 17:9). 
 

'''The Ultimate Prophet and Judge of All'''

In this passage that Moshe is declaring that eventually Yahweh will raise up a prophet like him, whose words MUST be followed.  It is from this passage that the ultimate justice for humanity will be executed.  Moshe declares that a future prophet will make declarations that must be believed.  As he introduces this future prophet, Moshe recalls the incidence that takes place at Mt. Horeb when he is receiving the Ten Commandments directly from the Almighty:  (Ex. 20:18-22).

The thunder, the lightning, the sound of the Heavenly Shofar and the smoking mountain terrified the sons of Israel witnessing this awesome display of His power.  It was at this time that they asked that Moshe be the spokesperson for Yahweh to avoid Him speaking to them personally again with all the manifestations thereof.   As Moshe describes a future prophet, he adds a statement that the sons of Israel MUST listen to him.  In fact, the future prophet will serve a similar role as Moshe.  God will put His words in his mouth which he will speak to all that he is commanded to speak.  

“Yahweh your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your countrymen, you shall listen to him.”  Then this sobering caveat is added:  ‘It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him”  (Deut. 18:15-19).

In the Gospel of John, Yeshua brings this passage of Scripture to light as He declares in so many words that He is the prophet that Moshe was speaking of in this passage rebuking them for not listening to him.   “For if you believed Moshe, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me.  “But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?”  (John 5:18-47)

Yeshua makes it perfectly clear that He is from the Father and that He does nothing on His own initiative.  The words that He declares are the words of the Father.  These are the words that the Holy One requires all to heed.
Interestingly, it is in this passage that Yeshua states that in searching the Scriptures, men think they have eternal life.  Instead, it is the words of Scriptures that actually testify about the Messiah.  Those who search the Scriptures and do not understand that Yeshua is the future prophet that Moshe speaks of, are unwilling to come to Him in order that they might receive eternal life.

After Shavuot (Pentecost), the Apostle Peter is explaining about the Resurrection and Ascension of the Messiah to his listeners in Jerusalem and he had these words to declare:
“But the things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Messiah would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.  “Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of Yahweh; and that He may send Yeshua, the Messiah appointed for you, whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.  “Moshe said, ‘Yahweh GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN; TO HIM YOU SHALL GIVE HEED to everything He says to you.  ‘And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.’  “ (Acts 3:18-26).   As Moshe had said, God would require it of the person who did not listen to Him. 

When you take this to heart and read and consider the words of Yeshua, recognizing that He is the future prophet that Moshe is speaking of in the Shoftim portion, you realize that His words MUST be believed or you will face eternal separation from the Holy One.  According to the statements of Moshe, Yahweh will require His children to believe the words of this future prophet.  
For those without faith, it is impossible to believe His words.  And yet God requires us to believe in them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ki Tetse-When You Go Out   Deuteronomy 21:10-25:19

Mostly Devarim (Deuteronomy) is a book of reminders of laws and statutes given previously and is preparation for entering the promised land.  If these commandments and list of admonitions had been adhered to perfectly, then it would seem that the results would be a society that is absolutely pleasing to the Holy One of Israel.  Situations regarding inheritance, rebellious children, capital punishment, property rights, clothing adornment, bird eggs, parapets, horticulture, fabric usage, marital and sexual relations, standards for the illegitimate, regulations regarding their relations with the neighbouring peoples, nocturnal emissions, sanitation, slave relations, promiscuity, lending restrictions, vow commitments, agricultural allowances, kidnapping, leprosy situations, prompt payment of wages, judicial regulations, treatment of widows and orphans, proper punishment laws (lashings), sibling relations, equal weights and measures, handling the Amalek (their enemy) problem just to name some of the details.

Moshe prescribes principles of domestic life, family laws, laws of equity, relationship of employer and worker, exercise of justice for the stranger, the orphan, the widow; kindness to animals and justice to their owners in regard to livestock; honesty and integrity in weights and measures.  It actually contains a total of seventy-four positive and negative commandments. 

Moshe gives a number of additional laws here that are to be observed as part of the new society, including rules about maintaining the purity of the military camp; prohibitions about returning an escaped slave; the duty to pay a worker on time; the proper treatment of a debtor and the prohibition against charging interest on a loan; the laws of divorce; the penalty of 39 lashes for transgression of a Torah prohibition; and the procedures for yibbum (“levirate marriage”) of the wife of a deceased childless brother. The degrading chalitzah ceremony (“removing of the shoe”) is explained for the case of a brother-in-law who is unwilling to marry the wife of his deceased brother.

In this Torah portion we see a plethora of laws concerning many seemingly small details regarding human life.  As we make our way back to a more biblically-based lifestyle and orientation we begin to see that Yahweh cares about the details of our lives.  Matthew Henry in his commentary says of these various laws: “God’s providence extends itself to the smallest affairs, and his precepts do so, that even in them we may be in the fear of Yahweh, as we are under his eye and care...If we would prove ourselves to be God’s people, we must have respect to his will and to his glory, and not to the vain fashions of the world. Even in putting on our garments, as in eating or in drinking, all must be done with serious regard to preserve our own and other’s purity in heart and actions.”   (22: 5-12)

Many of the laws of Yahweh’s penal code are preventative in nature.  Such is the case with the wayward and rebellious son. In ancient Israel there were no prisons since it was the goal of Yahweh’s Torah-laws to root out evil before it spread endangering society.  Parents’ love for Yahweh must supersede that of their children to uphold His standards and to prevent them from going down the path of faithlessness and rebellion  (21:18-21) 
Many of the mitzvot (commands) appearing in Parshat Ki Tetzei deal with relationships between men and women, several dealing specifically with marriage. According to the beginning of the Talmudic Tractate Kiddushin, the first verse of chapter 24 - when a man takes a wife” - serves as the textual basis for the contracting of marriages. 

A society depends upon the faith people place in one another.  Without people feeling that they can rely upon one another that others are looking out for what belongs to me and I must look out for what belongs to them society collapses in suspicion, selfishness, and bitter contention” (A Torah Commentary For Our Times, vol. 3, p. 149).   On the passage of returning lost property, one rabbinical commentator states: “The commandment to return lost property is ‘fundamental’ and that ‘all society depends upon it.’   In this respect let us not forget the second half of the shema: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  It is not just a matter of one person taking care of another’s possessions or of ‘loving’ another. What is important here is the critical matter of ‘trust’ among human beings.   22:1-4


'''The Essence of Iniquity'''

Yahweh has given to us the model for living righteously in accordance with His principles and in harmony with  our fellow-man.  Using our own reasonings against complying with them,  is in effect lawlessness.  By rendering them of non-effect in our lives and thereby placing ourselves above Yahweh’s Torah-law,  we become a law unto ourselves, which scripture identifies as iniquity.  This is humanism: every man doing what is right in his own eyes, instead of obeying Yahweh whatever the cost.  The bottom line is, is Yahweh master of our life, or have we placed self on the throne of our life?  The essence of sin is living in independence of God, establishing for ourselves what is right and wrong in our own eyes and thereby being ‘as god’.   It was our rebellious sin nature which is bent on going our own way that took Him to the torture stake.

“All of us like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; but Yahweh has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him. .. .. ..  He was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke as due? .. .. .. Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, and He will divide the booty with the strong; because He poured out Himself to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet He Himself bore the sin of many, and interceded for the transgressors” 
“For You do not desire sacrifice; else would I give it: You delight not in burnt offering. (51:17) The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You wilt not despise.”   Isaiah 53: 6, 8,12;  Psalms 51:16

All of our service for Him and worship does not compensate for humble submission to His will to obey the statutes and judgements of God.  There is no special status which places anyone above keeping His commandments.  We can be someone special however, and have a part in Yahweh’s eternal plan and share in the glory of His will being done on earth as it is in heaven, simply by being obedient.  We cannot otherwise partake in His kingdom purposes.

As Yeshua said, “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.  Many will say unto Me in that day ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’  And then I will declare unto them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.  Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine and does them, I will liken him to  a wise man who built his house on the rock”   Matthew 7:21-24
   
Yahweh does not actually need us to fulfil His eternal plan, He doesn’t need you or me to get His job done!  He has an eternal plan and whether or not we obey His statutes and judgements, whether or not we clean up our acts and return to Him in repentance, whether or not we go out and come in when we’re told,  He will work out His eternal plan with, or without us.  He doesn’t depend on your or my obedience, or your or my ministry to get the job done, but whether we do or not will determine our eternal destiny. When we are submitted to Yahweh in the right manner, we’ll do the things He likes and we’ll make ourselves available to be used by Him.  When we’re submitted to Him we’ll be gathered under the shadow of His wings.

What do you do personally with laws about women wearing mens-type clothing, mixed fibres in clothing, lending without interest; caring for the widows and orphans, personal hygiene, family purity laws (e.g. men not having physical relations with their wives during their cycles), removing blood from all meat before eating it, men wearing beards, faithfully tithing, eating only kosher meats, keeping Yahweh’s Sabbaths (weekly and annual); etc.?  These are lifestyle changing laws, many of which go contrary to the culture of our society.  We are called to be a kadosh, set-apart, special and peculiar (i.e., treasured) people before Yahweh.  We need to examine what progress we are making to bring our lives into conformity to His standards of righteousness.


'''Rebellion in Society'''

The originators of a family are the parents, who are analogous to a vine, and the offspring are compared to the grapes.  The quality of the vine will determine its produce.   When a man and woman enter into marriage, it is extremely important that  they have similar views and mutual goals for the family they hope to raise. Unfortunately, the husband and wife sometimes do not see eye to eye in their aspirations for their children. The Torah is telling us that when a child is exposed to a “kol aviv” - “a father’s voice” - and a “kol imo” - “a mother’s voice” - each one telling the child different things, it is possible that the child, receiving mixed signals, may end up being wayward and rebellious.

“If an ish (man) have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his ‘ab (father), or the voice of his ‘em (mother), and, though they chasten him, will not listen to them;  then shall his ‘ab and his ‘em lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place;  and they shall tell the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.  All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you; and all Yisrael shall hear, and fear.”   Deuteronomy 21:18-23

This appears like a cruel and heartless act especially if you are a loving parent.  Take a closer look at what we are being told here.  First of all careful reading of this passage clearly informs us that the subject is not your ordinary child. It could seem from the text that the judges simply took the parents word as to the condition of the child and immediately passed judgment and had the child stoned to death but cases were always judged on the testimony of two or three witnesses.  Deut.17:6-7
A thorough investigation of the situation had to follow the charges supported by eye witnesses to the conduct of the child.  The fact that the ‘ab and ‘em chastened him/her, obviously countless of times due to stubbornness and rebellion, clearly indicates that these parents tried everything possible to correct their child so as to get them back on the right track.  Nothing obviously worked.  In total exasperation and frustration over the situation and the condition of their child; stubborn, rebellious, a glutton and a drunkard (remember these charges), they bring him/her to the Shoftim who were always available at the gates of each city.

The biblical implications of the charges made against the child of stubbornness, rebellion, gluttony and drunkenness are all direct affronts to Yahweh Himself when parents are teaching their children His principles.   Such a child is set upon rebellion against Yahweh and the judgement to be administered is for the preservation of a righteous community by removing the leaven from the midst of it.   This was to prevent the inevitable crimes which he would commit if allowed to enter into society as an adult.
The phrase “stubborn and rebellious” in Hebrew has the implication of one who throws off the authority of both parents and Yahweh God.  It is not simply a ‘naughty child’, and the expression of a ‘glutton and a drunkard’ is more than eating and drinking in excess, it is literally a lifestyle of riotous debauchery - a person who has no control over his passions and his life.

There are no recorded instances of this judgement being executed.  The decree itself was a preventative measure and a strong incentive for parents to fulfill their obligation to teach their children and instill in them the Torah and also cautioned the children, knowing the ultimate judgement that awaited them if they continued in rebellion (Deut. 6:6-9).  We have the results of this principle not being applied today in laws favouring children over their parents.  As a result laws actually punish the parents who try to strongly discipline stubborn and rebellious children.  These are the chaotic results of our disobedience to His laws.

In Luke 7:34, Yeshua alludes to this passage when He says, “The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard…’” These are two of the criteria the Torah requires for putting a rebellious son to death.  Yeshua was contrasting His approach to piety with that of John the Immerser. Unlike Yeshua, John practiced a severe asceticism and ate only locusts and honey, whereas Yeshua ate and drank freely. The same people who criticized Yeshua for eating and drinking freely, regarded John’s behavior as demonic.  Regarding John’s asceticism, Yeshua remarked, “For John the Immerser has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’” (Luke 7:33)  In other words, the opponents of the gospel of repentance dismissed John on the basis that he was an ascetic, and they dismissed Yeshua because He was not an ascetic.  Accusing Him of being a glutton and drunkard, they attempted to associate Him with the rebellious son of Deuteronomy 21.


'''Co-laborers with Him”'''

The children of Israel were to be a holy nation with just laws and a righteous judicial system which was covered in the previous parasha, Shoftim.  The logical next step in the process of building a nation based on righteousness, would be to regulate how individuals relate to each other.  It is for this purpose that KiTeitzei recites all these commandments.  We all as children of our heavenly father need to come under His discipline and be corrected that He may receive us as true sons.

“For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls.  You have not yet resisted to bloodshed striving a against sin. .. .. My son, do not despise the chastening of Yahweh, nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;  For whom Yahweh loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives”   Hebrews 12: 3-4, 5-6

Yeshua was judged and found guilty in the Roman court of justice by the testimony of false witnesses and executed by the hand of Rome’s might.   In this regard, Yeshua was initially charged with blasphemy by the Jewish leaders of His day (Matt. 26:65; Mark 14:64; John 10:33) - an offence that was punishable by stoning (Lev. 24:11-16).  However, the provision made in the Law for an offender to be “hung on a tree” was used to justify the sentence of death by Roman crucifixion (Matt. 27:31; Mark 15:13-4; Luke 23:21; John 19:6, 15).   He stood in for us when it should have been us who should have been placed on the tree to die for our sin.  The Father loved us so much that He asked His Son to die in our place because He knew only the death of His Son could wipe the slate clean.  
Paul wrote, “Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us - for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree” (Gal. 3:13).  The Apostle Peter also had this in mind when he wrote: “The God of our fathers raised Yeshua, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree” (Acts 5:30; cp. Acts 10:39-40); and, “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.  By his wounds you have been healed.”   (1 Peter 2:24).

These scriptures relate to a person whose sin is worthy of death, if he is hung on a tree, his body is to be taken down and buried that same day so that the land is not defiled by the accursed person (21:22-23).  This is what happened to Yeshua the Messiah, but He suffered this death because of our sin of rebellion, not His own!  We were the ones who were rebellious, acting like gluttons and drunkards in our rebellious attitude towards our heavenly Father, by disobeying Him even when He took the time to teach us His ways over and over. 

According to the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 6:4), a pole with a horizontal beam was erected and the dead man’s hands were bound and slung over the beam, leaving the body suspended.   In so doing it served as  a warning to others.  Besides the shame and degradation of this manner of death, the one so executed would be unable to fall to their knees as a final act of repentance before God, thereby implying that they were under the irrevocable curse of God.

Yahweh has two main plans that are work, for people individually and collectively as a nation.  The first is his plan for individuals and requires our participation and of course our cooperation.  How we as individuals as part of the greater community respond to these commands (mitzvot) effects our personal future, our communal future and over the short term, our nations future.  Our responsibility as children of God is to participate in His eternal plan by adhering to His commandments.  In doing so we will bring harmony to our lives and be CO-laborers with Him in accomplishing His will on earth.


'''Construction of Houses'''

When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet (MA’AKEH) for your roof, so you will not place blood (DAMIM) in your house if one falls from it (Deut. 22:8).   Although the word MA’AKEH has no parallel in the Tanach, it is clear from the context that it refers to an enclosure around the roof, a parapet or guardrail.  It is a provision for taking account for not being liable for another’s death.  “You shall not stand by while your fellow’s blood is shed”  Leviticus (Vayikra) 19:16   We are obligated to be concerned, beyond our own health and safety, with the health and safety of our fellow members of society.

In the “Laws of the Murderer and Protecting Life”, chapter 11, the Jewish sage Rambam codifies some of the details of these laws: Any house that is at least four cubits by four cubits, and is used for dwelling, requires the construction of a sturdy ma’akeh of ten handbreadths’ height. By extension, one must erect a sand wall around his well or cistern. One is similarly obligated to remove or repair every hazard: “R. Nathan says: Whence is it derived that nobody should breed a bad dog in his house, or keep a wobbly ladder in his house?  From ‘and you will not place blood (DAMIM) in your house’” (Bava Kamma 15b).


'''Marriage Laws'''

When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her [Stone Edition Tanach: found in her a matter of immorality; found her offensive in some respect] then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.   And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife.   And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth 
it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;  Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before Yahweh: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Yahweh your Elohim giveth thee for an inheritance. (24:1-4)


'''''Divorce laws and a Get.''''' 

This verse forms the basis of the divorce laws of the Torah and the actual get or bill of divorce which was a written document that a husband gave to his wife because of some immoral activity on her part. (ASE Chumash, p. 1058). Yahweh himself divorced Israel and gave her a ‘get’ because of her unfaithfulness to him, though he never remarried. The prophetic implications of this are astounding in light of Yahweh’s divorce of unfaithful Israel and his eventual remarriage to her made possible by Yeshua’s death on the cross.  

The word uncleanness or immorality is the Hebrew word ervah (Strong’s #6172) which according to The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament refers simply to nakedness or the resulting shame therefrom. Strong’s Expanded Concordance adds to this definition: an indecent thing or figuratively the idea of disgrace or blemish. According to Strong’s this word is used in a various ways in the Hebrew Scriptures (OT) with reference to shameful sexual exposure or nudity as in the case of unlawful cohabitation (Lev. 18:6), or the shame resulting from Israel’s spiritual adultery (Lam. 1:8); or any “indecent thing” that represents defilement or uncleanness resulting from the misuse of the physical body (e.g. uncleanness [due to not burying human excrement] in the military camp, or violation of any laws of sexual abstinence, or being in a state of impurity from sexual cohabitation or nocturnal emissions). With regard to Deuteronomy 24:1 Strong’s comments, “ervah appears to bear this emphasis on any violation of the laws of purity if a groom is dissatisfied with his bride ‘because he hath found some uncleanness in her,’ he may divorce her. Obviously this evidence is not of previous cohabitation (adultery), since such a sin merits death (Deut. 22:13ff).&quot;

The verse in 24:1 neither specifically states, nor implies that this is the first marriage for both of them. This is underscored by the Torah’s use of the Hebrew word ishah (wife or woman) in verse one as opposed to either the words bethulah or almah both of which lexically have stronger references to a virgin, youthful bride or young maiden as opposed to the more generic term ishah. Therefore, based on the generic meaning of the word ervah (as discussed above) a broader meaning than actual immorality is implied as to why the husband was compelled to “put his wife away”. 

Laws regarding Sexual Immorality. A man who falsely accuses his bride of being unfaithful to him before their marriage is to receive lashes and a fine. If the charges prove correct, however, the wife is to be stoned. If a woman commits adultery, both she and the man involved are to be killed.  One should not marry his father’s wife, or a member of Ammon or Moab.  Adultery and a lustful heart seriously endanger the soul and can lead one to eternal perdition.


'''The Priesthood of the Firstborn'''

“If a man has two wives, the one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have borne him children, and if the firstborn son belongs to the unloved, then on the day when he assigns his possessions as an inheritance to his sons, he may not treat the son of the loved as the firstborn in preference to the son of the unloved, who is the firstborn,  but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the unloved, by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the firstfruits of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his”.  Deuteronomy 21:15-17

The first born son (haBen habechor) is to inherit a double portion from his father, regardless of the status of the mother. This passage is given in Scripture on how the inheritance of the firstborn is to be passed on.  In several situations man conspired to bypass this and in others God chose who would be the inheritor of the promise. Allowing man his free will Yahweh determines the fulfilment of His purposes, knowing in advance the disposition and the choices each person will make. This was the case with Jacob and Esau, where Esau defaulted in his calling of being the firstborn and Jacob inherited the blessing.  This was established by Yahweh’s foreknowledge before they were born  -  Genesis 25:23 

Esau’s fate was sealed before he was even created because God knew what was in his heart from before his conception. We are told Esau grew up to despise his birthright and the events worked out that Jacob obtained the birthright. Genesis 25:34 
Strongs gives the meaning for ‘despise’ as  - 0959 hz&quot;B’ bazah (102b)  Origin: a prim. root  Usage: careless(1), contempt(1), despicable(1), despise(5), despised(32), despises(2), disdained(1), disdained*(1)

The reality is God knew Esau’s heart as well as Jacobs. Though Jacob used fleshly methods to obtain the inheritance, Yahweh knew Jacob was the one who would seek after the things of the kingdom and therefore was qualified to receive the inheritance.  This also happened in the passing of the blessing of the firstborn from Reuben (firstborn of Jacob), to Ephraim the youngest son of Joseph and it would seem this particular commandment would fit the situation with Reuben and Joseph perfectly for two reasons.  Firstly Reuben defaulted in his sexual sin and thereby defiled his father’s marriage-bed whereas in contrast Joseph was proven under testing in this area and secondly,  Joseph was the firstborn son of Rachel the beloved wife of Jacob.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The SMART-SIGNAL (Systematic Monitoring of Arterial Road Traffic and SIGNAL) system, developed by the University of Minnesota, offers an easily implementable approach to collect and archive continuous and high-resolution traffic data on signalized arterials (Liu et al., 2008). In this system, a complete history of traffic signal control, including all vehicle actuation events and signal phase change events, is archived and stored. Based on the event-based data, arterial performance measures, such as arterial travel time, intersection queue length, and level of service, are produced. The SMART-SIGNAL system has been installed on 11 intersections along France Avenue in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and 6 intersections along Trunk Highway 55, Minnesota, since February 2007. Event-based traffic data are being collected in a 24/7 mode and then archived in a database system, thus yielding a tremendous amount of field data available for research. This chapter will briefly introduce the system architecture, data collection hardware, and data processing procedure of the SMART-SIGNAL. 

== System Architecture ==
As illustrated in the following figure, the SMART-SIGNAL system has three major components, data collection, performance measurements, and performance presentation through user interfaces. The data collection component collects high resolution raw data directly from the field on an event-by-event basis. Signal phase change events and vehicle-detector actuation events are acquired separately from data collection units located in traffic signal cabinets. The data are recorded in daily log files and sent to a data server at the master cabinet by serial port communication. The daily log files are finally transmitted to a database located at the Minnesota Transportation Observatory (MTO) lab at the University of Minnesota through the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or wireless communication. The second component of the SMART-SIGNAL system is performance measure calculation using the field-collected data. Analysis of the stored data log files yields a set of performance measures, one covers intersection level measures (e.g. queue length) and a second related to arterial level measures (e.g. travel time). Once all performance measures have been derived from the raw data, the results are made accessible to a variety of users. 

[[Image: Smart-Signal-Fig1.PNG|SMART-SIGNAL System Architecture]]

== Data Collection Unit ==

The key element of the SMART-SIGNAL is the data collection unit, which consists of an industrial PC and a data acquisition card. At each intersection, an industrial PC with a data acquisition card is installed, and event data collected at each intersection is transmitted to the data server in the master controller cabinet through the existing communication line (in this case, spare twisted pair) between signalized intersections. The data acquisition cards (PCI-6511 from National Instruments (2006)) used in the SMART-SIGNAL system, as shown in Figure 2 2a, have 64 input channels. If the total number of detector inputs and signal phases for one intersection exceed 64, an additional data acquisition card needs to be installed. A terminal box is used in order to limit the input direct current (DC) to a safe range and establish the connection between the data acquisition card and back panel of the traffic cabinet, as shown in Figure 2 2b. The terminal box allows digital voltage changes on the back panel, which indicate different traffic events in the field, to be captured by the data acquisition card installed in the industrial computer. A traffic event recorder software program, developed using the Microsoft Visual C# program, runs on the industrial computer in the field to record the events (for example, a phase 1 green change from “ON” to “OFF”) into a log file. 

[[image: Smart-Signal-Fig2.PNG |Demonstration of the Traffic Data Collection Components ]]

Data communication between two controller cabinets is done using the existing twisted pair communication lines. A protocol of RS-485 is used to transmit data and synchronize time between cabinets (B&amp;B Electronics, 2007). After the data in the local cabinets is transferred to the master cabinet, DSL or a wireless unit installed in the master cabinet is used to send the data back to the database located in the MTO.

A sample of data is shown in the figure. Each logged event starts with a time stamp that includes the date, hour, minute, second and millisecond based on the computer system time, followed by different types of event data including phase changes, detector actuation and pedestrian calls. A complete history of traffic signal events is thus recorded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The SMART-SIGNAL (Systematic Monitoring of Arterial Road Traffic and SIGNAL) system, developed by the University of Minnesota, offers an easily implementable approach to collect and archive continuous and high-resolution traffic data on signalized arterials (Liu et al., 2008). In this system, a complete history of traffic signal control, including all vehicle actuation events and signal phase change events, is archived and stored. Based on the event-based data, arterial performance measures, such as arterial travel time, intersection queue length, and level of service, are produced. The SMART-SIGNAL system has been installed on 11 intersections along France Avenue in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and 6 intersections along Trunk Highway 55, Minnesota, since February 2007. Event-based traffic data are being collected in a 24/7 mode and then archived in a database system, thus yielding a tremendous amount of field data available for research. This chapter will briefly introduce the system architecture, data collection hardware, and data processing procedure of the SMART-SIGNAL. 

== System Architecture ==
As illustrated in the following figure, the SMART-SIGNAL system has three major components, data collection, performance measurements, and performance presentation through user interfaces. The data collection component collects high resolution raw data directly from the field on an event-by-event basis. Signal phase change events and vehicle-detector actuation events are acquired separately from data collection units located in traffic signal cabinets. The data are recorded in daily log files and sent to a data server at the master cabinet by serial port communication. The daily log files are finally transmitted to a database located at the Minnesota Transportation Observatory (MTO) lab at the University of Minnesota through the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or wireless communication. The second component of the SMART-SIGNAL system is performance measure calculation using the field-collected data. Analysis of the stored data log files yields a set of performance measures, one covers intersection level measures (e.g. queue length) and a second related to arterial level measures (e.g. travel time). Once all performance measures have been derived from the raw data, the results are made accessible to a variety of users.

== Data Collection Unit ==

The key element of the SMART-SIGNAL is the data collection unit, which consists of an industrial PC and a data acquisition card. At each intersection, an industrial PC with a data acquisition card is installed, and event data collected at each intersection is transmitted to the data server in the master controller cabinet through the existing communication line (in this case, spare twisted pair) between signalized intersections. The data acquisition cards (PCI-6511 from National Instruments (2006)) used in the SMART-SIGNAL system, as shown in Figure 2 2a, have 64 input channels. If the total number of detector inputs and signal phases for one intersection exceed 64, an additional data acquisition card needs to be installed. A terminal box is used in order to limit the input direct current (DC) to a safe range and establish the connection between the data acquisition card and back panel of the traffic cabinet, as shown in Figure 2 2b. The terminal box allows digital voltage changes on the back panel, which indicate different traffic events in the field, to be captured by the data acquisition card installed in the industrial computer. A traffic event recorder software program, developed using the Microsoft Visual C# program, runs on the industrial computer in the field to record the events (for example, a phase 1 green change from “ON” to “OFF”) into a log file. 

[[File: Smart-Signal-Fig2.PNG |Demonstration of the Traffic Data Collection Components ]]

Data communication between two controller cabinets is done using the existing twisted pair communication lines. A protocol of RS-485 is used to transmit data and synchronize time between cabinets (B&amp;B Electronics, 2007). After the data in the local cabinets is transferred to the master cabinet, DSL or a wireless unit installed in the master cabinet is used to send the data back to the database located in the MTO.

A sample of data is shown in the figure. Each logged event starts with a time stamp that includes the date, hour, minute, second and millisecond based on the computer system time, followed by different types of event data including phase changes, detector actuation and pedestrian calls. A complete history of traffic signal events is thus recorded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What about the alleged &quot;2&quot; in &quot;square&quot;? The problem, as stated, explicitly allows the square operator, and using ^2 or superscript 2 is only one of a number of ways of expressing that operator. The square of X equals X * X. It's really the same with the square root operator: we may represent the root to be found with the normal root symbol, and a number, i.e., 2 for a square root, or 3 for a cube root, etc., but, routinely, the root is taken as the square root if another number is not specified.

If the square or square root is not to be used, the problem should state that. Instead, it states the opposite, so the claims of an IP editor that these are not allowed, because they contain a &quot;two,&quot; are assertions involving a different problem. Many classical solutions found to the four fours problem involve the use of the square root operator, for some of the numbers, so it cannot be claimed that this is some deviation here. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 20:56, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

Doing some more research on this, some sources -- including the Wikipedia article, don't allow the square, and some don't allow the square root on the same argument that would be used for the square. However, if we want to change the answers to not allow squares and/or square roots, the problem should be restated.

[http://wheels.org/math/44s.html] allows square root but not square.

Looking about, I see mostly the exclusion of the square operator, but, oddly enough, in one place, the allowance of the &quot;sqrt&quot; operator, which, of course, implies &quot;2.&quot; I.e., it is equivalent to exponentiation at 1/2.

The problem is arbitrary, actually. The set of allowed operators could be smaller or larger. A smaller set makes the problem harder, perhaps. The source I cite did have solutions for all integers up to 116 without using the square operator, but using the square root.

[http://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/questionCorner/fourfours.html] claims that without using the square root operator, it is impossible to represent 10. However, our page shows an obvious counterexample for ten. It's a good example of how a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and especially when &quot;little&quot; is &quot;more than your average bear.&quot; Even a lot more. Experts make mistakes! --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 21:28, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

[http://www.dwheeler.com/fourfours/] explicitly considers the problem. The author, David Wheeler, establishes a hierarchy of allowed operators. For reasons which escape me, he considers square root part of the basic operators, but lists square -- a very simple operation known to grade schoolers early on -- as number six. He calls this an &quot;impurity factor,&quot; and, with the exception of square root, the operators he lists as basic don't imply some number. Percent, for example, impurity factor number 5, is division by 100. Before using square, he would prefer to use the overline, which, by the way, implies ten as a number base (as do some representations such as 44), an arbitrary root power (i.e., not merely two or four), the gamma function, i.e., (x-1)!, and percent. And he lists two more &quot;impure&quot; operators. Oddly, he seems to have a missing &quot;impurity level,&quot; because the basic levels are called &quot;zeroth,&quot; and he starts his numbering with level 2.

:I did not necessarily agree with the IP editor who stated we can't use squares either.  IMO, if squares are disallowed, sqrt should be too, and for the reasons Abd has stated.  Interestingly, the use of concatentation (i.e., 44) may or may not imply a base.  For example, the solution I added for 10 earlier today (44-4)/4 works for other bases as well, perhaps any base that can represent &quot;4&quot;. (I know it's true for bases 5, 8, and 16, but the answer of &quot;10&quot; is in the selected base.  Maybe that disqualifies it.) This is an unsupported assertion, but it could be correct. It's another example of &quot;little knowledge ;-)   Of course, that doesn't mean that concatenation works in other problems either.  All that being said, I do prefer solutions without sqrt or square, so I tried to find some. It's a fun exercise! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 02:35, 9 September 2010 (UTC)
::Well, no matter what the base, (44-4)/4 is equal to 11-1 or 10, that's true. Obviously this is any base 5 or higher. However, what we are looking for is to calculate an actual integer, the tenth item in the list of integers, with nine items before it! I have ten fingers, &quot;ten&quot; is just name for that integer. If the base is 5, using the digits 0-4, &quot;10&quot; is equal to 5 base ten. It doesn't work, it's the fifth integer, i.e., the one matching the fingers on one hand.... So using positional notation as in 44 does require a &quot;number&quot; -- the base -- to be specified. It's base 10 in all the examples I've seen. If we really wanted to be tricky, we'd require the base to be four! But would this use up one of our 4s? Heh! This gives us another way to use a 4 in the process.... Anyway, I found those IP comments to be a bit rude, so certain of being right, as if there couldn't be variant rules. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 05:05, 9 September 2010 (UTC)
:::But if the base were 4, we couldn't use &quot;4&quot; anywhere else in the numbers, as 4 is not a valid digit in base 4. :-)  I agree that the IPs comments were rude and that it was right to remove them. Thanks for doing so. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 11:13, 9 September 2010 (UTC)

== Square root operator ==

The problem allows the usage of the square operator and not the square root operator. Many revisions, including ones I worked on, overlooked this. Some users also used 44, contrary to another problem condition. (The problem is number base independent, to parse 44 requires assuming a number base, 10 was assumed, i.e., 44 = 4 x 10 + 4.) I have restored the answers given by the original author. I have not checked every one, that should still be done. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abd|contribs]]) 13:18, 5 March 2014 (UTC)

== The use of &quot;44&quot; ==

For one number, 43, I have been unable to find a solution that does not use either the square root function or the base-10 number &quot;44.&quot;

The original statement of the problem did not disallow &quot;44.&quot; This was added by [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Puzzles/Arithmetical_puzzles/Four_4s_Equal...&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=870399 this edit]. All versions here did not allow the square root operator, but most versions of the solution allowed that use.

So we have

43 = 44 - 4/4, very simple, fits the original problem, without the restriction on the use of 44. I have it listed with a note that this is the only answer that requires 44.

There is another answer, 44, which is much simpler that what is given if 44 is allowed: 44 = 44 +4 -4.

Many other versions on the internet of this problem do allow the square root operator.

I was temped to do as had been done for quite a while, list 43 as &quot;missing.&quot; Perhaps someone can think of a way to represent 43 without using 44. Or perhaps someone can prove that 44 is necessary (or the square root operator).

I personally prefer the problem as incompletely solved, it is pedagogically much more interesting that way. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abd|contribs]]) 23:03, 5 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Chapter III: Living Standards====
 
The growth of the British economy kept pace with the population. There was a baby boom in the twenties, which is not surprising. At the other end of the age scale the advances in medicines - sulpha drugs and penicillin, stress prevention, and the treatment of shock, were some of the experiences gained from the battlefield. All these, and other treatments, raised life expectancy levels. This rise in the working population added over three and a quarter million to the workforce. This did not just improve production but also raised demand. This increase in working population now included a much larger share for women. Even though returning men from the war eased women out of jobs more associated with ‘men’s work’ the role of women would never return to those of pre-war. A far greater number of women were independent, earning their own living. Professions and occupations previously closed to women now received a number of applicants granted inclusion.

Reading certain history books - giving a social history of Britain, you might be lead to believe that by 1929 the mass of the population were leading a life different from that lived ten years before. It is not so. Some men had not worked continuously since returning home from the war... others engaged on one job at a time - competing for vacancies every morning. In the early thirties the newspapers were filled with stories of the nation’s economic troubles. There were millions unemployed and stories of unrest among the workers. There was real human suffering and the picture from the north of England was bad. The mills were silent, groups of idle workers on every street corner. Clogs were worn - echoed on the cobbles. Scores of children were undernourished. In many towns factories were being torn down for the bricks to be sold on as seconds. As will be pointed out this was a true picture of the industrial sector - up north.
  
1931 saw the faint glimmer of hope. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, was a skilled financier; he had already made a name for himself for being an excellent administrator when Minister of Health, now he was to show his skill attending to the nation’s money. His plan was to save by introducing cuts in wages and salary of all people, not just the lower paid. In a series of stringent budgets he presided over a policy of protectionism, great saving were made by converting two thousand million pounds of the five per cent War Loan to three and a half. By this time the schemes for house building had begun and more of the money saved went on rearming the nation. In 1937 the fifteen to sixty-four age group represented nearly seventy per cent of the working population. This added three-quarters of a million to the workforce over a period of thirteen years. The increase, in birth rate, life expectancy, and the resultant consumer spending generated by both, increased national output. These five key decisions: protectionism, reduced wages, realigned interest rate, stimulated house building, and rearmament saw the nation slowly begin its recovery - to begin a ten year cycle of improvement. This programme was mainly directed towards the industrial sector of society. Light engineering, the new sources of power, communications, and the service industries, were never as seriously affected by the depression.

During The National Government's years in office there was a steady improvement in the public’s standards of health. As well as a reduction in the death rate there was an improvement in a child’s life expectancy - deaths dropping by ten per cent. The normal teenager’s death rates: from scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, and measles, improved greatly – doubling in twenty years. There was a steady improvement in adult height and weight. The 1937, 'Survey of the Social Structure of England and Wales', considered that it was the improvement in: housing, water provision, sanitation, hygiene, and advances in medical skill which contributed to rise. This improvement was common throughout England. All covered by the 1936 Public Health Act, extended later to include the Food and Drugs Act. 

The new housing estates, the local planning authorities concern for recreational space, the nations completed sewer system, improved, nutritional diets, and greater health provision - through local cottage hospitals, maternity units and nursing and auxiliary services, all contributed to improved standards in public health. In 1934, an act was passed empowering local authorities to make free or subsidized milk available to schoolchildren. This was distributed in third of a pint bottles by classroom monitors providing a straw for each child. Three years later over three million children had the opportunity to drink milk. By 1935, there were two thousand three hundred doctors and five thousand three hundred nurses engaged in servicing the school’s medical services. In 1936, local authorities had to provide trained midwives. Three years later all schools in Harrow and District provided subsidized school meals, plus a percentage free for the needy.

The National Insurance Act 1912, applied to nearly twelve million workers… by 1921, fifteen million, and finally twenty million by 1938. The scheme provided a free doctor service. For families of insured workers – included most of the middle classes, reliance placed on private schemes and sick clubs. Other health services had to be paid for. Payment for a visit to the hospital in 1928 was a two tier arrangement split between local authorities and voluntary hospitals. Only the very poor had free treatment. Harrow was considered to be the best place to receive medical treatment and your chances of survival from treatment far greater. It has always been the case that life expectancy is greater where there is an improvement in living conditions - environment and diet.  In 1930, the BMA suggested a system of health insurance for practically all adults and their dependants. This would include dentists, maternity and ophthalmology. It took over fifteen years for the National Health Service to be fully operational – until after The Second World War.

All towns were provided with public lavatories, some more elaborate than others. North Harrow’s was a brick built and tiled roofed building - in an architectural style in keeping with all the local buildings, sited next to the services road. It boasted a permanent staff of an aged couple who were most particular how their toilets were turned out. The brass work shone and the tiled floor sparkled. The Association for the provision of Drinking Fountains and Horse Troughs had its beginnings in 1847 when the Liverpool local government bought out the private water companies. Their object was to construct public baths and stimulate interested parties to built drinking fountains. Twelve years later Samuel Gurney, a London MP, started an association with the aim of building drinking fountains to provide pure cold water… the first to be built on Holborn Hill on 21st April 1859. With the collaboration of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals drinking fountains for both humans and animals acclaimed as necessary public amenities… linking up with the evangelical movement gave the movement a strong link with the church. It became so popular that thousands of water troughs were installed on city and town streets. Henceforth, it became obligatory for local councils to provided space in all new town development. North Harrow had two, one on Station Road the other on Pinner Road, close to the town’s main cross-roads. By 1936, the association stopped building new troughs, as cars and trucks took over from the horse. However, more fountains were built at schools and parks… the metal cups chained to the bowls gave way to a small jet, for the sake of hygiene. West Harrow Park, Headstone Park and Pinner Park all were provided with a fountain, the most elaborate sited at West Harrow the oldest park of the three. The standard 1929 design can be seen at each in addition to the more elaborate commemorative fountains.

The dust cart came round once a week – on a Wednesday. The lorry was painted green and the collection was tipped into domed compartments covered by bowed sliding doors. Anything which could not be placed in the back of the cart was put on the roof. Every house had its own metal bin. I do not remember any complaint about having too much rubbish or throwing away an awkward shape or extra heavy item. Everything was taken away without question by the dustmen. The Road Sweeper pushed his metal sided cart to his allotted station, there he took from the rack his broad headed broom to sweep the pavements pushing the rubbish into the gutters. When he had finished the pavement he swept the rubbish into neat piles in the gutter to be later shovelled up and placed in his cart. At the end of his day he pushed the cart to a collection place behind the shops where the council dust cart carried the waste to the dump. All the pavements and roads were similarly treated there was never any rubbish left lying about. 

As unemployment rose, after The General Strike, into the thirties, a series of Government Acts were passed to provide extra levels of benefit. It was soon transparent that there were gaps in the payments, benefits and contributions. Many of the poor still had to apply to the Poor Law, and after 1929, to the Public Assistance Committees, of the local authorities. The government soon recognised the gaps - especially the exceptional diversity of employment. The Unemployment Assistance Board Acts of 1934/5 still didn’t seal the gaps and a further series of acts were needed. It took until 1937 for the majority of the unemployed that received assistance under the Public Assistance Committees of the local authority transferred to the Unemployment Assistance Board. By the early 20s the Family Endowment Society was advising a national family allowance system, providing 12s. 6d. per week for mothers, 5s. 0d. for the first child and 3s. 6d. for each subsequent child. This suggestion never got off the ground for it was considered by the government that this would destroy work incentives and reduce the mobility of labour. In 1931/2 Chamberlain took the issue out of the local authority hands and set up the Unemployment Assistance Board in 1934. By 1939/40 the government give way, but not for the original social reasons but to suppress wage claims, labour disputes, and therefore, to control inflation.  But the principle was laid…! The Beveridge Report 1942, made family allowance a cornerstone of social insurance.

It is perfectly understandable to find, in census figures, that congregations shrunk after each war, and did so throughout the passing centuries. The First World War had a profound affect on a society staggering from the unsettling results of a shifting population, buffeted, and confused, by industrialization. These uncertainties took their toll. Increasingly, in the twenties, Nonconformist, made inroads upon the established church. It was not because they required less commitment, but less ridged, and prescribed behaviour. Their services: complimented by, song, colourful-tracts, and religious-leaflets, drew-in their congregations - giving them a sense of belonging. Although the graph for York shows that Anglican attendees continued to dominate until after the Second World War, the Nonconformists were waiting to take up the reins soon after that. The figures for Catholicism, on the other hand, show a steady rise throughout the whole period. This is born out by what was happening in North Harrow. Between the wars the attendance figures for Baptists, Wesleyan, Methodists, United Free Church and Congregationalists showed little change. Their attendance figures, reflected the strength of the connection to the youth association, adopted by the church or chapel; for instance: a strong Boys Brigade Company saw a strong congregation. Similarly, Scout Group, or Church Lads movement. For well established churches, and chapels, that catered for the full range of young people, the attendances were higher still. As with all institutions, if they are run by a team of dedicated officers over a long period, and if the takeover, after they retire, is sound, church attendance figures stayed consistent... Although church attendances steadily declined, from the early, strict Victorian period, throughout all social classes, society continued to adhere to the churches principles and teachings. From the end of the thirties... into the war years... and beyond, those principles and teachings has been undermined, disregarded, and in some cases, abandoned. Nevertheless, the values, influencing the new culture, were Christian.

The vast majority of children attended State Schools working towards an in-school – set, marked, and invigilated, exam. I do not think that those children at the bottom of their year looked up to those above, nor do I believe that those in the highest streams looked down on those below. As far as I can remember it was a structured conveyor belt of things you had to do… you stepped on at twelve and alighted three years later. Not one of us displayed any fear for the future or suffered from sleep disturb nightmares. The future – leaving school for work, was another step on the path to adulthood. There was an abundance of jobs. What one ended up doing was as much to do with 'father’s job', as to the result of year’s report.

A number of boys quickly and quietly went from Secondary School to Polytechnic, Trade School or Technical College. They had worked out what they wanted to do. Others went to a prearranged apprenticeship. It wasn’t a question of this job, or that line, or this was paid better. It was up to fate, and a little luck. The Labour Party adopted the principle of secondary education for all, irrespective of the income, class, or occupation of their parents; that children maybe transferred at the age of eleven plus, from primary to one or other of the secondary schools, and remain there until fifteen. This principle was a cornerstone in the Hadow Report in 1923, and came into being in 1926. The two types of secondary school were, Secondary Modern Schools and Grammar. The children attending secondary modern schools were to leave at the age of fifteen. The Hadow Report was accepted but the implementation delayed by the poor state of the country’s economy. The majority of children by 1938 were operating within the reorganized secondary modern system. Some fee-paying schools, from the private sector, qualified for ‘direct grants’ for taking on a number of scholarship boys.

My primary school was Longfield. The class sizes in 1938/9 were between twenty-five to thirty children. The first class was The Introduction Class, a further three classes held a years difference between each. Similarly upstairs, the Junior School operated the same class structure – years 8/9, 9/10, 10/11. The school had been built at the same time as the rest of the town displaying the then modern style – brick walls, metal framed windows and a flat roof. All the furniture and equipment was new.
The New Secondary Education system followed the pattern voiced in the thirties – that there should be different schools for different abilities, and the children tested to decide which school system, at the age of eleven.It is impossible to write about England’s class structure without some reference to education. It is what is taught, how it is taught and why, that defines for the recipient where they fit in the social structure. Children are carriers of the parents assumed place in society. When educated they carry also the school’s aims and objectives which includes aspired place for their charges. This overlays their parents opinions, lies in sympathy with it, or, gives them their own place. It is highly likely that these opinions, shaped by heredity, environment, and education, are confused... can be easily changed, depending on circumstance. Class is a subject which will always have to be defined, and the answer will always include: the parents education, the home, the environment, the school, place in year, what university, which course, who taught it, and with what result. As today’s thinking suggests education is a continuous event… social class, for the individual, is beyond defining. 
  
In 1929 William Morris of Oxford was dominating the car production industry. He alone, out of fifty-eight companies, was way out in front, producing a series of models to take British car production ahead of France, to become Europe’s largest car producer. In 1937 Britain provided fifteen per cent of the worlds vehicle exports – a record level of production. By 1938 Morris Motors included MG, Wolseley, and Riley In 1939 Morris Motors produced twenty-seven per cent of the car market - the largest share. By 1924 Britain was producing 146,000 units; thirteen years later the figure was over three times that number. The years at Britain’s lowest production level – in the middle of the depression Britain produced more cars than in any previous year. By the end of our period there were nearly 400,000 employed in motor manufacture. In 1935/6 a popular model could be bought for half the cost of one produced ten years before. The motor vehicle industry was closely linked to aircraft production, motor cycling, push bikes, electrical engineering and kitchen equipment. The whole industry was sixty per cent higher in 1937, than the figures for 1924. From the early thirties rearmament boosted up production in electrical and mechanical engineering – particularly those industries closely linked to military vehicles and aircraft. The chemical industry developed many new materials from oil: Plastic, rayon, synthetic dyes, fertilizers, animal food and gas. The industry employed 100,000 by 1939, catching up fast on engineering. Once again, rearmament served the chemical industry well creating many new materials and uses.

The largest influence to change society forever was the cinema. The life-styles, values, language and music of American film producers exerted pressure, which, through a weekly injection, altered mainly working class morals, behaviour, speech and expectations. Many of Britain’s best actors and comedians followed the trail to America when jobs were hard to find here. To stimulate British films production the Cinematograph Films Act of 1927 was introduced. A wave of lavish productions by Alexander Korda, through London Films, tried to wrestle work away from America. It failed, not having the production cost effective. A spate of cheap ‘quickies’ also failed to satisfy quota requirements. Eventually the Act was modified in 1938, and again later, evened out production schedules and quotas. Another film company in 1928, built upon the Neptune Film Company, became established as the Ideal Film Company, owned by Ludwig Blattner. The Blattner Studio was leased to Joe Rock Productions who bought the company, the whole eventually becoming British National Films Limited. Gainsborough Film Company was also operating at the same time producing comedy films with Will Hay.

Associated British Cinemas, established in 1927, merged a number of Scottish cinema circuits… becoming British International Pictures, later absorbed into Elstree Studio complex – Graham/Wilcox company. This merged with British National Studios. During the 1930s grew to become ABPC. The owner John Maxwell died in 1940 his widow sold out to Warner Brothers. In America Warner Brothers developed the Vitaphone, sound on disc system, producing The Jazz Singer. This was the start to Hollywood musicals. MGM won the first Oscar for the musical Broadway Melody in 1929, following the Wall Street crash. Busby Berkeley reshaped the musical stage with his cleaver editing and unusual camera angles. The first animated musical was Walt Disney’s Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs. Quickly followed by MGMs 'The Wizard of Oz' in 1939. The thirties was a period stage stars turned to the film studio for work including Fred and Adele Astaire, Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. It was in the 1930s that a series of British film comedies lifted the British cinemas audiences. The works of Will Hay, Old Mother Riley, George Formby and Max Miller drew in the crowds.

Rank’s venture into film making began when he was a Sunday school teacher. He punctuated his teaching with showing religious films to his own class and to other schools. Eventually he made his own and the distributed them. The Methodist Society complained that about the negative influence American films were having on young people. Rank took up the challenge to make his own ‘family friendly’ films. Within British National Films Company J Arthur Rank created Pinewood Film Studios. He found that after making Turn of the Tide he could not get it screened – the American movie industry denied access. Rank solved the problem by buying a large part of both the distribution and exhibition systems – formed a partnership with C M Woolf to create General Cinema Finance Corporation. He then used that company to buy out General Film Distributors, the UK arm of Universal Pictures. By 1937 Rank consolidated his film making business in both Pinewood and Denham Film Studios, within a new company called the Rank Organisation.By 1939 four million cinema seats gave daily access to the false, romantic, sham and colourful escapism of Hollywood… The first Technicolor film musical was The Wizard of Oz and from 1939 there was a string of fantastic musicals still produced on the stage today. The following year Rank bought the Odeon cinema chain, and Amalgamated Studios in Elstree. The Rank Organisation then bought Gaumont–British Picture Corporation and Lime Grove Studios. The following year negotiated to buy Paramount cinema chain, in 1942.

The country’s citizens were entertained by other popular mediums: the radio, football and boxing. These sops to the daily grind of life, supplied relief replacing religion which never recovered from the tragedy and farce of The First World War. Churchgoers fell from twenty per cent to twelve, between 1910 and 1960 From the start of the thirties consumerism manifested considerable influence: there was more to buy, a more colourful society to copy, more money in the housewife’s pockets and jobs were becoming available. Things were looking up…!

Harrow, as we know it today, was a merger of Harrow-on-the-Hill Urban District, and Wealdstone and Hendon Rural Districts in 1934. The town’s chief claims to fame are its public school, church and hill, upon which both sit. Prior to the 1920s its population gathered around the hill unevenly spreading further out towards London. Every town in the vicinity had its own cinema. Naturally the largest town required the largest cinema which more often than not the smartest. Harrow had its Granada cinema which boasted an organ – the only cinema that had one close at hand. In 1929 there were about four thousand cinemas in Britain. The Granada was, when built, considered to be one of the new super cinemas that could seat upto four thousand patrons.

The Harrow Coliseum, as with all large theatres of the day, was resplendent in gold paint and red velvet cloth. The carpets, thick and lush, and the seats, soft and springy. All covered in red velvet with gold headed nails. It represented ‘High Victorian’ design - mouldings and motifs, statues, niches and plaster cornicing. The Coliseum was opened in 1940 in Station Road, Harrow, by Queen Mary. The auditorium, circle and boxes designed to seat two-thousand patrons in luxury. The theatre was closed fifteen years later, in 1955. The original site was a 1922 cinema, foundered by the owners of Hammer Films – whose doors opened to the public in 1923 to great acclaim.

The Local Authority Greenhouses and Nurseries were situated at West Harrow Park. It is important to explain that Parks, Gardens and Walks were under the authority that maintained and stocked their gardens, verges and beds. To be able to do this there was an organized nursery system large enough to cope with all their needs. It was on a grand scale overseen by the Head Gardener. His position was guaranteed by his previous experience… upheld by the gardeners below him - maintaining a high standard. All the Borough’s flower beds were immaculate, every bit as good as those seen at large holiday resorts on the coast. A competition was held by all the parks as to who’s the best each year. This prize was eagerly sought after and suitable notices and reports made in the local newspapers. The only way a gardener could apply for an advanced position, if he could show how well his gardens performed in competition. West Harrow Park had a paddling pond that provided space for those keen enough to sail their model boats. The park held the local tennis courts and Bowling Green as well as providing a bandstand. The park was for perambulating not for children’s games, running about or cycling. The grass was perfect and the flower beds a riot of perfectly formed colour and floral design. Headstone Manor Park was home to Bessborough Cricket Ground, circled by stately elms. Pinner Park had a fountain, and Streamside Walk meandered beside the River Pinn, bridged over to allow movement along the further bank. All these local parks were perfections of horticultural splendour policed by park keepers who stopped children running, cycling or walking on the grass. They were places for peace and quiet providing seating for contemplation and rejuvenation.

===C initialisation of SDL===


&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;


&lt;/source&gt;




===C++ initialisation of SDL===

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;

#include &quot;Application.h&quot;

//Extern'd in Application.h; Used as forefront to access everything we create =D
Application* pApp;

int main(int args, char* argv[])
{
    //Create the application on the heap for actual use
    pApp = new Application();

    //Initialize the application. If something fails, return -1 (I like -1 for errors)
    if(pApp-&gt;Init() != true)
    {
        return -1;
    }

    //This should successfully run our application
    //Should go through Input, Logic, and Rendering
    pApp-&gt;Run();

    //This will clean up everything, deallocating dynamically allocated memory
    //Uninitializing SDL, etc.
    pApp-&gt;Quit();

    //Out of habit, I always check to make sure a pointer has a value (other than NULL)
    //Before I deallocate it. I also ALWAYS set it to NULL immediately after.
    //Good habit to get into because it is preventative for memory leaks
    if(pApp)
    {
        delete pApp;
        pApp = NULL;
    }

    //Lastly, end the application, returning 0 to indicate that nothing went wrong
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#ifndef APPLICATION_H_INCLUDED
#define APPLICATION_H_INCLUDED

#include &lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;

class Application
{
private:
    //We'll keep adding here as we go along

    bool m_bDone;
public:
    Application();
    ~Application();

    bool Init();
    void Run();
    void TakeInput(SDL_Event* pEvent);
    void Update();
    void Render();
    void Quit();
};

//We'll use this global pointer to access things like the window later on
extern Application* pApp;

#endif // APPLICATION_H_INCLUDED

&lt;/source&gt;



&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;Application.h&quot;

Application::Application()
{
    //Standard constructor we'll use to initialize variables with default values

    //The program just started, we certainly are not done yet!
    m_bDone = false;
}

Application::~Application()
{
    //Here, we'll deallocate any dynamically allocated memory we may have missed
}

bool Application::Init()
{
    //Initialize SDL and return false if anything goes wrong
    //We'll add more initializations here for anything else we use
    if(SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) != 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    //Lastly return true to indicate that the initialization was successful
    return true;
}

void Application::Run()
{
    //This function implements our loop
    //Any calls that should be made each frame should be put in this loop

    //the m_bDone variable will track whether the program is ready to exit
    while(!m_bDone)
    {
        m_bDone = true;
    }
}

void Application::TakeInput(SDL_Event* pEvent)
{
    //We'll use this function to take input from the user and act upon it
}

void Application::Update()
{
    //This is where all the magic happens!
    //After receiving input, this is where we act on that input
    //and actually make things happen =D
}

void Application::Render()
{
    //Here, we will draw our images to the screen
}

void Application::Quit()
{
    //Uninitialize SDL, we'll also deallocate any memory we dynamically allocate
    SDL_Quit();
}

&lt;/source&gt;




===2D platformer pseudo code===

&lt;pre&gt;
game loop 

while( SDL_PollEvent( &amp;event ) )
      {
        myHero.handle_input();
            //If the user has Xed out the window
            if( event.type == SDL_QUIT )
            {
                //Quit the program
                quit = true;
            }
        }

    
    myHero.move( blahbox );
    
    //Set the camera
    myHero.set_camera();


handle_input()

    if( event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN )
    {
        
            if( SDLK_LEFT ) { xForce -= HERO_WIDTH / 2; }
        
            if( SDLK_RIGHT ){ xForce += HERO_WIDTH / 2; }
        

    }
    else if( event.type == SDL_KEYUP )
    {

            if( SDLK_LEFT ) { xForce = 0; }
            if( SDLK_RIGHT ) { xForce = 0; }
        

    }

move()

void Hero::move(SDL_Rect blahbox)
{
    //Move the dot left or right
    if( xForce != 0 ) { xAcc = xForce / HERO_MASS; }
    if( xForce == 0 ) { xVel = xAcc = 0; }
    xVel = xVel + xAcc;
    box.x = box.x + xVel;


    //If the dot went too far to the left or right or touched a wall
    if( ( box.x &lt; 0 ) || ( box.x + HERO_WIDTH &gt; LEVEL_WIDTH ) || check_collision( box, blahbox) )
    {
        //move back
        box.x = box.x - xVel;
    }

}

what i was going for is force is applied when a key is pressed,  

acceleration = Force / Mass
Velocity = Velocity + Acceleration
etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

SDL uses event-based input. All SDL apps are handling events by themselves. Therefore, every SDL app starts a busy loop on AROS, using as much of CPU time as possible. It seems also that the SDL software is badly written and most of the code uses event pooling (instead of waiting for events) and small delays, like [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=360184 here]. It also seems, many programmers do not care at all if a SDL game consumes 100% of cpu time even in idle state. 

&lt;pre&gt;
st=SDL_GetAppState();
if ((st==SDL_APPACTIVE) || (! st) ) SDL_Delay(1000)
else SDL_Delay(0)
PollEvents...
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Colors in SDL are usually stored in Uint32 variables.  This type (and others) is defined by SDL so that you can be sure that you get exactly 32 bits on every different platform/OS, rather than the ambiguous 'unsigned int'.  On a 32-bit surface, each color component gets 8 bits.  If I write a hexidecimal constant like so: 0x50a600ff, and the pixel format is ARGB, then my components would be alpha = 0x50 (80), red = 0xa6 (166), green = 0x00 (0), and blue = 0xff (255).  There you can see that color components range from 0 to 255 (256 values).  These components can each be stored in Uint8 variables.

SDL uses the standard coordinate axes for computer graphics.  The point (0, 0) is in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.  The x coordinate increases to the right, and the y coordinate increases downward.  This does have a small side-effect that the coordinate system is left-handed (angles are measured clockwise).

It pays to wrap certain things in your own functions.  For example, you can write a function that draws an image to the screen, taking just the surface pointer and coordinates.  Found it very easy to wrap both keyboard and joystick handling into one function, so my game accepts either input method for a particular player and the code to use it is nice and clean.








==openGL==


OLD STYLE OpenGL 1.1    - Immediate mode: glBegin(), glEnd(), glVertex() etc 

NEW STYLE OpenGL2 3 4 - [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Aros/Developer/SDL&amp;action=edit Vertex Arrays ] 




=== OpenGL 2, 3 and 4 - Shaders and co ===


glColor() - Even if often used with immediate mode, this is ok for setting a constant color for further vertices to draw.

glNormal(), glTexCoord() - As with glColor(), although it's quite rare to set these to a constant value.

glTranslate(), glLoadMatrix(), glMultMatrix() etc. - These are the way to do transformations.

glMatrixMode() - Used to change which matrix to apply changes to. Don't do glFrustum(), glOrtho(), gluPerspective() or similar each frame (unless its arguments change). In most cases,this belongs to your reshape function.

 NOTE: all of the previous functionality is deprecated, and done quite differently in &quot;modern&quot; OpenGL



glEnableClientState(), glVertexPointer() (and equivalent for normals, texcoords, color), glDrawArrays(), glDrawElements() - While deprecated, the &quot;idea&quot; is generally the same (but used functions different) with modern OpenGL. Give OpenGL a pointer to elements, which it will draw. Of course you want to use VBO (upload the data to graphics ram) when possible. You can do this with few #ifdef's if you want to compile your code also for platforms that already support it.

GL_POINTS, GL_LINES, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN - These are still around in every OpenGL (or OpenGL ES) implementation. Use freely. 

NOTE: all previous functionality (except immediate mode) works with OpenGL ES1. OpenGL ES2 uses shaders extensively, and it's not possible to write code that works both on TinyGL or OpenGL1 and OpenGL ES2 without using lots of #ifdefs or similar, assuming you do something more complex than clear the screen with the specified color.

GL_QUADS, GL_QUAD_STRIP, GL_POLYGON - AVOID. Deprecated, and missing from both OpenGL ES1 and ES2. Use indexed GL_TRIANGLES or GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP instead.

VBOs (Vertx Buffer Objects) with texture atlases (create one big texture with all your textures in it uing [http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Array_Texture Texture Arrays]) - use multiple VBOs, one for each texture atlas - 

shaders 

use the OpenGL state machine more optimally. Switching between shaders and textures are often more expensive than actual draw calls, so one has to design the code in such a way that this switching is minimised, e.g. perform all the draw calls that need a specific shader and texture before switching to another shader and/or texture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Russia=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the constituent countries, including Russia, returned to their former separate and independent status. Soviet inscribed stamps (“CCCP”) continued to be used without alteration for many years. (See [[International Postage Meter Stamp Catalog/Union Of Soviet Socialist Republics|UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS]] for these issues.) Catalogued in this section are stamps inscribed “RUSSIA”, “РОССИИ”, “РОССИЯ”, “ROSSIJA”, “РФ” (''RF = Russian Federation'') or are without country inscription but have a Russian town mark.

* The stamps are grouped according to appearance:
:: A - Provisional issues without country inscription
:: B - Frank is upright octagon
:: C - Frank is horizontal octagon
:: D - Frank is rectangular
:: E - Frank is irregular shape&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==&lt;font color=blue&gt;GROUP A: Provisional issues without country inscription==
* &lt;font size=3&gt;All have octagonal franks with inner rectangular box around the value figures.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TopNav|cat|next=Relational Databases}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The main drive behind a relational database is to increase accuracy by increasing the efficiency with which data is stored.  For example, the names of each of the millions of people who immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island at the turn of the 20th century were recorded by hand on large sheets of paper; people from the city of London had their country of origin entered as England, or Great Britain, or United Kingdom, or U.K., or UK, or Engl., etc.  Multiple ways of recording the same information leads to future confusion when there is a need to simply know how many people came from the country now known as the United Kingdom.

The modern solution to this problem is the database.  A single entry is made for each country, for example, in a reference list that might be called the Country table.  When someone needs to indicate the United Kingdom, he only has one choice available to him from the list: a single entry called &quot;United Kingdom&quot;.  In this example, &quot;United Kingdom&quot; is the unique representation of a country, and any further information about this country can use the same term from the same list to refer to the same country.  For example, a list of telephone country codes and a list of European castles both need to refer to countries; by using the same Country table to provide this identical information to both of the new lists, we've established new relationships among different lists that only have one item in common: country.  A relational database, therefore, is simply a collection of lists that share some common pieces of information.

== Structured Query Language (SQL) ==

'''[[wikipedia:SQL|SQL]]''', which is an abbreviation for '''Structured Query Language''', is a language to request data from a database, to add, update, or remove data within a database, or to manipulate the metadata of the database.

SQL is a declarative language in which the expected result or operation is given without the specific details about how to accomplish the task.  The steps required to execute SQL statements are handled transparently by the SQL database.  Sometimes SQL is characterized as ''non-procedural'' because procedural languages generally require the details of the operations to be specified, such as opening and closing tables, loading and searching indexes, or flushing buffers and writing data to filesystems.  Therefore, SQL is considered to be designed at a higher conceptual level of operation than procedural languages because the lower level logical and physical operations aren't specified and are determined by the SQL engine or server process that executes it.

Instructions are given in the form of statements, consisting of a specific SQL statement and additional parameters and operands that apply to that statement.  SQL statements and their modifiers are based upon official SQL standards and certain extensions to that each database provider implements.  Commonly used statements are grouped into the following categories:

; Data Query Language ([[wikipedia:Data Query Language|DQL]])

* SELECT - Used to retrieve certain records from one or more tables.

; Data Manipulation Language ([[wikipedia:Data Manipulation Language|DML]])

* INSERT - Used to create a record.
* UPDATE - Used to change certain records.
* DELETE - Used to delete certain records.

; Data Definition Language ([[wikipedia:Data Definition Language|DDL]])

* CREATE - Used to create a new table, a view of a table, or other object in database.
* ALTER - Used to modify an existing database object, such as a table.
* DROP - Used to delete an entire table, a view of a table or other object in the database.

; Data Control Language ([[wikipedia:Data Control Language|DCL]])

* GRANT - Used to give a privilege to someone.
* REVOKE - Used to take back privileges granted to someone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TopNav|cat|prev=Data Query Language|next=Data Definition Language}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Data Manipulation Language is used to modify the records in the database.  It never modifies the schema of the database (table features, relationships, ...).  It describes three statements: INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.

== INSERT statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the INSERT statement is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
INSERT INTO &lt;table name&gt;[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]
{
 VALUES (&lt;value&gt;[, &lt;value&gt;]*)
|
 SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] &lt;column name&gt; [, [ALL | DISTINCT] &lt;column name&gt;]*
 FROM &lt;table&gt; [[AS | =] &lt;alias&gt; | [[FULL | LEFT | RIGHT] OUTER | INNER] JOIN &lt;table&gt; ON &lt;expression&gt;]
  [, &lt;table&gt; [[AS | =] &lt;alias&gt; | [[FULL | LEFT | RIGHT] OUTER | INNER] JOIN &lt;table&gt; ON &lt;expression&gt;]]*

 [WHERE &lt;predicate&gt; [{AND | OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*]
 [GROUP BY &lt;column name&gt; [, &lt;column name&gt;]*
  [HAVING &lt;predicate&gt; [{AND | OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]]*]
 ]
 [ORDER BY &lt;column name&gt; [ASC | DESC] [, &lt;column name&gt; [ASC | DESC]]*]
 [LIMIT &lt;count&gt;]
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The INSERT statement is used to add new records (rows) in a table.  For instance, we want to add a new reunion:
* Its primary key is 7,
* Its name is &quot;Job interview&quot;,
* Its description is &quot;Meeting with Mr. SPENCER&quot;,
* Its priority is B,
* Its planned,
* Its date is on October 28, 2009,
* Its hour is 18:30:00,
* Its duration is 30,
* Its office technical id is 23,
* There is no pdf report.

The INTO clause contains the name of the table where the record needs to be inserted.  It can be followed by a list of columns in brackets.  The VALUES clause contains the values to insert in brackets.  If the column names are omitted, the VALUES clause must contains as many values as the number of columns of the table.  The values are inserted in the table columns in the same order that the order in which the columns have been declared in the table.  If the column names are mentioned, there must be as many column names as values.  The values are respectively inserted into the named columns.  If a column in the table is omitted, a NULL value is inserted instead.

The VALUES clause can be replaced by an inner SELECT statement.  In this case, the INSERT statement can insert several rows in the table.  For example, we want to plan twice all the reunion with a B priority level, one year later:

&lt;/center&gt;

== UPDATE statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the UPDATE statement is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
UPDATE &lt;table name&gt;
SET &lt;column name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;]*
WHERE &lt;predicate&gt; [{AND | OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The UPDATE statement is used to modify already existent records in a table.  The UPDATE clause is followed by the table name in which the rows need to be changed.  The SET clause is followed by couples of column name and value.  The values will be inserted in the given columns.  The WHERE clause contains predicates.  If the predicates are true for an existent row, this row will be modified.

For instance, we want to change the date, the hour and the description of the reunion with id 14:


* '''The table before the statement''':
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;10&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''reunion'''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

== DELETE statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the DELETE statement is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
DELETE FROM &lt;table name&gt;
[WHERE &lt;predicate&gt; [{AND | OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*];
&lt;/pre&gt;

The DELETE statement is used to remove specific rows in a table with conditions.  The FROM clause is followed by the table name in which the rows need to be removed.  The WHERE clause contains predicates.  If the predicates are true for an row, this row will be removed.  If the predicates are false for all the rows, the statement do nothing.  A DELETE statement without WHERE clause empties the table.

For example, we want to remove all the reunions that last two hours:


* '''The table before the statement''':
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;10&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''reunion'''&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TopNav|cat|prev=Data Manipulation Language|next=Data Control Language}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Data Definition Language is used to modify the schema of the database.  It will never impact the user rights for the database.  Otherwise, it can erase records in some tables.  It describes three statements: CREATE, ALTER and DROP.

== CREATE statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the CREATE statement for the tables is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
CREATE TABLE &lt;table name&gt;
(&lt;column name&gt; &lt;column type&gt;[ NOT NULL][ PRIMARY KEY| DEFAULT &lt;value&gt;][, &lt;column name&gt; &lt;column type&gt;[ NOT NULL][ PRIMARY KEY| DEFAULT &lt;value&gt;]]*
 [,[ CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint name&gt;]
  {
   PRIMARY KEY (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)
  |
   UNIQUE ([VALUE|&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*])
  |
   FOREIGN KEY (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*) REFERENCES &lt;table name&gt; (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)[ ON DELETE CASCADE][ ON UPDATE CASCADE]
  |
   CHECK (&lt;predicate&gt;[{ AND| OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*)
  }
 ]*
);
&lt;/source&gt;

The CREATE statement is used to create a new table with no record.  Let's create the table &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt;.  The records in the &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt; table will contain a technical id, the name of the office, a description, the number of available places, the availability and the date for the next office security control:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE office
(
   id_office INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
   description VARCHAR(255),
   place_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
   available SMALLINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
   next_inspection DATE NOT NULL
);
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''The table after the statement''':
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
||&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| INTEGER
|----
||name|| VARCHAR(20)
|----
||description|| VARCHAR(255)
|----
||place_number|| INTEGER
|----
||available|| SMALLINT
|----
||next_inspection|| DATE
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Now the table &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt; can be used and filled as the tables &lt;code&gt;reunion&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;project&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;members&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;6&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || place_number || available || next_inspection
|----
||1|| Show room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 100 || 1 || 2011-03-24
|----
||2|| Big room || The biggest room. || 200 || 1 || 2010-06-03
|----
||3|| Open space || The developer open space. || 50 || 1 || 2011-03-15
|----
||4|| Hall || The entrance. || 20 || 1 || 2010-10-28
|----
||5|| Reunion room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 20 || 1 || 2010-05-12
|----
||6|| Actual office || This office is under construction. || 5 || 0 || 2010-06-03
|----
||7|| Temporary office || The office used while the actual is under construction. || 5 || 1 || 2011-03-15
|----
||8|| Coffee machine || The room where you can pause. || 5 || 1 || 2011-02-11
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The statement starts with CREATE TABLE, to indicate that what we want to create is a table.  It's followed by the name of the table (i.e. &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt;).  The name of the table is followed by parentheses which describe all the columns of the table.  The descriptions of the columns are separated by a comma.  Each description contains the column name (for instance, id_office), the column type (INTEGER, VARCHAR, CHAR, DATE, etc...), an optional nullability information (nothing to indicate that the column can be null or NOT NULL to indicate that the column can't be null) and the optional keyword DEFAULT followed by a default value or the optional keyword PRIMARY KEY to indicate that the column is a primary key.  If no default value is defined, NULL is the default value.  If NOT NULL is defined, the column can't have NULL as default value.

You can see that the column &lt;code&gt;id_office&lt;/code&gt; has been defined as a primary key, the column &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; can be null and the column &lt;code&gt;available&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; as default value.

== ALTER statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the ALTER statement for the tables is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
ALTER TABLE &lt;table name&gt;
{
 ADD[ COLUMN] &lt;column name&gt; &lt;column type&gt;[ NOT NULL][ PRIMARY KEY| DEFAULT &lt;value&gt;]
|
 ALTER[ COLUMN] &lt;column name&gt;[ SET DEFAULT &lt;default option&gt;| DROP DEFAULT]
|
 DROP[ COLUMN] &lt;column name&gt;
|
 ADD[ CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint name&gt;]
 {
  PRIMARY KEY (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)
 |
  UNIQUE ([VALUE|&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*])
 |
  FOREIGN KEY (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*) REFERENCES &lt;table name&gt; (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)[ ON DELETE CASCADE][ ON UPDATE CASCADE]
 |
  CHECK (&lt;predicate&gt;[{ AND| OR} &lt;predicate&gt;]*)
 }
|
 DROP CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint name&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The ALTER statement is used to modify a table.  It can be used on a table with records in it.

=== ADD CONSTRAINT clause ===
This clause allows to add a constraint on the table as it could be done at the table creation time.  Let's add a unicity constraint on both the name and the description of the office:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE office ADD CONSTRAINT unique_name_and_description UNIQUE (name, description);
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can not insert a row with the same name and description of an already existing row and we can not update a row with the same name and description of another row.  However, we can insert a row with only the same name or only the same description.

=== DROP CONSTRAINT clause ===
This clause allows to remove an existing constraint on the table by its name.  Let's remove the preceding unicity constraint on both the name and the description of the office:
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE office DROP CONSTRAINT unique_name_and_description;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can insert a row with the same name and description of an already existing row and we can update a row with the same name and description of another row once again.

=== ADD COLUMN clause ===
Let's add a new column &lt;code&gt;has_video_projector&lt;/code&gt; to indicate if we can project a slideshow:

* '''The table before the statement''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;6&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || place_number || available || next_inspection

||6|| Actual office || This office is under construction. || 5 || 0 || 2010-06-03
|----
||7|| Temporary office || The office used while the actual is under construction. || 5 || 1 || 2011-03-15
|----
||8|| Coffee machine || The room where you can pause. || 5 || 1 || 2011-02-11
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
* '''Query''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;

ALTER TABLE office ADD has_video_projector SMALLINT DEFAULT 0;
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''The table after the statement''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|----
|colspan=&quot;7&quot;|&lt;center&gt;'''office'''&lt;/center&gt;
|----
!|&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || place_number || available || next_inspection || has_video_projector
|----
||1|| Show room || style=&quot;background-color:#ccc;&quot; | || 100 || 1 || 2011-03-24 || 0
|----
||2|| Big room || The biggest room. || 200 || 1 || 2010-06-03 || 0
|----
||3|| Open space || The developer open space. || 50 || 1 || 2011-03-15 || 0
|----
||4|| Hall || The entrance. || 20 || 1 || 2010-10-28 || 0
|----

||6|| Actual office || This office is under construction. || 5 || 0 || 2010-06-03 || 0
|----
||7|| Temporary office || The office used while the actual is under construction. || 5 || 1 || 2011-03-15 || 0
|----
||8|| Coffee machine || The room where you can pause. || 5 || 1 || 2011-02-11 || 0
|----
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The column &lt;code&gt;has_video_projector&lt;/code&gt; has been added at the end.  The column has been filled with the default value.

=== DROP COLUMN clause ===
Now let's remove the column &lt;code&gt;next_inspection&lt;/code&gt;:

* '''The table before the statement''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

!|&lt;u&gt;id_office&lt;/u&gt;|| name || description || place_number || available || has_video_projector

&lt;/center&gt;

The column &lt;code&gt;next_inspection&lt;/code&gt; has been removed.  If you want to remove a column, you need to remove any constraint applied on it (for instance, you could not remove the name or the description column if there is still the unique_name_and_description unicity constraint).

== DROP statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the DROP statement for the tables is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
DROP TABLE &lt;table name&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;

The DROP statement is used to remove table.

Now you can use a database for any type of data.

Data Control Language is used to modify the user rights for the database.  It describes two statements: GRANT and REVOKE.

== GRANT statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the GRANT statement is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
GRANT
{
 ALL PRIVILEGES ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
|
 {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}
 [, {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}]* ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
|
 USAGE ON 
 {DOMAIN &lt;domain name&gt;|COLLATION &lt;collation name&gt;|CHARACTER SET &lt;charset name&gt;|TRANSLATION &lt;translation name&gt;}
|
 REFERENCES &lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]* ON &lt;table name&gt;
}
[,
 {
  ALL PRIVILEGES ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
 |
  {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}
  [ ,{SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}]* ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
 |
  USAGE ON 
  {DOMAIN &lt;domain name&gt;|COLLATION &lt;collation name&gt;|CHARACTER SET &lt;charset name&gt;|TRANSLATION &lt;translation name&gt;}
 |
  REFERENCES &lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]* ON &lt;table name&gt;
 }
]* TO {PUBLIC|&lt;user name&gt;}[, {PUBLIC|&lt;user name&gt;}]*[ WITH GRANT OPTION];
&lt;/source&gt;

The GRANT statement is used to give a privilege to someone.  Any SQL operations are done using a user name.  The user name are created by the ''database management system''.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; width: 100%;&quot;

&lt;/center&gt;

The privileges apply on the tables (i.e. &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt;, etc...), the views, their columns, the domain, the collation, the charset and the translation.

The privileges can allow to process SELECT (&quot;s&quot;), INSERT (&quot;i&quot;), UPDATE (&quot;u&quot;) and DELETE (&quot;d&quot;) statements (not CREATE, ALTER or DROP statements).  Let's say that only the DataBase Administrator has the privileges.

For each privilege (&quot;s&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot; and &quot;d&quot;), there is also a meta-privilege (&quot;S&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;U&quot; and &quot;D&quot;) : a user can send a privilege to another user.  Let's say that only the DataBase Administrator has the meta-privileges.

Whereas you can send several privileges on a table to several users at once, you can't send privileges on several tables at once.  If you want to send all the privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE), you can replace the list of privileges by the keywords ALL PRIVILEGES.

Now, the DBA wants to allow USER_1 to insert on the table &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; and allow him to send this privilege to other users:

The keyword WITH GRANT OPTION indicates that we want to send privileges with the meta-privileges to the user.  Now, USER_1 can send the SELECT privilege on the table &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; to the other users.  Let's say that USER_1 wants to allow anyone to process SELECT on the table &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt;:
{| style=&quot;border: solid 1px;&quot;

The operation has been refused because DEVELOPER_3 hasn't enough privileges.

=== Sending privileges on columns ===
You can send privileges on columns only (only for INSERT and UPDATE):
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
GRANT INSERT (name, description) ON TABLE office TO USER_2;
GRANT UPDATE (id_office, name) ON TABLE office TO USER_2;
&lt;/source&gt;

For INSERT, make all the columns that the user can't fill have default values, are automatically generated or are filled by a trigger before the insertion.  Otherwise, the privilege is just useless.

== REVOKE statement ==
The exhaustive syntax of the REVOKE statement is as follows:

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
REVOKE[ GRANT OPTION FOR] 
{
 ALL PRIVILEGES ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
|
 {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}
 [, {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}]* ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
|
 USAGE ON 
 {DOMAIN &lt;domain name&gt;|COLLATION &lt;collation name&gt;|CHARACTER SET &lt;charset name&gt;|TRANSLATION &lt;translation name&gt;}
|
 REFERENCES &lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]* ON &lt;table name&gt;
}
[,
 {
  {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}
  [, {SELECT|DELETE|{INSERT|UPDATE}[ (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*)]}]* ON[ TABLE] &lt;table or view name&gt;
 |
  USAGE ON 
  {DOMAIN &lt;domain name&gt;|COLLATION &lt;collation name&gt;|CHARACTER SET &lt;charset name&gt;|TRANSLATION &lt;translation name&gt;}
 |
  REFERENCES &lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]* ON &lt;table name&gt;
 }
]* FROM {PUBLIC|&lt;user name&gt;}[, {PUBLIC|&lt;user name&gt;}]*[ RESTRICT| CASCADE]
&lt;/source&gt;

The REVOKE statement is used to take back privileges granted to someone.  This revocation may be more complicated than you expect.  To completely remove a privilege to a user, this privilege must be taken back by &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; the users that have sent the privilege.

For instance, the DBA wants to remove the INSERT and DELETE privileges on the table &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; to DEVELOPER_2 and DEVELOPER_3:
{| style=&quot;border: solid 1px;&quot;
|-
|[[File:Nuvola apps personal.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;DBA&lt;/center&gt;||&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
REVOKE INSERT, DELETE ON TABLE office FROM DEVELOPER_2, DEVELOPER_3;

If you remove a privilege to a user who was also sent the related meta-privilege (for example, SELECT privilege to USER_1), the operation also removes the meta-privilege.  To remove only meta-privileges, add the keywords GRANT OPTION FOR:

|-
|[[File:Nuvola apps personal.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;DBA&lt;/center&gt;||&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TopNav|cat|prev=Data Control Language|next=Glossary}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
== Result set column ==
It is not recommended to use &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; in a SELECT clause, due to performance issues.  You should only return columns you want to use.  As a consequence, you should replace any &lt;code&gt;count(*)&lt;/code&gt; by a count on one column only.

== Avoid the value expressions ==
Whenever it is possible, avoid the use of value expressions in the WHERE clause like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sql&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
SELECT id_reunion
FROM reunion
WHERE duration - 60 &lt;= 0;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It forces the rDBMS to compute the value for each line, which is very expensive. You should rather compute yourself the values with literals (&lt;code&gt;0 + 60&lt;/code&gt; in this case):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sql&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
SELECT id_reunion
FROM reunion
WHERE duration &lt;= 60;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Index ==
If you often select records sorting or filtering by a given column, you may add an index on this column.  The database behavior should not change.  The index may make query faster.  However, don't add useless indexes as it makes insertion a little bit slower.

The exhaustive syntax of the CREATE statement for the indexes is as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sql&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
CREATE[ UNIQUE] INDEX &lt;index name&gt; ON &lt;table name&gt; (&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;]*);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The keyword UNIQUE indicates that all the group of values in the columns must be distinct.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;background:#FFFFFF&quot;

|- id=&quot;ACID&quot; 
| ACID || An acronym for the 4 properties ''atomicity'', ''consistency'', ''isolation'' and ''durability''. Any [[#Transaction|transaction]] must conform to them. ''Atomicity'' means that either all or no data modification will take place. ''Consistency'' ensures that transactions transforms the database from one valid state to another valid state. ''Isolation'' requires that transactions will not affect each other, even if they run at the same time. ''Durability'' means that the modifications will keep into the database even if the system crashs immediately after the transaction. q.v.: [[w:en:ACID|ACID]]

|- id=&quot;Attribute&quot;
| Attribute || A set of properties (name, datatype, size, ...) used to characterize the data items of [[#Entity|entities]]. A group of attributes constructs an [[#Entity-type|entity-type]] (or [[#Table|table]]), i.e.: all [[#Value|values]] of a certain [[#Column|column]] must conform to the same attributes. Attributes are optionally complemented by [[#Constraint|constraints]].

|- id=&quot;Block&quot; 
| Block || Aggregation of one or more physical blocks of a mass device. Usually a block contains numerous [[#Row|rows]] of one or more tables. Sometimes one [[#Row|row]] is distributed across several blocks. q.v.: [[#DirtyBlock|dirty block]]

|- id=&quot;Clause&quot; 
| Clause || A certain language element as part of a [[#Statement|statement]]. E.g.: the ''WHERE clause'' defines seach criterias.

|- id=&quot;Column&quot;
| Column|| A set of [[#Value|values]] of a single [[#Table|table]] which resides on the same position within its [[#Row|rows]].

|- id=&quot;Constraint&quot; 
| Constraint || Similar to [[#Attribute|attributes]] constraints define rules at a higher level, data items must conform to. E.g.: nullability, primary and foreign key, uniqueness, default value, user-defined-criterias like &lt;code&gt;STATUS &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt;.

|- id=&quot;Cursor&quot; 
| Cursor || A cursor is a mechanism by which the [[#Row|rows]] of a [[#Table|table]] may be acted on (e.g., returned to a host programming language) one at a time.

|- id=&quot;Database&quot; 
| Database || A set of [[#Table|tables]]. Those tables contain user data and the [[#Data Dictionary|Data Dictionary]].

|- id=&quot;DBMS&quot; 
| Database Management System (DBMS) || A set of computer programs that controls the creation, maintenance and usage of the [[#Database|database]]. q.v.: [[w:en:Database_management_system|DBMS]]

|- id=&quot;Data Dictionary&quot; 
| Data Dictionary (DD) || A set of predefined [[#Table|tables]] where the [[#DBMS|DBMS]] stores information about all user defined objects (tables, views, constraints, ...).

|- id=&quot;DCL&quot; 
| Data Control Language (DCL) || A class of [[#Statement|statements]] which defines the access rights to data, e.g: &lt;code&gt;GRANT ..., REVOKE, ...&lt;/code&gt; . 

|- id=&quot;DDL&quot; 
| Data Definition Language (DDL) || A class of [[#Statement|statements]] which defines logical and physical design of a [[#database|database]], e.g.: &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE ...&lt;/code&gt; .

|- id=&quot;DML&quot; 
| Data Manipulation Language (DML) || A class of [[#Statement|statements]] which retrieves and manipulates data, e.g.: &lt;code&gt;SELECT ..., INSERT ..., UPDATE ..., DELETE ..., COMMIT, ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt;.

|- id=&quot;DirtyBlock&quot; 
| Dirty Block || A [[#Block|block]] whose content has changed in memory, but is still not written to disc.

|- id=&quot;Entity&quot; 
| Entity || An identifiable object like an ''employee'' or a ''department''. An entity is an instance of an [[#Entity-type|entity-type]]. Usually there are many instances of a certain [[#Entity-type|entity-type]]. Every entity is stored in one [[#Row|row]]. Entities of same [[#Entity-type|entity-type]] are stored in [[#Row|rows]] of the same [[#Table|table]]. So entities are a logical construct and [[#Row|rows]] a physical implementation.

|- id=&quot;Entity-type&quot; 
| Entity-type || A group of [[#Attribute|attributes]] describing the structure of [[#entity|entities]]. As [[#entity|entities]] of same entity-type are stored in [[#Row|rows]] of the same [[#Table|table]] it can be said, that an entity-type describes a [[#Table|table]]. (Many people tend to use the term [[#entity|entity]] as a synonym for entity-type.)

|- id=&quot;Expression&quot; 
| Expression || A certain language element as part of a [[#Statement|statement]]. It can produce either scalar [[#Value|values]] or a [[#Table|table]].

|- id=&quot;Foreign key&quot; 
| Foreign key || A [[#Value|value]] used to reference a [[#Primary key|primary key]].  Its value will match a primary key value outside own [[#Table|table]].
|- id=&quot;Index&quot; 
| Index || An index is a construct containing copies of original values and backreferences to their original rows. It's purpose is the provision of a fast access to the original data. To achieve this, an index contains some kind of collocation.&lt;br /&gt;
Remark: Indexes are not part of the SQL standard. Nevertheless they are part of nearly every DBMS.

|- id=&quot;Junction table&quot; 
| Junction table || If more than one row of table T1 refers to more than one row of table T2 (many-to-many relationship) you need an intermediate [[#Table|table]] to store this relationship. The [[#Row|rows]] of the intermediate table contains the [[#Primary key|primary keys]] of T1 and T2 as [[#Value|values]]. q.v.: [[w:en:Junction_table|Junction_table]]

|- id=&quot;Normalization&quot; 
| Normalization || [[#Table|Tables]] should conform to special rules - namely ''First-'', ''Second-'' and ''Third-Normal Form''. The process of rearranging columns over tables is called ''normalization''.

|- id=&quot;NULL&quot; 
| NULL || If no [[#value|value]] is stored in the a [[#Column|column]] of a [[#Row|row]], we say it stores the ''null value''. So, NULL is a special value that is used to indicate the absence of any data value. For example it makes a difference whether a temperature is measured and stored as 0 degrees or whether the temperature is not measured and hence not stored. One consequence of the existence of ''null values'' is that SQL knows not only the boolean values TRUE and FALSE but also a third one: UNKNOWN.

|- id=&quot;Predicate&quot; 
| Predicate || A language element of the ''WHERE clause'' which specifies conditions that evaluates to the SQL three-valued logic (true/false/unknown). Predicates are used to find rows.

|- id=&quot;Primary key&quot; 
| Primary key || A [[#Value|value]] or a set of [[#Value|values]] used to identify a single row uniquely. 

|- id=&quot;Query&quot; 
| Query || An often used [[#Statement|statement]] which retrieves data from the database. It is introduced by the keyword SELECT and usually contains a [[#Predicate|predicate]].

|- id=&quot;Relationship&quot; 
| Relationship || A reference between two different or the same [[#entity|entity]]. References are not implemented as links. They base upon the [[#Value|values]] of the entities.

|- id=&quot;RelationalModel&quot; 
| [[w:en:Relational model|Relational Model]] || A method (and a mathematical theory) to model data as tables (relations), the relationships among each other and all operations on the data.

|- id=&quot;Row&quot; 
| Row || One record in a [[#Table|table]] containing information about one single [[#Entity|entity]]. A row has exactly one [[#Value|value]] for each of its columns - in accordance with ''First Normal Form''. This [[#Value|value]] may be [[#NULL|NULL]].

|- id=&quot;Statement&quot; 
| Statement || A single command which is executed by the [[#DBMS|DBMS]]. There are 3 main classes of statements: [[#DML|DML]], [[#DDL|DDL]] and [[#DCL|DCL]].

|- id=&quot;Table&quot; 
| Table (=Relation)|| A set of [[#Row|rows]] of a certain [[#Entity-type|entity-type]], i.e. all [[#Row|rows]] of a certain table have the same structure.

|- id=&quot;3VL&quot; 
| Three Value Logic (3VL) || SQL knows three boolean values: TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. See: [[#NULL|NULL]].  q.v.: [[w:en:3VL|3VL]]

|- id=&quot;Transaction&quot; 
| Transaction || A logical unit of work consisting of one or more modifications to the database. The [[#ACID|ACID criterium]] must be achieved. A transaction is either saved by the &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt; statement or completely canceled by the &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; statement.

|- id=&quot;Value&quot; 
| Value || Implementation of a single data item within a certain [[#Column|column]] of a certain [[#Row|row]]. (You can think of a cell within a spreadsheet.)

|- id=&quot;View&quot; 
| View || A virtual [[#Table|table]] containing only its definition and no real data. The definition consists of a [[#Query|query]] to one or more real [[#Table|tables]] or views. [[#Query|Queries]] to the view are processed as [[#Query|queries]] to the underlying real [[#Table|tables]].
