      <text xml:space="preserve">== API Overview ==

Here is an overview of some of the most important package namespaces and classes in the [http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html Android API].

* [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html android.content.Context] is the base class for [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html android.app.Activity] and other similar classes. Here you will find important methods for accessing application package data and the application environment.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html android.view.View] is the base class for all widgets. The [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/package-summary.html android.view] namespace defines non-widget-specific utility classes.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/package-summary.html android.widget] is the namespace where you will find specific widget implementations and related classes.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/package-summary.html android.graphics] is the namespace for the 2D graphics API; [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html Canvas] is the drawing context, [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html Paint] specifies settings like what colour, drawing mode, text settings etc to use, and [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Typeface.html Typeface] is how you specify fonts.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html android.content.Intent] is the basic IPC mechanism.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/package-summary.html android.os] contains various useful classes to do with the UI framework: [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.html Handler] for feeding tasks/messages to a [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Looper.html Looper], and [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html AsyncTask] for running tasks on background threads that need coordination with the UI. Here you will also find [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcel.html Parcel] and [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Bundle.html Bundle], which are different ways of serializing/deserializing data, mainly meant to be used for saving/restoring UI state.

=== API Versions ===
New versions of Android introduce new capabilities, and sometimes drop support for old ones. Each version of Android has an associated [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html API level], and each app in its manifest declares its “minimum” and “target” ''SDK version'' (i.e. API level). The minimum API level indicates that it will not work (or at least has not been tested) with any older Android version, and will likely crash. The target API level is used to adjust some automatic behaviour of the Android system, to match with expectations of the app.

== Dates and Times ==
Java (and Android) offer a confusing plethora of different classes to do with dates and times. This section will try to shed some clarity on the thicket.

* [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html java.util.GregorianCalendar] — this is the main class to be used for constructing and manipulating dates and times. Note that many important methods come from its [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Calendar.html java.util.Calendar] superclass.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/TimeZone.html java.util.TimeZone] — gives you information about the current system time zone as well as other available time zones that the system knows about.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Date.html java.util.Date] — this remains an essential class, even though most of its constructors and methods are deprecated. You can obtain one of these from a Calendar object by calling its [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Calendar.html#getTime() getTime] method. The only reason you need objects of this class is because the formatting routines don’t work with &lt;TT&gt;Calendar&lt;/TT&gt; objects!
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/DateFormat.html java.text.DateFormat] — this is where you will find the functions for doing locale-dependent date formatting. Note they only work on Date objects, not &lt;TT&gt;Calendar&lt;/TT&gt; or &lt;TT&gt;GregorianCalendar&lt;/TT&gt; objects.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/DateFormat.html android.text.format.DateFormat] — convenience routines for obtaining suitable &lt;TT&gt;java.text.DateFormat&lt;/TT&gt; objects for the user’s current locale/format settings. Also lets you format dates according to custom formats.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html java.text.SimpleDateFormat] — lets you create custom date formats.
* [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/SimpleTimeZone.html java.util.SimpleTimeZone] — not sure what the point of this is. Why would you want to define your own time zones?

== 2D Graphics Concepts ==
Overview of the Android 2D graphics API.

=== Canvas ===
A [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html Canvas] provides the basic drawing context. On-screen drawing of most widgets is done in their override of [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas) View.onDraw], which gets passed a Canvas into which they render their display. Alternatively, if you want to do drawing at times dictated by your app, rather than by the system, then you can use a [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceView.html SurfaceView].

You can also create your own Canvas objects to do off-screen rendering. You do this by wrapping them around a Bitmap object that you set up.

The normal Canvas coordinate system has the X-coordinate increasing from left to right, and the Y-coordinate increasing from top to bottom, with (0, 0) at the top-left of the drawing area. However, you can alter this by transforming drawing through a Matrix.

=== Bitmap ===
A [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.html Bitmap] is the container for an array of pixels. You can either supply the pixels (in which case the Bitmap is ''immutable''—i.e. the graphics API will not draw into them), or have the graphics API allocate the space for them itself (in which case the Bitmap is ''mutable''—can be drawn into). In the latter case, you must remember to call the [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.html#recycle() recycle] method when you have finished with the Bitmap; contrary to the documentation saying “This is an advanced call, and normally need not be called”, you will be quite likely to hit “out of memory” errors if you create lots of mutable bitmaps without doing this.

=== Colour Values ===
Pixel colours are specified in many places as a 32-bit integer with alpha, red, blue and green components each taking up 8 bits. Assuming that “alpha”, “red”, “blue” and “green” are each integers in the range 0 .. 255, you can build them into a colour value as follows:

&lt;code&gt;
    int color =
            alpha &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 24
        |
            red &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 16
        |
            green &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8
        |
            blue;
&lt;/code&gt;

The API doesn’t enforce whether [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing alpha is premultiplied] or not. But the [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/PorterDuff.Mode.html Porter-Duff transfer modes] will really only give correct results with premultiplied alpha.

=== Paint ===
A [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html Paint] object contains various settings used to control drawing of some object into a Canvas: the colour to use, what transfer modes and filtering effects to apply, Path-rendering settings, and text settings.

=== Typeface ===
A [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Typeface.html Typeface] is how you specify a font. Note that there is only a limited set of preinstalled system fonts, with no (official) provision for adding more. If you want more fonts, you will have to include them with your app, or access them from a user download area, or something.

=== Path ===
A [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Path.html Path] is the representation of a scalable geometric object. This could be as simple as a single circle, oval or rectangle, or it could be more complicated and consist of multiple segments made out of cubic and quadratic Bézier curves and straight-line segments. A path can be filled or stroked. It can also be used for clipping drawing in a Canvas.

Note that there is no equivalent to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript PostScript] &lt;TT&gt;pathforall&lt;/TT&gt; operator: there is no way to read back the components of the definition of a Path. If you need to maintain this information, you will need to define your own geometry object, which will convert its contents to a Path on demand.

=== Shader ===
A [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Shader.html Shader] gives you more advanced options for drawing with a Paint. By default a paint renders an area of a single flat colour, but setting the right kind of Shader gives you options for applying gradient fills, filling with a bitmap image, and combinations of these.

=== Why Do My Graphics Look So Jaggy? ===
The graphics API includes options for anti-aliasing, but these are not enabled by default (why not? performance issues on older hardware?). To make things look good, use [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html#setAntiAlias(boolean) Paint.setAntiAlias] for rendering smooth geometry, and [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html#setFilterBitmap(boolean) Paint.setFilterBitmap] for smooth scaling of bitmaps.

=== See Also ===
The video [http://www.parleys.com/#st=5&amp;id=2110&amp;sl=44 Android Graphics and Animations] presented by Romain Guy and Chet Haase at the Devoxx 2010 Java conference gives an overview of the graphics API and how to do animations.

== 2D Versus 3D Graphics ==
Android uses quite different APIs for 2D versus 3D graphics. The 2D graphics API is built on the '''Skia''' graphics library that Google acquired along with the company that created it. The 3D graphics API is '''OpenGL-ES''', the “embeddable” subset of the well-known cross-platform OpenGL 3D graphics API.

The 2D graphics engine is completely integrated into the UI, and is used for all on-screen drawing of windows, widgets etc. For example, to create your own custom widget, it is easy enough to subclass &lt;TT&gt;View&lt;/TT&gt;, do whatever custom rendering you want in its &lt;TT&gt;onDraw&lt;/TT&gt; method and event handling in &lt;TT&gt;onTouchEvent&lt;/TT&gt;.

3D graphics is not quite so seamlessly integrated. The easiest way to do an on-screen 3D display is to subclass &lt;TT&gt;[http://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.html GLSurfaceView]&lt;/TT&gt;, in addition to which you need to provide a custom subclass of &lt;TT&gt;[http://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.Renderer.html GLSurfaceView.Renderer]&lt;/TT&gt; which does the actual setup and drawing.

A &lt;TT&gt;GLSurfaceView&lt;/TT&gt; offers two “render modes”, selected by calling &lt;TT&gt;setRenderMode&lt;/TT&gt;: &lt;TT&gt;RENDERMODE_CONTINUOUSLY&lt;/TT&gt; in which your &lt;TT&gt;Renderer&lt;/TT&gt; is continually called to render the scene (the default), and &lt;TT&gt;RENDERMODE_WHEN_DIRTY&lt;/TT&gt; where your &lt;TT&gt;Renderer&lt;/TT&gt; is only invoked when you do a &lt;TT&gt;requestRender&lt;/TT&gt;. Note this is quite different from normal 2D widgets, which are only (re)drawn in response to an &lt;TT&gt;invalidate&lt;/TT&gt; call.

Note the difference in coordinate systems: in the 2D graphics API, y-coordinates increase ''down''wards, while in OpenGL they increase ''up''wards.

=== Graphics Primitives ===
The available graphics primitives are more limited in 3D. Whereas in 2D you have complex entities like text, Paths, Drawables and Pictures, in 3D you just have points, lines and triangles. In particular, all object surfaces must be constructed out of triangles; curved surfaces are approximated to a limited extent by subdividing into smaller triangles, but more importantly by enabling ''smooth shading'', which fools the eye into seeing continuous gradations instead of angular facets.

It is possible to use 2D graphics in 3D, by rendering a 2D image to a Bitmap, which is then used as a texture on an object surface in 3D.

Also note that OpenGL is strictly an '''on-screen real-time rendering API''': it defines no “file format” for storing scenes/models in persistent storage, and it doesn’t support CPU-intensive functions like ray-tracing, radiosity and the like.

=== OpenGL-ES Versus Regular OpenGL ===
OpenGL-ES leaves out various capabilities of OpenGL which were deemed to have too high an overhead of implementation in an embedded environment. OpenGL-ES 1.1 is  based on OpenGL 1.5, among the differences being:
* No &lt;TT&gt;Begin&lt;/TT&gt;/&lt;TT&gt;End&lt;/TT&gt; grouping and associated calls for individually specifying vertex info: instead, you must use the ''xxx''&lt;TT&gt;Pointer&lt;/TT&gt; calls to pass entire buffers of coordinates at a time, and then draw them with &lt;TT&gt;DrawArrays&lt;/TT&gt; (selecting contiguous subarrays) or &lt;TT&gt;DrawElements&lt;/TT&gt; (selecting individual array elements by index).
* Only 2D textures, no 3D or 1D.
* No support for polygons other than triangles.
* ES adds the option to specify coordinates etc as ''fixed-point'' values (calls with an &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; suffix) instead of floating-point (&lt;TT&gt;f&lt;/TT&gt; suffix).

=== &lt;TT&gt;android.opengl&lt;/TT&gt; Versus &lt;TT&gt;khronos.opengles&lt;/TT&gt; ===
Android provides two alternative styles of OpenGL API calls: the [http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/microedition/khronos/opengles/package-summary.html khronos.opengles] calls are method calls off explicit &lt;TT&gt;GL&lt;/TT&gt; objects, whereas the [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/package-summary.html android.opengl] calls are all static, and implicitly refer to a current GL context.

It looks like the latter are now the preferred form, since the addition of support for OpenGL-ES 2.0 in API level 8 (Android 2.2) was done only in the &lt;TT&gt;android.opengl&lt;/TT&gt; style, not the &lt;TT&gt;khronos.opengles&lt;/TT&gt; style.

=== OpenGL-ES 1.''x'' Versus 2.0 ===
Android 2.2 introduced support for OpenGL-ES 2.0, which is ''not backward-compatible'' with OpenGL-ES 1.1 or 1.0. However, the OpenGL-ES 1.''x'' APIs remain available for existing code. When you write new code, you have to decide which one to use.

The main difference is that OpenGL-ES 2.0 ''drops support for the fixed-function pipeline''. That is, all the traditional OpenGL material, lighting and matrix functions are no longer available (these are deprecated in more recent versions of regular OpenGL, too). In their place, you write custom ''vertex shaders'' and ''fragment shaders'' which give you total control over how your materials, lighting and transformations will work.

=== EGL ===
[http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/microedition/khronos/egl/package-summary.html EGL] is an API for giving direct control over creation of OpenGL contexts that render to on-screen windows, offscreen pixmaps, or additional graphics-card memory. GLSurfaceView provides a simple wrapper to save you using it directly, but you can still do so in cases where this isn’t flexible enough (like when you want to do offscreen rendering).

=== See Also ===
Documentation on OpenGL, OpenGL-ES and EGL can be found at [http://www.khronos.org/ khronos.org].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Android Software Developer Kit is what you use to develop Android applications. You get it from [https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html here].

=== GUI Versus Command Line ===
The SDK includes a plugin for use with the [http://eclipse.org/ Eclipse] IDE, as well as command-line tools that can be invoked via an [http://ant.apache.org/ Ant] build script.

Most developers seem to prefer GUI tools. However, this makes it difficult to choose different IDEs or text editors. Also sometimes more complex builds require the execution of custom scripts at build time, and only the command line offers the flexibility to cope with this.

== Native Code==
Android apps do not have to be written entirely in Java. It is possible to include C/C++ code and compile it with the [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/overview.html Native Development Kit (NDK)]. This code then interfaces with the Java code through the [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/jniTOC.html Java Native Interface (JNI)], of which the Dalvik virtual machine includes a (mostly) complete implementation.

When you might want to use the NDK:
* Port C/C++ code from another platform.
* Java code is too slow—but beware: “'''premature optimization is the root of all evil'''” (variously attributed to Donald Knuth or Tony Hoare). Do ''actual testing'' to determine where the slow parts of your code are, before trying to speed them up: the performance bottlenecks are often not where you think they are.
* Allocate more memory than the 20MB or so permitted for your Java heap.

Reasons not to use the NDK:
* Your compiled code ends up being architecture-specific. Sure, you can include alternative versions for, say, both ARM and MIPS to cover the likely bases for now, but what happens if Intel’s Atom efforts pay off, and future devices make more use of ''x''86 chips?
* Debugging is hard. Instead of seeing a nice Java exception traceback in the logcat, pointing to the exact source line where the error occurred, you get a crash register dump. However, it is possible to narrow down the point of the error through the standard expedient of outputting debug messages at strategic points in the code (see Logging, below).

=== Better JNI Glue ===
The standard Android-provided &lt;TT&gt;jni.h&lt;/TT&gt; makes it slightly awkward to call JNI routines. You can improve this by processing &lt;TT&gt;jni.h&lt;/TT&gt; through [https://github.com/ldo/JNIGlue JNIGlue], which generates more convenient &lt;TT&gt;static inline&lt;/TT&gt; wrapper routines. For example, instead of

&lt;code&gt;
    const jclass SystemClass = (**env).FindClass(env, &quot;java/lang/System&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;

you can do

&lt;code&gt;
    const jclass SystemClass = JNFindClass(env, &quot;java/lang/System&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;

=== Logging ===
In Java code, you can write messages to the logcat using either the [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html Log] class, or simply write to the standard Java [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/System.html#err System.err] diagnostic stream or [http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/System.html#out System.out] output stream. In the first case, you can set the logging level and the “tag” string used to prefix your messages; in the second case, the level is always warning (W), and the tag is always “System.err”, and in the last case, the level is info (I) and the tag is “System.out”.

In native code, the usual stdio streams of &lt;TT&gt;stdout&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;stderr&lt;/TT&gt; are defined, but do ''not'' work—certainly trying to write to &lt;TT&gt;stdout&lt;/TT&gt; or &lt;TT&gt;stderr&lt;/TT&gt; not only does not display messages anywhere, it can lead to strange crashes elsewhere in your code.

Instead, you can use the native logging library. There is no public documentation for this, but the routines are in the &lt;TT&gt;android/log.h&lt;/TT&gt; header file that you can include in your C/C++ code. Also in your &lt;TT&gt;Android.mk&lt;/TT&gt; for building the native code, add &lt;TT&gt;-llog&lt;/TT&gt; to the definition of your &lt;TT&gt;LOCAL_LDLIBS&lt;/TT&gt; variable.

Messages written to the logcat in this way look like

    ''level''/''tag''(''pid''): ''text''

e.g.

    W/System.err( 1288): test app successfully started

The log levels as enumerated in &lt;TT&gt;android/log.h&lt;/TT&gt;, and the corresponding single-letter codes that appear in the messages, are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | code
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | char
|-
|ANDROID_LOG_UNKNOWN
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''message does&lt;BR&gt;not appear''
|-
|ANDROID_LOG_DEFAULT
|-
|ANDROID_LOG_VERBOSE || V
|-
|ANDROID_LOG_DEBUG || D
|-
|ANDROID_LOG_INFO || I
|-
|ANDROID_LOG_WARN || W
|-
|ANDROID_LOG_ERROR || E
|-
|ANDROID_LOG_FATAL || F
|-
|ANDROID_LOG_SILENT || S
|}

=== GCC Extensions ===
The C and C++ compilers included with the NDK are built from [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC], so you have access to the usual GCC capabilities. For example, you can do the C99 &lt;TT&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdbool.h&amp;gt;&lt;/TT&gt; and use the &lt;TT&gt;bool&lt;/TT&gt; type, with values &lt;TT&gt;true&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;false&lt;/TT&gt;, in conditional expressions in your code. You can enable more general C99 capabilities by putting a line like this in your &lt;TT&gt;Android.mk&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;code&gt;
    LOCAL_CFLAGS += -std=c99
&lt;/code&gt;

== A possible example of setting up android development ==

This is a walkthrough of a typical setup of android development .


Mint Linux edition 15 dvd is downloaded , burned to a dvd which is verified, and then the computer is rebooted with the mint dvd. 

Custom installation is chosen, and with the unused disc space that was reserved when windows installed , or otherwise use the obsolete linux's root partition , because it won't work anyway when it's upgraded. 

Once mint is installed, the IDE will be eclipse because it is so flexible, and tons of other development junk can be put on it later, so eclipse kepler/ whatever the latest edition is downloaded , the toplink / most popular download is chosen ( the one with java development and plugin development). 
This is unzipped in a user directory, and we try to execute it . Hopefully it does, e.g. fortunately we didn't chose the 64 bit version of eclipse when the 32 bit of Mint was installed. 

A little hello world java program is written, to see if the eclipse IDE has a working java compiler. At least the java runtime should be working, because eclipse wouldn't run otherwise. If not, go to synaptic or the mint applications loader and find a java runtime, e.g. openjdk 7 in 2013. 

The next bit is to get the android sdk. In Nov 2013, it was the r22  one, found at
http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.3-linux.tgz, and this is downloaded and unzipped. It might not work if you have a 64 bit Mint environment though, maybe a redhat one would. To get it working in this case, you have to execute tools/emulator and see what it says. 

If it says something like there is no file or directory called .. blah/emulator  , then likely you don't have a 32 bit environment installed, so get the libc 32 bit environment from synaptic.

If you aren't the administrator, open a terminal first, run su, then type the administrator password
(the first user created when mint was installed ). Then type synaptic.

then install libc6-i386. 

Keep running emulator and install the libraries it pines for, e.g. lib32stdc++6.

Something else won't work either, which is the aapt build tool in the version of build tools from android, which requires the 32 bit version of the zlib library ,  lib32z1 . It shows up later , when you
find that the generated R class for your android app doesn't generate automatically when editing your project, and everything R.xx is underlined in red.

Run the ./tools/android  exec, funny it should actually work even if there is no 32 bit libs. 
This is to get your android platforms loaded, e.g. platform for 4.4 kitkat, or 4.3 ice cream sandwich, or 2.2 froyo, and also the down in the Extras folder at the bottom, the latest android &quot;support&quot; package, because this gives you backward compatibility of an application written in a later library with an earlier device, if the support library is included in your project. 
Also you need the  ARM system image as a minimum , and maybe the Intel one, but each image makes the
download longer, and you can easily end up with 1 gig of development crap just to get hello world on android.

Install the plugin in eclipse, by running eclipse and going to the right most help menu item, and &quot;install new stuff&quot; , then at the top, add in a new software repository site by clicking the button at the top on right &quot;Add..&quot;  , and pasting the url in the second &quot;Location&quot; field,
 https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

then chose the android development plugin, and maybe the NDK , if you are hardcore gnu ( but you wouldn't be because you are using eclipse ). 

After this try creating a blank activity android project, and try running it.

This requires setting up by clicking under the &quot;Window&quot; menu item in eclipse and &quot;Android Virtual Device Manager&quot; , and then choose a low grunt virtual device like Nexus One , so that you don't grow too old waiting for the virtual device to start. Click the second tab in the avd manager, and then select Nexus One from the list on the left, and the &quot;create AVD&quot; button on the right becomes enabled, and then create a virtual device with the ARM system image and whatever level of Android API, and maybe snapshot checked at the bottom, but beware of use &quot;Native GL&quot;  because the 32 bit libraries for these may not be loaded, and it will still let a non-functional device be created. 

After this , you can try to get a calculator project going, but don't do the programming one from google search 2010, just use the layout editor for the main activity xml , as you can but 4 buttons in one horizontal layout, copy the layout, and paste it to get the other rows. You can also set the onClick method for all the buttons by use ctrl-click to multiple select all the buttons, and then right click in the Outline view over a highlighted button, and choose the menu item &quot;Other property..&quot; and choosing &quot;OnClick&quot;, and typing the method name to receive e.g. buttonPressed.
Then create a &lt;i&gt;public&lt;/i&gt; method in the Activity.java file , called &quot;public void buttonPressed(View v)&quot; , and handle any button clicks by identifying the button using the button's label. (Cast the v passed in into a Button object first ).  

Happy android programming, and may the market whim be with you.</text>

''Open question: To speed up running Java applications in a JVM (and similar interpreters and CPU emulators), would it help to have 3 separate caches -- a machine instruction cache indexed by the program counter PC, a byte code cache indexed by the VM's instruction pointer IP, and a data cache ?''

:I suppose not. On current CPUs, the bytecode is treated as data (accessed by the same instructions) or compiled just-in-time (transformed into instructions). No CPU, except perhaps some ARMs with Jazelle, handles bytecode in a specific way: there is no need to waste area and add *a lot* of complexity to handle bytecode differently, when it already fits perfectly in the split D/I cache hierarchy. I suggest someone removes the question from the page, since it hasn't much theoretical interest IMHO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Decimal Numbers'''
A decimal number system is composed of ten digits from 0 to 9 and each digit has its own weight and quality. These are the numbers which have base 10. In decimal number system every digit has a weight multiplied by power of 10.
    Eg: Let us take a number 56.
    here 5 has a weight of 10 i.e. 5×10=50
    and 6 has a weight of 1 i.e. 6×1=6
    after adding these numbers we get 50+6=56

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter presents one way to play audio files in web apps using the HTML5 &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; element. There are alternatives (e.g. W3C's [http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/ Web Audio API]) but the HTML5 &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; element appears to be the most widely supported standard. 

===The Example===
The example of this chapter (which is also available [http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/sounds/sounds.html online]; also as [http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/sounds/isounds.html downloadable version]) uses three buttons to call the &lt;code&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;load()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pause()&lt;/code&gt; methods of the &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; element. In fact, this is about all you can do with &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; elements (more specifically with media elements, see the W3C's [http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-elements specification of media elements]). The example can also be used to test whether a specific audio file can be played on a specific platform. For example, I had problems using the &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; method more than once with the WAV file on an iPad. (The iPad would stop playing the file until I reloaded the web page.)

The following sections will discuss the sound-specific parts of the code; see the chapter on [[Canvas 2D Web Apps/Responsive Buttons|responsive buttons]] and previous chapters for discussions of other parts.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot;
      content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no&quot;&gt;

    &lt;script src=&quot;cui2d.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;script&gt;
      function init() {
        // get images
        imageNormalButton.src = &quot;normal.png&quot;;
        imageNormalButton.onload = cuiRepaint;
        imageFocusedButton.src = &quot;selected.png&quot;;
        imageFocusedButton.onload = cuiRepaint;
        imagePressedButton.src = &quot;depressed.png&quot;;
        imagePressedButton.onload = cuiRepaint;

        // get audio
        audioHello = document.getElementById(&quot;hello&quot;);
        audioHello.load();

        // initialize and start cui2d
        cuiInit(myPage);
      }

      // audio clip
      var audioHello;

      // create images
      var imageNormalButton = new Image();
      var imageFocusedButton = new Image();
      var imagePressedButton = new Image();

      // create buttons
      var button0 = new cuiButton();
      var button1 = new cuiButton();
      var button2 = new cuiButton();

      // create page
      var myPage = new cuiPage(400, 300, myPageProcess);

      function myPageProcess(event) {
        if (button0.process(event, 20, 50, 80, 50, &quot;play&quot;,
          imageNormalButton, imageFocusedButton, imagePressedButton)) {
          if (button0.isClicked()) {
            audioHello.play();
          }
          return true;
        }
 
        if (button1.process(event, 100, 50, 80, 50, &quot;load&quot;,
          imageNormalButton, imageFocusedButton, imagePressedButton)) {
          if (button1.isClicked()) {
            audioHello.load();
          }
          return true;
        }
 
        if (button2.process(event, 180, 50, 140, 50, &quot;play/pause&quot;,
          imageNormalButton, imageFocusedButton, imagePressedButton)) {
          if (button2.isClicked()) {
            if (audioHello.paused || audioHello.ended) {
              audioHello.play();
            }
            else {
              audioHello.pause();
            }
          }
          return true;
        }

        if (null == event) {
          // draw background
          cuiContext.fillStyle = &quot;#A0A0AF&quot;; 
          cuiContext.fillRect(0, 0, this.width, this.height);
        }
        return false;  // event has not been processed
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
 
  &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#000000&quot; onload=&quot;init()&quot; 
    style=&quot;-webkit-user-drag:none; -webkit-user-select:none; &quot;&gt;
    &lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;A canvas element cannot be displayed.&lt;/font&gt;

    &lt;audio id=&quot;hello&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;source src=&quot;grouphello.wav&quot; type=&quot;audio/wav&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/audio&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Loading Sounds===
The easiest way to load sounds is to define an &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; element in the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
  &lt;audio id=&quot;hello&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;source src=&quot;grouphello.wav&quot; type=&quot;audio/wav&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
This specifies a &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; element with the name “&lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;” and the audio file (the source) “&lt;code&gt;group hello.wav&lt;/code&gt;” of type “&lt;code&gt;audio/wav&lt;/code&gt;.” Note that:
* You should specify multiple &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; elements with the same audio content in different formats such that all web browser find one that they can play. (See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility here] for an overview of supported formats by various browsers; Apple developers should see [https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/Device-SpecificConsiderations/Device-SpecificConsiderations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009523-CH5-SW9 here] for formats supported on iOS.)
* You should specify the type of each audio file because some browsers (in particular Safari on iOS) appear to need this information in some cases.

In order to access the &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; element, a global variable should be defined, e.g.:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      var audioHello;
&lt;/source&gt;
This variable should be set in the &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; function; in the example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
        audioHello = document.getElementById(&quot;hello&quot;);
        audioHello.load();
&lt;/source&gt;
This uses the name “&lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;” which was defined in the &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; tag and requests the web browser to load the audio file.

===Playing Sounds===
The &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; function uses one button to call &lt;code&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
        if (button0.process(event, 20, 50, 80, 50, &quot;play&quot;,
          imageNormalButton, imageFocusedButton, imagePressedButton)) {
          if (button0.isClicked()) {
            audioHello.play();
          }
          return true;
        }
&lt;/source&gt;

There is a second button to call &lt;code&gt;load()&lt;/code&gt; again (which usually rewinds the file to the beginning but might lead to problems for some combinations of audio file formats and web browsers):
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt; 
        if (button1.process(event, 100, 50, 80, 50, &quot;load&quot;,
          imageNormalButton, imageFocusedButton, imagePressedButton)) {
          if (button1.isClicked()) {
            audioHello.load();
          }
          return true;
        }
&lt;/source&gt;

The third button checks whether the audio file is &lt;code&gt;paused&lt;/code&gt; or has &lt;code&gt;ended&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, it calls &lt;code&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise &lt;code&gt;pause()&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
        if (button2.process(event, 180, 50, 140, 50, &quot;play/pause&quot;,
          imageNormalButton, imageFocusedButton, imagePressedButton)) {
          if (button2.isClicked()) {
            if (audioHello.paused || audioHello.ended) {
              audioHello.play();
            }
            else {
              audioHello.pause();
            }
          }
          return true;
&lt;/source&gt;
The example can also be used to test audio files with particular web browsers, which is often necessary as described next.

===Testing Sounds===
Since support for audio file formats strongly depends on the web browser (not only for technical reasons but also because of legal issues), it is important to test web apps with sounds on as many platforms as possible. If there is an issue, the same content should be provided in multiple formats in order to support as many browsers as possible. It might also make sense to avoid calling the &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; function more than once, e.g. if the audio clip is very short and restarting before it ends doesn't make much sense anyways. (Also note that the &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; function in Safari on iOS appears to be rather slow.)

For iBooks widgets, [http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5068 Apple recommends] to use AAC audio in an MPEG-4 container with an “&lt;code&gt;.m4a&lt;/code&gt;” file extension.

A Python script can find out about the type, class, attributes and methods of an object. This is referred to as '''reflection''' or '''introspection'''. See also [[../Metaclasses/]].

Reflection-enabling functions include type(), isinstance(), callable(), dir() and getattr().

==Type==
The type method enables to find out about the type of an object. The following tests return True:
* type(3) is int
* type('Hello') is str
* type([1, 2]) is list
* type([1, [2, 'Hello']]) is list
* type({'city': 'Paris'}) is dict

==Isinstance==
Determines whether an object is an instance of a class.

The following returns True:
* isinstance(3, int)
* isinstance([1, 2], list)
Note that isinstance provides a weaker condition than a comparison using [[#Type]].

==Duck typing==
Duck typing provides an indirect means of reflection. It is a technique consisting in using an object as if it was of the requested type, while catching exceptions resulting from the object not supporting some of the features of the class or type.

==Callable==
For an object, determines whether it can be called. A class can be made callable by providing a __call__() method.

Examples:
* callable(2)
** Returns False. Ditto for callable(&quot;Hello&quot;) and callable([1, 2]).
* callable([1,2].pop)
** Returns True, as pop without &quot;()&quot; returns a function object.
* callable([1,2].pop())
** Returns False, as [1,2].pop() returns 2 rather than a function object.

==Dir==
Returns the list of attributes of an object, which includes methods.

Examples:
* dir(3)
* dir(&quot;Hello&quot;)
* dir([1, 2])

==Getattr==
Returns the value of an attribute of an object, given the attribute name passed as a string.

An example:
* getattr(3, &quot;imag&quot;)
The list of attributes of an object can be obtained using [[#Dir]].

I've changed the code to rotate around and scaling centered at the midpoint between the two fingers (which is more intuitive, in particular for task such as zooming into a map). There are a couple of side effects; thus, the page has to be revised substantially.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Run the '''Database Configuration Assistant''':&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 [oracle@collabn1 ~]$ '''/u01/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/dbhome_1/bin/dbca '''



&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;The splash screen appears.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

[[File:RA-Oracle_RAC_12101-DBCA Splash.PNG|RA-Oracle_RAC_12101-DBCA Splash]]



&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Select '''Create Database''' and click '''Next'''.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

[[File:RA-Oracle_RAC_12101-DBCA Database Operation.PNG|RA-Oracle_RAC_12101-DBCA Database Operation]]



&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Select '''Create a database with default configuration'''.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Global Database Name:  '''RAC.racattack'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Storage Type:  '''Automatic Storage Management (ASM)'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Database Files Location: '''+DATA'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Fast Recovery Area: '''+FRA'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Database Character Set: '''AL32UTF8 - Unicode UTF-8 Universal character set'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Administrative password: '''racattack'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Check '''Create As Container Database'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Pluggable Database Name: '''PDB''' (*)&lt;/big&gt;

{{warning|&lt;big&gt;(*) There are a large number of differences between a Container Database (CDB) and a standard Database (non-CDB). If you are not ready to experiment with too many new technologies together, just leave unchecked '''Create As Container Database'''&lt;/big&gt;.}}

&lt;big&gt;Click '''Next'''.&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;A warning is shown because the password is weak. Click '''Yes''' to continue.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;The prerequisite checks may fail due to space requirements. It's safe to ignore by checking '''Ignore all'''.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Click '''Next'''.&lt;/big&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spanish is the language which is expanding globally.
Some of the basic reasons which are promoting Spanish language are:. 

1. The second most-spoken language in the United States and Europe and is the fourth most-spoken language in the world.

2. In US, employers provide pay increases for bi-lingual employees, especially those who are fluent in Spanish because of the prevalence of Spanish-speaking immigrants and workers in the U.S.

3. It is some how similar to English language.

Do you know learning to speak a second language stimulates your creative ability and improvise your thinking processes too. Some research revealed that the ability to speak 2 languages fluently can reduce the odds that you may develop dementia as you age, including Alzheimer’s Disease.</text>

== GUI Programming ==

In my capacity as a Ph.D. student, I sometimes teach courses.  Last fall (2013) I was teaching a course on Windowed Systems Programming; suffice to say I didn't like our existing textbook.  As students need a reference, I had the clever idea of just making a wikibook to track what we do in class.  There are already a number of &quot;Learn GUI Programming with X&quot; guides, for any language X.  I'd like to tackle something a little more general, aiming at modern practices that span specific toolkits.

That's a little tricky though, because I basically discovered that the overlap between modern toolkits isn't perfect, and to do anything useful you have to get down in the weeds - and different toolkits have different copses of weeds at different places.  I may finish this wikibook or I may come back and do one for a specific toolkit.

==Things Will Be Different==

Things are a little different when working with event-driven systems.

The first programs you wrote were probably simple single-file programs.
They had a beginning, ran through several steps, and reached an end.
Your programs may have grown to encompass more functions, files and modules, but they probably still had some concept of a &quot;current instruction,&quot; and there was probably some flow through the program that you could, in principle, follow.

This is of course still true of event-driven programs &quot;under the hood,&quot; but this is not how you, the programmer, will view them.
You will not (necessarily) be starting at a given entry point (like a main routine) and then tracking your program flow as it moves through various stages of execution.

In even-driven programming, you are instead given an ''environment''.
You will add ''entities'' into this environment, and you will define how those entities respond to ''events'' that come from the environment.
You will set this construct up and then &quot;let it go,&quot; and its exact behavior will depend on the specific events that your system receives from the environment.

==Events and Callbacks==

Let us begin by first examining the concept of a ''callback''.
A ''callback'' is a function that a programmer provides to some external library, so that the library can trigger that function at some other time; abstractly, they are a way to specify to the library in question what we want ''done'' at some future point, thereby specifying how the library will ''behave'' or ''respond''.

The exact details of how we do this and what our callbacks will look like will vary from language to language, from GUI library to GUI library and from problem area to problem area.
Registering a key-press-handling callback in a 3D game written in C++ will look ''very'' different from setting a callback to process a message-received event in a Java programming listening to an internet socket or an on-mouse-click event handler written in JavaScript on a web-site.

==An Example: Processing Numbers==

To give us something concrete to work with, let us turn to an example.
Consider a Python program that we will use to analyze an arbitrary series of numbers:

&lt;source lang=Python&gt;
def PrintIfEven(number):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    print(str(number))

def AbortIfFortyseven(number):
  if number == 47:
    gp_SignalAbort()

gp_RegisterCallback(PrintIfEven)
gp_RegisterCallback(AbortIfFortyseven)

gp_Run()
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!--
[[if-then-else|&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement]]
--&gt;

The above program assumes that 'some' library is providing the &lt;code&gt;gp_*&lt;/code&gt; functions that we are using.
Omitting the code for that library is not accidental; in the context of GUI development, you usually will be working with some existing event-generating library, and you usually will not be concerning yourself with that library's internals.

Also note that much of the work done in this program occurs &quot;out of our sight&quot;.
It might not even be completely obvious what the program is going to do when run, since we don't know under what conditions our callbacks will actually be used -- that is, we don't know when &lt;code&gt;gp_Run&lt;/code&gt; is going to run our callbacks.
This is also a feature of event-driven programming; we have to have some expectation of what kinds of events we're going to receive from the environment (and what we can do with the environment in response) in order to write our program.

Looking into what's happening here, we first define two functions, each with a single argument.
These functions both evaluate their arguments, and do something &quot;interesting&quot; depending on what values they've received.
In the first, if the &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; given as an argument is even, the function then prints that number.
In the second, if the &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; is exactly 47, the function calls the &lt;code&gt;gp_SignalAbort&lt;/code&gt; library routine; we'll come back to this function in a little bit.

We then come to the &lt;code&gt;gp_RegisterCallback&lt;/code&gt; function, which takes a single argument, which it expects to be a function.
&lt;code&gt;gp_RegisterCallback&lt;/code&gt; registers our number-processing functions with the (implicit) number-generating GP library; it tells the GP library to call the given functions every time a new number is generated.
We call &lt;code&gt;gp_RegisterCallback&lt;/code&gt; twice, once with each of the callbacks that we defined.

Depending on what languages you are familiar with, it may seem odd to pass a function name as an argument to another function.
Python supports ''functional programming'' -- that is, in Python it is possible to treat functions variables.
They can be handled just like any other variable; they can be assigned, returned from functions, passed into functions and so on.
This facility exists in some languages and not in others; for example, it exists in some sense in C, where function pointers replicate ''some'' of this functionality, but it does not exist as such in Java.
I make note of this to point out an important fact of event-driven programming, and later graphical programming: the right way to do a given thing will depend heavily on the features supported by your ''language'' or event-generating ''library''.
While the abstract ''idea'' might be the same from language to language or GUI tool-kit to tool-kit, the ''exact'' way that you define, handle or trigger your callbacks will be different in different languages.
For example, in Python you might define your callbacks as functions directly, while in Java you might define an object that overrides the some &lt;code&gt;HandleEvent&lt;/code&gt; method defined in an &lt;code&gt;EventHandler&lt;/code&gt; interface.

Returning to our example, we finally call &lt;code&gt;gp_Run()&lt;/code&gt;.
Presumably, the &lt;code&gt;gp_Run()&lt;/code&gt; function will generate an arbitrary sequence of numbers, and call every function registered with &lt;code&gt;gp_RegisterCallback&lt;/code&gt; with the each generated number as an argument.
The GP library maintains some 'state', including an &lt;code&gt;Abort&lt;/code&gt; flag.
The GP library will periodically check if that flag has been set to &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;; if it has, the &lt;code&gt;gp_Run&lt;/code&gt; function will return, thus ending the generation and evaluation of numbers.

Note that the behavior of the program when run will be determined by the callbacks that we have provided (as well as by how &lt;code&gt;gp_Run&lt;/code&gt; ''generates'' numbers, a question that we will turn to momentarily).
We determine what is done (or not done) with each number; presently, we print the even ones, but with different callbacks we might, for example, write every prime number to disk, or simply count how many numbers are generated before the program is terminated.
Similarly, we determine under what conditions the program will halt; if none of our callbacks ever called &lt;code&gt;gp_SignalAbort&lt;/code&gt;, then presumably our example would never terminate.

==Events==

In the previous example, we did not specify under what conditions &lt;code&gt;gp_Run&lt;/code&gt; will generate numbers.
We might suppose that it simply generates numbers continuously and then feeds them into our callbacks, so long as &lt;code&gt;gp_SignalAbort&lt;/code&gt; has not been called; this is in fact the implementation of &lt;code&gt;gp_Run&lt;/code&gt; that the author used to error-check the example.

&lt;!--source language=python&gt;
def gp_Run():
    while not gp_Abort:
        number = randint(0, 255)
        
        for callback in gp_Callbacks:
            callback(number)
&lt;/source--&gt;

But this is far from the only way that &lt;code&gt;gp_Run&lt;/code&gt; could be implemented.
Suppose that it instead were to monitor the keyboard; every time a key on the keyboard is pressed, &lt;code&gt;gp_Run&lt;/code&gt; could pass the character-code for that key into the callbacks that had been registered.

This would radically change the way that we would expect our program to behave.
If we assumed that our callbacks would simply receive a stream of arbitrary numbers, then, when our code is run, we might expect to see a stream of arbitrary (even) numbers generated on the console.
At some point, when the number 47 is generated, we would expect the stream to stop.

But if a number is generated and processed if and only if a key is pressed, we would expect completely different behaviour.
For one thing, we would only expect to see output generated when we press a key; our callbacks would not be called unless a key is pressed.
&lt;!--We would also only expect the program to halt if the key pressed generated a character with code-point 47 (if we're using the ASCII character-set, this would be the '/' key).--&gt;
In this alternate set-up, our program is not simply processing a stream of numbers; it is instead responding to changes that are happening in our program's environment -- that environment being the keyboard.

This is the key concept of event-driven programming: instead of running through some specified procedure until the job we wish to perform is done, our program instead watches the environment for changes, and then responds to those changes when they occur.
We call these changes ''events'', and we determine how we respond to those events by specifying the callbacks that we wish to be invoked when a given event occurs.

It is worth noting that our original Python example provides a single event, the generation of a number.
If we wanted to specify different behaviours for different ''types'' of numbers (even, odd, prime or so one) we need to determine what type of number was generated in our callbacks.
In most realistic applications, this is not the case; there will generally be many possible events that an entity in the environment could generate, each with their own distinct list of registered callbacks.
For example, in a Java SWING GUI, an image might have one set of callbacks registered for when the user ''left''-clicks the image (which we would call a left-click event), and another set of callbacks for when the user ''right''-clicks the image (which we would call a right-click event).

=Generating Events=

&lt;!--When we build a GUI, we will typically set first populate our interface with ''widgets'' - the windows, buttons and so on that make up our GUI - and then &quot;wire them together&quot; by connecting the events that they may generate with event handlers that we have defined.
We will then ask the system to start generating events and sending them into our interface.--&gt;

Having looked at the process of creating callbacks, let us take a moment to consider how the system generated and dispatches events.
Though this will generally not be our responsibility when working with GUI libraries, it is worthwhile to understand in the abstract how this process operates.

==Event Loops==

In the abstract, we will frequently set up entities in the environment, add callbacks for the events that might be generated and then ask the system to begin to process events; we can see this last step in the previous Python example when &lt;code&gt;gp_Run&lt;/code&gt; function is called.
This function represents what is often termed an ''event loop''; an event loop is a function that monitors the state of a given environment (and the entities that it contains) and dispatches events that correspond to any changes that occur.

In slightly more concrete terms, event loops are typically infinite loops.
They will maintain a copy of the environment's last state; until some predetermined stopping condition occurs, they will compare the current state of the environment to the last state that was seen.
If a change has occurred, this will be viewed as an event; if any handlers were registered for this event, those handlers will be invoked.
They will then update their state record with the state that was just encountered, and return to the head of the loop.

The result, from our point of view, is what we have seen; we set up a list of callbacks and specify the events that we wish to trigger those callbacks, and then invoke the event loop; the event loop then monitors the environment and triggers our callbacks as necessary.

==A Java Example==
As a concrete example, let us consider a Java class that watches the state of the mouse.
If the mouse moves, it will create a MouseMotionEvent that describes that motion and invoke any registered event handlers; if no motion occurs, no action will be taken.
The event-loop will not terminate unless a callback requests that it do so: in this specific case, callbacks may do this by simply returning &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
The code for this class is given below:

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
import java.util.Vector;

import java.awt.MouseInfo;
import java.awt.PointerInfo;
import java.awt.Point;


public class MouseWatcher {

    private Vector&lt;MouseMotionEventHandler&gt; EventHandlers;

    public MouseWatcher() {
        EventHandlers = new Vector&lt;MouseMotionEventHandler&gt;();
    }

    public void RegisterMouseMotionEventHandler(MouseMotionEventHandler handler) {
        EventHandlers.add(handler);
    }

    public void WatchMouse() {
        boolean AbortFlag = false;

        int lastX, lastY;

        Point p = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation();
        lastX = p.x;
        lastY = p.y;

        while (AbortFlag == false) {
            p = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation();
            int delX = p.x - lastX;
            lastX = p.x;

            int delY = p.y - lastY;
            lastY = p.y;

            if (delX != 0 || delY != 0) {
                MouseMotionEvent e = new MouseMotionEvent();
                e.HorizontalMotion = delX;
                e.VerticalMotion = delY;

                for (MouseMotionEventHandler handler: EventHandlers) {
                    boolean handlerResult = handler.HandleMouseMotionEvent(e);

                    if (handlerResult == false) {
                        AbortFlag = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return;
    }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

This example uses the following definitions for the &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionEvent&lt;/code&gt; class:
&lt;source lang=java&gt;
public class MouseMotionEvent {
    public int HorizontalMotion;
    public int VerticalMotion;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
and the &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionEventHandler&lt;/code&gt; interface:
&lt;source lang=java&gt;public interface MouseMotionEventHandler {

    public boolean HandleMouseMotionEvent(MouseMotionEvent event);

}
&lt;/source&gt;

Of primary interest is the WatchMouse function, which in this case is our event loop.
We store the last observed mouse position in &lt;code&gt;lastX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lastY&lt;/code&gt;.
Then, until we detect that a callback has requested that we terminate, we get the current position of the mouse, and compute the difference between the current position and the last position.
If a change has occurred, we construct a &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionEvent&lt;/code&gt; and invoke every registered &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionEventHandler&lt;/code&gt; with that event as an argument; if any of those handlers return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, we set the &lt;code&gt;AbortFlag&lt;/code&gt;.
We then update our record of the last mouse position with what we just fetched.

Consider how this might be used: potential client code is presented below.

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
public class MouseListeners {
    public static void main(String args[]) {

        MouseWatcher watcher = new MouseWatcher();

        watcher.RegisterMouseMotionEventHandler(new MouseMotionEventHandler() {
            public boolean HandleMouseMotionEvent(MouseMotionEvent event) {
                int distance_square = event.HorizontalMotion * event.HorizontalMotion;
                distance_square += event.VerticalMotion * event.VerticalMotion;
                double distance = Math.sqrt((double) distance_square);

                System.out.println(&quot;Distance moved:  &quot; + String.valueOf(distance));

                if (distance &gt; 20.0) {
                    System.out.println(&quot;Requesting abort!&quot;);
                    return false;
                }

                return true;
            }
        });

        watcher.WatchMouse();

        return;
    }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, we declare an anonymous class that implements the &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionEventHandler&lt;/code&gt; interface.
The &lt;code&gt;HandleMouseMotionEvent&lt;/code&gt; function that we have provided here computes the distance that the mouse has moved; if the mouse has moved more than 20 unites (which, though unspecified, we may reasonably assume are pixels), the handler requests that event processing terminates.
The distance moved is printed in either case.
When run, this generates output similar to the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
Distance moved:  1.4142135623730951
Distance moved:  1.4142135623730951
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.0
Distance moved:  1.4142135623730951
Distance moved:  2.8284271247461903
Distance moved:  2.23606797749979
Distance moved:  3.0
Distance moved:  2.23606797749979
Distance moved:  4.47213595499958
Distance moved:  12.041594578792296
Distance moved:  11.180339887498949
Distance moved:  25.0
Requesting abort!
&lt;/pre&gt;

There is a subtlety here; notice that the output that we see depends on how quickly our event-handlers run.
If our handlers run quickly, we will likely see vary small changes reported; if the mouse is moved at a constant rate, quicker callbacks means a shorter span of time will pass between checks by the event-loop.
However, if one of our callbacks took a very long time to run, then this would mean that it will be a very long time before the event-loop checks the state of the mouse again.
This might mean that a very large change in position is reported; it might also mean that some mouse motion is missed entirely.
If for example the mouse was moved some distance to the right and then moved ''back'' some distance to the left during the span of time in which the long callback was running, then the mouse motion will be reported as less than it actually was, since we only know the last position we saw the mouse and the current position where we see the mouse.

This suggests what is actually a very general principle; your callbacks should be ''fast''.
What exactly &quot;fast&quot; means we shall not precisely define; as a bound, for GUI programming, any callback whose execution time a human could perceive is a callback that is far too slow.
The faster your callbacks are, the more responsive your program will be; the slower your callbacks are, the more your interfaces will stutter.

The student may wonder how exactly one is to handle a long-running process, such as fetching a resource from the internet.
The short answer is that we do this outside of a callback; we mark the interface such that the user knows that a long-running job is being performed, we start the job perhaps on another thread, and we return to event-processing on the main thread.
Part of our event-processing may be to check the status of the long-running job, so that we can update the interface with that jobs current state.
Having said this, handling long-running jobs is a more involved topic that we shall return to later.</text>

[[Cascading Style Sheets/Dedication]] should be deleted. Wikibooks are not dedicated, and certainly not by a single editor who contributed almost nothing to the book. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 21:41, 14 February 2013 (UTC)
: He actually made 38 edits to that book.  Nevertheless, I agree with the sentiment that he shouldn't have added a dedication page.--[[User:Abramsky|Abramsky]] ([[User talk:Abramsky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abramsky|contribs]]) 13:08, 15 February 2013 (UTC)
:: Do we have any policies about dedications?  Seems like a nice idea to me and helps personalise books a little.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:05, 20 February 2013 (UTC)
:::No policy as far as I can tell. I've no problem with dedications ''per se'' but it would have to be by consensus of the book authors or at least somehow relevant. This dedication seems irrelevant to the content and not added by consensus of the authors &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 10:01, 21 February 2013 (UTC)
::::That makes sense.  The other issue is that since this is a wiki, what's to stop any other editor changing the dedication to refer to someone else?--[[User:Abramsky|Abramsky]] ([[User talk:Abramsky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abramsky|contribs]]) 12:31, 21 February 2013 (UTC)
:::::I agree that a dedication is not prohibited but editors must understand that they are also no protected, as you state any other editor may make changes and any reproduction of the work outside of the project may simply discard it, removing any usefulness from creation one so in general should be avoided as they simply may degenerate in points of contention.  
:::::Some type of enforcement or protection may be granted to the page using a Book convention that establishes by consensus (as QuiteUnusual indicates) establishes special considerations or requirements for changes, but ultimately there will not way to protect the content outside of the project.
:::::Due to its ineffectiveness I wouldn't oppose making it clear in a proper guide/policy (this discussion should be resumed on Reading room after it closes). It can also be something to add to the manual of style.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:26, 4 July 2013 (UTC)   
* '''Delete''' in boldface, to make it clear I am serious about the nomination. Why don't you just delete a dedication made by an editor who contributed no substance to a book he has dedicated? How can making such a dedication ever be considered reasonable or acceptable, just for a second? You don't need a policy for that. If you agree with me, please post boldfaced delete so we can delete the thing. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 17:21, 13 July 2013 (UTC)
::Don't know if the &quot;you&quot; is directed to me but will extend my view on the issue to why I did not express agreement with this particular deletion.
::The first issue I have is with global community exerting control on generalized issues regarding specific works and failing to rule permanently those issues. This of course leads to people feeling to be target for special treatment and can lead to injustice, as it enables the active vocal/participatory minority to be able to make radically different decision in similar situations. Then there is the waste of time in repeating the same discussions over and over again especially if those participating are not aware of past discussions, have forgotten past argumentation or have no interest in having them revisited because they do not support their view.
::The other point is that I feel that project specific editorial disputes should be resolved inside the project that has them first, only failing to get a consensus there should the general community be involved. I'm generally opposed (will not support) RDFs of pages in works that do not violate general policy/guidelines and to a lesser degree established common practice.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:57, 14 July 2013 (UTC) 
* [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Delete''' The user's contribution to the book appears to have been infrastructure, but a dedication without consultation does seem a somewhat high-handed gesture.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:57, 13 July 2013 (UTC)

* {{del}}&lt;s&gt;{{keep}}&lt;/s&gt; Actually seems pretty clear to me, albeit as yet unused. Basically, there are a lot of functions that you will be calling, and this is intended to be a central collection page to allow you to refer back to a function definition if you need to, without breaking up the text for those that don't.

*: These are ''selected'' functions. But selected how? Furthermore, there is already [[Visual_Basic/VB6_Command_Reference]] that seems to serve as a function reference. The stub only hosts &quot;StrConv&quot; as a heading without any content, while [[Visual_Basic/VB6_Command_Reference]] already has 28 functions, including [[VB6_Command_Reference#StrConv]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 19:10, 7 September 2012 (UTC)

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

''The goal of this lab is to demonstrate Oracle Clusterware’s fencing ability by forcing a configuration that will trigger Oracle Clusterware’s built-in fencing features. With Oracle Clusterware, fencing is handled at the node level by rebooting the non-responsive or failed node. This is similar to the as Shoot The Other Machine In The Head (STOMITH) algorithm, but it’s really a suicide instead of affecting the other machine. There are many good sources for more information online. 
----
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Start with a normal, running cluster with the database instances up and running.&lt;/big&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Monitor the logfiles for clusterware on each node. On each node, start a new window and run the following command:&lt;/big&gt;

 [oracle@&lt;node_name&gt; ~]$ '''tail –f /u01/app/12.1.0/grid/log/`hostname -s`/crsd/crsd.log'''
 
 [oracle@&lt;node_name&gt; ~]$ '''tail –f /u01/app/12.1.0/grid/log/`hostname -s`/cssd/ocssd.log'''


&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;We will simulate “unplugging” the network interface by taking one of the private network interfaces down. On the collabn2 node, take the private network interface down by running the following command (as the root user):&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 [root@collabn2 ~]# '''ifconfig eth1 down'''



&lt;big&gt;Alternatively, you can also simulate this by physically taking the '''Internal Network''' interface offline in VirtualBox:&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Go to collabn2 -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network -&gt; Adapter 2, uncheck '''Cable connected''' and click '''OK'''.&lt;big&gt;

[[File:RA-Virtualbox_4216-Cable Disconnect.PNG|RA-Virtualbox_4216-Cable Disconnect]]



&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Following this command, watch the logfiles you began monitoring in step 2 above. You should see errors in those logfiles and eventually (could take a minute or two, literally) you will observe one node reboot itself.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;big&gt;If you used '''ifconfig''' to trigger a failure, then the node will rejoin the cluster and the instance should start automatically.&lt;/big&gt;  

&lt;big&gt;If you used '''VirtualBox''' to trigger a failure then the node will not rejoin the cluster.&lt;/big&gt;

*&lt;big&gt;Which file has the error messages that indicate why the node is not rejoining the cluster?&lt;/big&gt;
*&lt;big&gt;Is the node that reboots always the same as the node with the failure? Why or why not?&lt;/big&gt;

''The goal of this lab is to demonstrate Oracle Fast Application Notification (FAN) Callouts. In versions prior to 11g, these were also known as Oracle Clusterware Callouts.''

''This feature is a relatively little-known capability for Oracle Clusterware to fire a script (or a whole directory full of them) to perform whatever tasks you may want performed when a cluster-wide event happens.''

''For more information, consult the documentation here: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/rac.121/e17887/hafeats.htm#BABHAJAH''

''For this exercise, we’ll configure some FAN callout scripts on each node and then trigger various cluster events to see how each one triggers the callout script.''
----
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Start with a normal, running cluster with both nodes up and running.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;From a shell prompt (logged in as oracle) on each server, navigate to '''/u01/app/12.1.0/grid/racg/usrco'''. Create file there called '''callout1.sh''' using vi (or your favorite editor). The contents of the file should be this:&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 #!/bin/ksh
 umask 022
 FAN_LOGFILE=/tmp/`hostname`_uptime.log
 echo $* &quot;reported=&quot;`date` &gt;&gt; $FAN_LOGFILE &amp;
  
{{Warning|Note the use of backticks around the hostname and date commands.}}

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Make sure that the permissions on the file are set to 755 using the following command:&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 [oracle@&lt;node_name&gt; ~]$ '''chmod 755 /u01/app/12.1.0/grid/racg/usrco/callout1.sh'''

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Monitor the logfiles for clusterware on each node. On each node, start a new window and run the following command:&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 [oracle@&lt;node_name&gt; ~]$ '''tail -f /u01/app/12.1.0/grid/log/`hostname -s`/crsd/crsd.log'''

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Next, we need to trigger an event that will cause the callout to fire. One such event is node shutdown.  Shutdown the clusterware on node '''collabn2'''.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 [root@collabn2 ~]# '''crsctl stop crs'''
 CRS-2791: Starting shutdown of Oracle High Availability Services-managed resources on 'collabn2'
 CRS-2673: Attempting to stop 'ora.crsd' on 'collabn2'
 CRS-2790: Starting shutdown of Cluster Ready Services-managed resources on 'colleabn2'
 CRS-2673: Attempting to stop 'ora.rac.db' on 'collabn2'
 CRS-2673: Attempting to stop 'ora.DATA.SHARED.advm' on 'collabn2'
 CRS-2673: Attempting to stop 'ora.LISTENER.lsnr' on 'collabn2'
 ...
 CRS-2793: Shutdown of Oracle High Availability Services-managed resources on 'collabn2' has completed
 CRS-4133: Oracle High Availability Services has been stopped.

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Following this command, watch the logfiles you began monitoring in step 2 above. Because we set long timeouts on our test cluster, you might have to wait for a few minutes before you see anything.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

*&lt;big&gt;You should eventually observe entries noting that the node has failed and shortly following that, you should observe an entry placed in the /tmp/&lt;hostname&gt;_uptime.log file indicating that the node is down.&lt;/big&gt;
*&lt;big&gt;Note which members run the clusterware callout script. (A surviving member could run commands to notify clients and/or application servers that one of the cluster nodes has died.)&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;big&gt;You should see these messages in the /tmp/*.log files:&lt;/big&gt;

{{Info|One popular use for clusterware callouts is to notify administrators (possibly via email) that a cluster event has occurred. You may use the arguments to the script (you’ll see the arguments in the logfile we’ve created) to conditionally perform notification as well. For example, you may not want to notify anyone unless a node crashes unexpectedly. By testing some of these arguments, you may be able to send notifications only when desired.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In chapter 6.1.1 Programming languages (on this page) i read &quot;See Status of AROS implementation for more on this&quot;, with a link to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/Docs#Status_of_AROS_implementation.

Unfortunately that page does not contain the section 'Status_of_AROS_implementation'. I was unable to find this section on another page so quickly. I suggest removing that link or pointing it to the correct location.

Since i'm fairly new to this game, i didn't want to remove the link without discussing it first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Picking Your Environment==

A complication in covering GUI programming is that there are a great many possible environment in which we might be working.
We must select at least one concrete programming language and at least one library to provide us with graphical capabilities.
There are, fortunately or unfortunately, a great many pairs of languages and libraries that we could choose between.

Unlike many courses, the aim here is to cover common concepts in a generalized and abstract way - the aim is 'not' to learn, say, GUI programming in Java SWING, but to learn the abstract and general concepts of GUI programming that will be consistent across all possible platforms.
To that end, the student or reader is invited to select their own language and GUI toolkit; since this early choice may have great consequences for how the student interacts with the course, we will here provide some guidance.
We do this both so that the reader will be aware of the options that are available, and so the student can make a wise selection from among them.

===What Matters in a Language===

What facilities are important in a particular programming language?
For our purposes, two spring immediately to mind: ''1)'' some capability for functional programming and ''b)'' some capability for object-oriented programming.

At least while we are starting out, functional programming is a very natural way to describe a callback; however, many modern GUI toolkits do not use functional programming as the primary metaphore for registering event handlers.
Instead, most modern graphical libraries treat graphical entities as 'classes', and use overridden methods as the primary system for specifying and providing callbacks.
This is a fairly efficient and natural way to work with graphical elements.

It is, of course, not essential: C does not support object-oriented programming, and yet Gtk - which is written natively in C - is a perfectly usable GUI development library.
Perfectly usable, but somewhat awkward; Gtk must provide through macros and explicit functions many of the facilities that APIs developed in object-oriented languages get for free, which can make Gtk programs much more verbose (and much more repetitive) than equivalent programs written in other languages.
This means that the student who selects a language such as C will have a much harder time than is required.

===What Matters in a Library===

Most libraries will support at least the basic set of interface components - widgets, as we will later name them - that we shall cover, so this need not be a concern.
How exactly callbacks are described will vary greatly from library to library, and will of course also depend on the underlying language in use.

Likely one of the largest differences that will distinguish one GUI toolkit from another, apart from those dictated by the underlying language, will be the platforms on which it runs (or perhaps the platform on which it is most native).
For example, if one wished to develop applications that would &quot;behave well&quot; on Windows and has little concern for other platforms, one would be best advised to select Microsoft's GUI development tools; if one wished to develop portable programs that would run on a variety of platforms, one would be well advised to select Qt or Java.

Another issue of particular import to the student is ''pricing''.
Fortunately, most GUI toolkits in common use are available for free - including, for example, Microsoft's free Visual Studio Express or Google's free tools Android Development Tools.
Therefore, price need not necessarily be a concern.

A final point of particular interest is support for visual GUI design tools.
Many modern GUI toolkits allow the user to develop GUIs visually - by dragging interface elements around in a visual representation of how their design will appear, as opposed to manipulating the code that will generate their interface.
This is a valuable facility that will save the developer much time and anguish.
Most modern GUI toolkits include such a facility; unfortunately, many older toolkits do not.
The availability of visual design tools is a point that the student may wish to carefully consider.

==A List of GUI Libraries==

The above having been said, let us consider what libraries exist, and what features may recommend them (or discourage their use).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Wikis,
born 1942, after study electronic engineering I was busy for passive components in the industry since 1968. My special interest are capacitors. Retired some years ago I am now trying to bring my knowledge into Wiki articles. The reason and my motivation:

'''Capacitors are a good example of the fact that even the simplest device can become complicated given 250 years of evolution.''' ''(Citation J. Ho, T. R. Jow, St. Boggs, Historical Introduction to Capacitor Technology)''
 
Some articles in the German Wiki I was involved: 
* Elektrolytkondensator 
* Aluminium-Elektrolytkondensator 
* Tantal-Elektrolytkondensator 
*Niob-Elektrolytkondensator
*Kunststoff-Folienkondensator   
* Entstörkondensator   
* Keramikkondensator 
* Variabler Kondensator  
*Superkondensator
* Lithium-Ionen-Kondensator
* Leistungskondensator 
*Nanokondensator 
*Capacitor plague  
*Dielektrische Absorption

With a lot of help for correct English from friendly and helpful colleagues I was involved in the followig English articles 
*Capacitor plague
*Dielectric absorption
*Film capacitor
*Types of capacitor
*Ceramic capacitor
*Supercapacitor 

Next challenges:

*Electrolytic capacitor
*Aluminium electrolytic capacitor
*Tantalum capacitor
*Tantalum electrolytic capacitor
*Niobium electrolytic capacitor
*RFI/EMI capacitor
*Variable capacitor

''In order to test failover it would be best to connect from a client outside the cluster, so we'll start by downloading and installing Oracle's Basic Instant Client (English-only) and the Instant Client SQLPlus package. Then we'll configure the DNS resolution and the local TNS naming to use the SCAN addresses.''

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;Login to '''collabn1''' as the '''oracle''' user.  Create a new service '''svctest''' with RAC1 as a preferred instance and RAC2 as an available instance.  This means that it will normally run on the RAC1 instance but will failover to the RAC2 instance if RAC1 becomes unavailable.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;big&gt;If you haven't created a container database, omit the -pdb parameter.&lt;/big&gt;

 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl add service -d RAC -pdb PDB -s svctest -r RAC1 -a RAC2 -P BASIC'''
 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl start service -d RAC -s svctest'''

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Examine where the service is running by checking '''lsnrctl''' on both nodes and looking at the '''SERVICE_NAMES''' init parameter on both nodes.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl status service -d RAC -s svctest'''
 Service svctest is running on instance(s) RAC1
 
 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''lsnrctl services'''

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Wait a few moments and then repeat step 2.  What has happened?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl status service -d RAC -s svctest'''

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Restart the instance that you killed.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

{{Info|This does not initiate any instance recovery at all.  Do you know why?}}

 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl status database -d RAC'''
 Instance RAC1 is not running on node collabn1
 Instance RAC2 is running on node collabn2
 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl start instance -d RAC -i RAC1'''
 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl status database -d RAC'''
 Instance RAC1 is running on node collabn1
 Instance RAC2 is running on node collabn2
 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Repeat step 2.  Where is the service running now?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl status service -d RAC -s svctest'''

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Manually failover the service.  Confirm where it is now running.  Note that this does not disconnect any current sessions&lt;/big&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl relocate service -d RAC -s svctest -i RAC2 -t RAC1'''
 collabn1:/home/oracle[RAC1]$ '''srvctl status service -d RAC -s svctest'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter introduces the cui2d framework, which is used (and explained in detail) in the following chapters. cui2d is a light-weight collection of JavaScript functions that supports the creation of user interfaces with the canvas 2D context. Thus, instead of starting from scratch in every chapter and introducing GUI elements one by one, a framework is presented that includes these GUI elements. There are a couple of advantages to this approach:
* You can get started and apply the GUI elements without having to work through the details of their implementation.
* All GUI elements that are discussed in this wikibook are available by including one script file ([http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/cui2d.js &lt;code&gt;cui2d.js&lt;/code&gt;]) and they (are supposed to) work together without problems.
* Automatically generated (by JSDoc3) reference documentation of cui2d is available [http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/cui2d_doc/ online]. 
* It is easier to understand the implementation of individual GUI elements by seeing the big picture of how they work together. In fact, some of the aspects of the implementation just don't make sense without this big picture.
Next, the framework is introduced with the help of an example.

===A “Hello, World!” Example===
The example of this chapter just shows a page with the text “Hello, World!” using cui2d. It is also available [http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/helloworld/helloworld.html online] and should work fine on desktop and mobile web browsers. The parts for downloading the web app to a mobile device are missing but a version that includes them is available [http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/helloworld/ihelloworld.html online]. (See the chapter on [[Canvas_2D_Web_Apps/iOS_Web_Apps|iOS web apps]] for a discussion of these parts.) 

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; 
      content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no&quot;&gt;

    &lt;script src=&quot;cui2d.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;script&gt;
      function init() {
        // set defaults for all pages
        cuiBackgroundFillStyle = &quot;#A06000&quot;; 
        cuiDefaultFont = &quot;bold 40px Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;; 
        cuiDefaultFillStyle = &quot;#402000&quot;;

        // initialize cui2d and start with myPage
        cuiInit(myPage);
      }

      // create a new page of size 400x300 and attach myPageProcess
      var myPage = new cuiPage(400, 300, myPageProcess);

      // a function to repaint the canvas and return false (if null == event) 
      // or to process user events (if null != event) and return true
      // if the event has been processed
      function myPageProcess(event) {
        if (null == event) { // repaint this page
          cuiContext.fillText(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;, 200, 150);
          cuiContext.fillStyle = &quot;#E0FFE0&quot;; // set page color
          cuiContext.fillRect(0, 0, this.width, this.height);
        }
        return false; // event has not been processed 
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
 
  &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#000000&quot; onload=&quot;init()&quot; 
    style=&quot;-webkit-user-drag:none; -webkit-user-select:none; &quot;&gt;
    &lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;A canvas element cannot be displayed.&lt;/font&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Discussion===
The first few lines just start the HTML file. The line
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; 
      content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
was included to avoid complications with scaling the content on mobile devices. In fact, the page in this example is not only scalable but can also be rotated and dragged around with two-finger gestures. (With a mouse, the page can only be dragged. Sorry.) However, all these transformations are controlled by the web app instead of the operating system.

The line 
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;cui2d.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
includes the file [http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/cui2d.js &lt;code&gt;cui2d.js&lt;/code&gt;]; thus, that file should be in the same directory as the HTML page such that the web browser can find it.

The function &lt;code&gt;init()&lt;/code&gt; is specified in the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tag at the end of the HTML page and will be called after the page has been loaded.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    ...
    &lt;script&gt;
      function init() {
        // set defaults for all pages
        cuiBackgroundFillStyle = &quot;#A06000&quot;; 
        cuiDefaultFont = &quot;bold 40px Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;; 
        cuiDefaultFillStyle = &quot;#402000&quot;;

        // initialize cui2d and start with myPage
        cuiInit(myPage);
      }
      ...
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;init()&lt;/code&gt; first sets some default options, which are applied by the cui2d framework before any page is repainted. This makes it possible to change these options for all pages in a single place. After that, it uses the call &lt;code&gt;cuiInit(myPage);&lt;/code&gt; to initialize the cui2d framework and start with displaying &lt;code&gt;myPage&lt;/code&gt; which is defined next:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      ...
      // create a new page of size 400x300 and attach myPageProcess
      var myPage = new cuiPage(400, 300, myPageProcess);
      ...
&lt;/source&gt;

This defines a global variable &lt;code&gt;myPage&lt;/code&gt; and creates a new &lt;code&gt;cuiPage&lt;/code&gt; object of width 400 pixels and height 300 pixels. The coordinate system for this page has its origin (0,0) in the top, left corner, is 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels high. The content and the behavior of the page is defined by the function &lt;code&gt;myPageProcess()&lt;/code&gt;, which is specified as third argument in the constructor of the &lt;code&gt;cuiPage&lt;/code&gt; object and is defined next:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      ...
      // a function to repaint the canvas and return false (if null == event) 
      // or to process user events (if null != event) and return true
      // if the event has been processed
      function myPageProcess(event) {
        if (null == event) { // repaint this page
          cuiContext.fillText(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;, 200, 150);
          cuiContext.fillStyle = &quot;#E0FFE0&quot;; // set page color
          cuiContext.fillRect(0, 0, this.width, this.height);
        }
        return false; // event has not been processed 
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Every GUI component in cui2d has a single “process” function, which repaints the GUI component (or the whole canvas in the case of a page) if the argument &lt;code&gt;event&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise (if &lt;code&gt;event&lt;/code&gt; is not &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;), it tries to process the user event. Thus, each process function has two tasks. Even &lt;code&gt;myPageProcess&lt;/code&gt; in this example performs both tasks; however, for user events it only returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, which means that the user event has not been processed. In this example, these events allow the page to be dragged with a mouse or transformed in multiple ways with two-finger gestures. If you change the code to return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; then it is assumed that the process function has “consumed” these events and, thus, the page cannot be transformed in any way (except by changing the orientation of a mobile device).

In the case that no event has been specified, the function just writes some text at the center of the page, sets a new fill color and fills the whole page. Note that we render from front to back, which is the standard in cui2d. Also note that “&lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;” refers to the &lt;code&gt;cuiPage&lt;/code&gt; object; thus, &lt;code&gt;this.width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;this.height&lt;/code&gt; are just the width and height of &lt;code&gt;myPage&lt;/code&gt;.

Lastly, the HTML code defines the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tag with a message in case the canvas is not displayed for some reason; for example, if the web browser does not support the canvas element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
  ...
  &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#000000&quot; onload=&quot;init()&quot; 
    style=&quot;-webkit-user-drag:none; -webkit-user-select:none; &quot;&gt;
    &lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;A canvas element cannot be displayed.&lt;/font&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;init()&lt;/code&gt; is specified as the handler of the &lt;code&gt;onload&lt;/code&gt; event; thus, it is called when the page is loaded. The background color is set to black. This background color is sometimes visible when the window of a desktop browser is being resized and during the animation of an orientation change of a mobile device. The WebKit &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attributes help to avoid any default user interaction with the HTML page.

The code is rather long for a hello-world example. This is partly due to the fact that it supports multiple platforms, partly due to the definition of customized colors, and partly due to the structure of the cui2d framework, which requires a &lt;code&gt;cuiPage&lt;/code&gt; object in order to display anything. The next section discusses how the cui2d framework actually works internally.

===Implementation of the Render Loop===
This section discusses how the cui2d framework renders dynamic graphics, i.e. interactively manipulated graphics and animations. This is particularly useful if you want to modify or extend the framework, or if you want to implement your own framework.

The code in [http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/cui2d.js &lt;code&gt;cui2d.js&lt;/code&gt;] starts with many global variables. Most of them will only make sense once you see how they are used. They are included here just for completeness:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
/**
 * @file cui2d.js is a light-weight collection of JavaScript functions for creating 
 * graphical user interfaces in an HTML5 canvas 2d context.
 * @version 0.30814
 * @license public domain 
 * @author Martin Kraus &lt;martin@create.aau.dk&gt;
 */

/** The canvas element. Set by cuiInit(). */
var cuiCanvas;

/** The 2d context of the canvas element. Set by cuiInit(). */
var cuiContext;

/** Boolean flag for requesting a repaint of the canvas. Cleared only by cuiProcess(). */
var cuiCanvasNeedsRepaint;

/** 
 * Currently displayed page. 
 * @type {cuiPage}
 */
var cuiCurrentPage;

/** Time (in milliseconds after January 1, 1970) when events are no longer ignored. */
var cuiIgnoringEventsEnd; 

/** Minimum time between frames in milliseconds. */
var cuiAnimationStep = 15; 

/** Time (in milliseconds after January 1, 1970) when the last animation should stop. */
var cuiAnimationsEnd; 

/** Boolean flag indicating whether any animation is playing. Set by cuiPlayTransition(). */
var cuiAnimationsArePlaying; 

/** 
 * The animation for all transition effects.
 * @type {cuiAnimation}
 */
var cuiAnimationForTransitions;  

/**
 * The page for all transition effects.
 * @type {cuiPage}
 */
var cuiPageForTransitions; 

/** Background color. */
var cuiBackgroundFillStyle = &quot;#000000&quot;;

/** Default font. */
var cuiDefaultFont = &quot;bold 20px Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;;

/** Default horizontal text alignment. */
var cuiDefaultTextAlign = &quot;center&quot;;

/** Default vertical text alignment. */
var cuiDefaultTextBaseline = &quot;middle&quot;;

/** Default fill style (e.g. for text). */
var cuiDefaultFillStyle = &quot;#000000&quot;;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

These global variables are followed by the definition of the functions &lt;code&gt;cuiInit()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cuiResize()&lt;/code&gt;, some more user event handlers (which are discussed in a later chapter), &lt;code&gt;cuiRepaint()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;cuiProcess()&lt;/code&gt;. Before reading the code, you should understand how they work together. Consider the following diagram:


{|cellpadding=&quot;5px&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; vertical-align:center;&quot;
|-
|colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;width:30%; background:#e0e0d0;&quot;|'''cuiInit(startPage)'''
|style=&quot;width:1%; font-size:200%;&quot; |→
|style=&quot;width:69%; text-align:left;&quot;|calls '''cuiRepaint()''' 
|-
|style=&quot;width:14%;&quot;|
|style=&quot;width:1%; text-align:right; padding:5px 0 5px 0; font-size:200%;&quot; |↓
|colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;width:85%; text-align:left;&quot;|calls
|-
|colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;width:30%; background:#e0e0d0;&quot;|'''cuiRenderLoop()'''
|style=&quot;width:1%;font-size:200%;&quot; |→
|style=&quot;width:69%; text-align:left;&quot;|calls itself in an infinite loop
|-
|style=&quot;width:14%;&quot;|
|style=&quot;width:1%; text-align:right; padding:5px 0 5px 0; font-size:200%;&quot; |↓
|colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;width:85%; text-align:left; &quot;|calls (if repainting requested with '''cuiRepaint()''')
|-
|colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;width:30%; background:#e0e0d0;&quot;|'''cuiProcess(null)'''
|style=&quot;width:1%;font-size:200%;&quot; |
|style=&quot;width:69%; text-align:left;&quot;|
|-
|style=&quot;width:14%;&quot;|
|style=&quot;width:1%; text-align:right; padding:5px 0 5px 0; font-size:200%;&quot; |↓
|colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;width:85%; text-align:left; &quot;|calls 
|-
|colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;width:30%; background:#e0e0d0;&quot;|'''cuiCurrentPage.process(null)'''
|style=&quot;width:1%;font-size:200%; &quot; |→
|style=&quot;width:69%; text-align:left;&quot;|calls '''process()''' for all elements on the page
|}


As illustrated, the call &lt;code&gt;cuiInit(myPage)&lt;/code&gt; in the example starts a chain reaction that in the end calls &lt;code&gt;cuiCurrentPage.process(null)&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. &lt;code&gt;myPage.process(null)&lt;/code&gt; in our example, which is nothing but &lt;code&gt;myPageProcess(null)&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. the process function that we have defined for our page. Furthermore, &lt;code&gt;cuiRenderLoop()&lt;/code&gt; calls itself in an infinite loop such that it keeps calling &lt;code&gt;myPageProcess(null)&lt;/code&gt; to repaint our page whenever necessary (for example, when the user has dragged the page). In technical terms, repainting is “necessary” whenever &lt;code&gt;cuiRepaint()&lt;/code&gt; has been called since the last repaint. The diagram also includes &lt;code&gt;cuiProcess()&lt;/code&gt;, which is responsible for the correct geometric transformation of the current page (and for the processing of events for which the process function of the page returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;).

The definition of &lt;code&gt;cuiInit()&lt;/code&gt; mainly adds a canvas element to the body of the HTML page, adds event listeners (which will be discussed later), and then initializes global variables for various parts of the cui2d framework. In the last two lines, it calls &lt;code&gt;cuiRepaint()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cuiRenderLoop()&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
...
/** 
 * Initializes cui2d.
 * @param {cuiPage} startPage - The page to display first.
 */
function cuiInit(startPage) { 
  cuiCanvas = document.createElement(&quot;canvas&quot;);
  cuiCanvas.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
  cuiCanvas.style.top = 0;
  cuiCanvas.style.left = 0;
  document.body.appendChild(cuiCanvas);

  window.addEventListener(&quot;resize&quot;, cuiResize);
  document.body.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, cuiIgnoreEvent);
  document.body.addEventListener(&quot;mousedown&quot;, cuiMouse);
  document.body.addEventListener(&quot;mouseup&quot;, cuiMouse);
  document.body.addEventListener(&quot;mousemove&quot;, cuiMouse);
  document.body.addEventListener(&quot;touchstart&quot;, cuiTouch);
  document.body.addEventListener(&quot;touchmove&quot;, cuiTouch);
  document.body.addEventListener(&quot;touchcancel&quot;, cuiTouch);
  document.body.addEventListener(&quot;touchend&quot;, cuiTouch);

  // initialize globals
  cuiContext = cuiCanvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);
  cuiCurrentPage = startPage;
  cuiIgnoringEventsEnd = 0;
  cuiAnimationsEnd = 0;
  cuiAnimationsArePlaying = false;
  if (undefined == cuiAnimationStep || 0 &gt;= cuiAnimationStep) {
    animationStep = 15;
  }

  // initialize transitions
  cuiAnimationForTransitions = new cuiAnimation();
  cuiAnimationForTransitions.previousCanvas = null;
  cuiAnimationForTransitions.nextCanvas = null;
  cuiAnimationForTransitions.nextPage = &quot;&quot;;
  cuiAnimationForTransitions.isPreviousOverNext = false;
  cuiAnimationForTransitions.isFrontMaskAnimated = false;
  cuiPageForTransitions = new cuiPage();
  cuiPageForTransitions.process = function(event) {
    if (null == event) {
      cuiDrawTransition();
    }
  }
  cuiRepaint();
  cuiRenderLoop();
}   
...
&lt;/source&gt;

The only event handler that we mention here is &lt;code&gt;cuiResize()&lt;/code&gt; because it is extremely simple:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
...
/** Resize handler. */
function cuiResize() {
  cuiRepaint();
}
...
&lt;/source&gt;

I.e., it just calls &lt;code&gt;cuiRepaint()&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
...
/** Request to repaint the canvas (usually because some state change requires it). */
function cuiRepaint() {
  cuiCanvasNeedsRepaint = true; // is checked by cuiRenderLoop() and cleared by cuiProcess(null)
}
...
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;cuiRepaint()&lt;/code&gt; just sets the global variable &lt;code&gt;cuiCanvasNeedsRepaint&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. This variable is checked by &lt;code&gt;cuiRenderLoop()&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
...
/** Render loop of cui2d, which calls cuiProcess(null) if needed. */
function cuiRenderLoop() {
  var now = (new Date()).getTime();
  if (cuiAnimationsEnd &lt; now ) { // all animations over?
    if (cuiAnimationsArePlaying) {  
      cuiRepaint();
      // repaint one more time since the rendering might differ
      // after the animations have stopped
    }
    cuiAnimationsArePlaying = false; 
  }
  else {
    cuiAnimationsArePlaying = true;
  }

  if (cuiCanvasNeedsRepaint || cuiAnimationsArePlaying) {
    cuiProcess(null);
  }
  window.setTimeout(&quot;cuiRenderLoop()&quot;, cuiAnimationStep); // call myself again
    // using setTimeout allows to easily change cuiAnimationStep dynamically
}
...
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;cuiRenderLoop()&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;cuiProcess(null)&lt;/code&gt; to repaint the current page if &lt;code&gt;cuiCanvasNeedsRepaint&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; (and also if &lt;code&gt;cuiAnimationsArePlaying&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; but that is another story). 

In the last line, &lt;code&gt;cuiRenderLoop()&lt;code&gt; calls itself (after a time specified by &lt;code&gt;cuiAnimationStep&lt;/code&gt;) by using the HTML5 function &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;. Since it always calls itself again, it continues in an endless loop until the web app is closed.

The next function is &lt;code&gt;cuiProcess()&lt;/code&gt;. However, this function makes heavy use of draggable objects, which will be discussed later. Thus, the discussion of &lt;code&gt;cuiProcess&lt;/code&gt; has to wait until then.

===Benefits of a Render Loop===
A render loop might appear to be a complicated way to do such a simple thing as calling a render function (i.e. the process function with argument &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; in cui2d). However, there are good reasons for a render loop:
* The render function should not be called for every user event since there can be too many user events; for example, a new event for every movement of the mouse.
* In animations, the render function should be called regularly (e.g., 60 frames per second) without any event triggering the rendering.
A render loop solves these problems by calling the render function as often as necessary but not more often.

In HTML5, changes of the orientation and acceleration of a device can be monitored with the help of &lt;code&gt;deviceorientation&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;devicemotion&lt;/code&gt; events. W3C has published the [http://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/ DeviceOrientation Event Specification]. In the Mozialla Developer Network, see the event reference for [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/deviceorientation deviceorientation] and [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/devicemotion devicemotion]. Apple developers should consult the [https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/SafariDOMAdditions/Reference/DeviceOrientationEventClassRef/DeviceOrientationEvent/DeviceOrientationEvent.html DeviceOrientationEvent] and the [https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/SafariDOMAdditions/Reference/DeviceMotionEventClassRef/DeviceMotionEvent/DeviceMotionEvent.html DeviceMotionEvent] class reference in Apple's Safari Developer Library.

      <comment>Added basic info about links and syntax for using ln</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Links =
There are times when it may be helpful to have two different names that refer to the same file.  For example, a file may have a very long name that cannot be changed because it is needed for identification purposes.  For ease of use, you could also refer to the file using a shorter name.  These different references to the same file are called links, and there are two different kinds of links: hard links and soft links.

== Hard Links ==
A hard link is a name that directly references a file on the file system. Most filenames are hard links: they refer to a file system location on a storage medium.  More than one filename can refer to that file system location.  If file1 and file2 are both hard links that refer to a file that contains text, any editing saved in file1 will show up when you look at file2.  Hard links are independent, so if you remove file1, file2 still refers to the file on the filesystem.

== Soft Links ==
A soft link (also called a Symbolic link) is a name that references a filename (not a file).  If file1 is the name of a file in your home directory (a hard link to the file on the file system) and file2 is a soft link, it refers not to the file on the file system, but to file1.  Anything saved in file1 will still show up in file2, but if file1 is removed, file2 will no longer refer to a valid filename.

== ln (link) ==
The Unix command to create links is ''ln''.  By default, the ''ln'' command creates hard links.  The option ''-s'' tells the command to create a soft link instead.

Let's create a file and then create a hard link and a soft link.   

&lt;pre&gt;

This book is intended to get you started on your journey to building a Hackintosh rig. However, due to the scope of this topic, we are unable to cover each and every possible Hackintosh build; there are literally hundreds of thousands of possibilities. Therefore, you may find the links in the Resources section of this book when you become more experienced in the topic.

While I attempt to inform you and all other readers about the legality of installing Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware in a Hackintosh setup, I am not responsible nor held liable for any sort of monetary, emotional, etc. loss that you may suffer as a result of you following this book or your attempt to follow this book. In addition, I am not liable for any criminal or civil charges incurred against anyone or party as a result of reading, following, or attempting to follow this book. The information in this book can be publicly searched and located on the Internet through a search engine, and is only amassed here for readers' convenience. '''The legality of building or using a Hackintosh may vary by your country of residence, so it is strongly recommended that you seek local guidance over this topic if you have qualms about the issue before you continue any further.'''
==How It All Began==
The Hackintosh (or &quot;OSx86&quot;, as it is now affectionately referred to) movement first began in 2005, when Apple made the transition from the PowerPC architecture to Intel's x86 architecture. With that, somebody asked the trivial question &quot;Can we port it over to non-Apple hardware?&quot; Naturally, Apple had installed many checks and &quot;gimmicks&quot; throughout the system to ensure that this didn't happen, but with enough time, workarounds were found. Mac OS Leopard (the first release after Apple's transition) very quickly became a Hackintosh favorite, with higher end computers moving on to Snow Leopard, Lion, and now Mountain Lion and at the time of writing, even 10.9, Apple's OS X &quot;Mavericks&quot; developer preview.

Several well-known Hackintosh lawsuits have gone down in history, the best known one probably being Psystar vs. Apple. In a nutshell, Psystar was convicted of encouraging its users to attempt the OSx86 hack, in some cases even distributing the operating system to customers. Eventually, Apple filed a lawsuit against Psystar, saying that Psystar's actions were a violation of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) under US law. Psystar was eventually banned from distributing the operating system.

Fortunately for most of us, installing a Hackintosh for the average Joe is just a violation of Apple's EULA (End User License Agreement) -- which basically means that you will not be eligible for servicing or customer support at an Apple store -- you're on your own. Psystar was most likely penalized for illegally distributing Apple's operating system, which was a legitimate violation of the DMCA. As long as you obtain your copy of Mac OS X through legal and legitimate methods (and there are some rather sketchy ones out there), you should be in the clear. However, you should still be weary that OSx86 is a grey area in terms of legality and ethics.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What qualifies as &quot;pre-built model&quot;?==
When we speak of pre-built models here, we mean that we are:
* purchasing a desktop or laptop computer and other components and using it in a Hackintosh build
* possibly using soft-fixes (most builds require soft fixes anyways)

==Where can we find lists of pre-built models?==
For finding pre-built model compatibility, your best resource is probably the [http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page OSx86 Wiki], with their [http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page#Hardware_Compatibility Hardware Compatibility] section. It is recommended that you look into the most stable version of Mac OS X that has been released (i.e. the latest version that is not a developer preview), because updating your software after you choose your hardware and install everything can result in boot errors, and possibly having to start all over again. If you don't find anything you want on the OSx86 wiki, you can always check [http://tonymacx86.com TonyMacx86], which has an extensive forums family. If you ''still'' can't find what you're looking for, perhaps a guide is available for your desired hardware somewhere on the Internet, at which point you should finally resort to a search engine.</text>

      <comment>+a dedicated chapter, although this is fairly well covered in [[Visual_Basic/Coding_Standards#Error_Handling]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Error handling in Visual Basic, an outline:
* On Error Goto &lt;Label&gt;
* On Error Goto 0
* On Error Resume Next
* If Err.Number = 0
* If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0
* Resume
* Resume &lt;Label&gt;
* Resume Next
* Err.Description
* Err.Raise &lt;Number&gt;

Suppressing the error and detecting it using the non-zero error numberː
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Set MyCollection = New Collection
MyCollection.Add &quot;Item&quot;, &quot;Item&quot;
On Error Resume Next
MyCollection.Add &quot;Item&quot;, &quot;Item&quot; 'This result in an error
MyErrNumber = Err.Number
On Error Goto 0 'Restore the absence of error handling
If MyErrNumber &lt;&gt; 0 Then
  'Error occurred
  MsgBox &quot;Item already present in the collection.&quot;
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

Creating an error handlerː
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub Test()
  On Error Goto ErrorHandler
  ...
  Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:
  ...
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Creating an error handler that differentiates per error numberː
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub Test()
  On Error Goto ErrorHandler
  ...
  Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:
  Select Case Err.Number
  Case 0
    'No error
  Case 5
    '...
  Case Else
    '...
  End Select
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Haxe only has one compiler unlike most languages but, there is no reason to have multiple as the current one is all you need.

== Downloading &amp; Installing ==
=== Haxe ===
The first thing you will want to do is download the automatic installer(you can also install it from sources or binaries if you are running linux) [http://haxe.org/download here], after that just run the installer and follow the instructions in the installer. 

Once you are done open your command line program(cmd, terminal, etc) and enter &quot;haxe&quot; without the quotation marks. If it prints a list of commands then you are done installing, if you get an error message try uninstalling and install it again.

=== Neko ===
Neko is not required but, it is a very helpful target.

You can download Neko [http://nekovm.org/download here], just download the right version for your system and open the zip file with whatever you use and drag the Neko folder to be inside the same directory as your Haxe installation.

== Libraries ==
=== Setup ===
Setting-up libraries/targets for Haxe is easy, just open your command line tools and enter &quot;haxelib setup&quot; after that it will ask you a question about the directory, just press enter and your done!

=== Types ===
Haxe has support for installing libraries and targets through your command line. Some of the most famous include C++, NME, and OpenFL.

Once you've setup(above), the way you install thing is just by opening your command line and entering:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
haxelib install &lt;name&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Just replace &lt;name&gt; with the name of whatever you want to install for example &quot;hxcpp&quot; which installs the c++ target. If you would like a list of all the targets and libraries you can install go [http://lib.haxe.org/ here].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Target Platforms ==
Below is a list of all of the platforms Haxe supports:

{| border = 1
  |+ Targets
|-
  ! Name
|-
  | Flash(AS3)
|-
  | Neko
|-
  | Javascript
|-
  | C++
|-
  | C#
|-
  | Java
|-
  | PHP
|}

&lt;br /&gt;

== &quot;Hello, world!&quot; ==
First off we are going to write a hello world program like any other language.
Below is a list of ways to write hello world in Haxe using different target platforms.

=== Flash(AS3) ===
Haxe was originally made to be converted to flash and already has support for it without the need of installation.

This way of printing hello world also applies to the c++ target.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haxe&quot;&gt;
class Hello {
    static function main() {
        trace(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

=== Neko ===
When using the Neko target you are going to convert all of your Haxe code into a Neko bytecode file, *.n, which can be executed using the Neko virtual machine.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haxe&quot;&gt;
class Hello {
    static function main() {
        neko.Lib.print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Book Search|prefix=Haxe Programming}}

This book will teach you the '''Haxe''' programming language, this book will cover all of the major features down to the minor features.

&lt;br /&gt;

== About Haxe ==
{{Wikipedia|Haxe}}
Haxe is a cross-platform programming language able to be converted to other languages.

Haxe is pronounced &quot;hex&quot; although most people pronounce it &quot;hacks&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Family relation names in Hindi are very specific to the speaker. For example there are different names for your uncles such as your father's brother and your mother's brother. Since these vary a bit from place to place, the following are some standard examples. The listed words are the naFamily relations[edit]

Father --Tande,Appa

Hello,

Possibly it's been so long that you don't need an answer any more, but I added my two cents re: [[Talk:Haskell/Type_basics_II#Why_wasn.27t_.2F_defined_with_type_.28Num_a.2C_Fractional_b.29_.3D.3E_a_-.3E_a_-.3E_b_.3F|your question on number types]] at the Haskell book.

      <comment>/* Tell one of the following listening Bible Stories. */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Adventist Adventurer Awards/Header|class=Multi-Level}}

== Memorize and explain 2 of the following listening Bible verses:==

a. James 1:19

b. Jeremiah 29:11-12

c. Jeremiah 13:15

d. Proverbs 1:8

e. Isaiah 59:1

== Tell one of the following listening Bible Stories. ==

a. '''Samuel listening''' – 1 Samuel 3

You may remember that Samuel's mother was a woman named Hannah. She wanted a son more than anything, so she prayed and asked God to give her a son. She promised God that if he would give her a son, she would give him back to the LORD to serve him all the days of his life. God gave Hannah the son she asked for and she kept her promise to God. When the boy was old enough, she took him to the temple and presented him to Eli the priest. So Samuel served in the temple under Eli.

One night Samuel was sleeping when he heard someone call his name. He got up and ran to Eli. &quot;Here I am; you called me,&quot; he said to Eli.

&quot;I didn't call you,&quot; Eli answered, &quot;go back to bed.&quot; So Samuel went back to bed.

Again the LORD called, &quot;Samuel!&quot; Samuel jumped out of bed and and went to Eli. &quot;Here I am; you called me.&quot;

&quot;I didn't call you, go back to bed,&quot; Eli answered a second time.

A third time God called Samuel and Samuel got up and went to Eli. &quot;Here I am; you called me,&quot; he said.

Finally, Eli realized that it was God who was calling Samuel. He told Samuel, &quot;Go and lie down, and if he calls you again, say, 'Speak LORD, for your servant is listening.&quot;

Samuel went back to bed and sure enough, again he heard the voice of God calling, &quot;Samuel! Samuel!&quot; This time Samuel answered as Eli had told him, &quot;Speak, for your servant is listening.&quot;

Some people think that God only calls grown-ups. That is why I like the story of Samuel. Samuel was just a young boy when God called him. God knows your name just as he knew the name of Samuel and God still calls boys and girls today saying, &quot;Come, follow me.&quot; So, listen for God's call and answer just as Samuel did, &quot;Here I am!&quot;

b. ''' Jesus listening ''' – Luke 2:41-49

Every year, Mary, Joseph and Jesus traveled to Jerusalem for a celebration. They 
went with a big group of friends and family. The party was so much fun. They had lots of 
good food and told God how much they loved Him. 

When the party was over, Mary and Joseph and the group traveled back to their home. 
(March with your feet) After a while, Mary and Joseph realized that Jesus was not anywhere 
to be found. They asked all their friends and family, but no one had seen Jesus. (Put your 
hand by your brow like you are searching for Jesus.) 

Mary and Joseph rushed back to Jerusalem. They looked everywhere for Jesus. (Put 
your hand across your brow as if you were looking for Jesus; then call Jesus’ name like you 
were looking for Him) 

Finally, they found him. Do you know where Jesus was? He was in the temple 
church, talking to the leaders. They had been there talking together the whole time! The 
leaders were amazed at what Jesus knew. 

When Mary found him she said, “Son, why did you do this to us? Your father and I 
were very worried about you!” 

Jesus asked, “Why did you have to look for me? You should have known that I 
would be where my Father’s work is.” But they did not understand what He meant. 

Jesus went with them to their home in Nazareth and He obeyed them. He listened and 
did what His parents asked Him to do. Jesus continued to grow up. People liked him and he 
pleased God too.

== Learn the following principals of listening:==

* '''Listen to God.'''
* '''Be always ready to listen.''' “My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.” James 1:19
* '''Be patient.''' Listening takes time, but the reward far exceeds the investment.
* '''Be obedient.''' Listen and respond the first time instruction is given.
* '''Be kind.''' Listening is a gift, so be the first one to lead out in listening. Be a listening role model.
* '''Be respectful.''' Listen to others and let them finish their story, before you talk.
* '''Be attentive.''' Pay attention while others are speaking.

== Make a craft that relates to listening.==

'''String Telephone'''
 
You will need:

* 2 plastic or paper cups – a tin can works great too
* String (you can experiment with different lengths)
* A friend to hold the other end of the string telephone:)

Instructions:

* Make a small hole in the bottom of both cups.  Thread your string through the cup and tie a knot to keep the string from pulling back through.  That’s it!  You are all ready to start playing.
* You take one cup and your friend takes the other.  Walk far enough apart to make the string tight.  Depending on how long you cut your string will depend on how far you need to stand apart.  Also, make sure that the string is not touching anything else.
* One friend holds the cup to their mouth and talks, while the other friend holds it to their ear and listens.

== Play a listening game.==

'''Follow the Leader 1:'''

Facilitate an old-fashioned game of Simon Says as a way to emphasize the importance of focus and following directions. Try saying, &quot;Simon says touch your toes and then say sit on the floor.&quot; If your child follows the second direction without hearing Simon says, they lose. This game reinforces how effective listening relates to following directions. For older children, use a picture that includes geometrical shapes. Give the child a blank piece of paper and then describe the picture and ask them to draw what they hear. Compare the two pictures and discuss how listening to directions played a role in replicating the picture.

'''Follow the Leader 2:'''

Form groups of three. Have one person in each group close his or her eyes. Have the other two take the person at least 20 feet away from their group.

Say: You have one minute to get back to your seat with your eyes closed. Your friends in your group will guide you, but listen well.

The &quot;blind&quot; people can't be led by the hand; they must follow only their group members' instructions. Play three times to let each group member have a turn being the blind one. Then ask: How easy or difficult was it to listen to your group members' voices? How did other people's instructions affect you? What techniques did you use to listen well?

Say: Listen to this story about a little boy who learned to listen well -- and heard God's voice.

Read aloud 1 Samuel 3:1-11.

Ask: Think of the techniques we used in our game to listen well. How can we use some of those same techniques to listen well to God?

'''Listening to God'''

Divide the kids into four groups. Whisper instructions to each group so the other groups don't know what you told them. Tell the first group to sing twinkle twinkle little star as loudly as possible. Tell the second group to shout out their favourite foods. Tell the third group to do jumping jacks and count them as they do them. Tell the last group to use their normal voice level and say &quot;God loves you&quot;. On &quot;go&quot;, have each group begin. Allow the kids to do this for about 60 seconds. Then call them all together and ask the first three groups if they can identify what each group was doing. They will probably be able to tell you what the first three groups were doing, but will have no idea what the last group was doing. The parallel you want to draw here is that we can't listen when we are talking or being loud or distracted. If we want to know what God wants to tell us then we need to be still and listen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello
I have created this account for the purpose of translating  [[GIMP| this book]] to Hebrew.

Before I begin, the preliminary reading suggests its a good idea to get familiar with the following conventions and best practices of wiki work and translation on particular:
#  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Piped_link  how to link stuff in wiki] .
#  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translate_us  Wiki Translation Howto]
#  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Development_stages  Development stages]
#  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Print_versions Making this guide printable] , and have a look at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Collections Collections too].
#  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Naming_policy Naming and linking]

Added:
#  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Templates Wiki templating]

This page may or may not service me in the future, but for now it shall become my public todo list.
If anyone stumbles upon it and want to suggest reading, or any other help or feedback, your welcome to do so. I'd be happy if you don't mess my list though.
Rather, add your notes and suggestions in Discussion. 
And, well, I try to conform to [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:User_pages Usr pages] conventions as much as I have time to read them..

And let the work begin!

Salutes!

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you want to live on the wild side of things, you can build your own computer based on other Hackintoshers' prior experience. Many people post their working builds online for other people to use. If you want a rather customizable yet stable setup, using known-working builds are your best option.

===Where can we find known working configurations?===
Again, we can look into [http://tonymacx86.com TonyMacx86] for help.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some of the great examples of other wikibooks initiated by educational technology scholars provided an inspiration for this wikibook created as part of a course assignment for the Research and Technology in Teacher Education Course. These inspirations came from Dr. Ana Paula Correia's course wikibook project [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Breaking_the_Mold:_An_Educational_Perspective_on_Diffusion_of_Innovation “Breaking the Mold: An Educational Perspective on Diffusion of Innovation”], Dr. Niki Davis's [http://wikieducator.org/Davis%282011%29#Preface &quot;Change with Digital Technologies in Education&quot;], and Dr. Curt Bonk's [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Web_2.0_and_Emerging_Learning_Technologies&quot;The Web 2.0 and Emerging Learning Technologies&quot;]. These provided great examples of such collaborative work that came out of graduate courses. 


The nature of the TPACK framework that we investigated throughout the semester was another source of inspiration. TPACK is a multifaceted construct. To conduct an in-depth exploration of this frame, we needed to look at it from different lenses such as from the lens of a discipline, a research method, a social context etc. This wikibook is the product of such &quot;bon voyage&quot; taken by the course participants.
Wikibook helped us present our work in an online platform that is open to the whole world. Knowing this and the whole idea of writing a chapter for a book was first challenging, but exciting. Not only students followed a guided writing process but also decided many elements of the book together, such as the design of the cover and the selection of the title. The product is not an end but a beginning of the further work that will come out of our efforts in understanding TPACK within different contexts.


Following chapters present different topics in “The Many Faces of TPACK: Perspectives and Approaches”. First section focuses on the investigation of TPACK research and implications in different disciplines. 
Cetinkaya examines TPACK in Science Teacher Education. First exploring at the reasons for integration of technology in teacher education, she provides analysis of the research conducted on TPACK within the context of science teacher education. Gamze’s chapter offers suggestions for implications of TPACK research in science education.


Celik investigates TPACK in English Language Teacher Education. He starts with a presentation of the definition of knowledge and its transformation and English as lingua Franca. Celik later provides examples of research that integrated TPACK into the ELT context. Chapter finishes with future implications. Another context that was investigated is Math education. Reviewing the trends on TPACK and math teacher education, Kol presents recent literature and continues with the future recommendations for Math teacher educators.


Another important but under-researched field in TPACK is the special education teacher education. Altan completes the quest of TPACK in special education by first defining special education, then presenting the research on the integration of technology into special education, and finally, laying out limited studies conducted on TPACK and special education teacher education with examples and implications.  Cilsalar investigates the literature on TPACK and primary teacher education. While still at its infancy, TPACK has produced a number of research studies conducted within the context of k-5 teacher education level. This chapter provides a review of those studies with examples from the field. Final chapter in the “Exploring TPACK within Disciplines” section is the computer education. Computer education has is a unique discipline in the context of Turkey. Bahcekapili provides an analysis of the studies conducted on TPACK in the context of computer and technology teacher education.


Second section focuses on TPACK measures. Ilci provides a detailed review of the TPACK measures used in the literature. His discussion includes the development phases of the measurement tools as well as the challenges regarding measuring TPACK. Sat continues with the investigation of a specific measure: the TPACK self-assessment survey developed in collaboration with Iowa State University and Michigan State University in 2009. Sat’s review present the impact of this widely adopted survey around the world by reviewing the studies that used the tool in different contexts. 


Recently, TPACK been cited frequently in efforts for renewing Turkey’s teacher education system. Considering this, Kayaduman's chapter on the investigation of technology initiatives in Turkey within the light of TPACK provides a detailed and critical picture of some of the large technology initiatives started in Turkey. Kayaduman provides recommendations on how TPACK can be used to inform teacher education research and practices in Turkey’s teacher education contexts. Final chapter focuses on TPACK from the perspective of simultaneous renewal. Yasan, investigates technology initiates around the world such as the PT3 in the Unites States and Fatih project in Turkey with the TPACK framework.


Throughout this Wikibook, authors not only examine TPACK within different disciplines, research methods, and initiatives, but also provide their own insights on how this frame might impact future research and practice both in Turkey and around the world. I believe this is just a beginning to our “bon voyage” on TPACK and motivation to improve learning and teaching with technology. We cherish this collaborative effort that opened the borders of our course to the scholarly community and hope to continue such endeavours in the near future.

===1...Nf6===
In this response, black develops a piece without committing to a pawn opening.  

White normally completes the fianchetto through 2. Bb2, and black sets up the same pattern by attempting 2...g6 (where the knight shields the pawn.)  White may then send out the kings knight with 3.Nf3, or claim the center with 3.e4 (with the knight being pinned).  

Less common is 2.Nf3, which lets black setup a fianchetto of his own.  
 
=== Statistics ===
FICS Games Database shows the most common responses for white are Bb2 (64%), Nf3 (23%) and e3 (8%).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introductions ==

If you've ever had to delete more than a few rules at once, you know it is a bit of a drag. 

Copied below is a test case for the Firefox Selenium IDE which you can use to do the deletion while you lovingly watch it work away.

This was made this using OpenClinica 3.1.3.1 and the [http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/ Selenium IDE for Firefox], with the [https://github.com/darrenderidder/sideflow sideflow add-in]. 

Please don't run this in a production environment before you are certain it is correct by first running it in a test environment.
== Instructions ==

# Log in to OpenClinica, go to Manage Rules, put in the filter criteria for the rules you want to remove, and apply the filter. Make note of how many rules are returned by the filter.
# Copy and paste the URL into the 'Open' target in the test case. 
# Enter the number of rules returned by the filter in the 'target_run' variable. This isn't strictly necessary because the test case will fail when the filter returns no rules, but only crazy people intentionally run infinitely looping code.
# Run the test case.

The test case will go to the filter address, delete the rule at the top, and repeat this however many times you set your target_run. Obviously this will hammer your server a bit so probably best to only do it when other users won't be using OpenClinica.

Once the test case has finished, it will say 'Deleted x of y rules' in the log pane. If it otherwise ran out of rules because you set the target_run too high, the test case should just fail.

Copy and paste the below into the source pane of a test case in Selenium IDE.

	&lt;td&gt;If you remove this rule, it will not run in Data Entry or Bulk mode . The rule can be restored by a principal investigator. Are you sure you want to remove it?&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;store&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;new Number(${times_run} + 1)&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;times_run&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;gotoIf&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;${times_run} &amp;lt; ${target_run}&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
== Advanced version ==

Maybe instead of many rules that fit only one criteria, you have a list of rules you need to remove which fit a range of different criteria.

You could create a separate test case for each filter set and run them as a suite, or use the following version of the above test case.

Instead of plonking down the whole filter string, this version lets you put a comma separated list of the filter criteria for each set. 

For example, to delete all rules with the OIDs of RULE01 and only RULE02 where the target is ITEM01, you would use the following string for the 'rules_to_delete' variable:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&amp;ruleAssignments_f_ruleOid=RULE01,&amp;ruleAssignments_f_ruleOid=RULE02&amp;ruleAssignments_f_targetValue=I_ITEM01&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Other than that, you just need to put your instance location in the 'instance_location' variable. The number of rules deleted is echoed in the log once the test case is complete.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;

The ''object pool'' pattern uses a set of initialized objects kept ready to use, rather than allocating and destroying them on demand. A client of the pool will request an object from the pool and perform operations on the returned object. When the client has finished, it returns the object, which is a specific type of factory object, to the pool rather than destroying it.

Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is high, the rate of instantiation of a class is high, and the number of instances in use at any one time is low. The pooled object is obtained in predictable time when creation of the new objects (especially over network) may take variable time.

However these benefits are mostly true for objects that are expensive with respect to time, such as database connections, socket connections, threads and large graphic objects like fonts or bitmaps. In certain situations, simple object pooling (that hold no external resources, but only occupy memory) may not be efficient and could decrease performance.

== Handling of empty pools ==

Object pools employ one of three strategies to handle a request when there are no spare objects in the pool.

# Fail to provide an object (and return an error to the client).
# Allocate a new object, thus increasing the size of the pool. Pools that do this usually allow you to set the high water mark (the maximum number of objects ever used).
# In a multithreaded environment, a pool may block the client until another thread returns an object to the pool.

== Pitfalls ==

When writing an object pool, the programmer has to be careful to make sure the state of the objects returned to the pool is reset back to a sensible state for the next use of the object. If this is not observed, the object will often be in some state that was unexpected by the client program and may cause the client program to fail. The pool is responsible for resetting the objects, not the clients. Object pools full of objects with dangerously stale state are sometimes called object cesspools and regarded as an anti-pattern.

The presence of stale state is not always an issue; it becomes dangerous when the presence of stale state causes the object to behave differently. For example, an object that represents authentication details may break if the &quot;successfully authenticated&quot; flag is not reset before it is passed out, since it will indicate that a user is correctly authenticated (possibly as someone else) when they haven't yet attempted to authenticate. However, it will work just fine if you fail to reset some value only used for debugging, such as the identity of the last authentication server used.

Inadequate resetting of objects may also cause an information leak. If an object contains confidential data (e.g. a user's credit card numbers) that isn't cleared before the object is passed to a new client, a malicious or buggy client may disclose the data to an unauthorized party.

If the pool is used by multiple threads, it may need the means to prevent parallel threads from grabbing and trying to reuse the same object in parallel. This is not necessary if the pooled objects are immutable or otherwise thread-safe.

== Criticism ==
Some publications do not recommend using object pooling with certain languages, such as Java, especially for objects that only use memory and hold no external resources. Opponents usually say that object allocation is relatively fast in modern languages with garbage collectors; while the operator &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; needs only ten instructions, the classic &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; pair found in pooling designs requires hundreds of them as it does more complex work. Also, most garbage collectors scan &quot;live&quot; object references, and not the memory that these objects use for their content. This means that any number of &quot;dead&quot; objects without references can be discarded with little cost. In contrast, keeping a large number of &quot;live&quot; but unused objects increases the duration of garbage collection. In some cases, programs that use garbage collection instead of directly managing memory may run faster.

== Examples ==

In the .NET Base Class Library there are a few objects that implement this pattern. &lt;code&gt;System.Threading.ThreadPool&lt;/code&gt; is configured to have a predefined number of threads to allocate. When the threads are returned, they are available for another computation. Thus, one can use threads without paying the cost of creation and disposal of threads.

Java supports thread pooling via &lt;code&gt;java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService&lt;/code&gt; and other related classes. The executor service has a certain number of &quot;basic&quot; threads that are never discarded. If all threads are busy, the service allocates the allowed number of extra threads that are later discarded if not used for the certain expiration time. If no more threads are allowed, the tasks can be placed in the queue. Finally, if this queue may get too long, it can be configured to suspend the requesting thread.

==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Alternatives and Modeling Approach'''&lt;/font&gt;==

In previous Systems Engineering steps we identified functions that make up parts of a project, and assigned what these parts are supposed to do in terms of requirements.  The next several steps are intended to find the best design to meet these requirements.  In this section we look at developing alternative options and incorporating them into a complete system model.  In the next section we will show how to use such models to optimize and select among the alternatives.  These steps are described in sequence in the text that follows because books are a linear sequence of words.  But in practice, developing a complex design is not a strictly linear process.  As the pieces of the design are identified and the designers exercise their creativity, new arrangements and options will suggest themselves.  Thus the design will evolve partly through an iterative process.  These steps provide an organized way to start the design process, but they are repeated as many times and at as many levels of detail as needed.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Developing Alternative Options'''&lt;/font&gt;==

Developing alternatives is further divided into several steps.  In order to not miss any valid options we first identify all available and possible technologies and methods to perform a given function.  This typically needs specialists who understand the field or researching the state of the art.  This initial survey does not limit options by state of development or practicality.  A feasibility analysis then eliminates some of these technologies based on not meeting one or more project requirements.  The remaining options are then sized or bounded to an appropriate range for meeting project needs.  Within that range, their design parameters are then quantified in terms of mathematical models, design drawings, and other design information.  It should be kept in mind that the final design may end up using more than one technology or method.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Identifying Technologies and Methods'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

If the design team is sufficiently large, it will contain specialists in different subjects.  They can then be assigned to investigate alternatives for the various functions in the project according to their experience areas.  If the team is small, or a single person (as it is for the book author at present), then the designer(s) have to gather information from other sources to come up with a list of options.  Even projects that later become large tend to start out small, so gathering technical information outside one's area of experience is often necessary.  Tasks for doing this include:

'''&lt;u&gt;Identify Relevant Fields by Function&lt;/u&gt;''' - Use the words in the function title and description as search terms in general search engines such as Google, and general and specialized reference sources.  If you are not familiar with the fields identified by these methods, read some introductory articles or material to gain a basic understanding of their scope.  You can then gather more detailed information on the field by standard methods of library and online searches, finding experts to ask, social networking, contacting companies in the field, etc.

'''&lt;u&gt;Develop List of Candidates&lt;/u&gt;''' - From the previous search and data gathering, make a list of items that might apply to performing the function.  This includes existing ones, and new items that would require research and development.  Items that require too much development will be filtered out later, our aim is to be inclusive at this point.  It also includes items that only do part of a function and need to be combined with other items to perform it completely.  The list of candidates is then documented, according with the data sources and reasoning for how they would apply to the design.

===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Feasibility Analysis'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

The list of candidates is then compared to the project requirements to determine if it is feasible to use them, or if they cannot meet one or more of them.  Common reasons to not meet requirements include technical performance or scale, readiness for use within the project schedule, or excessive cost, but any requirement can be a cause for elimination.  Technologies which are not fully developed should not be rejected solely for that reason.  If they can be developed at reasonable cost, within the project schedule, and reasonable performance risk, they can be carried to the next steps.  It is likely that some technologies will be marginally feasible, or there is not enough information to decide.  In that case, they should be carried forward and more work done to develop the details.  As the design progresses, more candidates will be found infeasible and eliminated, or feasible but less highly ranked, until the best options become evident.  

As with the other steps, the data, reasoning, and choices regarding feasibility are documented.  We emphasize documentation throughout the design process because typically the design team starts out small and grows over time, and because technology in general does not stand still.  A small team cannot know everything about every technology, and later members can fill gaps or add better information to the work.  Having the past design logic clearly recorded helps in this process.  Progress in a technology may make it a better option or feasible where it was not before, and being able to trace the previous design decisions helps in making updates.

===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Option Sizing'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

In the next step, the feasible options are sized against the project needs.  Since functions interact with each other, we may not know at this point the required size, for example, of the electrical power supply.  Therefore we establish a generous range that covers the eventual needs.  Thus if we estimate we will need 100 kW of electricity, we might size the different power supply options over a 10 kW to 1 MW range, so that the actual need will very likely fall within that range.

===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Design Parameters'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Building System Models'''&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''The Need for Models'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

In a complex system the interactions and effects of multiple functions on each other and the outside environment are also complex.  For the system as a whole to operate, the various functions and flows must be sized correctly.  For the design to be optimized, the effects of choosing among alternatives for a given part on the entire system must be understood.  Manual resizing and recalculation of all the design parameters for each change would be too slow, prone to error, and tedious in the extreme.  Therefore we build mathematical models to describe the system, and use computers to help recalculate, simulate, and optimize.  Optimizing the overall design before working on the details or building physical hardware saves on effort and cost in the long run.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''System Modeling'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

A model in essence is a simplified representation of a system and its parts.  In abstract form, mathematical formulas, tables, and other analytical and numerical elements link the system to the outside environment, and describe the parts of the system and how they relate to each other.  The elements of a model are based on design information developed for the various options, general engineering knowledge, or best estimates when such information is not available.  A variety of software tools and methods are available to implement the models and perform the necessary calculations.  These range from simple spreadsheets, to numerical analysis software, to simulation software for individual elements up to entire factories.  

Multiple software tools may be needed to completely model a complex system.  Outputs from one kind of tool are often used as inputs to others, linking them to form a full system model. The choice of which tools to use and how to connect them depends on a number of factors.  These include the level of detail the design has reached, how well available tools are suited to the task, past experience, and available staff and funds.  Overly detailed modeling may not gain enough design improvement to be worth the effort to create them.  Thus the modeling process is itself subject to design and optimization for a given project.  As a design evolves, the models will develop in parallel, from simple to more complex and detailed.  Thus the tools used in the early stages are often not the ones used later.  When considering how to model a given project, thought should be given how to transition data from one tool to another as the work evolves.

Establishing requirements and defining functions to meet those requirements should not presuppose a design solution, so as to not exclude a better alternative.  The system modeling stage should allow for alternatives until the optimization and selection is done. Even then further work may find a better solution and change the selected alternatives.  Thus the model and data contained therein should be considered the latest version developed so far, but always subject to updates and improvement.  Which options to select may happen at different times in the design process for different parts of the system.  In some cases the difference between options is large and evident early.  In other cases more detailed work is needed to define the options to the point a choice can be made.  Thus the model must be able to handle such a mixed state, where some choices have been made, and others not.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Model Elements'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

Models are built from simpler elements which are linked in various ways.  In the early stages of design these elements may be the entirety of the system model.

'''&lt;u&gt;Tables and Graphs&lt;/u&gt;''' -

'''&lt;u&gt;Parametric Equations&lt;/u&gt;''' - These relate one variable quantity based on other quantities in the system.  For example, a furnace's required power input can be related to the kg/hour of material to be heated times the specific heat and temperature difference in the process.  Thus varying the production rate during analysis of the whole system will also change the required power level.

'''&lt;u&gt;Annotated Diagrams&lt;/u&gt;''' - The same kind of functional diagrams described in section 4.1 can be used for modeling system elements. The function boxes and flow arrows are annotated with quantities or formulas along with their text labels.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Model Types'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

The model elements listed previously do not react to changed inputs when they are in the form of bare tables, formulas, and diagrams.  The must be embedded in software to automatically propagate changed entries to the rest of the model.

'''&lt;u&gt;Spreadsheets&lt;/u&gt;''' - The common spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel, is a useful tool for system modeling.  Most designers are already familiar with this kind of software, and formulas, tables, and even active diagrams are relatively easy to build.  It has some drawbacks for more complex and detailed modeling.  These include lack of automated detection for missing flows and functions, or ability to simulate physical processes.  Nonetheless it is well adapted to early system modeling, and as a summary of more detailed models.

A spreadsheet type model can adopt a tabular or diagrammatic layout, or a combination of both.  In tabular form, a conventional way to organize it is by grouping function boxes and the flows which enter and leave them as rows.  Where multiple alternatives are being modeled, they are listed as additional rows, with a use factor from 0 to 100% applied.  By changing the use factor, you change which alternative is being included in the calculations.  This includes mixed alternatives, for example using both solar panels and wind turbines as power sources in varying amounts for the total power required.  Columns in the table represent different kinds of resources making up a flow.  For example, a metal casting operation might require some kilograms of raw metal and kiloWatt-hours of electricity to melt it as input resources.  A function which consumes a resource has a negative value for the quantity, and one which outputs a resource has a positive value.  

Columns must eventually sum to zero, meaning every input used has a source supplying it.  Otherwise you are implicitly creating or destroying a resource from nothing, and the model is therefore incomplete or needs the values adjusted.  When they sum to zero, the resources are balanced in the accounting sense.  This is the same as in double-entry bookkeeping, where assets and liabilities (positive and negative money values) must be equal and thus sum to zero.  Financial resources are in fact one of the resource types that can be included in a system model.  Balanced resource accounting generalizes what was first developed for money accounts to tracking all types of resources in a project - labor, materials, machine output, energy, or anything else.

'''&lt;u&gt;Numerical Analysis and Simulation Software&lt;/u&gt;''' - 

'''&lt;u&gt;Design and Manufacturing Software&lt;/u&gt;''' -

'''&lt;u&gt;Integrated Models and Suites&lt;/u&gt;''' - The trend in engineering design has been towards integration of design data, models, and simulation into single programs or suites of related software.  Partly this has been enabled by much more powerful computers and networks.  Integration removes much of the work in moving data between 3D design models, system models, simulations, and other computer-aided design steps.  It speeds up the design process by feeding changes more quickly to other parts of the design.  Commercial suites are rather expensive, and typically need time to learn how to use the various parts efficiently.  They are better suited to larger design teams in the later and more detailed stages of the design process.

== Closing noticeboards ==

I propose to close [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects]] and [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance]] as they are not used and could be replaced with the General noticeboard easily. I would [[w:WP:BOLD]] be bold, but the nav.template is fully-protected (although it says semi-protected) [[User:Ebe123|Ebe123]] ([[User talk:Ebe123|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ebe123|contribs]]) 15:35, 30 July 2013 (UTC)

: They are used, from time to time.  They do not appear to me to do any harm.  So I for one see no need to close them.  One would need to think very carefully about the distribution of functions amongst the reading rooms, too.

: I do note that being bold (the link you want, btw, is not to the Wikipedian guideline but to [[WB:Be bold|the Wikibookian one]]) should be leavened with reasonable discretion.  Closing reading rooms isn't something to be done unilaterally.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:09, 30 July 2013 (UTC)
::It's easier to watch a fewer boards than many. [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance]] has two threads, but there are no responses at either of them.  As there are not many threads in general, it would be easy to keep track of threads even if there are a couple more on the noticeboard.  [[User:Ebe123|Ebe123]] ([[User talk:Ebe123|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ebe123|contribs]]) 01:30, 31 July 2013 (UTC)
::: Hm.  I don't think it's significantly easier to watch slightly fewer boards, if one uses a watchlist.
::: The two threads that are there appear to be old ones that, for one reason or another, the archiving bot doesn't like.  Not sure there's anything to be inferred from them, except perhaps that the bot is cantankerous as all bots.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:45, 31 July 2013 (UTC)
:::Don't see the need to close the boards. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 14:51, 31 July 2013 (UTC)
::::More than addressing a particular taste there is also the problem of that the change has been too recent and continual alterations are even a greater deterrent to utilization/usefulness.
::::I confess that I prefer simplification but since the change has already made (fragmentation by specific subjects) I don't see any advantage in going back.
::::I'm '''opposed''' to the proposal on those grounds.  
::::My preferred pet peeve with the Reading rooms is the stupid even rule breaking archival of open subjects in the proposal and administrative &quot;forums&quot; were subjects aren't ever given a resolutions/closure.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:41, 1 August 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The stratigraphical knowledge of the Indonesian Archipelago will be summarized in this chapter. A synopsis of the stratigraphy of the Netherlands East Indies has been published by BROUWER (1925) and L. M. R. RUTTEN (1927). In 1938 UMBGROVE gave a comprehensive review of the geological history of the East Indies. A number of important contributions to the stratigraphy which appeared in 1937-1938, not available to UMBGROVE, were summarized by SMIT SIBINGA (1940). L. M. R. RUTTEN (1948) and DE BEAUFORT (1948) reviewed the paleontological work carried out in the Netherlands for the Dutch Overseas Territories during the period 1918-1943. 

Other important reviews on the stratigraphy of the Indian Archipelago are to be found in: The &quot;MARTIN-Volume&quot; of the &quot;Leidsche Geologische Mededeelingen&quot; (1931), in which a number of authors gives a review of the paleontological and stratigraphical data up to the year 1930; UMBGROVE (1934 b) on theNeogene, and(1935)on thePre-Tertiary; BADINGS (1936) on the Paleogene; STAUFFER (1945) on the stratigraphy of Indonesia; SMITH (1924, 1925) on the stratigraphy of the Philippines; MONTGOMERY, OSBORN and GLAESSNER on the stratigraphy of Eastern New Guinea 1); CHHIBBER (1934) on the stratigraphy of the Andamans and Nicobars. 

In 1950, P. Marks, published Stratigraphic Lexicon of Indonesia, which is a compilation of formation names in Indonesia. The formation names are sorted in alphabetical order with their description, rough map of the localities, and summarized them in stratigraphic charts. 

The first Indonesian Stratigraphic Nomenclature guide (Sandi Stratigraphy Indonesia) was published in 1973 by Soejono Martodjojo and Djuhaeni. This book was updated in 1996 and published electronically by the Indonesian Geologist Association. The file is available online in [http://www.iagi.or.id/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Sandi-Stratigrafi-Indonesia-1996.pdf SSI-1996]. Many publications related to sequence stratigraphy and seismic stratigraphy in Indonesia were published by the Indonesian Petroleum Assocation ([http://www.ipa.or.id IPA]), the Indonesian Geological Association ([http://www.iagi.or.id IAGI])and other professional organizations. A compilation of updated article on biostratigraphy of SE Asia is currently being prepared by the Indonesian Sedimentologists Forum (FOSI), which aim to issue it in 2014. Another key source on the stratigraphy of Indonesia is the Geological Research and Development Centre of Indonesia (GRDC)

For the sake of brevity, in this chapter only some notes will be given on recent advances in our knowledge of the pre-tertiary stratigraphy. For the rest the reader is referred to the regional descriptions. 

The tertiary and quaternary formations have a much wider distribution than the pre-tertiary rocks. Their stratigraphy is most important in the unraveling of the evolution of the younger mountain systems in this area. Therefore, the stratigraphy of the Tertiary and the Quaternary will be treated at some length in this chapter.</text>

* '''Silurian'''
Hallysites wallichi REED is the oldest of the fossils found to date in the Indian Archipelago (VAN BEMMELEN, 1949). It occurs in limestone boulders in the Snow Mountain Range of New Guinea and has been described by TEICHERT (1928) and MUSPER (1938). This fossil points to Upper Silurian and it represents the oldest fossil-bearing strata in the circum-Australian Mountain System.

* '''Devonian'''
The oldest fossil-bearing strata of the Sunda area (i.e. the Asiatic part of the archipelago) have a lower-Devonian age. This has been stated by M. G. RUTTEN (1940, 1947), who found Clath- rodiction d. spatiosum BOEHNKE and Heliolites porosus OLDFUSS in the &quot;Danau Formation&quot; of East Central Borneo (Telen area). SUGIAMAN and ANDRIA (1998) have revisited and analyzed the fossils from this area. 

In the Central Ranges of New Guinea the Silurian is succeeded by Devonian strata. The Devonian fossils have been described by MARTIN (1911), FEUILLETAU DE BRUYN (1921), STEHN (1927), and TEICHERT (1928) in the upper part of the Modio Limestone Formation.  The result of reset age of zircon fission-track (ZFT) showing age of 650±63 Ma (Quarles van Ufford, 1996). OLIVER et al, 1995 found Late Devonian (Frtasnian) corals in the Modio Limestone.

The Modio Formation is interpreted as a transgressive sequence deposited from tidal to marine shelf. The upper contact with Aiduna Formation is not well exposed and is interpreted to be disconformable (UFFORD, 1996).

* '''Permo-Carboniferous'''
Much more is know about the distribution of permo-carboniferous rocks. Characteristic fossil faunas and floras have been found in several islands. It is not always possible to separate with certainty the Permian from the Carboniferous and, therefore, often the name &quot;Permo-Carboniferous&quot; is used in the literature. 
In the western part of the Archipelago (Malaysian Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo), carboniferous, permo-carboniferous, and permian fossils have been found. VON L6czy (1934) and VON KUTASSY (1934) presume the presence of Young Paleozoic in the East arm of Celebes (Tokala Mts); but HETZEL (1935, p. 30) remarks that VON KUTASSY'S plate, illustrating the concerning fossils, is too indistinct to convince the reader of the correctness of the determinations. In the outer arc of the eastern part of the Sunda Mountain System, the islands of Timor, Savu, Roti, Leti, Luang, Babar are reknown for their rich permian fauna, especially the former. From the Snow Mountain Range of New Guinea, upper- carboniferous and permian fossils have been described. For a summary of the above mentioned occurrences we may refer to BROUWER (1931, pp. 553-563) and UMBGROVE (1935 a, pp. 125-128). The fossils come from neritic and littoral sediments. Most probably in young paleozoic time some islands or larger land areas lay scattered in a shallow sea, which submerged at that time the East Indian region. 
Only in the Permian of West Borneo there are indications (radiolarian cherts and ophiolites in MOLENGRAAFF'S Danau Formation), for the presence of a deep-sea trench. 
In the following paragraph are quoted some recent advances of our knowledge on the carboniferous flora in New Guinea and of the Permo-Carboniferous in West Borneo. For the Permian of Timor see under Mesozoic. For further information on the occurrences of young-paleozoic strata in Sumatra and Malaya, the reader is referred to the regional geological descriptions.

'''1. PERMO-CARBONIFEROUS OF NEW GUINEA''' 

An important contribution to our knowledge of the distribution of the Glossopteris-flora was recently given by JONGMANS (1940, 1941). 

The Glossopteris-flora of the Southern hemisphere is found between India and Australia (where it has been known for considerable time). A former report of its occurrence in British North Borneo proved to be erroneous, 

The flora of the Carboniferous of the Northern hernisphere (Europe, Asia, North America) can be distinguished jnto two groups: the Eurameric Flora (North America, '~'urope, western Asia) and the Cathaysia Flora (China and Korea). The difference between these two does not develop before the younger Carboniferous. It does not exist up till Westphalian D, but becomes apparent in Westphalian E and especially in the &quot;Rotliegendes&quot;. The Djambi Flora (Sumatra) corresponds with the Cathaysia group in many respects, but the European character of this Djambi Flora is more pronounced than that of the typical Cathaysia Flora because it belongs to Westphalian E thus being older than the typical development of the latter. Also in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo, floras with a European character are known. Mixtures of the Eurameric Flora with the Glossopteris Flora of the southern hemi- sphere have been found in North Africa, Brasil and Central Africa. Up till 1940 no mixing of the Cathaysia with the Glossopteris Flora. was known; but now this has been demonstrated by JONGMANS for material from the southern slope of the Snow Mountain Range of New Guinea. Here have been 'found, Vertebraria (a typical element of the Glossopteris Flora) and Pecopteris- and Taeniopteris species (belonging to the Cathaysia Flora); the age is probably Westphalian E due to the presence of some Euramerian elements. This proves that also the Cathaysia Flora existed on the southern side of the Tethys where it could mix with the Glossopteris Flora of the Gondwana Land. During the younger Carboniferous the western part of the Archipelago had land connections with East Asia (China) and the eastern part with Australia. 

JONGMANs(1941) also described some recent finds of up per- carboniferous plants (Westphalian D-E) from Borneo. 

KEYZER (1941), summarized our knowledge of the fossiliferous Paleozoic in the Snow Mountain Range of New Guinea as follows: 

Permian: Gray marly sandstones with coral limestones containing: Lonsdaleia fliegeli (ZWIERZYCKI); limestone with? Productus (HUBRECHT); ? Bryozoa-limestones (TEI- CHERT). 

Upper-Carboniferous: dark shales with a Cathaysia Flora (JONGMANS); dark limestones with Martinia sp., Subulites sp., etc.; coarse micaceous calcareous sandstone with Chonetes sp., Proetus sp. (TEICHERT). South of the Carstensz summits a complex of conglomeratic, sandy and clayey rocks with Brachiopoda (Dozy). 
Devonian. 

Upper-Devonian: Brown, beige, and white sandstones with Spirifer (Ado/jia), Retzia sp., Wi/sonia sp., Goniophora sp., etc. (FEUILLETAU DE BRUYN, TEICHERT). 

Middle- (and? Lower-) Devonian: Gray, fine calcareous limestones with Favosites reticulatus (DE BLv.), Fav. sp. GERTH 1927, Cystiphyllum sp., Cyathophyllum douvillei FRECH, and Brachiopoda; dark gray sandy limestones with Heliolithes barrandei PEN.; Favosites sp. GERTH 1927, and Cystiphyllum, 
Silurian. 

Upper-Silurian: Green limestones with Hallysites wallichi REED (TEICHERT, MUSPER). 

The thickness of these paleozoic deposits in the geosyncline of the Snow Mountain Range is prob- ably considerable. In the section of the southern slope of the Carstensz summits drawn by Dozy (1939), the paleozoic strata have a thickness of 1500 m, presumably only representing a part of the Young Paleozoic. 

'''2. PERMO-CARBONIFEROUS OF BORNEO''' 
According to ZEYLMANS VAN EMMICHOVEN (1938, p. 37), the Permo-Carboniferous of West and Central Borneo occurs in a volcanic and a non- volcanic facies: 

&quot;The normal sedimentary facies is especially charac- terized by frequent occurrence of siliceous rocks (chert, siliceous slate, jasper and jasperoid), Non-silicified rocks are phyllites, slates, light coloured dense clay stones, marls and limestones. The cherts may have originated by a later intensive silicification of clay shales, which are locally coaly limestones and volcanic rocks. 
The original rocks of the Permo-Carboniferous were predominantly clays (locally with coal beds, elsewhere with many plant remains), fine granular clay-sandstones, and subordinate limestones. No primary siliceous rocks were deposited, as was assumed by MOLENGRAAFF (1900) for the Danau Formation, at least not in the greater part of this area (Sanggau and the adjacent part of Sarawak). Rather striking is the absence of coarser clastic sediments; only very sporadically detrital material of schists were encountered. 
The permo-carboniferous age is proved in various places by Fusulinidae, found by KREKELER (1932, 1933), determined by ZEYLMANS V. E. and confirmed by TAN SIN HOK, in limestones, marbles, jasperoids and combust- ible clay shales, silicified into cherts. Furthermore plants, determined by JONGMANS as quite probable Calamites, possibly from the group of leioderma, and Pecopteris from the group of arborescens. Only the latter fossil plant enables a more accurate determination of the age, namely 
youngest Upper Carboniferous. 	. 
The volcanic facies of the Permo-Carboniferous consists of basic effusiva and ejectamenta. They are nearly always intensively decomposed and altered 1). These rocks are completely identic to the igneous rocks of the Pulu Melaju Zone of MOLENGRAAFF'S Danau Formation. These volcanic complexes have in numerous places supplied their detritus to upper-triassic deposits, which proves their pre-upper- triassic age. Moreover, in some places, their transition into and association with the permo-carboniferous cherts is quite probable. Therefore, their permo-carboniferous age can hardly be doubted.</text>

== animated videos ==

I am only interested in working on wikibooks if we are allowed to embed some media (i.e. animated gifs or short &lt;3min relatively language free soundless videos), which would of course be subject to discussion and change, but not immediately discarded as in wikipedia. Is this encouraged or discouraged? Thank-you. Linda Fahlberg-Stojanovska [[User:Lfahlberg|Lfahlberg]] ([[User talk:Lfahlberg|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lfahlberg|contribs]]) 19:28, 24 June 2013 (UTC)

: @[[User:Lfahlberg|Lfahlberg]] : Yes, you can embed animated video into a wikibook -- for example, [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating animated GIFs using Blender and Gimp]].
: Go ahead and begin.
: (I suspect that people at Wikibooks and Wikiversity might decide that Wikiversity is a better place for such media -- for example, [[Wikiversity: action potentials]]. Since it's so easy to move stuff from Wikibooks to Wikiversity, I think it's better to flip a coin and start posting right away, and then later let the people who worry about such things move it to the &quot;right&quot; place. Rather than spend a lot of time trying to figure out which is the best place before you begin).
: I wish you great success. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 17:29, 2 August 2013 (UTC)
== Adding a duplicate recipe? ==

I have my own recipe for fried green tomatoes with a step by step photo tutorial as well and it is quite different from the one already in the wiki cookbook. May I add it to the cook book as well and if so can I title it Fried Green Tomatoes 2 or how should I do that? Also, do you have a help template here like they have on english wiki? Basically you type { {helpme} } (without the additional spaces between the {{ I did that just so it will show all the text) above a help me question post you leave and it calls attention to a more experienced editor to help you. Thanks &lt;span&gt;[[User:Tattoodwaitress|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;TattØØdẄaitre§&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Tattoodwaitress|&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt; lĖTŝ tÅLĶ&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;'' 14:47, 22 July 2013 (UTC)
:Yes, although I would encourage you to use a better name (e.g., Fried Green Tomatoes Italian Style) [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 11:28, 7 August 2013 (UTC)
== Attaching .ODT guide ==

I made a guide for making an easy to make, low cost working model of a spectroscope. The guide (two actually - one in Hebrew and one in English) is in LibreOffice ODT format. Can I upload it here 'as is' so it will be available as an educational guide for everyone. I understand and accept the attribute-share-alike licensing.

:No I'm afraid you can't for two reasons: the software does not support that file type; it defeats the purpose of a wiki as nobody can edit it. Sorry.

== Is wikitabs.org anything to do with Wikimedia and associated sites? ==

There's a chapter in the Guitar book that is purely links to external sites. Here's the link:

[[Guitar/Song_Library]]

There's the usual ultimateguitar.com links but also wikitabs.org. I want to know if this wikitabs site is part of Wikipedia et al. 

The chapter is also full of links to tabs generated by: http://bettylou.zzruss.com/

I don't know what to make of all this. This chapter seems to be an external link directory. This is meant to be a book about the guitar not a search engine or link directory. I've added a deletion request.

So it wikitabs.org part of Wikipedia et al?

Also why have they nested the chapters?. You click on Song Library and get presented with a whole chapter dedicated to displaying three links.  

cheers

Hello everyone, I've just joined and I'm very new to Wikibooks? Where do I start? How much can one spread out with editing? What's appropriate for beginners? Would appreciate your input! Thanks.

== LaTeX Export Done ==

Hello,
most of the featured books on this site now got PDF versions generated with the [[LaTeX]] typesetting software. The open source conversion software ([http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf mediawiki2latex]) is available on Debian GNU Linux Sid as well as Ubuntu Saucy Salamander as well as Windows XP or higher. Furthermore the LaTeX sources are attached to the PDF files.

== Personal development book ==

As far as I see, currently there isn't any single book about personal development or productivity. Topics that could be dealt with in such a book include:
* [[wikiHow:Simplify-Your-Life]]
* [[wikiHow:Make-a-Life-Plan]]
* [[wikiHow:Manage-Your-Time]]

There isn't any WikiProject for lifestyle either. Doesn't such a topic suit in Wikibooks or hasn't there been just nobody willing to write a book on such a topic until now?--[[User:Yuwash|Yuwash]] ([[User talk:Yuwash|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yuwash|contribs]]) 17:27, 18 August 2013 (UTC)

::Thanks! That's like what I was looking for. Though many interesting ones are still in “freshly started” or “partly developed” stadium, the books do already provide some useful contents. I can't figure out the reason why there are so few writers on these topics here, while there are tons of blogs and sites about this around. (wikihow and [[wikia:how-to:How_To]] are the only wikis though)--[[User:Yuwash|Yuwash]] ([[User talk:Yuwash|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yuwash|contribs]]) 18:24, 18 August 2013 (UTC)</text>

Please keep in mind that in these basic lessons, we are not including USTED. For basics, we feel as though you are speaking to your peers. USTED is a term saved for people whom you are speaking with the utmost respect. Though it is nice to know, for beginning Spanish learners, it may be too confusing to learn. For example: ¿Como se llama? may be referring to USTED or EL/ELLA depending on the context.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Opinion seeking (alpha &gt; 0.8) ==
=== Description ===

The authors conducted five studies to develop two scales: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Opinion leadership|opinion leadership]] and opinion seeking. Hereby, data from more than 1,100 respondents were used. The authors strived for unidimensionality, reliability, construct validity, and criterion-related validity.

=== Definition ===

Opinion seeking happens when individuals search out advice from others when making a purchase decision.

=== Items ===

This short questionnaire is about popular rock music and rock music recordings [fashion; environmentally friendly products]. Please read each statement carefully. For each of the statements below, please circle the number that most closely matches your view of the opinions stated. The items are scaled from 1 to 7, with a higher number meaning stronger agreement.

*When I consider buying a CD or tape [clothes; &quot;green&quot; products], I ask other people for advice.
*I don't need to talk to others before I buy CDs or tapes [fashionable clothing; products that are good for the environment].
*I rarely ask other people what music [fashions; environmentally friendly products] to buy.
*I like to get others' opinions before I buy a CD or tape [new clothes; &quot;green&quot; products].
*I feel more comfortable buying a recording [fashion item; product that is good for the environment] when I have gotten other people's opinions on it.
*When choosing rock music [fashionable clothing; a &quot;green&quot; product], other people's opinions are not important to me.

Some items are reverse-coded.

Hereby, data from more than 1,100 respondents were used. The authors strived for unidimensionality, reliability, construct validity, and criterion-related validity.

=== Definition ===

Opinion leadership occurs when individuals try to influence the purchasing behavior of other consumers in specific product fields.

=== Items ===

This short questionnaire is about popular rock music and rock music recordings [fashion; environmentally friendly products]. Please read each statement carefully. For each of the statements below, please circle the number that most closely matches your view of the opinions stated. The items are scaled from 1 to 7, with a higher number meaning stronger agreement.

*My opinion on rock [fashion; environmentally friendly products] seems not to count with other people.
*When they choose a rock music recording [fashionable clothing; &quot;green&quot; products], other people do not turn to me for advice.
*Other people [rarely] come to me for advice about choosing CDs and tapes [fashionable clothing; products that are good for the environment].
*People that I know pick rock music [clothing; &quot;green&quot; products] based on what I have told them.
*I often persuade other people to buy the rock music [fashions; &quot;green&quot; products] that I like.
*I often influence people's opinions about popular rock [clothing; environmentally correct products].

Some items are reverse-coded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Guarani (avañe'ẽ), specifically the primary variety known as Paraguayan Guarani, is an indigenous language of South America that belongs to the Tupí–Guaraní subfamily of the Tupian languages. It is one of the official languages of Paraguay (along with Spanish), where it is spoken by the majority of the population, and where half of the rural population is monolingual. It is spoken by communities in neighbouring countries, including parts of northeastern Argentina, southeastern Bolivia and southwestern Brazil, and is a second official language of the Argentine province of Corrientes since 2004. It is also an official language of Mercosur, by a total of over 4 million speakers.

Guarani is distinguished by its rhythm, due to the avoidance of combinations between two consonants or two vowels and its regular prosody. It is also distinguished by its unique nasal harmony, with processes that make both consonants and vowels be nasalised.

      <comment>/* Pu'ae jurugua (oral vowels) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Despite the presence of Guarani words in texts by explorers such as Italian Antonio Pigafetta and German Hans Staden, the ''achegety'', the Guarani alphabet, would only be standardised in 1867, with the modern orthography being officialised only in 1950, in the ''Congreso de la Lengua Guaraní de Montevideo''. Here are the 33 letters, in alphabetical order:

'''A, Ã, CH, E, Ẽ, G, G̃, H, I, Ĩ, J, K, L, M, MB, N, ND, NG, NT, Ñ, O, Õ, P, R, RR, S, T, U, Ű, V, Y, Ỹ, ' '''

==Pu'ae (vowels)==

===Pu'ae jurugua (oral vowels)===

They all sound like their Spanish, Italian, Finnish, Portuguese or French counterpart.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Letter
! IPA
! Pronunciation of the letter (English approximation)
|-
|A a
|{{IPA|a}}
|Like ''a'' in ''father''
|-
|E e
|{{IPA|e}}
|Almost like in ''say'', but a single release
|-
|I i
|{{IPA|i}}
|Like in ''see''
|-
|O o
|{{IPA|o}}
|Like in ''low'', but a single release
|-
|U u
|{{IPA|u}}
|Like in ''you''
|}

===Pu'ae ahy'ogua (guttural vowel)===

Y is considered apart other oral vowels in Guarani. Its IPA symbol is /ɨ/.

The pronunciation of '''y''' is like that of the ''e'' in ''roses'' in some dialects. It is a schwa, that is, a reduced and weak sound, but it is close to the English ''i'' in ''bit'', with some articulation resembling ''u''.

===Pu'ae tĩgua (nasal vowels)===

Some vowels in Guarani are nasal, that is, they need nose vibration. This is represented with a tilde (~), both in orthography and IPA.

===Pu'ae ahy'otĩgua (nasal and guttural vowel)===

The process above also happens to y.

==Pundie (consonants)==

===Pundie jurugua (oral consonants)===

|-
|Gu gu
|{{IPA|w}}

|-
|H h

|Unaspirated like in ''squadron'', with a weak semivowel
|-
|P p

|Unaspirated like in ''sport''
|-
|R r

|-
|V v

===Nasal harmony===

Guaraní displays an unusual degree of nasal harmony. A nasal syllable consists of a nasal vowel, and if the consonant is voiced, it takes its nasal allophone. If a stressed syllable is nasal, the nasality spreads in both directions until it bumps up against a stressed syllable that is oral. This includes affixes, postpositions, and compounding. Voiceless consonants do not have nasal allophones, but they do not interrupt the spread of nasality.

Most oral consonants consonants change nothing when they undergo nasal harmony. However, ''g'', ''gu'', ''r'' and ''v'' have a nasal release.

''M'', ''n'' and ''ñ'' only exist as nasal allophones, that is, the form other consonants assume after undergoing nasal harmony. They are transformations of, respectively, ''mb'', ''nd'' and ''j''.

''Ng'' and ''ngu'' do not change form when they undergo nasal harmony, but their form of a weak ''ng'' followed by a strong ''g'' becomes that of a simple strong ''ng'', ''ngu'' mantaining the weak ''w'' following it.

==Accent==

The tilde and the accent mark tonic syllables. If neither of them appear, the accent falls on the last syllable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* The first letter of roots is here capitalised, to make comprehension easier

== Vocabulario — Ñe’endy ==

* '''Maitei''' – salutation
* '''Maitei(kuéra)''' – salutations
* '''Momaitei''' – to salute
* '''Mba’éichapa''' – Hello, how are you (generic salutation)
* '''Aguyje''' – thank you
* '''che Maitei''' (atonic ''che'') – my salutation
* '''nde Maitei''' (atonic ''nde'') – your salutation (singular)
* '''iMaitei''' – his/her/their salutation
* '''Ñande Maitei''' – our salutation (also yours)
* '''Ore Maitei''' – nuestro saludo (not yours)
* '''Pende Maitei''' – your salutation (plural)
* '''Imaiteikuéra''' – sus saludos
* '''Karai''' – mister
* '''Che''' – I (tonic)
* '''che''' (atonic prefix) – my
* '''Nde''' (tonic) – you (singular)
* '''nde''' (atonic prefix) – your (singular)
* '''ndéve''' – to you
* '''+pa''' – atonic interrogation sufix
* '''+piko''' – atonic emphatic interrogation suffix
* '''Ha''' – and
* '''Avei''' – also

The distinction between &quot;Ore&quot; and &quot;Ñande&quot; is on whether the person being addressed is included or not.

=== Sentences ===

* '''to G̃uahe ndéve che Maitei''' – may my salutations get to you
* '''Che Aguijevete ndéve''' – thank you very much
* '''Che Aguijevete ndéve nde Maitei''' – I thank your salutations a lot

== First dialogue ==
 
One does not need to write question marks in Guarani, since suffixes already denote questions.

Dos personas se encuentran, Juan y Pedro, que no se conocen. Pedro es un hombre adulto, un ''Karai'' (señor).

: Juan: '''Mba’éichapa Karai.''' – How are you, sir?
: Pedro: '''iPorãnte, Ha Nde.''' – I'm fine, what about you?
: Juan: '''Ha iPorãnte Avei.''' – I'm fine too.

== Second dialogue ==

With &quot;Ha'e&quot;, optional, names are asked. This word means &quot;to be&quot;.

: Juan: '''Mba'éichapa nde Réra.''' – What's your name?
: Pedro: '''che Rera (ha’e) Pedro, Ha Nde.''' – My name is Pedro, and yours?
: Juan: '''Che (ha’e) Juan''' – I'm Juan.

== Third dialogue ==
 
&quot;Piko&quot; as a question marker and &quot;niko&quot; as a noun conector, meaning &quot;to be&quot;.

: Juan: '''¡Mba’éichapa! Máva piko Nde?''' – Hello, how are you?
: Pedro: '''Che niko Pedro, Ha Nde.''' – I'm Pedro, and you?
: Juan: '''Ha Che niko Juan.''' – I'm Juan.

Notice how &quot;Ha&quot; is used, with the sense of addition.

== Conjugation of Maitei and moMaitei ==

Strictly, '''Maitei''' (“saludar”) is an ''intransitive'' verb (it cannot take direct object) and '''moMaitei''' (''mo''+''Maitei'') is ''transitive'' (it must take an object).

In the present tense, we do not have to use a particle to express tense, just person and number.

* '''(Che) aMaitei''' – I salute
* '''(Nde) reMaitei''' – you (singular) salute
* '''(Ha'e) oMaitei''' – he/she salutes
* '''(Ñandé) ñaMaitei''' – we (including you) salute
* '''(Oré) roMaitei''' – we (you not) salute
* '''(Peê) peMaitei''' – you (plural) salute
* '''(Ha’eKuéra) oMaitei''' – they salute

Let us see a sentence with '''moMaitei'''.

* '''AmoMaitei Perupe''' – I salute Perupe.

If the intention is to use the future, the suffix '''-ta''' should be used.

* '''ÑamoMaiteita ñande Sýpe''' – We (including you) will salute our (also yours) mother.
* '''AMaiteita''' - I will salute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Why Learn About Computers?=


Today's world runs on computers. Just about every aspect of modern life involves a computer in some way or another. Those people who do not have experience with computers and software are at a severe disadvantage in work, leisure and daily life. As technology is advancing, the scale of computer use is indeed increasing. Computers, widely known, are used by big companies as well as individuals. Computers are efficient. They ease people's onerous jobs by offering them handful software and applications,designed to offer more convenience. To illustrate, rather than writing manually by hands, an author can benefit from the use of Microsoft Word. With the facilities Microsoft Word provides such as word counter and vocabulary and grammar checker, the author can save his time thus able to finish within his deadline. Moreover, computers are able to perform difficult tasks with better calculations. 

[[File:Popular_Social_Networks,_Gavin_Llewellyn,_CC.jpg|thumb|Technology Is the Future]]

Computers offer a quicker way to gain information which is by providing an internet access. Up to this moment, many internet browsers and applications have been invented, for instance, Mozilla Firefox, Google search engine and Microsoft Outlook to organize emails. These applications surely contribute a lot to a much easier way to gain information. 

Computer skills are required to be hired in companies these days. Imagine if two candidates are interviewed, one of which knows nothing about computers while the other does. The employer will definitely hire the latter. Furthermore, with computer skills, one can build his own company and expand his business. He could perhaps work online and export his goods or service.

=Computers at Home=

A computer is a good product to have at home. There are so many benefits to owning your own computer. It allows you to be able to write letters, articles, stories, reports and other things easier and faster. If you own a printer, you can easily write a letter to a friend or family member, print it out and send it to them. You can save your written documents on your home computer and have easy access to them when you need them again.

Having a computer at home allows you to have access to work from home jobs such as research, data entry, writing and other work-from-home jobs. With a computer at home, you can easily communicate with friends and family through email, social networks and instant messaging. Using a computer to communicate is cheaper than calling friends and family long distance. You can also communicate with co-workers, your boss and anyone else you meet on the Internet through your own computer.

People usually go to the library for their research. If you have your own computer at home, you don't have to travel to the library when you need to research something. Log on to the Internet and research whatever you need with your computer at home. When you need to know something fast you can look it up on Google or your favorite search engine. Having a computer at home gives you access to learning all kinds of things through research. This will save you on gas charges instead of having to drive to the library.

[[File:Lemote_computers.jpg|thumb|Home Computer Benefits]]

Having a computer at home means your own personal entertainment source. There are literally thousands of games on the Internet which you can play anytime you want to. You can also watch movies and your favorite TV shows on DVDs. You can also join social networks and interact with your friends on a daily basis.

With a computer at home and the Internet, students can now get a college degree from home. There are a lot of different schools that allow students to take college classes online. Using a computer and the Internet can get you a degree at your own pace and faster than going to a college campus.

=Computers in Education=
[[File:FPL's Computer lab.jpg|thumb|FPL's Computer lab]]
At most colleges and universities, their students are familiar with blackboard &lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackboard.com&lt;/ref&gt;, a course management system that is used quite frequently in order to stay in touch with teachers, figure out homework assignments, and keep track of grades. While not all classes utilize this technology, it can be very helpful especially for online courses. With technology growing and advancing so far forward we now have the ability to learn and take classes from the comfort of our own home. 

While many students still go on campus, there is no shortage of computers. 
Most colleges have at least one mega lab with nearly a hundred computers. But if you wish to bring your own laptop there are plenty of wireless hot spots where you could get a connection to the internet from anywhere on campus. 
Understandably lugging textbooks around campus may seem exhausting and tiring, you now have the option to get an electronic eBook of most textbooks needed for class.

=Computers on the Job=

If you have seen any older movie (or SpongeBob) you have probably seen people getting to work grabbing their time card and getting it stamped to show what time they have arrived at work. This is called an authentication system or timesheet&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia: Timesheet]]&lt;/ref&gt;. While now the authentication system is more digital than before, the concept still applies. This isn't the only use of computers on the job or at work in general. For instance say there is a presentation you must give to the board of directors, you might want to make a PowerPoint&lt;ref&gt;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/&lt;/ref&gt; to give visuals to help drive home your point. Or perhaps you work retail and the pair of pants a customer wants is out of stock, you could easily order it online for them, and minimize the headache of shopping for those who hardly shop. Whatever the case, computers can help.

=Portable Computers=

[[File:HP Presario F700.jpg|thumb|Laptop]]

Portable computers are compact and fully functioning versions of a regular desktop computer that are designed to be mobile. While they rely on rechargeable batteries or an electrical outlet for power, they allow a person the freedom to move around while still being productive. Their mobility alongside their ability to operate similar to a desktop make them powerful tools for businessmen, students, and common individuals alike. Whether giving or preparing a project or presentation, taking notes or studying online, or simply connecting to the internet from a cafe, portable computers have become essential for individuals who wish to work, study, or play on the go. Portable computers come in three basic versions which include the laptop, tablet, and netbook.
 
[[File:Tablet.jpg|thumb|Tablet]]

Laptops are thin computers that contain a keyboard and monitor folded on top of each other so that the top half is the visual display and the bottom half is the input. Laptops are commonly called &quot;notebooks&quot; do to this folding feature and their thin appearance. Recently, touch screens have been introduced into some laptops allowing some operating systems like Windows 8 to open applications with the touch of a finger. While laptops are comparable to desktops in their use, their smaller size results in some small amounts of the computing power and functionality being lost. However, their compact size allows them to be stored when not in use and the familiar &quot;nest&quot; of wires associated with linking up a desktop is reduced to a single power cord. Laptops are also better at &quot;creating&quot; fully functional content when compared to a Tablet or Mobile Device (such as a cell phone). If you require the ability to write reports or long e-mails, to use a spreadsheet in order to crunch numbers, to create a &quot;PowerPoint&quot; presentation, to rearrange music libraries or photo albums, or to edit pictures then you will need a desktop, laptop or a netbook. Tablets and Mobile Devices are more designed to consume content than to create.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2364302,00.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 



Tablets are smaller than laptop PCs, very lightweight, and extremely easy to carry, but they lack the processing power of a laptop as well as a keyboard input. They rely, instead, on a stylus and touch screen. For those who are hardcore gamers, giving business presentations, or conducting heavy research a tablet doesn't offer the speed and efficiency that is needed to complete these tasks. However, if a person is more of a casual internet surfer or &quot;lightweight&quot; game player then a tablet can handle what computing is needed to do this. They can browse the web relatively easy and stream movies or Youtube videos too. It should also be noted that tablets have become handy for other lightweight tasks involved with simple music/DJ production like FX and mixing as well as live sequencing. Some artists and designers are now using their tablets for preliminary sketches that they transfer into design software and programs on a full powered laptop later on as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-vs-tablet/&lt;/ref&gt;

Netbooks are similar to laptops but differ in size as well as processing. While netbooks are smaller versions of laptops, they have been designed, to the best of their ability, to have the same functionality as laptops and PCs. A netbook's computer display will rarely reach above 10&quot; or 12&quot;, and are more commonly smaller than this, whereas some laptops can contain up to 15.5&quot; of display screen. Netbooks have been around since 2008, roughly, and have revolved around their ability to connect to mobile networks such as the wifi at your local cafe or restaurant. Because of this feature, it has changed the laptop industry and has been heralded as a revolutionary and pivotal focal point in the production of laptops and netbooks. Since then this capability has now become a standard among both. Even though they don't maintain some of the functionality and computing power as their desktop and laptop counterparts, they are still capable of word processing, mathematical computation, and other productivity programs that businessmen and students use. On top of that, they are also extremely durable and affordable which make them perfect for educational tools. Students will find them easy to manage, organize, and carry around as well as a &quot;distraction free&quot; resource because of their minimalistic capabilities. Couple these advantages with internet access to mobile hotspots such as school libraries and it can be easily seen why this device had dominated the market for so long. It has only been a recent trend for individuals to pick up the tablet despite it's rudimentary processing power and it has been speculated that this is due to the tablet's sleek design and effective marketing strategy toward the younger generation. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/what-is-a-netbook/#eventbody1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Embedded Computers ==
[[File:Room Thermostat Vaillant.jpg|thumb|Thermostat Embedded Computer]]

An embedded computer is a mini computer with a specific function within a product that completes detailed tasks or jobs for that product.  Often times, individuals do not realize how many objects have embedded computers enclosed in them.  Some examples of embedded computers used in households include, remote controls, heating pads, digital clocks, washing machines, and microwaves.  Others include Bluetooth capabilities in cars, camera traffic lights, and Red Box machines.  Surprisingly, a pregnancy test is also considered a simple, yet complicated embedded computer. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2379383,00.asp &lt;/ref&gt;  Embedded computers are developed to do one particular duty, and therefore a regular computer cannot act as an embedded computer. 


== Mobile Devices ==
[[File:Iphone 2.jpg|thumb|Smartphone Mobile Device]]

A mobile device is a handheld tablet or other device that is made for portability, and is therefore both compact and lightweight.  New data storage, processing and display technologies have allowed these small devices to do nearly anything that had previously been traditionally done with larger personal computers.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.techopedia.com/definition/23586/mobile-device &lt;/ref&gt; These mobile devices are capable of numerous tasks including making phone calls, sending text messages, viewing Web pages, playing games, downloading music, taking digital photos, and watching TV shows and movies.  With our ever-growing world of technology, mobile devices are at the tips of our fingers.  Questions can be answered, maps can be observed, and weather can be checked.  Of the many mobile devices used today, smartphones are the most common form of device.  They have Internet capabilities along with the extensive list above.  Tablet devices do not have all the capabilities smartphones have, but they are used for Web browsing, gaming, taking digital photos, and playing movies as well as TV shows.  Mobile devices are now a big part of people’s everyday lives.  Google stated, “The mobile phone might be the world’s most ubiquitous device…” (www.thinkwithgoogle.com/insights/uploads/940910.pdf/download/)‎. This shows how technology will keep improving, to become the some of the most widely used devices around.  



== Personal Computers ==
[[File: Laptop.svg|thumb|Laptop- Personal Computer]]
A personal computer is a computer that is mainly for individual use. Before personal computers, computers were designed for companies who would then attach terminals that would allow for more than one user to a single large computer and the resources were shared among all users. The first personal computers came out around the 1970s. The most popular of the time was the Apple II, which came out in 1977 from Apple Computer. In 1981, IBM came out with its first personal computer. IBM PC took over the market and it was what most people bought.  Personal computers use single-user systems and are based on microprocessors. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/personal_computer.html &lt;/ref&gt; Many people do link their personal computers together to create a network.  Most personal computers are made up of a central processing unit, control circuitry on an integrated circuit, and various input/output devices. It also contains two types of memory; main memory and auxiliary memory. The sales of personal computers has grown tremendously over the years, according to Michael Dell in 2005 there were 240 millions personal computers sold worldwide. &lt;ref&gt; http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/personal-computer-PC &lt;/ref&gt; The sale of personal computers will, likely, continue to increase. 


== Midrange Servers ==
[[File:Overton's Computer Lab.jpg|thumb|School computer lab using a midrange server]]

Midrange servers are used more for networks, such as in hospitals or a school computer lab. Midrange servers started to become popular in the 1990s. Midrange servers come in between entry-level servers and mainframe computers. They tend to have more memory capacity, processing power, and room for expansion. Another kind of midrange servers are special home servers and they are designed for the home and they link all the content from all the computers onto one network. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.techopedia.com/definition/14471/midrange &lt;/ref&gt; Something that is happening more frequently with midrange servers is something called virtualizion. It involves splitting had drives and creating two separate hard drives. It can also involve server virtualizion which is splitting the physical server into smaller virtual servers. Virtualization helps companies to use fewer servers and that leads them to reduced costs and less server management.  &lt;ref&gt; http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/virtualization &lt;/ref&gt;


== Mainframe Computers ==
[[File:Dec_pdp-6.lg.jpg|thumb|Early mainframe computer]]
Mainframe Computers are much larger computers that consolidate the needs of large organizations like universities, hospitals, banks, government offices, etc. These much more powerful and expensive computers are usually stored in data centers where they connect to all the other computers using a computer network. From this room a single mainframe can serve thousands of users on the same network. Early mainframe computers were first produced in the 1950s due to the increasing processing demands of growing businesses. From then on, these mainframes have increased in power and improved in size.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/172 &lt;/ref&gt; However, with more processing power, this requires more energy consumption, leading computer manufacturers to focus more on energy efficiency in these new computers. Manufacturers also began bundling free software with their mainframe computers as an incentive to help compete against other computer manufacturers. Eventually, a lot of these programs and several new ones were offered as separate products that they could sell rather than just giving them away for free.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/172 &lt;/ref&gt; Today, mainframe manufacturers use advances in technology to further improve the power and efficiency of their computers, one important being virtualization, creating several virtual servers rather than physical ones that take up space.

== The History of the Internet ==

The history of the internet begins in 1962 with J.C.R. Licklider’s memos about an Intergalactic Network idea, in which users around the world are connected and can access programs and data. With colleagues, he forms a research program called Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). After an experiment with an air travel reservation system, the first communication satellite is launched that can allow machines to exchange data. Soon, IBM introduces System 360 computers into the market which becomes remarkably popular. American Airlines debuts IBM’s SABRE air travel reservation system to process on-line transactions, which links over 50 cities through telephone lines (1964). [[File:Macintosh_classic.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Original Macintosh Computer]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/&lt;/ref&gt; By 1965 the first wide-area network connection is established by Larry Roberts and Thomas Marill. Over the next four years, the Network Working Group works diligently, creating a router, a modem, and even experimenting with monitors. On October 29, 1969 the first host-to-host connection was made! Then, over 3 years, memory, speed, processing, and communication capabilities are tested and refined and protocols are made. By 1973, 30 institutions are connected to the network called ARPANET.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/internet_history_70s.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak announce the Apple II computer, opening the consumer and small business market for computers. This led to the creation of more modems for dial up services. A computer science research network called USENET sets up a server where newsgroups can post to, in 1979. A year later an email only service opens. Less than a decade later, 30,000 networks are on the internet due to the advances with computers, including the new Macintosh computer and the use of Ethernet. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/internet_history_80s.html&lt;/ref&gt; Within 2 years the number of hosts jumps to over 160,000! By 1991 over 600,000 hosts are connected in over 100 countries! &lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/internet_history_90s.html&lt;/ref&gt; In just 30 years the hypothetical concept J.C.R. Licklider once toyed with has become a part of everyday life! A lot of experimenting and funding went into the creation of this remarkable &quot;cyberspace.&quot;

== From ISP to URL ==
[[File:Fingerprint - Central Pocket Loop Whorl.jpg|thumb|Domain names are like fingerprints; no two are alike.]]
Now that you know the history of how the internet came to be, it's time to start exploring. You double-click your browser of choice, the screen opens up... and you start drawing blanks. 'Where do I go from here?' you might start asking yourself. Just take a deep breath; using the internet isn't as complicated as you might think. The most important thing to understand before you start browsing through the cornucopia of online resources is the internet address. Just like a street name and number is necessary if you want to visit a friend, the internet address in the top and leftmost white bar is necessary to take you wherever you'd like to go online. The two parts that make up an address are the URL and the domain name. The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) uniquely identifies a specific Web page and is the http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or https (Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol) part of the web address. Everything that you type after the URL is the domain name, which is defined as the textual method of identifying computers available through the internet. If you want to have your own website, you have to buy the domain name and then build upon your address. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalserviceresources.org/understanding%20-urls-and-domain%20-names&lt;/ref&gt; The most interesting tidbit about domain names is that, just like fingerprints, no two can ever be the same.

== Internet Communication ==
[[File:Facebook_icon.jpg|thumb|]]In today's technologically booming society, there are hundreds of ways we are connected to computers and the Internet every day. We use computer networks (collections of computers and other devices that are connected together to enable users to share multiple forms of information)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techopedia.com/definition/25597/computer-network&lt;/ref&gt; on a daily basis. While it is not always free to do so, such as having to pay an Internet service provider (ISP), there are many places that offer free wifi to people in their area. Today, we mostly use networks for social media, communication, and spreading of information. Think of the networks in your life. I'm guessing something like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn came to mind along with many others&lt;ref&gt;http://socialmediatoday.com/soravjain/195917/40-most-popular-social-networking-sites-world&lt;/ref&gt;. These are all networks that allow us to share information whether it be personal, images, news stories, surveys, information on new products, etc., these networks have become engrained into our daily lives and most people see them as helpful devices for distance communication and spreading of ideas. Another way we use the Internet for communication is through email. Most people today have an email address because they are required for registration for many different things we use on a daily basis (such as the networks previously listed)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.email-brokers.com/en/emailing-business-strategy&lt;/ref&gt;. Today's evolving technology is making it easier to access things like networks and email through all of the mobile devices available and the use of apps or condensed mobile versions of the full desktop websites. All in all, the Internet and computer have changed our world in forms of communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Data and Program Representation=
==Digital data and numerical data==

Most computers are digital computers which use a specific language to communicate within itself in order to process information. If there are programs running in the background or a person is typing up a word document for example, the computer needs to be able to interpret the data that is being put into it by the human as well as communicate to working components within itself. This language that digital computers use is called binary code and is a very basic form of language composed of only two figures; 1 and 0. Whereas the English language is composed of 26 figures which we commonly call the alphabet, computers use a language composed of only two figures, hence its name Binary Code. Binary literally means two and refers to anything that consists of, involves, or indicates two.[[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/binary?s=t]] The language known as Binary Code operates on a system of 1's and 0's strung together in order to form &quot;bits&quot; of information needed for computing. &quot;Bits&quot; are the smallest unit of data that a binary computer can recognize and every action, memory, storage, or computation that is done through a computer is composed of them. From playing music through your speakers to cropping a photograph, to typing up a document and preparing an important presentation all the way down the line to browsing the internet or picking up on a wifi signal in your area, everything uses &quot;bits&quot; to complete the task needed. &quot;Bits&quot; string into larger lines of information the way letters string into words and then sentences. When &quot;bits&quot; are compounded in this way they are then referred to as &quot;bytes&quot;. 

&quot;Bytes&quot;, which are made up of &quot;bits&quot;, are commonly used when referring to the size of the information being provided. For example, a song that is downloaded may contain several kilobytes or perhaps even a few megabytes if it is a whole c.d. and not just a single track. Likewise, pictures and all other documents in general are stored on the computer based on their size or amount of bytes they contain. The amount of information that can be stored onto a computer is also shown or displayed in bytes as is the amount left on a computer after certain programs or documents have been stored. Since bytes can be extremely long, we have come up with prefixes that signify how large they are. These prefixes increase by three units of ten so that a Kilobyte represents 1,000 bytes, a Megabyte represents 1,000,000 bytes or one million bytes, a Gigabyte represents 1,0000,000,000 or one billion bytes, etc. Computers components have become so small that we can now store larger and larger amounts of data bytes in the same size computers resulting in the use of other larger prefixes such as Tera, Peta, Exa, Zetta, and Yotta. Below is a chart outlining the name of the prefix used and powers of ten they symbolize.[[http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/education/k12/the-journey-inside/explore-the-curriculum/digital-information/lesson1.html]]

(from the [[w:SI|SI]] page on Wikipedia): 

{{SIUnits}}

Representing data in a way that can be understood by a digital computer is called Digital Representation and Binary Code is the most commonly used form of this. Binary Code is a Numerical Representation of data that uses only 1 and 0 to represent every possible number. Mathematics uses 10 symbols ranging from 1 TO 0 and include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as well. This Numerical Representation of data is called the decimal numbering system because it uses ten symbols. As shown on the chart, the prefix deci symbolizes ten. In both systems, the position of each digit determines to which power that number is raised. In the deci-mal system each digit is raised by ten so that the first column equals 1 (10^1) or ten raised to the zero power, the second column equals 10 (10^2) or ten raised to the first power, the third column equals 100 (10^3) or ten raised to the third power and so on. However, since Binary Code only operates with two symbols, each digit is a power of two instead of ten. In binary the first column equals 1 (2^0) or two raised to the zero power, the second column equals 2 (2^1) or two raised to the first power, the third column equals 4 (2^2) or two raised to the second power, the fourth column equals 8 (2^3) or two raised to the third power, and so forth. Because the Binary system takes advantage of so few symbols, the result is that more positions for digits are used to express the same number than in decimal form, leaving long lines of information for even the simplest expressions.

==Coding systems==

[[File:ASCII Code Chart-Quick ref card.png|thumb|ASCII Code Chart-Quick ref card]] There are a few different coding systems,[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC EBCDIC],[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII ASCII] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode Unicode]. EBCDIC (extended binary coded decimal interchange code) was created for use in mainframes, developed by IBM. The code uses a unique combination of 0’s and 1’s, 8-bits in length, which allows for 256 different combinations. ASCII ( American standard code for information interchange) was created for a more personal use. ASCII uses a 7 bit code, though there is an extended code which adds an extra bit, which nearly doubles the amount of unique characters the code can represent. however Unicode is a much longer string of code, between 8 and 32 bits. With over one million different possibilities, every language can be represented with this code, every mathematical symbol can be represented, every punctuation mark, and every symbol or sign from any culture.

=The System Unit - The Motherboard and CPU=

===Motherboard===

&quot;The motherboard can be thought of as the &quot;back bone&quot; of the computer.&quot; This quote is from the article [http://pcsupport.about.com/od/componentprofiles/p/p_mobo.htm Motherboard]. Inside the system unit contains the motherboard. The motherboard is the &quot;glue&quot; of the computer. It connects the CPU, memory, hard drive, optical drives, video card, and sound card together. The front of the motherboard are peripheral card slots. The slots contain different types of cards which are connected to the motherboard. The left side of the motherboard contain ports. The ports connect to the monitor, printer, keyboard, mouse, speakers, phone line, and network cables. &lt;ref&gt;http://pcsupport.about.com/od/componentprofiles/p/p_mobo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motherboard.JPG|thumb|Motherboard]]

===CPU===

The CPU is the abbreviation for the central processing unit. The computer needs the CPU in order to function correctly. It is known as the brains of the computer where the calculations occur. The microprocessor and the processor are two other names for the central processing unit. The Central processing unit attaches to a CPU socket on the motherboard. A common CPU is called the multi-core CPU. This specific type of CPU is efficient because it allows computers to work on more than one task at a time. Also, these multi core CPU's experience less over heating than the original CPU which causes much less problems to the computer. A typical CPU is two by two inches. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CPU.htmlM&lt;/ref&gt;

=The System Unit - Memory, Buses, Ports=

==Memory==

[[File:DDR RAM-1.jpg|100px|thumb|1 GB RAM Memory Chip]]


Memory is used to store data and programs on a temporary or permanent basis, for computers and other digital electronic devices.  &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory &lt;/ref&gt;  There are two main types of memory storage on a CPU.  &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit &lt;/ref&gt;  These include the random access memory or RAM, and the read-only memory or ROM.


The RAM includes the cache memory and registers, which are volatile (meaning the materials are erased when the power to the computer is shut off).  RAM stores important information for the main memory when the computer is currently running.  This is different than storing a document.  In order to save a file permanently to the computer, one needs to store this on a storage medium so it can be recovered at a later date.  It will still be erased on the RAM, but will be saved elsewhere.  The RAM is measured in bytes, and is typically reliant on how much the CPU can store and hold as well.  An easy analogy to remember RAM is by thinking of a mailbox with different slots.  There are many different areas where things can be placed. 


Registers are temporary for data storage while processing.  These can be accessed more quickly than other memory storage devices for the CPU.  The larger the register, the faster the CPU performs.  Inside the system unit, ROM is attached to the motherboard and is recovered when needed. These files cannot be erased, which is why it is called “read only.”  The contents saved to the ROM are kept, regardless if it has power or not.  &lt;ref&gt; http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/rom.htm &lt;/ref&gt;
Lastly, the flash memory is also a nonvolatile memory chip that is used for storage on a computer.  An interesting thing about flash memory is that it is starting to replace ROM.  Many mobile phones now have flash memory that is embedded into the device.  The reason for this is so the life of the product can be updated.

==Ports==
[[File:Parallel computer printer port.jpg|thumb|Parallel Printer Port]]
Ports are on the outside of the system unit and they are used to connect hardware devices. There are physical ports and virtual ports. A physical port is a physical connection to a computer where data is transferred. It is when something is physically plugged into the computer or some other device. Virtual ports allow software applications to share hardware resources without having to physical connect to each other or to interfere with one another. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.computerports.net/ &lt;/ref&gt; 

Almost all PCs come with a serial RS-232C port or a RS-4222 port and they are used for connecting a modem, mouse, or keyboard. They also have parallel ports that are used to connect printers. These are also considered USB ports because they are physical ports and which standardize communications between computers and peripheral.  USB ports were created in the mid 1990’s; USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. There are also network ports used to connect a computer to a network. Ethernet was developed in the 1980s and it is a system for connecting a number of computer systems to form a local area network. 

A serial port is used to connect modems to personal computers. The term “serial” signifies that data sent in one direction always travels over a single wire within the cable. The last main kind of port is the FireWire, which are used to connect FireWire devices to the computer via a FireWire connector. These are used with mostly digital video cameras and other multimedia devices. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/port.html &lt;/ref&gt;

=How the CPU Works=

===CPU Architecture and Components===
[[File:CPU_supply.jpg|thumb|]]
As previously discussed on this page, the CPU is a complex piece of the computer made up of many parts. The way these parts all fit together inside the CPU is different in each processor but they contain mainly the same parts from device to device. The most abundant part in the CPU would be the transistor. There are millions of transistors within the CPU. Besides these transistors, there are several parts that make up the CPU. some of these inclue the arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) and floating point unit (FPU), the control unit, and the prefetch unit. The ALU is the part of the CPU that deals with the mathematics involving whole numbers and any functions done with those numbers. The FPU takes care of the mathematics with other numbers like fractions, or numbers with decimal places. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.techterms.com/definition/alu&lt;/ref&gt; These two parts work hand in hand, using arithmetic and logical processes, to allow you to perform basically any function you perform on your computer. The control unit takes charge in controlling where and when information is transferred two and from the CPU. When information leaves the control unit, it is usually sent to the ALU/FPU where it can be converted into a process. The prefetch unit, as its name implies, fetches data before it is needed. It uses a sequence of processes to guess what information will be needed next, and have it readily available before the time it needed.

=How the CPU Works=
===The Internal Clock===


Every computer actually has two different clocks. One is the virtual or system clock that runs and is displayed whenever the computer is on and running. &lt;ref&gt;http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/vtpubs/spectrum/sp970911/3b.html&lt;/ref&gt;The other is a real-time clock or hardware clock that runs continuously, and is responsible for tracking the correct time and day.
This device does not count time in days and hours for example. Instead it just runs a counter at  times per second. As far as the century goes, it is the job of the BIOS to track this and save it in the non-volatile memory of the hardware clock. These two clocks run independently on each other. The system clock is physically a small quartz crystal that can be found on  the motherboard. It also helps synchronize all computer functions by sending out signals- or cycles- on a regular basis to all parts. Hertz is the unit of measure used to count the number of cycles per second. For example, one megahertz is one million ticks of the system clock. This clock is very important to the CPU because the higher the CPU clock speed, the more instructions per second it could process. A machine cycle is a term often used when discussing the clock. It has four main parts- fetch, decode, execute, and store.

===Typical CPU Components (continued)===

[[File:A_bus_full_of_USN_tri-athletes.jpg|thumb|Just like a real life bus transports people, the bus interface unit carries information from one destination to another]]

To round up the simplified inventory of a CPU's guts, we have the decode unit, the registers and internal cache memory, and the bus interface unit. Of the remaining three sections of a CPU, the decode unit is easiest to understand because its job immediately follows the job of the prefetch unit. After the prefetch unit collects the data, the decode unit decodes the data into a language that is easier for the ALU/FPU to understand. It does that by consulting a ROM memory that exists inside the CPU, called microcode. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/How-a-CPU-Works/209 &lt;/ref&gt; The registers are used during processing; they're groups of high-speed memory located within the CPU that can be accessed by the ALU and FPU, or for other assorted optimization purposes. While the registers provide the fastest speed of memory, their space is extremely limited. In the cases where the small register space isn't good enough, there are the caches to save the day. The cache is used by the CPU for memory which is being accessed repeatedly, speeding up the access time and having a slightly larger storage than the register. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.moreprocess.com/devices/computer-memory-hierarchy-internal-register-cache-ram-hard-disk-magnetic-tape &lt;/ref&gt; The bus interface unit does exactly what it sounds like; it buses the data back and forth, connecting the core of the CPU to interact with other components. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.electronics.dit.ie/staff/tscarff/BIU/bus_interface_unit.htm &lt;/ref&gt;


=Improving the Performance of Your Computer=

[[File:Hard drive-en.svg|thumb|Computer Hard Drive]]
==Add More Memory and Buy a Larger or Second Hard Drive==
When it comes to technology, there is no question that newer is better. New systems are able to process faster, store more, and run more applications at once. However, it is obviously not within everybody’s means to just run out and purchase the newest and greatest technology the minute it hits the market. Technology is expensive, and therefore it is important to know your options. For example, if you have a computer that is a couple of years old, it is not unreasonable to assume that the hard drive and memory on the system are starting to slow down. However, what many people may not know is that buying a new computer is not the only solution to the problem. You can add memory to your old system simply by purchasing a new memory card and installing it into the computer hardware. By doing this, you are saving money and buying yourself a little bit more time with the computer. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/article/129177/article.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Another way to speed up your computer with out having to invest in a whole new one is by buying a second hard drive. When the original hard drive starts to fill up, one can simply purchase either an internal or external hard drive for the computer and drastically increase the operating speed. &lt;ref&gt;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-or-remove-a-hard-disk-drive&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Internet.png ‎|thumb|Internet Connection]]
==Upgrade Your Internet Connection==
If your system seems to be running poorly while using the internet, you may have to upgrade your internet connection. Upgrading your internet connection may become more costly but there is a significant change in the processor. Your first step would be to discuss any upgrades or check if the provider needs to be enhanced in any way. Then find a browser that is suitable for your connection type. With that being stated, you can change the settings on the router in order to speed up the internet connection. In order to prevent your internet connection becoming slower, it’s highly suggested to have a password in order to access the internet. In addition, every computer owner should provide maintenance to their computer in order to prevent viruses or any bugs the computer may receive but it also prevents an internet connection from being slow. In order to do so, keep up with upgrading and cleaning the computer because the more the computer is trying to maintain, the slower the internet connection may become. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.auslogics.com/en/articles/speed-up-internet/&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Crystal_Clear_app_Internet_Connection_Tools.png ‎|thumb|Video Graphics Card]]
==Upgrade Your Video Graphics Card==
If you notice that your computer is working slowly but not while your internet is running, there may be a problem with your video graphics card. Similar to the process of upgrading your internet connection, there is also a process in checking your graphics processing unit. To approach this problem, you will need to check which graphics processing unit need to be upgrade. To do so, you need to go to start menu, search for ‘cmd’, right click and select ‘run as an administrator’, this will provide you with the command drop. After that, you will need to type in ‘sfc /scannow’ which will search and provide you a list of the components that may need upgrading.  Within the list, find the graphics unit, select hardware you want to upgrade and then select yes to upgrade, which will then upgrade that certain hardware. Within the reading for chapter 2, upgrading your graphics card, it suggests to buy a new graphics card if you are searching for a more drastic change in the graphics processing unit. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsUjQGbHkGc &lt;/ref&gt;

==System Maintenance==
In order for computers to operate at their maximum efficiency, users must be aware of the importance of system maintenance because, over a period of time, one may notice a reduction in system performance. This can be attributed to a number of common factors that lead to the degradation in performance. One major reason is hard drive '''fragmentation'''. As more programs are installed onto the hard drive, the pieces of the files that are on those programs take longer to be located. The longer pieces of the program become shorter and fragmented, leading to a longer waiting period for the user as the computer searches for these scattered pieces. Related to this, although not nearly as detrimental to system performance as fragmentation, is the cluttering of pieces and references to uninstalled programs in the operating system. For Windows users, this occurs in the '''Registry'''. After the user uninstalls a program, there are references to that program left behind in the Registry that can possibly impact performance. However, performance is not necessarily the issue here. For example if the user is going to update the system by switching from an Nvidia graphics card to an AMD one, it might be a good idea to not only uninstall all drivers and related programs but also to clean the Registry of any references to the Nvidia drivers and software (in order to avoid possible conflicts when the AMD card is installed). This will ensure a “clean” install of both the hardware and software components. A free registry cleaner utility one can use is CCleaner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temporary files''' (e.g. from web browsers and installation programs) can take up valuable storage space if they are not removed after extended periods of times. Also, users should be aware of the programs they are installing and decide which specific programs are to run at '''startup'''. Too many programs can slow down the initial startup time of the computer because it must launch program after program. Only those programs that are necessary should be included, and to check for this, click Start (in the lower-left Windows icon) and enter the command ''msconfig'' in the search tab. This will open the System Configuration window. Programs that run at startup are listed under the Startup tab. Here the user can enable or disable programs, which can affect startup time.

Another important factor in determining system performance is the corruption of system files by '''malware'''. Viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, and other forms of malware can infect a system by various means, so it is important for the user to be aware and defensive. Anti-virus programs and other security software provide protection from malware, so it is recommended that a user has some sort of program installed and regularly scans the system for any traces. One free anti-virus program, among many, is AVG.&lt;ref&gt;http://free.avg.com/us-en/homepage&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, '''dust''' can accumulate in and on heatsink fans (e.g. processor and graphics card), case fans, ports, power supplies, and motherboards. Every internal component can accumulate dust, and this can be a major issue for system integrity because dust acts as an insulator by trapping heat. Fans with too much dust do not operate efficiently because the fins do not spin quickly, which further exacerbates the heating problem. Not only that, but dust can also cause electrical shorting of the circuits, which can irreversibly damage components.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerdust.com/downloads/special_report_on_the_effect_of_dust_on_electronics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To clean the computer, power off the system, which includes turning off the power supply. It should not be connected to ''any'' source. Then open the case and use a can of compressed air to blow out the dust wherever it may be. The goal is to rid the case of any remnants of dust. Following this and the other tips listed above will help ensure reliable performance and a longer lifespan for the computer.

==Storage Media, Storage Technology, and  Volatility==

[[File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg|thumbnail|Types of Storage Media]]Storage media is the hardware in which information is physically stored. This differs from the storage device which is usually the docking bay for the storage medium. One example of a storage device would be your CD/DVD drive in which you place your disks when inserting them into your computer or your USB flash drive reader. Storage media would be the actual CD/DVD disk itself or the memory within your computer known as RAM. Storage media can be internal or external meaning that it can be either hard-wired to the computer, like the hard drive for example, or it can be a separate physical storage facility thats meant to be more mobile, like a USB flash drive, Ipod, or an external hard drive for instance. Internal storage media is usually faster since it is hard-wired to the desktop or laptop and does not requires any extra space outside of the computer. On the other hand, external media is very mobile, can be transferred from one computer to another rather quickly, and is easily secured in a safe place separate from your main working station.[[http://www.forensicon.com/resources/articles/what-is-storage-media/]] On top of this the Non-Volatility of these storage medias have made them very valuable. Normally when a computer is shut down, any unsaved information is wiped clean from the RAM, or if the information isn't being used, while the computer is still on, the RAM may delete it to make room for processes being recalled more frequently. Storage media on the other hand, saves data despite the computer being powered down and can only be deleted by the user. Because of this, storage media such as flash drives and data c.d.s are used for anything that would be needed for future reference.


[[File:Laptop-hard-drive-exposed.jpg|thumbnail|Magnetic Hard Drive]][[File:BouncingRay.png|thumbnail|Bouncing Wave or ASE from a Laser Disk]]Storage Technology usually comes in three forms; magnetic, optic, and solid state. Some common magnetic storage systems are hard drives, floppy disks, and cassette tapes. Though cassette tapes don't work with computers they use the same technology and this is why they are worth mentioning. In each case the This type of technology stores binary code using polar alignments on the magnetic medium and can change those alignments as needed when information is altered, deleted, or rewritten. The magnet does this by converting the binary code from 1's and 0's to positive and negative charges, respectively, which are recorded on an iron oxide film inside the media.[[http://www.slideshare.net/SarabSingh2/magnetic-and-optic-based-storage-devices]] Optics use laser beams which rely on marking the media. In this case, lasers burn in lines of data which represent the binary code it is converting. &quot;Rewritable&quot; media has also become a popular choice for those who want to reuse the same disk. Rewritable media relies on changing the reflectivity of the media instead of scarring it. When the binary number 1 is recognized, the laser alters the reflection of the discs surface in certain spots. Data is then separated by the pits in between reflectivity which represent the binary number 0 so that 1's alter the reflection and 0's leave the reflection of the media as is. This creates a &quot;bouncing-wave&quot; like appearance on the surface of the disk called an Amplified Spontaneous Emission or ASE for short.[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_laser]] Solid State Drives, or SSD's as they are called, do not contain any moving parts such as lasers or magnetic heads. They operate electronically by storing the binary code as electrons which are either trapped or not trapped inside the flash memory cells within the unit. These types of media tend to be faster than the other two since they rely on electrical polarity within a cell instead of electronic motors to be read or rewritten. This also makes them more resistant to shock, allows them to run more quietly, and reduces the latency of the media. Typical storage media of this kind are &quot;jump&quot; drives or &quot;thumb&quot; drives, but some computers use this technology in their hardware as well.[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive]]

==Random vs. Sequential==

[[File:Random vs sequential access.svg|thumb|Random vs sequential access]] When thinking of storage systems, one could presume that all of your data in one folder is located next to each other within the hard drive. This is false when talking about random access. With random access your information can be pulled from any location on the disk. Meaning, your one folder could have its data scattered about the physical hard drive. The benefit of this type of storage is that you could access data in any order. Think of it as your CD player, your favorite song ends and you want to hear it again just hit back and you instantly hear it again. It’s fast and nearly instantaneous, unlike sequential. You could think of sequential access like a cassette within a cassette player. When a song finishes and you want to listen to it again, you must rewind the cassette, or if you want to skip a song you must fast forward the tape.&lt;ref&gt;http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8150/~/difference-between-sequential-and-random-access-operations&lt;/ref&gt; This is used with magnetic tape drives which, are used for backup purposes. Even though in random access media devices may seem like data could be misplaced or somehow lost in the sea of data. When created, every file is given a unique name by the computer system, other wise called addressable media, in order to keep tabs on all the data.

=Hard Drives=

Every computer contains one, if not two, hard drives. There are internal and external hard drives. The internal hard drive is located inside the system unit, and the external hard drive is connected to the computer for extra storage. It is vital that an owner of a computer purchases an external hard drive to backup his or her computer in case it crashed. An external hard drive is extremely convenient to store information; however, one must be cautious of the possibility of &quot;hard drive theft&quot; because it is easy for someone to access a random, external hard drive into their own computer. Many people today use a finger print or password to access to their hard drive because of this reason. Without a hard drive, one could not store the countless amount of information contained to a computer. The hard drive holds a port to connect to the motherboard. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/harddriv.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There are a wide range of capacity for hard drives, depending on the computer owner's preference. &lt;ref&gt;http://it.med.miami.edu/x929.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic hard drives and solid-state hard drives are two common hard drives used for computers. A magnetic hard drive is the term computer users mean when they say hard drive, and solid-state hard drives cause flash memory technology. Without hard drives, many information and data would be lost and forgotten.

=Optical Discs=

==Characteristics==

[[File:CD autolev crop.jpg|thumb|Optical Disc]]

An optical disc is a flat, circular disc that stores data and is made out of a very strong plastic called polycarbonate substrate &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc &lt;/ref&gt;.  This helps to protect the disc with many layers of coating.  Data on these discs are read optically, which means that they store data using laser beams.  Data can be stored on one or both sides of the disc.  The track, which is a single spiral around the disc, spins from inside the center track (or groove) to the outermost track for the data to be read.  Most people today have already switched from VHS movies to DVD movies, and now to Blu-ray DVDs.  The advancement in technology has made viewing and burning capabilities for DVDs and CDs much more beneficial.  These optical discs do not degrade, like VHS and magnetic media do.  Optical discs are used in our every day lives for storage, backing up, photos, movies, music, and much more.  


Read only discs are molded and stamped to show the data so that it can only be read (and not over written).  This happens with most CDs for music and software, and DVDs for movies.  A recordable or rewritable optical disc with a CD or DVD uses a laser to represent the data.  An example of this would be burning a CD for music, or an iMovie project to a DVD.  There is a complex process that takes place when writing the data on the optical disc.  To mold or stamp the discs, bumps (called pits) are formed on the disc’s surface.  The places that are not changed on the optical discs are called lands.  Switching from a pit to a land represents a 1 (like discussed in the system unit). &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Computer_Information_Systems/The_System_Unit &lt;/ref&gt; CD discs use infrared lasers, DVDs use red lasers, and Blu-ray discs use blue-violet lasers.  These different types of lasers are used to store different amounts of data at a more compact size.  


Optical drives are the machines that read the discs of CDs, DVDs, and BD drives.  Many households have switched to Blu-ray DVD players.  However, users are upset because only BD discs can be played on BD drives which is considered a hassle to some.  These drives are also used to burn data on the discs.  

==CDs, DVDs, and BDs==

[[File:Recordable CDs.jpg|thumb|Recordable CDs]]

Read-only optical discs include CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, and BD-ROM discs. These are CDs or DVDs that come with something already prerecorded on them and they cannot be cleared. This is because the pits that are molded into the surface of the disc are permanent. There are also read-only discs for video games and different software. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.thefreedictionary.com/compact+disc+read-only+memory &lt;/ref&gt; 

Recordable optical discs are also sometimes referred to as write-once discs. This means that these can be written to but the discs cannot be reused or erased. These include CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, and BD-R discs. The difference between the DVD-R and the DVD+R is the standard being used. There is also a DVD-R DL and a DVD+R DL, which indicates whether or not it is dual layer. Using DVD+R will allow you to instantly eject the DVD without having to wait for the finalized version. It also allows you to record some of the DVD on a personal computer and some of it on the TV.  Another feature is that is it 100% compatible with all DVD players. Recordable CDs are often used for backing up files, making music CDs, or sending large files to other people. BD-R discs are used for even larger back ups that need even more storage and they are used for high-definition multimedia files. &lt;ref&gt; http://netforbeginners.about.com/cs/multimedia/a/DVD_explained_3.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

Rewritable optical discs include CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and BD-RE discs. These can be written on and then erased and rewritten on. To rewrite on these types of discs they use phase change technology. So basically the rewriteable disc is coated with a metal alloy compound. They then use heating and cooling to write on the disc without making it permanent. These are used for backing up files but they are more convenient than recordable optical discs because they can be used multiple times. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-RW &lt;/ref&gt;

=Flash Memory=
===Embedded Memory===
Embedded memory is becoming an increasingly popular type of flash memory due to its small, convenient size. In today's society these types of memory can be found in phones, cameras, gaming devices, and even handheld devices like a GPS.&lt;ref&gt;http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/ice/cd/MEMORY97/SEC11.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; In July of 2013, Samsung announced that they developed the world's fastest embedded memory. These new products will be available in the 16, 32, and 64 GB sizes and feature an interface speed of 400 MB/s. This will increase user's abilities to multitask and perform tasks such as file transferring, browsing, and gaming. It also decreases the amount of time it takes to boot and load applications. This is a key factor in mobile devices where the physical space for additional storage or memory is limited. Memory cards are being used less and less when manufacturing mobile devices and smartphones. One limitation of the chip is the amount of memory it could store. The larger the chip, the more expensive the device is going to cost. Something else to consider is the problem that arises if the device breaks. Any valuable information that was stored on it is virtually irretrievable. That is one advantage of having a removable memory as discussed below.

===Flash Memory Cards and Readers===

[[File:Smartmedia card closeup.jpg|thumb|One of many different types of flash memory card that exists on the market.]]

If you want a fast and easy method of storing various types of media, you can't get much better than a flash memory card. Most modern portable devices contain a flash memory card because of its versatility and ease of use; cellphones, mp3 players, and digital cameras are but just a few examples of products that benefit from flash memory cards. However, just like how not all electronic devices can use the same type of battery, not all flash memory cards are compatible with every electronic portable device. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388408,00.asp &lt;/ref&gt; That's why it's always important to read your user manual for instructions on the right card to purchase if you ever need a replacement. 

Although the devices themselves can only use a specific flash memory card model, most modern desktop and notebook computers come with a flash memory card reader. The reader typically supports a number of different cards so you're able to organize and transfer the data from card to computer. If you aren't one of the fortunate few to have this reader built in to your computer, external models are sold at most stores that sell computer components and they're inexpensive. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.amazon.com/eSecure-Reader-Digital-Memory-Cards/dp/B003CKC8W8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379590136&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=flash+memory+card+reader &lt;/ref&gt;


===USB Flash Drives===
[[File:Sushiusb.jpg|thumb|Sushiusb]]
The USB storage device is one that has been growing rapidly in popularity. It is a very user friendly form of storage. To save information to a USB flash drive, one simply must plug in the USB drive into the USB port (usually on the side or back of the computer), click the &quot;save as&quot; option on their project, then select the drive on their computer which represents the USB. Then one can eject the USB and take the saved information anywhere they need. USBs are quickly advancing as well. There are now ways that you can create an entire mobile computer, a fingerprint enabled secure file, and secure the use of your computer all with the use of a single USB flash drive. These new advances are sure to be hot on the market. USBs are high in demand right now, not just because of their technical abilities but also because of how you can choose a USB to fit into any lifestyle or match any personality. There are thousands of custom USBs available in stores and online. These range in colors, sizes, amounts of memory, and even shapes. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.usbgeek.com/search?q=USB&amp;search-button.x=0&amp;search-button.y=0&lt;/ref&gt;USB flash drives are something that will definitely be here to stay for a while longer, even with the ever emerging cloud.

=Network Storage and &quot;The Cloud&quot;=
[[File:SANvsNAS.svg|thumb|Network Storage]]
== Remote Storage ==
Remote storage is there to expand the disk space without hard disks and isn’t connected to the computer directly but accessed through internet. That way you can access your files wherever you are, whenever you want, on your laptop or Smartphone or even a different computer. This is the basic concept of cloud storage. When you need to access a file, you open the file as usual but if the data isn’t on your local volume, Remote Storage retrieves the information from a media library. When data is removed from a file, the logical size of the file remains but the physical size is reduce.
&lt;ref&gt; http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759742(v=ws.10).aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage area network ==
Storage area networks are clusters of high performance computers used to transfer huge amounts of data. SAN are also used for distributed processing applications requiring fast local network performance and designed specifically for data management. 
&lt;ref&gt; http://compnetworking.about.com/od/networkstorage/g/storage_san.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

== Network Attached Storage ==
Unlike network storage, NAS is typically connected by a wired networking connection. NAS is used for data storage and supports file transfers, in which it will back up any data that appears in the form of files, such as email boxes, Web content, remote system backups.
&lt;ref&gt; http://compnetworking.about.com/od/itinformationtechnology/l/aa070101a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


== NAS vs SAN and Cloud Storage ==
[[File:Ken-A-Vision's FlexCam 2 document camera connected to a laptop computer.png|thumb|Sharing via &quot;The Cloud&quot;]]
Both systems of storage serve different purposes for their clients. The main difference between SAN storage and NAS storage is the way that the systems interact with the network. A NAS network will behave in a way that makes it similar to any other network component. In contrast, the storage devices of a SAN network are found in a separate network but connected to the main one. Overall though, both systems are used for storage and over time the performance offered by both is becoming harder to distinguish. For example a SAN uses Fibre Channel interconnects while NAS makes Ethernet and TCP/IP connects, but now many SAN systems are switching over to those connection routes NAS systems use.&lt;ref&gt;http://compnetworking.about.com/od/networkstorage/f/san-vs-nas.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud storage, sometimes just called online storage, is simply the use of a remote storage device that is accessed by means of the internet. Cloud storage has seen a massive increase in popularity over the last few years, and the industry for it has grown substantially to the point where there are now hundreds of companies that offer a variety of cloud storage services. More specifically, some cloud services focus only on digital pictures or email messages, while other systems store all kinds of digital data. Some services, like Google Drive, allow users to save their files in one of many massive data centers Google operates where, for instance, multiple users can collaborate on projects by having access to the same file.&lt;ref&gt;http://computer.howstuffworks.com/cloud-computing/cloud-storage1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the cloud’s popularity is growing, more and more businesses are transferring over to its storage capabilities. Many businesses are using the application as a back up program for their software and documents. By scheduling a set time for the computer to automatically transfer documents over, businesses can be sure that their information lies safely in the hands of the Internet without having to spend the tedious amount of time backing it up manually. 
Though the different applications of the cloud do sometimes have a monthly fee to pay, it is a small price to pay for the time and convenience it lends you. By utilizing these applications, anybody is able to access their documents anywhere worldwide. An individual is no longer tied down to just one electronic device in one set area, but can instead revise a version of a document on their laptop and then pull it up at work for a presentation the next day. This is just one example of the hundreds of ways that the application can be used conveniently to meet your day-to-day needs. The cloud is connecting electronic devices all across the globe and making every day processes just a little bit easier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Keyboards, Pointing, and Touch Devices=

===Keyboards===

Keyboards are one of the many different types of input devices, and one of the most common. Most if not all keyboards are set up in an alphanumeric key arrangement, also referred to as a qwerty keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few different ways a keyboard can connect to a computer, either wired or wireless, via USB or Bluetooth respectively. For the most part all keyboards are similar to one another, some may have extra keys for games and others may have a numerical keypad built into the board itself. [[File:Logitech Gaming-Keyboard G15.jpg|thumb|Logitech Gaming-Keyboard G15]] While not all computing devices have keyboards they do have supplements, such as a on screen touch keyboard. Many phones have a slide out keyboard for those who prefer an actual physical keyboard. Speaking of physical keyboards, many tablets allow you to purchase a keyboard dock. All of these additional keyboards that you could add to devices are most likely membrane keyboards. Membrane keyboards are the cheapest and most common types of keyboards. The other growing type of keyboards are mechanical keyboards. When you type on a membrane keyboard you complete a circuit which produces the data on screen, which generally makes little to no sound and gives no tactile feedback. For many gamers and avid typist, they would use a mechanical keyboard, which has the point of contact directly beneath the each key. This gives a better tactile feedback along with a faster typing speed, but generally cost much more than membrane keyboards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/article/242037/mechanical_keyboard_faq_pick_the_right_switch.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Point and Clicks===

[[File:Computer mouse-2005.jpg|thumbnail|Inside a Wheel Based Mouse]]Pointing devices are inputs that connect to a desktop or laptop and are used to move an on-screen pointer, usually an arrow, to allow the user to select objects on the screen. The most common of these is the &quot;mouse&quot; which derives its name from its size, shape, and &quot;tail&quot;, or thin wire, which connects it to the computer. It's usually connected via a USB port and it often rests next to the keyboard for easy access. Recently, laser &quot;mice&quot; have become popular due their added mobility as these connect via Bluetooth or other wireless connection and and no longer need their &quot;tails&quot; for support to the system. Older mice have a ball at their base and use this to move the pointer on screen as the user's hand moves the mouse across the desktop surface. Once the pointer is over the desired icon, link, or image, etc. the mouse is used to interact with it by clicking one of the two buttons on it's surface. A wheel may also be found on some and is commonly used to scroll up or down a page or zoom in and out of a window. Optical mice use a laser on the bottom which track movement with light instead of a ball. Three dimensional mice may also be used to interact with three dimensional programs. These programs tend to recognize more complex movements and the mouse may be lifted to simulate flying or angled to simulate a visual tilt within the program.

===Touch Screens===

[[File:Touch Screen Table at National Arboretum Canberra.jpg|thumbnail|Surface Computer]]Touch screens are interfaces which allow a user to interact with programs by using simple touch-based movements. Through the use of one or multiple fingers, different commands can be given without the need for a pointer or mouse. The user can interact with the content being displayed in multiple ways allowing actions such as scrolling, zooming, rotating, dragging, and dropping items to be handled with ease. Everything from mobile phones and tablets to desktops, laptops, and surface computers have taken advantage of this technology. They can be found in consumer kiosks, museums, newsrooms, and even government command centers and allow much more intuitive, rapid, and accurate interaction in these environments. Some systems use a stylus or pen-like instrument to interact with their touch screens. These systems accept input from these styluses and can be as functionally advanced that they can recognize the differences in pressure applied to the screen and may even contain buttons to aid in &quot;right-clicking&quot; on an object. These types of styluses are usually powered by the system they're operating such as a tablet or the Samsung Galaxy Note series of mobile phones. Other advanced technologies take advantage of multi-user capabilities and object recognition. These are referred to as surface computing devices and are often built into tabletops or wall screens. They can recognize multiple inputs allowing for more than one person to operate the device at the same time as well as verify and pinpoint multiple objects that are place on them or near&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_screens&lt;/ref&gt;

=Scanners, Readers, Digital Cameras=
 
===Scanners===
A scanner is a device that copies a picture in digital form. After capturing the image, the data is transferred to the computer. People use scanners to store their hand held pictures in their computer, and one might scan a document for business, school, etc. The two main types of scanners are flatbed and portable scanners. A flatbed scanner is the most common type of scanner, and it is designed to scan flat objects. A portable scanner is designed for travel purposes. &lt;ref&gt;http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/scanner&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Scaner.jpg|Flatbed Scanner
&lt;/gallery&gt;


===Readers===
Readers are designed to read the coding of different products. Readers are also called a &quot;price scanner.&quot; It is usually a hand held device that captures the barcode on a certain tag, sticker, or twitter/facebook code. UPC (Universal Product Code) and ISBN (International Standard Book Number) are the two most famous barcodes. Barcodes are essential for efficiency in different businesses. &lt;ref&gt;http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/barcode-reader-POS-scanner-bar-code-reader-price-scanner&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;



===Digital Cameras===
Almost every American owns a digital camera to save their memories! Digital cameras are used to take a picture, and these pictures are usually stored in a memory card. When purchasing a camera, it is important to know how many mega pixels the camera contains.For example, the higher the mega pixels, better the quality the picture will turn out. However, usually, the higher the mega pixels, the more expensive the camera will cost. People enjoy cameras because the pictures are almost immediately accessible. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+cameras&amp;oq=digital+cameras&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.2852j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=information+on+cameras&lt;/ref&gt;

=Audio Input and Output=

==Audio Input==
[[File:Gnome-audio-input-microphone.svg|thumb|Microphone used to input audio into a computer]]

Audio input is when audio data is put into a computer. Usually the audio that people put into computers is voice or music. Voice input is when words are spoken into a microphone on the computer and they are translated into the digital form via the microphone. Many people will use a sound recorder software to store the voice in a file. One thing that is becoming better known is speech recognition systems. An example of speech recognition being used is when you call a company and an automated voice recording answers and you speak to them and answer their questions and the computer is able to recognize what you are saying and take you where you need to go. &lt;ref&gt; http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/speech-recognition.htm &lt;/ref&gt; Many phones have speech recognition software that allows the user to speak their text message or anything else into their phone and the phone can type the text for them. However these programs are not perfect and they usually require the speaker to talk slowly and clearly. One new technology that is being developed has to do with computers picking up noises the hard drive is making and detecting if there are any problems. One way to input music into a computer is to input it from a CD. They also have keyboards that can be plugged into the computer and the sound can be inputted into the computer. With that technology they can also show the sheet music that was played. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/V/voice_recognition.html &lt;/ref&gt;

==Audio Output==

[[File:Logitech-usb-speakers.jpg|thumb|Audio Output-Speakers]]

Audio Output is exactly how it sounds.  These are the sounds heard while working on a computer, that incorporates voice, music, and other audio sounds.  The most common type of audio output device are speakers.  These are used to hear video games, music from iTunes &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes &lt;/ref&gt; or YouTube &lt;ref&gt; https://www.youtube.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;, TV shows on Netflix &lt;ref&gt; https://signup.netflix.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;, Web conferencing, and other types of programs.  Most computers have the capability to add additional speakers for better sound quality.  The speakers are usually included when the computer is bought.  Other speakers vary in a broad span of prices.  A subwoofer can be added to amplify the computer’s audio output.  Subwoofer’s have low-pitched audio frequencies known as bass and are intended to strengthen the low frequency range of loudspeakers covering higher frequency bands &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subwoofer &lt;/ref&gt;.  They can be installed in automobiles and computers.  For portable laptops and mobile devices, the speakers are built into the device.  Some desktop computers have speakers permanently installed to the monitor.  A unique example of audio output is a treadmill.  Some treadmills have the ability to play music from an iPod or MP3 dock, which makes working out more enjoyable.  With our rapidly growing and expanding market, recently many car companies have included headphone jacks, dock connections, or USB ports to connect an iPod or mobile device.  These connections make it easier for the driver to listen to their own music from their iPod, instead of the radio or CD’s.  Headphones can be used as audio outputs as well, instead of using speakers.  Using headphones helps users not to disturb others around them (in a library or school).

=Display Devices=

===Display Device Characteristics===
[[File:Old Philips television set, pic8.JPG|thumb|Old Philips Television Set]][[File:Triode-english-text.svg|thumb|Cathode Ray Tube]]There are many different characteristics of display devices. These include display colors, monitor styles,  resolutions, video compatibilities, and the extra abilities these devices may have. Most devices today have color displays but there are a few which still follow a monochromatic color scheme. The Nook eReader is one of these devices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Barnes-Noble-eBook-Reader-Black/dp/1400532620&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a difference in the type of monitor in the way it is illuminated. The older style devices such as the large, clunky, heavy tv's and computer screens are lot with cathode-ray tubes (CRT) and because the tubes take up so much room, the devices needed to be much larger. Today most of our devices are flat-panel displays. These displays use a chemical or gas reaction between two thin clear pieces of material to create their display; this is why they are able to be much thinner and lighter than CRT devices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.displaymate.com/crtvslcd.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Buyer beware, when buying a new device keep in mind that the monitors are measured diagonally. So that new 7&quot; tablet you are looking at on amazon.com is 7&quot; diagonally from corner to corner. If you expect the 7&quot; to be the width, you will be sorely disappointed by the smaller device you receive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.necdisplay.com/Documents/WhitePapers/Measuring_Screen_Size.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Keep in mind also that resolution is important. The more information that can be shown in less space, the clearer the image and higher the resolution will be. 
Video is input through a video card which holds the GPU inside of it. The video card is used to translate the video information into an image that will appear on the monitor of your device. It uses a fairly large amount of RAM to do so. There are many ways of connecting video devices to computers, and one of those actually allows the addition of extra monitors to an existing computer allowing for double the screen space. 
Other interesting features of display devices include the ability to hold a charge (temporarily) on their own and become known as wireless, display images in 2D or 3D format, become much more mobile and even wearable (such as a virtual reality simulator headset), as well as register commands based on touch and motion (e.g. iPhone, iPad, Android phone, and most other &quot;smart&quot; devices today).

===Data Projectors===

[[File:Surprised young cat.JPG|thumb|With a data projector, this heartwarming picture can get a whole classroom teary-eyed.]]

While your computer has many talents and uses, sometimes it might seem as if there's not enough of it to go around. Let's say that there's a hilarious cat video on Youtube that you'd like to share among thirty of your best friends but there's not enough room for them all to huddle close before your glowing monitor. Instead of splitting the viewing party up in groups, you can use a data projector. A ''data projector'' lets you display what's on your computer monitor onto a wall or projection screen. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.northcanton.sparcc.org/~technology/Tutorials/Files/Using_a_Data_Projector.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; The image is blown up so all your friends can now laugh in unison as the Youtube cat extends its paws in surprise. Even if you didn't know the name for it, chances are very high that you've encountered a data projector sometime in your life, especially if you attend public school. They can transfer data from computer to projection screen either with a cord or through a wireless connection. For those of you who like to share on the go, there are even portable projectors called ''pico projectors'' that can provide a lesser quality but more accessible presentation. &lt;ref&gt; http://popsci.typepad.com/popsci/2007/09/dont-publish-a-.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===Flat Display Devices===




Flat display devices have become increasingly popular over the years because of their slim design and accessibility. Monitors today must be able to provide full color and gray scale, high efficiency and brightness, the ability to display full-motion video, wide viewing angle, and a wide range of operating conditions. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.accessscience.com/content.aspx?id=757559 &lt;/ref&gt; Consumers today want these devices to be thin and light weight, be insensitive to magnetic fields, and not produce any x-rays. All of these attributes are not possible with the cathode ray tubes that are generally found in older televisions or monitors. There are electroluminescent displays, plasma display panels, vacuum fluorescent displays, and field-emission displays all being sold today. The first are used in industries and medical fields because of how durable they are under many temperatures. Plasma displays are usually used in televisions. Vacuum fluorescent displays are used for low information displays like on appliances or small electronics. Liquid-Crystal Displays (LCDS)are the most commonly manufactured displays at this time.

=Printers=
Printers today can be divided into two main categories: impact printers and nonimpact printers. Impact printers (known as dot matrix printers) are the traditional printers that actually strike the paper with ink. Their primary uses are for the production of business forms like packing slips and receipts. On the other side are nonimpact printers. These printers do not touch the paper like impact printers, and there are two common types: laser and inkjet. Laser printers use ink powder and inkjet printers use ink, which both create the images with dots (similar to pixels on a monitor). These dots make up the print resolution, which is known as the dpi (dots per inch). The higher the resolution the sharper the image. General ranges for a dot matrix printer are 60-90 dpi, an inkjet 300-720 dpi, and a laser printer 600-2400 dpi.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch&lt;/ref&gt; With that, color printers and black-and-white printers are two standards found in either the home or office setting. Typically for home-use color printers are more common than offices, which will use black-and-white printers due to costs (unless the company needs color for specific materials and products like reports or brochures). 

Advantages of laser printers include higher resolutions of the image, faster printing speed, and no smearing. However laser printers are more expensive than inkjet printers, which many people use because they are lower in cost yet still produce high quality images and remain relatively fast in operation. Besides these two types, the advantages of impact printers are their low printing cost per page, their ability to print on multi-part forms and their reliability. However these printers are much louder as well as slower than inkjet and laser printers.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.pcworld.com/index.php/Different_Types_of_printers_-_pc_world_tutorial&lt;/ref&gt; 

Personal printers and network printers are distinguishable by their connection to either a single computer or a home/office network. Network printers allow multiple computers to print from the same printer, which is why they are a standard in the business setting. Typically personal printers have a rate of 20 to 35 ppm (pages per minute) whereas network printers can print from 30 to 65 ppm. 

Printers can connect via USB, wired or wireless networks, or connections from other devices such as memory cards or cameras. It is not uncommon to see printers that have multiple capabilities like copying, scanning and faxing. These inkjet or laser printers are known as multifunction devices and they can come in color or black-and-white options. 



[[File: Laser_printer.png ‎|thumb|Laser Printer]]

== Laser printers ==
Why choose laser printer over any other printer? Well, Laser Printers are known to be good for their speed, precision and economy. Since it uses a laser, it can print one page at a time so it’s known to be significantly faster than the ink-jet printers. Although they are more expensive than ink-jet, they seem to be more cost-efficient considering ink is more expensive than toner powder, which is used for laser printers. Laser printers are more reliable with their prints because ink-jet printers tend to leave ink smears. Static electricity is the primary principle in making the printer work, which is an electrical charge built up on an insulated object. It uses objects with opposite static electricity forcing the fields to cling together. 
&lt;ref &gt; http://computer.howstuffworks.com/laser-printer.htm &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; http://computer.howstuffworks.com/laser-printer12.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cis3.jpg|thumb|Ink-jet Printers]]
Ink jet printers:
Why choose Ink-jet printers? Well, ink-jet printers create pictures by spraying ink from the ink cartridges onto the page. Depending on the printer there’s different sized ink droplets, nozzles and electrical charges for more precise printing. They are typically slower than laser printers because of the back and forth motion of the ink tray. Ink-jet printers have grown in popularity and performance while dropping significantly in price. These dots are thinner than a strand of hair and when different colors combined together to create photo-quality images. 
&lt;ref&gt; http://computer.howstuffworks.com/inkjet-printer.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hannover-Messe 2012 by-RaBoe 069.jpg|thumb|3D Printer]]
Special-Purpose Printers:
Though almost every household has some sort of either ink jet printer or laser printer, there are also numerous special purpose printers out there that are made to perform a specific task. Many companies invest in these products to improve time and cost efficiency. Some examples of these printers are photo printers, bar code, label and postage printers, portable and integrated printers, and 3D printers. 
-Photo printers, as the name quite obviously gives it away, are used for the purpose of printing merely pictures. Often times, people invest in these printers because they produce a better quality picture than just a typical everyday printer would. They also have certain capabilities and apps that one would not just find on any printer. 
-Businesses are also often found using bar code, label, and postage printers for their products. Every sellable item needs a product label, and having a printer that is designed just for that saves both time and money. They are also useful for the electronic postage capabilities, saving companies time on the mass amount of envelops that they send out on a daily basis. 
-If you are an on the go businessman or woman, a portable or integrated printer is the way to go. With so much travel and back and forth, it is easy to pull out these commutable printers and print the documents or images you need on the fly. 
-Finally, possibly the newest and most up and coming printer is the 3D printer. This useful tool can be utilized for printing models and samples. It prints using plastic, and literally produces a finalized 3D prototype of what you want. 
With technology rapidly improving, more and more products are being designed for the purpose of cost and time efficiency. Depending on what you do on an every day basis, it may be a very wise choice to invest in one of these printers to save you valuable time and money in the long run. &lt;ref&gt;http://printscan.about.com/od/printerscannerreviews/u/Reviews.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Systems Software Overview=
[[File:Ubuntu 12.04.png|thumb|Ubuntu 12.04 is an example of a OS]]
System software can be separated into two different categories, utility programs and operating systems. Operating systems are the foundation of your computer and almost every electronic device. The OS boots up the computer and makes sure everything is operational. The OS is also what runs your cell phone and most of your electronic devices. The OS is, for the most part, the GUI that shows you all of your applications, and without the OS you cannot use the computer. There are many different types of OS’s which are discussed later. Utility programs perform a very specific task, to either enhance or manage your computer. For example your virus protection program, like norton&lt;ref&gt;http://us.norton.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, is an example of a utility program along with the install/uninstall program that comes standard with Windows.
==Systems Software vs Application Software==

===Systems Software===
Systems Software are applications or programs that are designed specifically for running the hardware on a personal computer and are used to maintain a platform for Application Software to be used. This means that systems software is designed to communicate with the internal parts of your computer such as the hard drive, RAM, ROM, cache, microprocessors, etc. so that the user doesn't have to. It contains all of the drivers necessary for this type of communication, and ,in the most simplest sense, it is the interface between the user and the hardware.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/disk-operating-system/difference-between-application-software-and-system-software&lt;/ref&gt; The Operating System (called the OS for short) on your computer is not only one of the most important systems software on a computer, but is also the most frequently used. It is the software that runs in the background and brings the separate, physical parts of the computer together in order to provide the seamless stream of activity that a user experiences. Some of its responsibilities include the transfer of data between the memory and disks (on your hard drive) as well as providing the information needed to display icons, text, cursors and other visible necessities on the display screen. This display is called the graphical user interface or GUI and is entirely the result of the OS on the computer. This can be compared by viewing the differences between the Ubuntu OS and the Mac Snow Leopard OS. The icons between the two are positioned differently and they look different too. The Mac OS and GUI tends to have a more three dimensional aspect to it where Windows tends to appear more flat. It should also be remembered that the operating system conducts itself independently of both the user and any application software being used. This means that it is not directly dependent on the user or other programs in order to operate. Some other systems software would include Bios and device firmware. These help the user interact with other utilities such as diagnostic tools, language translators, data communication programs, as well as data management programs. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.buzzle.com/articles/application-software-vs-system-software.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Application Software===

Application Software are most commonly the programs that run in the foreground of the computer. They tend to perform useful tasks which are not associated with computer maintenance, system boot-up, or hardware communication. Application software is directly reliant on the Systems Software to communicate to the physical components of the computer and cannot operate without it. If you were to visualize this, the Application Software would operate on top of the Systems Software and would be the most visible to the user while the Systems Software would remain in the background unnoticed. The Systems Software would then communicate to the Hardware on its behalf and deliver any information to it from the Application Software. In turn, any information needed from the Hardware would pass through the Systems Software to the Application Software. Application Software are the most familiar forms of software and come in a variety of types. Most often they can be accessed through the graphical user interface of the operating system being used by double-clicking on an icon.  Some of the most popular examples include word processors, spreadsheets, photo-editing programs, database programs, and accounting programs to name a few. This list is by no means the extent to which application software may be used and many more programs are being created constantly to help individuals with daily activities. &lt;ref&gt;http://uwf.edu/clemley/cgs1570w/notes/concepts-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=The Operating System=

A computer would not be able to function correctly without an operating system. An operating system is a software program that empowers the computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerhope.com/os.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  An operating system is one of the most important parts of a computer. The operating system is able to do basic tasks as well as complex tasks. An operating system can be classified as a multiuser, multiprocessing, multitasking, multithreading, and real time. The operating system makes sure that different programs, and users running at the same time, do not interfere with one another. The owner of a computer interacts with the operating system through a set of commands. All application programs need an operating system. Also, operating systems optimizes one’s computer performance. Most of the work that is involved in the operating system is unnoticed because it does the work behind the scenes. This system is in charge of managing one’s network connections. Considering all the new technology out, operating systems must be uploaded in order to support the new technology being uploaded to computers. All in all, the operating system is the core of all computers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/operating_system.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

=Operating Systems for Personal Computers=

===DOS===
DOS (Disk Operating System) was the dominant operating system for microcomputers in the 1980s and the early 1990s. The first version of DOS was developed for IBM. DOS is a rather simple operating system but it does not utilize a graphical user interface and it does not support modern processors, which is why it is no longer used. &lt;ref&gt; http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/DOS &lt;/ref&gt; Some computers can still run the DOS commands but the user needs to know how to input the commands using the Command Prompt window.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Windows===
Windows is a series of operating systems that is designed by Microsoft. Microsoft introduced their first Windows operating system in 1985. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows &lt;/ref&gt; There have been many different versions of Windows, including Windows Vista and the main feature of Windows Vista is the Instant Search at the bottom of the start menu. Then Windows 7 came out and the improvements were mainly to make it faster and easier to use. The most recent version of Windows is Windows 8. Windows 8.1 comes out late October 2013. The new Windows will allow you do to more than one thing at once. It also allows for a new way to search and there is a way to open the Windows store from your home page.&lt;ref&gt; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/everywhere?ocid=Everywhere_O_WOL_Hero_Home_WinEverywhere_Pos1_01 &lt;/ref&gt; Windows is the most commonly used operating system and is used on about 90% of all personal computers.  &lt;ref&gt; http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/Microsoft_Windows.html &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Mac OS===

Apple Corporation’s registered operating system is called Mac OS.  There are many different branches stemming from the Mac OS X family.  It was primarily based off of UNIX because of its standard interface and graphics look.  Mac OS X Snow Leopard was the primary operating system, followed by the making of Mac OS X Mountain Lion &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mountain_Lion &lt;/ref&gt;, which is the newest and greatest version of Mac Operating Systems.  Mac OS has capabilities of multithreading and multitasking.  It also has a 64-bit processor that runs with applications used with 64-bit software.  The many great features of Mac OS X creates an easy working environment for students, teachers, and parents to easily access many files.  Mac OS is also known for its great graphic features that are popular to artsy users.  The Launchpad and Mission Control with the bird’s-eye view of the Dashboard and desktop make opening applications easier for users.
&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/gallery&gt;

===UNIX===

UNIX was trademarked in 1969 by a group of AT&amp;T employees at Bell Labs as a multitasking, and multi-user computer operating system. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix &lt;/ref&gt;  UNIX can support systems ranging from microcomputers to mainframes, along with various devices.  Because UNIX is used for an assortment of categories of computers, this is a great advantage.  However, it is more expensive than most operating systems, and is very difficult to maintain upgrades.  UNIX is widely known for its simplicity and ease while working on the computer, therefore different companies use a spin off of UNIX as their operating system, like Mac OS X.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Linux===

Linux operating system was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux &lt;/ref&gt;  This is another spin off operating system of UNIX, but was created separately.  Linux is an interesting operating system because all of the Linux contents are open source. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software &lt;/ref&gt;  This means that a source is available to the public, to which users can download Linux via the Internet and have the capability to run another operating system on their PC or Mac.  No other company has done this before.  Collaborators of Linux are continually making improvements to the system.

=Operating Systems for Mobile Phones=

There are many different operating systems for mobile phones and devices but most six stand out as being most used. These are Android, Asha, Blackberry, iOS, Windows Phone, and Windows RT.

[[File:Assorted_smartphones.jpg|right|263px|Assorted smartphones.]]
===Android===

Android is a free and open source operating system provided by Google. Since the release of Android 2.0, the operating system can be used on phones and tablets. Since HTC Dream was introduced, making the number of mobile devices capable of carrying the Android operating system heighten, Android's worldwide market rose significantly and now reaches 52.5% of the global smarthphone market share.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asha===

Asha is used by Nokia phones. These smartphones are on the lower end when it comes to software and component capability. Because of the low capability, Nokia smartphones are usually the cheapest which makes them able to compete with higher end smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Asha_platform&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackberry===
[[File:Star C6000.jpg|thumb|Star C6000]]
Blackberry's operating system is called BlackBerry 10. This is a closed source operating system for smartphone and tablet devices. The newest operating system developed by Blackberry for tablet devices is BlackBerry Tablet OS.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_10&lt;/ref&gt;

The BlackBerry operating system has all of the same features a smart phone does: email access, web browsing, phone calls, play music and video, and send and receive text messages. Most models are not touch screen, with the exception of the Storm and the Torch. Instead of a touch screen, a trackball or track pad is the hardware used for navigation. Because there is no touch screen, the operating system does not require that much battery life to process so the phone stays on longer than others. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/android-v-blackberry-smartphones-for-business-1136674&lt;/ref&gt;  The BlackBerry also has multiple buttons (similar to the image on the right) including a BlackBerry button, back button, call and end button, 1 or 2 convenience keys, and a full keyboard. The BlackBerry button is designed for easy integration, such as sharing a photo via email. This system is geared toward communications rather than games and apps. It features an email software that “pushes” email directly to the user’s phone, which saves battery and provides the most current information. One drawback to this type of smart phone is how limited the customization is. Only the wallpaper and the function of a few buttons can be changed. It also does not feature “widgets” or a wide selection of apps like the android phones do. Overall this operating system is easy for productivity, but falls behind its competitors in a wide selection of applications.

===iOS===

iOS is Apple's operating system for Apple's iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and second-generation Apple TVs. This operating system is closed source and not until iOS 2.0 were third party applications offically supported. Prior to this update, jailbreaking was the only way to allow third party applications access to a user's iOS device.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows Phone===

Windows Phone is developed by Microsoft as a closed source operating system for mobile phones. It allows users to accesss Microsoft SkyDrive, Office, Xbox, and other Microsoft programs remotely. Windows Phone devices are made mostly by Nokia, HTC, Samsung, and Huawei.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows RT===

Windows RT is also developed by Microsoft but this is used on tablet devices. This version closely resembles Windows 8, an operating system developed by Microsoft for computers. It is closed source as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbian OS===

[[File:Img 28111 symbian os.jpg|thumb|This was the logo for the now declining empire known as Symbian OS.]]

There was one OS that used to tower above all the rest, before recently falling completely out of the race thanks to increasingly competitive and more simplistic operating systems. The name of this OS is Symbian, and between 2000-10 it ruled supreme thanks to its partnership with Nokia, a company that excelled in moving large units of inexpensive cellphones. The Symbian company had risen from the ashes of a failing PDA company named Psion, changing its focus to mobile OS development with funding from entities such as Motorola and Ericsson, while the largest funding share always came from Nokia. Unfortunately, between the more complex code (which contributed to development periods that were unthinkable in comparison to what Windows and Mac were developing) and Nokia changing their allegiance to Windows, Symbian said its final goodbye in mid-2013. Any individuals or companies still attached to the Symbian OS will be offered support for a few more years, but they will need to consider their options now instead of waiting for the last minute. Luckily, as can be seen from the plethora of options above, Symbian users can surely pick an OS that is the closest to the quality programming to which they had grown attached.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/article/2042071/the-end-of-symbian-nokia-ships-last-handset-with-the-mobile-os.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile Device Systems===
Below are three very popular mobile phone/device providers today. They are Windows, Android, and Apple. The three use different operating systems.

Windows is full of change. Most people have used Windows on their personal computers, but did you know it is also integrated into our GPS systems, ATMs, and even robots? Windows mobile devices include things called tiles which are icons for different things stored in the device itself. Related tiles can be put together in hubs. Windows devices also offer integration with windows office software (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). They also include integration with Xbox Live. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/features?ocid=sem_s_pcrid_30043429957_se_Google_kwd_windows%20mobile%207%20games_pmt_b&lt;/ref&gt;

Android: Android was created by a group of 30+ mobile technology companies and is based on the Linux operating system. These devices offer the ability to multitask with a split thing (doing two things on the same screen verses switching between tasks). The screen will contain multiple applications that can be bought and downloaded (some for free) from the Android Market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.android.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;


iOS (Apple): This system is based on Apple's Mac OS X. Similar to the apps of the android system, apple products also contain apps but they are downloaded and purchased from the App Store. There are over 900,000 apps currently available. These devices are also synced to your iTunes account allowing you to upload your music to their devices as well. Some things that are specific to these devices are their Safari web browser, FaceTime, and the ability to track your device through the &quot;Find my iPhone&quot; app. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/iphone/&lt;/ref&gt;

=Utility Programs=

[[File:UmbDotNetContols1.gif|thumb|Folders]]
===File Management Program=== 
They organize files and are available for the user to access them. There are 6 important concepts that the file management programs have. To start off, it has a navigation system that gives the user access to the file hierarchy and be able to find their work. The actions to proceed are using the “up” and “down” to navigate through the folders and “go to” to reach their data. Another function is the operations functions which allow the user to interact with the files. The common functions along with this are as follows: open, save, close, copy, move, delete, rename, new and share. The user would obviously be concern about the security of their files. With this being said, the files can be blocked with a login procedure which will only give people that know the username and password access to the file. To keep your file program organized its necessary to maintain the storage on the program in which you should delete any unneeded files. For the conveyance to the user, there is a communications function in which there are links available in order to send out a file to a given location. Lastly, there’s a search function in which you can find a particular file you are looking for.
Specifically the '''Search Tool''' is very useful for the user. Like explain previously, it will find a particular file by simply using the files name. there are programs that will search the  data by key words but it seems to be more beneficial to know the username instead of the program searching all the documents for key words, which may lead to a longer search than intended. &lt;ref&gt;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/functions-file-management-program-41476.html&lt;/ref&gt;


===Diagnostic and Disc Management Programs===
With technology playing such an important role in our everyday life, it is important to make sure that is it maintaining itself and running properly. Instead of having to go through and check every aspect of the computer ourselves, computers come with built in diagnostic management program and disc management programs. Diagnostic management programs deal with making sure that everything on the system is working the way it should be, while disc management systems programs worry about the hard drive operating correctly. Most computers come with the basics of this software already built in, however some people prefer to go outside of what they already have and purchase more protection and security for their computer. These programs keep your computer running quickly, optimally, and effectively on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.krollontrack.com/information-management/hard-drive-management/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Icon_delete.svg|thumb|Deleting Unneeded Files]]

===Uninstall and Cleanup Utilities===
You would think that that once a program or application is deleted, no trace of it would be left behind; however, this is very often not the case. In many instances, traces of that file, program, or application are still left embedded into your hard drive. In order to fully get rid of them, people often use something called uninstall utilities. These programs go through your hard drive and remove any unneeded space, memory, or left over remnants from that application that once existed. Many computers come with this option already installed, which makes keeping your computer updated and up to speed an easy task. Clean up utilities are very similar to uninstall utilities; however, instead of going through and deleting old applications and programs, they go through and clean up your computer by deleting temporary files.&lt;ref&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morris_Worm.jpg|thumb|The floppy drive that holds one of the original computer worms released into the Internet]]
===File Compression Programs===
File compression programs are designed to reduce the size of files, which allows the user more storage space. For Windows users, these compressed files usually have the .zip or .zipx file extension. The most popular programs are Winrar, Winzip and 7-Zip.&lt;ref&gt;http://download.cnet.com/windows/file-compression/?tag=rb_content;main&lt;/ref&gt; For Mac users, these files usually have the .sit or .sitx format. Programs that are commonly used are RAR Expander, StuffIt Expander and MacZip. &lt;ref&gt;http://download.cnet.com/mac/file-compression&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs have the option of encrypting the zipped files, meaning that a password is required to open the file. This can help those who want to protect their files for themselves or specific users who are granted access. Overall using file compression programs is an efficient way to free up storage space for other computer tasks. 

===Backup and Recovery Utilities===
Over time one might experience the unfortunate event of a power outage or some other event that leads to the corruption of important system files. For example a storm can cut the power in an instant, which turns off the computer in an unsafe manner thereby leading to the corruption of the operating system and possibly even hardware. The system now is damaged, and this is an important reason why backing up is necessary. Businesses understand this, so it is extremely unlikely for a one to not backup its data on a regular basis because the possibility of losing just a segment can be catastrophic. The Windows Backup program (Windows) and Time Machine program (Mac) are included with their respective operating systems, but software programs exist that can be used for free or a price.

===Antivirus, Antispyware, Firewalls, and Other Security Programs===
Malware consists of viruses, trojans, worms, spyware and other forms that disrupt computer operation.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned, malware can infect computers in many ways, whereas the affected suffers while the infector gains. To protect against these threats, it is highly recommended to take advantage of the utility programs offered by the operating system as well as software programs. Popular antivirus programs for Windows include AVG, Norton 360, McAfee, Kaspersky and Microsoft Security Essentials&lt;ref&gt;http://download.cnet.com/windows/antivirus-software&lt;/ref&gt; A firewall is used to monitor network ports by controlling inbound and outbound traffic to the network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cat-5-cable-company.com/faq-what-is-a-Firewall.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary purpose is to defend the computer from malware and hackers, but it can also interfere with programs that must access the Internet. It will also not remove malware if it has infected the computer; it only blocks the malware from entering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ehow.com/about_7547911_purpose-firewall-software.html&lt;/ref&gt; Spyware is software that tracks personal information unknowningly from the user, which can lead to serious problems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/spyware-whatis.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to know the software one is downloading and to understand its license agreement and privacy statement (to see if unwanted software is included).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Application Software Basics=
[[File:Google Drive Logo.svg|thumb|Google Drive Logo]]
Application software allows you to do anything on the computer, such as playing games, or watching TV. Anyone and everyone using a computer should be familiar with the different applications available to them and how to properly utilize said programs. For instance one of the most widely used application software is Microsoft Word&lt;ref&gt;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/&lt;/ref&gt;. Microsoft Word allows you to create, edit, save and print digital documents on your computer. While it is not the only word processor out there, it is the most popular. Others would include WordPerfect&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corel.com/corel/pages/index.jsp?pgid=12100162&amp;storeKey=us&amp;languageCode=en&lt;/ref&gt;, Google drive&lt;ref&gt;https://drive.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;, and iWork&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/iwork/&lt;/ref&gt;. You could also create spreadsheets through Excel&lt;ref&gt;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/&lt;/ref&gt;, create a presentation through Keynote&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/&lt;/ref&gt;, and even edit music though Audacity&lt;ref&gt;http://audacity.sourceforge.net/&lt;/ref&gt;. All of these will be discussed in greater detail as we move on in this section.

=Word Processing=

===Explanation of Word Processing===

A word processor is a software program that is used to create a document, store it electronically, display it on a screen, modify it using commands and characters, and print it on a printer. It also processes paragraph indentation, margin size, font type, font size, font color, and spacing within the document being created. Word processors have replaced typewriters since they allow the user to make a change anywhere in the document without having to retype the entire page. Word processors also come equipped with &quot;spell-check&quot; functions eliminating the need for multiple editors and provide an immediate tool for grammatical correction. Some common word processors include Microsoft Word, AbiWord, Word Perfect, and Open Office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techterms.com/definition/wordprocessor&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Spell check.PNG|Spell Check
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Constructing a Word Processing Script===

When constructing a word document there are a few things to keep in mind; character formatting, paragraph formatting, and page formatting. These three basic functions lay the foundation for most of the customization that is needed to create many word documents. Character formatting changes the appearance of individual characters and relates to the size, font, color, and overall style of the letters or numbers being used. Character formatting also involves underlining, italicizing, and making bold those characters being used. This is great for making a word stand out or for underlining book titles. Paragraph formatting adjusts the spacing, alignment, and indentation of the paragraphs being formed. Spacing refers to the amount of lines left blank in between the lines being processed. A good example of this is double-spacing which is commonly used in an educational setting where a student has to write a paper for a specific instructor. Commonly double-spacing is used so that the instructor can make corrections to the document without having to mark over the actual words on the paper. Alignment refers to the way the paragraph is positioned in regards to the left and right margins. A left alignment is most commonly used when creating a word document and this setting aligns the words being formed to be flush with the left margin. A center alignment is usually used for titling a paper. Page formatting refers to the width of the margins, the size of the paper being used, and the orientation of the page. The standard margin is 1.25 inches on both the left and right but these can be customized to suit need and preference. The paper size options reflect what can be used in the printer, and the orientation indicates whether the document will use the traditional or landscape positioning on that paper. Traditional orientation is 8.5 inches wide by 11 inches tall whereas landscape is the exact opposite at 11 inches wide by 8.5 inches tall.&lt;ref&gt;http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~lrm22/technology/wpbasics/wpbasics.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Abiword 2.8.2.png|AbiWord Word Processor
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Word Processing Tools===
Some of the basic tools that are employed in word processing programs that help to make the application more user friendly are tables, graphics, and templates. These tools allow for minimal effort and excellent results when adding features like these to a word document. Tables are used for organizing information and are composed of rows and columns in which data is placed. This is great for comparing and contrasting information as it's condensed and presented in a straight forward fashion. Tables can also be used for laying out entire documents, such as a resume, where information is sectioned off from one another. In this example, the entire report is formulated to a table instead of a small section as mentioned earlier. Graphics are pictures, drawings, clip art, or other images that can be inserted into a document from other programs or from stored data on a computer. This makes for easy illustrations where a picture, or pictures, would suffice better than words or tables to highlight a point. Graphics tools also allow the user to manipulate the images that have been imported by changing the color, contrast, brightness, and size of the image, among other things. The customization process of these images in a word processor provide for an easy and quick avenue of explanation concerning the topics at hand. Another useful tool are Templates. These are preprogrammed arrangements of ideas and/or illustrations that are known to serve a purpose and are already organized for the user to interact with. Most often this means &quot;filling in the blanks&quot; and some common templates that should be recognized are resumes, business cards, identification cards, fax cover sheets, memos, invoices, and newsletters to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_(word_processing)&lt;/ref&gt;

=Spreadsheets=

==What is a Spreadsheet==

[[File:Poppit Spreadsheet.png|thumb|Poppit Spreadsheet]]
&quot;A spreadsheet is a group of values and other data organized into rows and columns similar to the ruled paper worksheets traditionally used by bookkeepers and accountants.&quot; The spreadsheet software is mandatory to create computerized spreadsheets. Microsoft Excel is a form of a spreadsheet. There are many terms one must have to know to create a spreadsheet. A worksheet is the single spreadsheet document. A workbook allows multiple worksheets to be saved together in a single spreadsheet file. Worksheets are divided into rows and columns. The intersection of a row is called a cell. One must enter content into the active cell, or current cell; it has a border around it to make it be easily identified. Data is entered directly into worksheet cells by clicking a cell to make it the active cell. Labels, constant values, formulas, and functions are the data that is entered into a cell. Before one enters a formula or function into a cell, one must begin with some type of mathematical symbol, usually the equal sign (=).&lt;ref&gt;http://ng.cengage.com/static/nb/ui/index.html?nbId=7345&amp;nbNodeId=1013914#!&amp;parentId=1013929&lt;/ref&gt; Spreadsheets are greatly used in businesses. They are used to organize finances, projects, statistics, etc. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theiia.org/intAuditor/itaudit/archives/2006/january/the-role-of-spreadsheets-in-todays-corporate-climate/&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to know how to use spreadsheets for school and one's job.

==How to use a Spreadsheet==

When using a spreadsheet application, the user can use various concepts to compute the data entered into the cells in the spreadhseet. These different concepts are provided within the program. Some very common concepts that are utilized are charts, functions, formulas, and cell referencing.

===Charts===
A chart can be created as its own object or embedded within the sheet itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet#Functions&lt;/ref&gt; This is helpful when a user needs to analyze data or represent changing data.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Excel_chart.PNG|A chart generated using Excel.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Functions===
A function is a pre-programmed mathematical formula to allow the user to make calcuations based on the data input. If the user wishes to create his own formula, Visual Basic can be used to write a formula and then the spreadsheet program can input the values into the newly written formula, reporting the data back into the sheet.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Functions_in_Excel.PNG|A function being editted using VB in Excel.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Formulas===
A formula identifies the calculation needed to place the result in the cell it is contained within. This means a cell has two display components; the formula itself and the resulting value.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet#Functions&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a formula consists of five expressions: value, references, arithmetic operations, relation operations, and functions.

&lt;gallery&gt;
image:Spreadsheet_animation.gif|Using a formula in Excel.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cell Referencing===
Cell referencing refers to the ability to call on other cells. There are two ways of doing this: relative and absolute cell referencing. A relative cell reference will adjust as the formula is copied from another cell white an absolute will not adjust. It is also important to note that a user can reference both the same sheet and other sheets in a book using this concept.

=Database=

Database Concepts:
A database is an organized list of facts and information. They typically contain text and numbers and they can hold still images, sounds and videos. A database organizes the information in a way that makes it easy to retrieve the information. A database is kind of like an electronic filing system. It makes it much easier to keep the files on the computer rather than have a file cabinet. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Databases.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Most databases are organized by fields, records, and files. A field (also called a column) is a single type of data, for example, last name, that is stored in a database. A record (also called a row) is a collection of related fields. Lastly, a table is a collection of related rows. One or more tables that contain similar information can be stored in a database. Another thing to look at in databases is Hypertext database where any object can be linked to another object; this is useful for organizing a lot of information. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/database.html&lt;/ref&gt; In order to access information from a database you need DBMS, which is database management software. A common database management software is Microsoft Access. 

[[File:Ponkan query.png|thumb|Query]]
Queries and Reports:

Queries and reports are used to retrieve information from databases. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query &lt;/ref&gt;  A query is almost like a search tool for the user of the database to find specific information like an item, number, name, etc.  Like other documents made, a query has to be made and saved as well, for users to be able to come back and search it again.  A query contains criteria that must be met for a record or row to be shown in the ending results of the specific query.  Queries can also be made to show multiple columns or rows at a single time, instead of just one row or column.  For example, a customer insists to buy a set of glasses for under $20 at Crate and Barrel. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crate_%26_Barrel &lt;/ref&gt;  The employee can then inquire “glasses under $20” and be able to tell the customer which kind to specifically look at.  A report is used when acquiring a formal output.  This can be a company logo or graphic with a page column heading.  These can be created with the “Report Wizard button” on the “Create tab” from the Ribbon.  Reports are mostly used with database tables or queries.  Databases can be used more efficiently for customers shopping via the Internet.  Today, online shopping is the newest sensation.  For example, a specific dress can be found on Lord and Taylor’s &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_%26_Taylor &lt;/ref&gt; website for women, prior to going to the store by typing in the search bar.  Examples of popular databases used are Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Oracle, MySQL, and IBM DB2. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database &lt;/ref&gt;

===Intro to Presentation Software===

[[File:Life's more fun when you are organized.jpg|thumb|Just because the phrasing is corny doesn't make the message any less true!]]

Everyone has different styles of learning. There are some students who retain information better when they can be hands-on, while others can hear a lecture from their teacher one time and remember all the important points without having to open their school book once. No matter your learning style, there is one type of software that has been proven, time and again, to be a great method of sharing lots of key information in an organized and relatively entertaining fashion. The successful software in question is presentation software.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jiscdigitalmedia.ac.uk/guide/pedagogical-uses-of-presentation-software&lt;/ref&gt; Presentation software allows the user to create multiple slides which they can piece together into a slide-show. It is a great way to organize and refine large amounts of information into only the most important parts because each slide has limited space and you typically are limited in time when responsible for a presentation. Whether you're presenting information to a classroom or a business meeting, the method of organizing information in a fluid manner remains the same. To add entertainment value, there are many variables within each example of software that can be manipulated, from text size and color to slide transitions. The expert presentation software users can even dare to add photos and music to their presentations. Two of the most widely used examples of presentation software today are: Microsoft Powerpoint and Prezi.

==Powerpoint==
[[File:US Navy 040605-N-6633C-002 Commander Naval Reserve Force, Vice Adm. John G. Cotton, is silhouetted in front of a Powerpoint slide mapping out the Naval Reserve Force's future.jpg|thumb|US Navy 040605-N-6633C-002 Commander Naval Reserve Force, Vice Adm. John G. Cotton, is silhouetted in front of a Powerpoint slide mapping out the Naval Reserve Force's future]]

Powerpoint is a Microsoft Office software used to present information and work as a visual aide. Certain options make it easy to organize and present information in a visually appealing way. Charts, pictures, tables, video clips, and sounds can all be added to the presentation. Designs and color themes come ready to use so the presenter just has to add the information and it is ready to go! The slides themselves come with several options of pre-loaded layouts, using features such as bullet points, pictures, captions, and titles. They are easy to drag and drop to make rearranging very easy. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.boundless.com/communications/preparing-and-using-visual-aids/using-powerpoint-and-alternatives-successfully/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-powerpoint/&lt;/ref&gt;The whole idea of a digital visual is, in concept, more beneficial to the presenters and the audience to avoid copies of handouts. One feature that comes in handy, however, is the ability to print the slides so either the presenter or audience can be informed ahead of time of what to expect. Slides can change with a simple click of a button. However, presenters can often lose eye contact from the audience and begin reading straight from the slides, instead of using it as a guide. Teachers, employers, and computer users all over the world have now become accustomed to using PowerPoint as their “go-to” visual aide. The image on the right shows a presenter using a powerpoint as a visual aide.

==Inside Scoop on New Presentation Software==
[[File:Sample Prezi.png|thumb|Sample Prezi]]
There are hundreds of ways we present information on a daily basis. Whether it be through verbal speech, body language, pamphlets, posters, commercials, flyers, power points, etc. we are constantly presenting information and being presented to. Technologically, there are still many ways to present information to an audience. The cool thing is, you do not just have to use things like PowerPoint and Microsoft Word. You do not even have to use products that cost money. There are several new and innovative free ways to present that will surely grab the attention of your audience.

Prezi is one of those free presentation methods. It is Internet based, and similar to PowerPoint. However, it is much more user friendly, as well as interactive. PowerPoint seems to have a set order you have to follow. It goes slide to slide in a single order. With Prezi, if you decide you want to go in a different order or go back to something 6 slides back you simply zoom out a little and click the slide you wanted to return to. Prezi slides are set in a &quot;path&quot; and as you present, the presentation will zoom in and out of each slide which are all present on one master screen. This is much different from PowerPoint's single slide screens. Prezi has the ability to integrate many different forms of information into your presentation. You can upload YouTube videos, PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, photos, music, and voice overs. You can also time your slides and have them move to the next one automatically like in PowerPoint. However, these things are input through a much simpler process. Instead of all the clicks you have to do in PowerPoint to insert things such as a YouTube video, Prezi has a button labeled &quot;Insert YouTube video&quot; and once you click it, it asks for the video URL. After you enter that, it automatically uploads it to your presentation. There you can resize it and place it wherever you would like. The ability to see where one idea came from and how it is physically moving to the next idea makes Prezi a much more innovative presentation method. It can be used for entertainment, educational work, teaching, and even in the business world. It comes with many templates as well at the ability to create your own presentation from scratch.

Prezi also offers many interesting things PowerPoint does not: it has the ability to share the presentation via email, collaborate on a presentation with multiple people, give several people access to the editing of a single presentation, and a free mobile app. The app is free and allows you to present, create, and edit presentations on the go with or without Internet. It is a very useful program and definitely something to check out! &lt;ref&gt;https://prezi.zendesk.com/forums&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic Software===
Graphic software has a variety of application programs and has a wide range of different uses. To further explain, there are programs like presentation programs that can create power points and graphics software uses photo editing programs that are used to manipulate pixels from images from pictures. A useful program would be Adobe Paint Shop, which can be used to edit, change and alter pictures however you would like them to be. Another category for creating images would be vector based images. This is where a bit-mapped image created by a digital camera is able to be altered and the images are able to re-scale to any size with no loss of detail. As well as the programs, the graphics side of them is able to create images in 3-D modeling, as well as create animations which can be made through Photoshop. In able to add video or audio there is programs with multimedia content which the software is able to play and editing audio and video along with any editing. Overall, graphic software is really useful for personal, business and education purposes, whether it’s for creating a college or providing information with addition affect for the audience.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.explainingcomputers.com/software.html &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Headphones_1.jpg|thumb|PROTIP: Headphones are useful when listening to sound.]]
===Audio Capture and Editing Software===
Audio capture and audio editing software is used to create and edit audio files. There are many different programs associated with these two types of programs. Some programs are designed to extract audio from CDs (ripping software) while others capture sound through input devices like a microphone (sound recording software). Some programs are able to record sound and also edit that sound, or it can open a certain type of sound file, which enables the user to edit any piece in various ways. The extent to which the user can edit the sound depends on the complexity of the software. One program can only allow very basic functions like cutting and pasting while another can add effects and modify every bit of the wavelength. This is an example of the distinction found between free programs and others deemed professional. However that is not to say that just because a program is free it must be of a lower quality. Audacity is a free, and very popular, program that includes both audio capturing and editing elements.&lt;ref&gt;http://audacity.sourceforge.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video Editing and DVD Authoring Software===
The widespread availability of digital cameras and now phones with built-in camera devices combined with the massive popularity of sites like YouTube has led many to use video editing programs. These programs enable the user to modify their clips extensively, and like audio capture and editing software there are both consumer and professional offerings. DVD authoring is a process that many video editing programs include. More specifically it oversees the layout of the DVD: what clips will be used and how they will be played along with customization of the menu. After authoring the DVD via the program the user must burn it to an actual DVD for playback. This can be done using utilities included by Windows or Mac or by dedicated software.

[[File:Wikibrowse media player.png|thumb|A Media Player]]
===Media Players===
Living in the technologically advanced country that we do now, it is relatively understandable to say that, at some point or another in our life, we have all heard some form of music or audio played off of an electronic device. Today, for most of us, these devises are things such as CDs, radios, iPods, phones, DVDs, and many more. These are all things that would be considered media players. They were designed with the purpose of playing audio or videos in mind. Today, many of these players are free and are programs that most of us have probably used at some point or another (such as iTunes or Windows Media Player). One thing it is important to keep in mind when using these is that although illegally downloading things may be easy, it definitely does not make it right. It is essential that we all keep the copyright laws in mind when downloading any type of audio or video.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/mediplay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Web-page.jpg|thumb|Graphics on a Webpage]]

===Graphics, Multimedia, and the Web===
Today, it is rare to find a company that does not use some form of multimedia or graphics on their businesses web page. This is just one example of how important multimedia and graphics have become to the World Wide Web. Open up you browser and instantaneously you’ll see some from of graphics spread across that front page. Whether it’s a banner, GIF, logo, demonstration, or picture, I can pretty much guarantee you that it’s there. These graphics are nice because they easily add color and animation to the page, and make being there just a little bit more interesting for the user.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billiondollargraphics.com/web.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GPS Satellite NASA art-iif.crop.jpg|thumb|GPS Satellite NASA art-iif.crop]]
There are many different types of network applications. First and foremost is the '''internet''', the largest network of networks in the world. Second, there are our phones, the oldest of which is '''POTS''' (plain old telephone service), which one day could be replaced by the newer technology, mobile phones. Mobile phones have been around for a few years now, and are beginning to replace home phone lines. Mobile phones can be separated into two groups, '''cellular phones''' and '''satellite phones'''. Cell phones work by communicating with cell towers in order to function. There are some dual mode phones which allow you to make phone calls through a WIFI signal, and switch to cell signal when out of WIFI range. Satellite phones work by communicating with satellites in space, this is primarily used with the military, where cell tower coverage is nearly impossible in some locations. While satellite phones can be used in rural and mountainous arias, the drawback to them is when there is a storm or heavy clouds, you can lose your signal. Satellites are also used with a '''GPS'''&lt;ref&gt; wiki: Global_Positioning_System &lt;/ref&gt;(global positioning system).  GPS functions by relaying data between your device and the 24 satellites in space. They work similarly to sonar waves. The signal leaves the satellite, and depending on how long it takes to get to you will determine your exact location.

[[File:Microchip rfid rice.jpg|thumb|RFID chip]]'''Monitoring Systems''' are another form of networking applications. These systems specialize in locating a specific person, vehicle or device rather than pulling up geographical information like a GPS does. However, most monitoring systems use GPS in locating their targets. Radio Frequency Identification (or RFID) for example, can be used to locate a person or animal with an RFID chip embedded inside of it. Most commonly recognized for it's ability track pets that have the chip implanted, RFID has also moved into the human medical field. In fact, some breast implants in the United Kingdom have been chipped so that a physician can read information about the implant years after the surgery has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?11093&lt;/ref&gt; While this is the social reasoning for this type of chipping, it seems that medical records housed on inexpensive servers would suit this purpose just fine. The fact remains that RFID chips, which are about the size of a grain of rice, operate using a small silicon chip and a copper antenna which emit personal information about it's owner. This information is then picked up by electronic networks feeding back information about the product, the person carrying it, and it's location to the network. It's currently being used to track cattle and Alzheimer's patients as well as merchandise produced by manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/rfid.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Other monitoring systems include vehicle tracking software such as the famous OnStar. This type of networking application has been expanded so that employers can spy on employees using company vehicles. With a simple installation, the latest vehicle tracking applications can feed information about the geographic location of a company vehicle, the speed of the vehicle, and even &quot;hard breaking&quot; events. Mobile phones aren't omitted either. Since most of the current mobile phones have stand alone GPS systems a person can track the movements of the individuals under their plan as well as their own phone if it is stolen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caranddriver.com/features/vehicle-tracking-systems-and-data-recorders-tested-gearbox&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multimedia''' networking has exploded as well. This type of networking offers digital multimedia content such as movies, music, and recorded t.v. shows to be viewed over a phone, p.c., or television. While most devices already have the required capabilities built in, some devices need may need a receiver. Placeshifting is common with this type of network which will allow an individual to download content from one place and view it in another, i.e. from a t.v. to a mobile phone. Similarly, '''VideoConferencing''' allows people to interact remotely from separate locations. Instead of streaming a movie in real time, a person can stream a video feed from a relative or business part who might be across the globe. They can then interact and speak as they normally would while viewing the mannerisms of others in real time. Also, through the use of videoconferencing '''Telemedicine''' has been used to diagnose and treat patients who are unable to access a doctor in person because of their poverty level, geographical area, or physical condition. Physicians, with the assistance of a member on site with the patient, use videoconferencing to conduct tests such as simple ear and throat checkups to procedures as complex as actual surgery in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americantelemed.org/learn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network Characteristics==

==Network Architecture &amp; Network Topologies==

[[File:Bus Topology.png|thumb|Bus Topology]]


Network architecture is the layout of the network. The hardware, software, communication protocols, and mode of transmission consists in the network architecture. The network architecture plays an essential role in today's society; therefore, one should be aware of the network architecture, and the different types of network topologies as well. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.kioskea.net/faq/2761-what-is-network-architecture&lt;/ref&gt; Network topology is how different nodes in a network are connected to each other and how they communicate. The five most common topologies are mesh topology, star topology, bus topology, ring topology, and tree topology. In a mesh topology, devices are connected with many excessive interconnections between network mode. In a star topology, the devices are connected to a central computer, and the nodes communicate across the network by passing data through the hub, which is the central computer. In a bus topology,  it connects all devices on a local-are network called LAN. Bus networks are not very pricey, and they are easy to install. In a ring topology, it consists of a local area network whose topology is a ring. The messages travel around the ring. In a tree topology, it is considered a &quot;hybrid&quot; topology that combines characteristics of the bus and star topologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Hardware_Software/Networking/tree_topology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data Transmission Characteristics==

===Bandwidth===
[[File:Bandwidth.svg|thumb|]]
Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted in a certain amount of time. Bandwidth is also referred to as throughput. The most common measure of bandwidth is bits per second (bps), but it is also measures in Kbps, which is thousands of bits per second; Mbps, which is millions of bits per second; or Gbps, which is billions of bits per second. &lt;ref&gt; http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/bandwidth &lt;/ref&gt; Bandwidth is the capacity of the connection. A network medium with a higher bandwidth will allow more data to pass through in a certain amount of time. So the greater the capacity, the better the performance will be. This isn’t always true though because performance depends on other things too.  Text data requires the least amount least amount of bandwidth and video data requires the most. &lt;ref&gt; http://compnetworking.about.com/od/speedtests/g/bldef_bandwidth.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

===Analog vs. Digital Signals===

[[File:Digital.signal.png|thumb|The red is a digital signal and the gray would be an analog signal]]
Analog signal is a continuous signal. It has constant fluctuations. A digital signal is an electrical signal that is converted into a pattern of bits. It has a discrete value at each sampling point. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.ask.com/question/what-is-the-difference-between-analog-and-digital-signals &lt;/ref&gt; Each sample is defined with a series of bits that are either 0s or 1s. Analog signals are denoted by sine waves whereas digital signal is square waves. Analog signals would be things like human voices in the air and analog electronic devices. Digital signals are for things like computers, CDs, DVDs, and other digital electronic devices. The advantages of digital signal are that the recording does not degrade over time and groups of numbers can often be compressed by finding patterns in them. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.diffen.com/difference/Analog_vs_Digital&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission Type and Timing===
[[File:Computernetwork.png|thumb|Network Data Transfer]]
For the transfer of data and networking media, there can be two ways to send information.  Serial transmission is data sent in a single path, one bit at a time &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication &lt;/ref&gt;.  An example of this would be a classroom of students lining up single file at the door and exiting one by one.  Parallel transmission is data sent one byte at a time, but each bit in the byte takes a separate route &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_communication &lt;/ref&gt;.  This is a more efficient way of sending or receiving data.  For instance, parallel transmission can be identified as students walking through a large hallway in a school to get to their specific classrooms.  This way, there is more space involved, in order for the data to be received more efficiently.  However, most networking media usually use serial transmission.  

Synchronous, Asynchronous, and isochronous transmission are three different ways that serial transmission is transferred.  Synchronous transmission is ordered into groups and blocks of data that are transferred one after the other.  Asynchronous transmission is not used as much as synchronous because it is sent when it is ready.  The data is not synchronized which makes the end result less efficient.  Isochronous transmission sends the data all at once. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_synchronous_and_asynchronous_signalling &lt;/ref&gt;

Data can also travel in mainly three distinct ways.  Simplex transmission is when the data is traveling in only one direction.  Half-duplex transmission sends the data in either direction, but data can be sent only in one direction at a time.  Full-duplex transmission sends the data back and forth in either direction and can be simultaneous.  


===Delivery Method===

Data is delivered by using circuit switching, which is a specific path between a sender and a receiver.  A telephone system is an example of circuit switching because the path is dedicated to only those two people for the time being.  Once they are off the phone, the path is free to use by whomever else.  Sending data over the Internet is called packet switching.  The messages sent are detached in “packets.”  While traveling through the Internet, the packets contain all information going from the sender to the receiver.  Once the transmission is complete, the packets are put back together to create the correct message.

==Communications Protocols and Networking Standards==

===The definition and usage of TCP/IP===
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|Internet map 1024|This is a visual representation of how all the IP addresses are connected to each other]]
There's little argument that the most popular communications protocol being used today is TCP/IP. The protocol that's used for transferring data over the Internet, TCP/IP is actually a combination of two protocols. The TCP part of the equation stands for ''Transmission Control Protocol'' and it is culpable for data delivery. IP stands for ''Internet Protocol'' and it provides routing information and addresses. There are several reasons for the continued popularity of TCP/IP. One of these reasons is the flexibility of the dual protocols, as the core has been able to remain largely the same over 25 years, even with the immense growth of internet popularity. Another reason is the routing design, as TCP/IP is designed specifically to facilitate the routing of information over a network of arbitrary complexity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPIPOverviewandHistory-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Pretty much all operating systems have built in support for the TCP/IP protocols so that is also a big factor in their popularity. 



One potential controversy related to IP's in particular was the scare when the Internet had run out of Internet addresses. The original IP version, called IPv4, had used up all the potential number combinations so no new folks would have been able to connect to the internet... that is, until IPv6 came out. It uses 128 bit addresses, versus the mere 32 bits of IPv4, ensuring that it will be another long time to go until we risk running out of internet addresses again.&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2011/02/03/ipv4-ipv6-guide/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cellular Standards===
[[File:Iphone-5s-black.png|thumb|4th Generation Technology]]
It is no secret that the technology used for mobile phones has vastly evolved over the years. What started out as basically a mobile brick has quickly transformed into a compact, highly productive, and speedy cellular communication device. However, many people are unaware of the generational breakdown of these devices. When the first generation mobile phone was released decades ago in the 1980s, it was produced with only the purpose of voice communication in mind. It was not until the second generation came out years later, around the 1990s, that we started to see both data and voice combined into one device. This generation is best known for its access to both Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) which greatly work to enhance speed and communication up to 14.4 Kbps. When the third generation came along in the 2000s, we saw companies start to use packet switching and access speeds as fast as 2 Mbps. This brings us to where we are today. Cellular companies across the globe are starting to utilize 4g technology and offer outstanding speeds of up to 20 Mbps. With technology constantly evolving and expanding, where will it take us next? Into what technological wonders is fifth generation technology going to bring us?

===Wireless Printers===
[[File:Gnome-dev-printer.svg|thumb|A common printer]]Wi-Fi is one of the most popular networking standards that uses wireless LANs. Certain devices come Wi-Fi enabled and some can be hooked up within the wireless network. One of the most popular devices being used today is the wireless printer. Not any printer can be used, however. Special printers nowadays have the Wi-Fi transceivers built into them to locate the available networks.  The major advantage is that multiple computers can print to a printer in any location that you want. Another great advantage is that you can avoid the painful cable clutter that comes with all of the devices you could hook up to the computer. It takes much less time for a computer to connect to the printer through Wi-Fi then it does to download the software and connect it manually with a USB cord. One thing to consider though is how windows and doors might affect the strength of the signal.  Security is something to think about as well. Some printers contain a WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) encryption that allows only special computers to connect if they activate the similar feature. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hp.com/global/us/en/wireless/wireless-basics.html&lt;/ref&gt;Believe it or not, these types of printers are actually reasonably priced compared to some of the other types of electronics out there on the market.

==Networking Hardware==
[[File:RA-VBox4-Network_adapter_preferences.PNG|thumb|Network Adapter preferences]]
'''Network adapters''' are used to connect a computer to a high-speed network. If it’s the home computer that you are installing a networks adapter than you will want to install a NIC if it isn’t already built into the mobo. The high quality networks cards are cheap enough that you won’t want to drive to get one from a store. A lot of mobos have them already built in, but any NIC will come with all recent windows Verizon, and if not using that provider than make sure it will function with the OS you plan to utilize. 


'''Modems''' are able to convert your computers digital data to analog data that can be sent over telephone service lines and converts incoming analog data to digital data that the computer can work with. An internet PCI modem are cheap as well and can be found around 5 dollars, but it’s not beneficial to buy the cheaper modem because of the way they process instead of the normal way. The better quality modems are provided a device that is able to do the work directly on the card. They are known to be faster and more efficient than a cheaper modem, go figure!&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kitchentablecomputers.com/nic.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware for Connecting Devices and Networks===
[[File:Router_1.jpg|thumb|A wireless router]]
There are different configurations used in connecting devices to a network as well as connecting networks to other networks. An example of a configuration for a home network is a star topology where there is one central device that provides a connection for other devices. This central device, or hub, is not as efficient regarding the availability of bandwidth between the devices, specifically computers, that are connected to the hub. More exactly, the '''hub''' can lead to unnecessary traffic build-up because it repeats everything it receives to other devices. This may or may not be an issue depending on the size of the network. A small network will not have much issue with using a hub for a central device, but for other, larger networks a different device may be more practical.
A '''switch''' is more suitable for larger networks. Like hubs, switches allow devices to communicate with each other. However switches contain ports that are designated for individual devices, which allows for a more efficient allocation of bandwidth for the devices as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darron.net/network/secondpage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Routers''' are used to connect multiple networks by taking information from broadband signals, through a modem, and then sending it to each network.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatismyipaddress.com/routers&lt;/ref&gt; Because they maintain configuration information in a storage known as a routing table, routers can filter incoming or outgoing traffic.&lt;ref&gt;http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/routers/g/bldef_router.htm&lt;/ref&gt; '''Wireless access points''' are devices that allow a device access to the network. This, along with a switch, can be found in '''wireless routers'''. These routers connect both wired and wireless devices to a network, which then connects that network to the Internet. Another device is a '''bridge''', which simply connects two LANs. An example of this would be connecting a game console to a home network.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Evolution of the Internet==
[[File:ARPA1974english.JPG|thumb|ARPA1974english]]
The internet has changed dramatically since its first incarnation. In 1969 the U.S. department of defense created ARPANET&lt;ref&gt; wiki: ARPANET &lt;/ref&gt;. The original concept of this project was to connect researchers located in different places to be able to communicate and collaborate from far distances. The fear of nuclear attack was very prevalent at this time, so the team also wanted to make a network that could still operate after a nuclear attack. Therefore creating many different fail safes, and alternative routes for packet sending was necessary. As this project grew, more and more people gained access to the internet and began shaping it to what we know today. As we have described before, everyone who uses the internet is called an internet user. For these users to obtain access to the internet, you must go through an ISP (internet service provider.) Side note, while the internet is not owned by any one company or government, it is most assuredly not free. It costs money to build, run, and maintain the servers that bring you the funny cat videos.

[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|map of Internet]]'''Internet 2''' is an amalgamation of different leaders in the field of academia, technology, industry, and government that formed together in order to collaborate on pioneering and innovative ideas that help advance education and research. They test new network applications and technologies using high-performance networks. Contrary to popular opinion, Internet 2 is not a gathering of minds who intend to replace the current Internet but congregate to ensure that the future Internet will be capable of operating with today's engineering. Internet 2 is currently being upgraded to 8.8 terabytes! This will aide in the ability to offer advanced telemedicine and long distance learning opportunities across connected countries through its network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internet2.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using the Internet==

===Getting Set Up To Use The Internet &amp; Different Internet Connections===

[[File:Crystal Clear app Internet Connection Tools.svg|thumb|Crystal Clear app Internet Connection Tools]]

Almost every household has access to the internet; therefore, it is important to know how to have access to the world wide web. There are five basic steps to set up an internet connection which consist of the following: 

# One must connect the hardware. Different hardware and software contain directions in setting up. Use the directions to set up these systems.
# The internet needs a wireless connection or an Ethernet cable before it can go online. Therefore, the computer owner must make this connection. 
# The computer owner must connect to the default IP address. The IP address usually consists of eight numbers, and it is broken up occasionally by periods. 
# It is the internet's server's responsibility to show the computer owner how to actually establish the connection. One must then set up a name and password for security purposes.
# Save the settings, and the internet light will turn green to indicate one is online. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-an-Internet-Connection&lt;/ref&gt;
:
There are many different kinds of internet connections. A few of these connections consist of wireless, broadband, and dial-up. Wireless is a router or a network that connects to a hot spot. A broadband is connected directly to a broadband modern, and one needs a user name and password to connect. A dial-up is used remotely via a telephone line. &lt;ref&gt;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/what-are-the-different-internet-connection-methods&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searching the Internet==
===Search Sites===
[[File:Bing logo.svg|thumb|Bing! A popular search site.]]
Search sites are websites that are specifically created to help search the Internet. Examples would include, “Google,” “Bing,” “Yahoo! Search,” and “Ask.com.” There are also many other not as well known search sites. Search sites generally use a search engine, which is a program for the retrieval of data from a database or network.  A search engine includes a spider, which goes to every page on every Web site that wants to be searchable and reads it. Then there is a program that creates an index from the pages that have been read. Then a program that receives your search request and compares it to the index, then gives you results. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/search_engine.html &lt;/ref&gt; Most search sites today are designed for keyword searches, which is when you type in keywords describing what you are searching for. A directory search is the other kind of search hat some sites allow and it uses lists of categories instead of a search box. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/K/keyword_search.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many search sites will also contain tools that can be used to find information. Many sites try to present their results as clearly as possible. They will also tend to make suggestions about things that are similar to what you searched that may help you find what you are looking for. &lt;ref&gt; http://webaim.org/techniques/sitetools/&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Google web search tr.png|thumb|Google Search]]

===Search Strategies===
Users of the Internet find search engines, like Google, helpful in order to gain information on a preferred topic.  However, some may find it difficult to retrieve the correct information.  Students with a research paper assignment find it increasingly difficult to get specific information, even from the vast World Wide Web.  There are different ways to combat this confusion.  The first tip to improve searching on sites is called phrase searching.  Phrase searching allows users to search for documents containing an exact sentence or phrase opposed to being limited to keywords. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_search &lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, to search for a more specific topic, users generally put “quotation marks” around their key phrase to specify the search.  The second tip is to browse multiple search sites instead of just using Google.  Google is preferred to most people; however there can be a significant difference when searching for certain information.  Another tip is to use Boolean Operators. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean &lt;/ref&gt;  This means that users type the words AND, OR, and NOT into their search.  Say you want to search for different types of dogs.  To gather information for two types of dogs, the key phrase would look something like, “Cockapoo AND Golden Retriever.”  To search only Golden Retrievers the search would be, “Golden Retriever NOT Cockapoo.”  And to perhaps search both, one could use “Golden Retriever OR Cockapoo.”  Some tricks others might use if they are having trouble with search results, is to use synonyms or key words.  For example, when searching for tables online one might use the words “vintage table.”  If they are not having any luck, they can use the phrase “antique table.”  This is called variant or alternate words.  Field searches can also be used to search for specific results.  This is limited to a certain title page, Web site, URL, or page text.  When searched, the information specified is only through the Web site or pages requested.  Finally when the user finished with the search, it is also very important to cite any Internet resources used when typing a paper, doing a report, or giving a speech.  Credit should be given where it originally came from.  

==Beyond Browsing and Email==
===Instant Messaging and Text Messaging===
[[File:2008TICA Press Conference TransAVA T88 TV Phone.jpg|thumb|2008TICA Press Conference TransAVA T88 TV Phone|You send text messages with a cell phone such as this one, though SMS has been on the decline]]
Communication is quite possibly the most important tool that humans can hone. While e-mails are a fast and environmentally-friendly method of Internet-based communication, there are two types of messaging that are faster and easier. These two types of messaging are: instant messaging and text messaging. Instant messaging, also referred to as chat, allows you to type out a message on your keyboard and then press 'enter' to have it sent immediately to the other party. Unlike emails, where you have to wait for the other person to be around at their computer to read the message, and THAT is assuming your email didn't get lost because of a faulty spam filter, IM's create a connection that is almost as good as being in the same room with the friend. To instant message a friend, you typically both need the same IM client, of which there are many free varieties such as AIM, MSN, YIM, and Skype.


Text messaging, which is also called SMS (Short Message Service), used to be the most popular means of speedy communication though it has been on the decline.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.brosix.com/why-instant-messaging-is-now-more-popular-than-sms/&lt;/ref&gt; Text messaging allows users to send fast and typically short notes with their cellular phones. The major downside of text messaging is how many cellphone companies charge a ton for your texts while instant messaging is free (plus the cost of the internet for your computer or phone, of course). Also text messages, like emails, need to be waited for and can sometimes not make it to the right place without a glitch whereas instant messengers tend to have a better track record.

=== Online Shopping: Amazon ===
 [[File:Amazon Box.JPG|thumb|Amazon Box]]Online shopping is so convenient for many who are on the go. There are no hours of operation to abide by, no lines to wait in, and consumers do not even have to leave the comfort of their own home to get what they want. There are some downsides of online shopping, such as not being able to try on clothes to see if it is the right size. The largest online retailer is Amazon.com. Shoppers seems to go-to website for all online shopping needs. The retailer started as an online book store, but now offers  purses, electronics, movies, music, and even sports equipment, just to name a few.  Sellers can create accounts fairly easy and try to sell their goods. Buyers need to be the cautious ones and look into the reviews to see who they are buying from. One advantage of shopping with Amazon is that they have an A-Z guarantee that helps the buyers resolve conflict with the sellers. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioba.org/newsletter/archive/8%284%29/toolbox2.php&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon expanded their services to include areas such as Amazon Art, Amazon Instant Video, Amazon Prime, Amazon Local, Amazon Wireless, Amazon Fresh, and Amapedia. One controversy that comes up with Amazon.com, as well as online shopping, is that consumers are not paying their true county sales tax. Instead they are paying the sales tax that Amazon collects.

===Social Media===
[[File:Voip HowItWorks 0203v2.jpg|thumb|Voip HowItWorks 0203v2]]
Besides texting, instant messaging, and online shopping, there are hundreds of other things you can use the Web for. One of the main things people use it for today is social media. Things from Facebook and Twitter to email and online newspapers are all forms of social media, or sites used to share information to groups of people over the Internet. The problem with the huge explosion that has been the beginning of the social media era is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to believe information posted online. The Internet has evolved so much that now we are able to even perform video and telephone functions through it. Sites like Skype are taking advantage of this technology. According to the FCC (Federal Communications Commision) the technology used by Skype, Vonage, and other similar Companies is called VoIP. They define this technology as one “that allows you to make voice calls using a broadband Internet connection instead of a regular (or analog) phone line”&lt;ref&gt; http://transition.fcc.gov/voip/&lt;/ref&gt;. Essentially, performing telephone functions through the Internet is VoIP. Social Media has seemingly encompassed the younger generations of today; while it has been slower to catch on with the older generations, it is something that has been increasing over time.

==Censorship and Privacy==
 
[[File: Bypassing_Internet_Censorship-Proxy-IE-1.gif ‎|thumb|Bypassing internet censorship]]

===Censorship===
Censorship is the control of the information distributed within a society and has been a sense of dictatorships throughout time. It’s the suppression of offensive expressions that are used for when people want to provoke their personal political or values to another group. Typically now censorship is filtered by the government to control the information that is given to the public. Censorship by the government is typically unconstitutional because of the freedom of speech and is highly fought against in the First Amendment. Different countries are now censoring their countries privacy information for their countries safely and they occasionally stop the information coming in and out of the country. On another note, when individuals are on strike or boycott an event they are protected by the First Amendment which can be dangerous but they are still known to be protected. Some private censorship campaigns are best countered by groups and individuals speaking out and organizing in defense of the threatened expression.&lt;ref&gt;http://gilc.org/speech/osistudy/censorship/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/censorship&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web Browsing Privacy===
[[File:Privacy.jpg|thumb|Knowledge of internet privacy is vital]]
Privacy is of great importance to all users of the Internet. According to Wikipedia, internet privacy involves the right or mandate of personal privacy concerning the sorting, repurposing, provision to third-parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy&lt;/ref&gt; This has been a subject of concern for decades. For example, one article that addresses the potential implications of privacy and computer dates back to 1965.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multicians.org/fjcc6.html&lt;/ref&gt; While it is certain that privacy can be infringed, a simple awareness of how exactly certain processes, like using a search engine, interact with a user can be help deal with some of these concerns. 

When one uses a search engine, such as Google, small files known as '''cookies''' are created to help identify preferences for the user. This enables a more accurate and quicker response when beginning a new session. To put this into context, cookies can help retrieve information like what was in a shopping cart for a previous session. However, third-party cookies can be more of an issue to some. Companies use these cookies to target advertisements towards users depending on their browsing patterns. Using the Internet Options in Internet Explorer (for Windows) can help one decide what types of cookies can be allowed as well as delete all cookies off the hard drive.

A more serious threat to internet privacy is '''spyware''', which refers to any software that is installed without knowledge of the user that obtains information about that user through an Internet connection. The degree to which these programs can cause harm range from simple annoyances (e.g. setting a homepage to something else) to full-scale threats on system integrity (e.g. rewriting the Windows registry to restrict the user from changing the homepage back to its original state). 

'''Adware''', while related to spyware, is less harmful. Adware is usually installed alongside other software, and this leads to advertisements that appear on-screen. This can be installed without prior knowledge during the installation of another program by not reading the licensing agreements that come with the program. Therefore it is important to read carefully the agreement to ensure unwanted software is kept away from the computer.

===E-mail Privacy===
[[File:Gmail logo.png|thumb|Gmail Controversy]]
It is extremely important to always make sure that any important or confidential information being shared over the Internet is being done in a private and confidential way. One of the unfortunate downfalls to everything being done electronically today is that we lose a sense of privacy. Things are much easier to attain on the Internet, and sadly there are hackers out there who spend their time trying to break into and gain access to this confidential information. If you are going to send important information electronically, it is necessary that you send it in an encrypted message. Encrypted messages make it so that others cannot hack into your e-mails and read what you are saying. 
One of the more recent controversies with privacy in e-mailing has to do with Google mail. Google has come out saying that they should be able to read the information sent by any of its Gmail users. People find issue with this because they are gaining personal and confidential information that individuals do not want out there. The purpose of sending a specific email to a specific individual is so that it can be done in privacy, with the hopes that only that recipient will receive it. However, today this is unfortunately not the case, and if you are going to send mail electronically, one needs to proceed with caution. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/09/05/google-seeks-to-dismiss-gmail-privacy-lawsuit-says-it-has-right-to-scan/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Encryption - decryption.svg|thumb|Encryption - decryption]]
Firewall is a type of security system that creates a wall that checks all incoming and outgoing messages to ensure only authorized traffic goes through. There are many different forms of this application such as Norton&lt;ref&gt;http://us.norton.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and Windows Security Essentials&lt;ref&gt;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download&lt;/ref&gt;. Another way to protect your information is encryption. Encryption basically scrambles and makes any message sent unreadable to anyone who does not have a key.  The key is then used to decrypt the scrambled message into the original format. Whenever you go to a website that has an S after the HTTP that means it is a secure web page. Meaning the entire web page is encrypted, so people hacking to your web browser cannot get you credit card number or SSN. One question that arises is, can't you just make every website a secure web page? The simple answer is money, a site owner needs to pay someone to encrypt the site. Then to send the data takes up more bandwidth, and slows down traffic in general. Another form of protection is a VPN (virtual private network). A VPN creates a link between the user and some other destination. In order to access the VPN you will need a username and password, in order to keep it more secure and to block out hackers.

[[File:Fingerprint and retinal scan.jpg|thumb|Retinal Scanner]]'''Biometric Access Systems''' identify an individual based on their fingerprint, iris, or facial features or other unique physiological characteristic. Keystroke Dynamics recognize an individual's personal typing pattern to authenticate the user as s/he types a username or password. Biometric readers allow access based on the persons physical characteristics. Fingerprint readers and retinal scanners isolate an unchangeable property in an individual in order to identify them and offer high security based on these measures. They are typically used to control access to high risk facilities such as government property, prisons, and corporate headquarters. Fingerprint scanners have also been equipped into laptops in order to offer a higher standard of protection in securing personal files. In the same way, a person can download face recognition software onto their laptop as well. Because biometrics are entirely unique to the user, they are extremely accurate. In the same way no two people will have the same fingerprint, a persons facial features and iris' are as equally unique. In fact, the odds of another person having the same features as another is about 1 in 10^78 power.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.biometricupdate.com/201308/human-recognition-systems-integrates-biometric-access-control-with-cscs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer Sabotage==

===Botnets and Computer Viruses===

[[File:Computer n screen.svg|thumb|Protect Your Computer]]

A botnet is a large group of computers that have been taken over; botnets are a serious threat to computer users because of their devious ways of taking over computers. At the time, computer owners
did not know their computers were being altered. Botnets are commonly used for DDoS attacks, click-fraud, phishing campaigns, key logging,and host malicious web sites. There are warning signs a computer user should be aware of if he or she's computer is apart of a botnet. For example, the computer will be extremely slow, one will receive emails accusing he or she of spam, and the computer user will have email messages in his or her's outbox that was never sent. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucalgary.ca/it/help/articles/security/awareness/botnets&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a malware is any type of deleterious software. A computer virus is a common type of malware that ruins computers. There are many harmful effects that could come with a computer virus. For example, a virus could delete important data, send out fake emails, and could possibly delete the information that contains on the hard drive. Therefore, it is important for a computer user to buy an anti virus system for his or her’s computer to avoid these terrible malfunctions that are very common in computers. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.ucalgary.ca/it/help/articles/security/awareness/botnets &lt;/ref&gt;

==Online Theft and Fraud==
===Identity Theft===
[[File:Credit-cards.jpg|thumb|]]
Identity theft is when someone identity in order to gain access to their bank accounts and possibly rent apartments or take out loans in that persons name. They then use their credit cards to make purchases. It usually begins when someone gets the name, address, and social security of someone from thrown a discarded document, usually mail. They can also get people’s information form the Internet. Identity theft is typically grouped into two subcategories. One is true name identity theft and that is when the thief uses another person’s information to open new accounts. The other kind is account takeover, which is when the thief uses someone else’s personal information to gain access to their existing accounts. &lt;ref&gt; http://money.howstuffworks.com/identity-theft.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  There are different techniques such as skimming and social engineering. Skimming is when the thief uses a device that reads and stores credit and debit card numbers and stores them for later retrieval by the thief. Social engineering is when you pretend to work at a bank and ask people for their information. &lt;ref&gt; http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/identity+theft &lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Phishing===
[[File:Twitter logo.svg|thumb|]]
Phishing is when a thief sends out an e-mail that looks like it is from a legitimate site and then they steal your information. They are typically sent to a large group of people and they include an urgent message. It usually says that they need to update their banking information or something to that affect. Phishing attempts can occur anywhere, including Twitter, MySpace, or e-bay. &lt;ref&gt; http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/phishing&lt;/ref&gt; Something that is becoming more targeted is spear phishing. Spear phishing is e-mails are personalized. It is often targeted to social media sites because it is easier to find personal information on people. &lt;ref&gt; http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/spear-phishing&lt;/ref&gt; 


[[File:AluminiumG4.jpg|thumb|Online Fraud]]
===Pharming, Drive-by Pharming, and Online Auction Fraud===
Many people today are victims of identity theft.  Another type of fraud or scam is called Pharming.  Pharming is usually a fraudulent domain name intended to redirect a website’s traffic to another “trick” website.  Pharming can be conducted either by changing the hosts file on a victim’s computer, or by the exploitation of a vulnerability in DNS server software. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharming &lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes this happens via email.  The hacker gets ahold of the user’s email address and sends the code or website to the specific user.  Once the user receives and opens the email, the hacker can receive the user’s information.  Pharming usually happens most often with DNS servers at a company with a common and well-known Web site.  The hacker can change IP addresses intended for the company URL.  Then the company URL is routed to the “poisoned” URL, which then takes over the Web server.  This method of pharming is useful to the hacker because the “poisoned” Web site is usually made to look exactly like the company Web site.  Once the user logs in, the hacker captures the username and password for the first time.  The user receives a login message error and is then returned to the original company Web site.  Drive-by Pharming is a little more recent.  This method is used by logging into the user’s personal routers by using a common password that a script within a website can run.  When it is accessed, the information on the router can be modified to suite the hacker. &lt;ref&gt; http://highsecurity.blogspot.com/2007/02/pharming-and-drive-by-pharming.html &lt;/ref&gt;
Online auction fraud happens when a payment online goes to the seller, but the item is never delivered.  For instance, if a buyer wants to make a bid online and buy tickets to a show or a concert, the buyer pays the seller for the tickets, and the seller never sends them.  Many people are scammed each year and need to be careful with who they are trusting over the Internet.

==Protecting Against Online Theft and Fraud==
===Protecting Against Identity Theft===
[[File:Vincent Bethell Self Aware Placard.png|thumb|Vincent Bethell Self Aware Placard|The key to internet safety is always being self aware.]]
Just as the Internet is always evolving for good, there are also constantly scheming e-criminals hoping to take advantage of those who aren't careful with their online identities. Identity Theft is one of the scariest things that can happen to a person, especially if they don't have a strong friend or family base to help convince the proper authorities of their true identity. There is no one universal way to protect yourself from identity theft; instead, there are a number of steps you should take to keep yourself fully protected. The first thing you can do is be responsible with your bank accounts and credit cards. If you're checking your balance every day, you will be quick to see if there are any suspicious discrepancies occurring.&lt;ref&gt;http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/how-to-tech/how-to-protect-against-identity-theft2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The next important step to protect against identity theft seems simple but can be easily overlooked: do not give out your personal information on the internet. This includes phone numbers, addresses, or anything else that hackers could potentially trace back to something you hold valuable. One of the final ways you can protect yourself from identity theft is being wary of your mail. It is very easy for an e-criminal to send you a destructive link in an email that looks like it came from one of your friends, where one small click will lead you into a world of pain. Just follow these few rules and you will be doing fine online.

=== The Safety of Using PayPal ===
[[File:Credit-cards.jpg|thumb|Credit-cards]]Internet users have to be very cautious of the information they put on the internet. PayPal seems to be a popular e-commerce business that many people use and willing give their private information to. Is this payment processor to be trusted? PayPal makes the lives of everyday internet consumers much easier. Its secure server stores your credit card information so payment over the internet is more efficient. Not much effort has to be put in by the individuals that use this payment processor. Other accounts require a vast amount of paper work to be signed beforehand. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.xsitepro.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-paypal-as-your-primary-payment-processor.html&lt;/ref&gt;One drawback to using PayPal is that there is a long list of rules the users must abide by, and if a user breaks any of these rules their money could be locked for up to six months while under investigation. An interesting feature that was added to PayPal in 2006 was an additional security option. Instead of only entering a login id and password, PayPal users can choose to type a six-digit number code in as well. This lowers the risk of malware bots trying to hack into the account. The only bad part is that there is a fee associated with this added security measure. Users might be discouraged to protect their accounts because of this additional fee. They should still take caution when it comes to entering personal information into PayPal.

===Cyber-bullying=== 
This is a new way of bullying especially for the amount of social networks and how it has influenced our society today. Unfortunately, it happens 24 hours of the day and anything can be posted or distributed anonymously in which it could be difficult to track where the bullying is coming from. And as everyone is informed these days, once something is on the internet, there is no way to permanently delete the comment after it has been sent. It happens when individuals are bullied through electronic technology. For example, you can cyber bully over text message, emails, rumors send through any type of social networks. There’s no way to prevent an individual from making a comment that could be known as the start of cyber bullying, but simply ignoring or reporting the comment to either a parent, friend or any type of guidance person could benefit you most in not having the bullying continue. To elaborate, you can simply block the individual that had started the commenting and keep any type of evidence of the bullying for future documents in case it gets worse. A last important note is to recognize the signs of attitudes if a student were to be cyber bullied; some reactions are abusing drugs and alcohol, skip school, receive poor grades and have lower self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online Pornography===
[[File:Barnpaapc.jpg|thumb|Protecting the Children]]
Along with the lifespan and constant evolution of the Internet came the controversial issue of online pornography. Though pornography has unfortunately been around on paper for centuries, electronic access has made it much easier, quicker, and more convenient for any individual to get ahold of it at any given time. With this online access comes a much bigger and more controversial issue. It has introduced people, especially children, to new and substantial safety issues. 
Though child pornography is banned and illegal, there is a considerable amount of it being circulated and passed throughout the Internet. With the link that has been made between this horrible content and child molestation, it is reasonable to be concerned about the spike that this will bring. Not only does it encourage sick people to do horrible things, but the computer also gives them an outlet to meet and dishonestly introduce themselves to children. It is unfortunate that today we have to be concerned about what could come from our children talking to people on the Internet; however, it is important that we voice these risks and make sure that parents take every precaution possible to keep their children from ever experiencing these horrific possibilities. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.popcenter.org/problems/child_pornography/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protecting Against Cyberbullying, Cyberstalking, and Other Personal Safety Concerns==
===Safety Tips for Adults===
[[File:Texting.jpg|thumb|Be careful what you send]]
While it may seem unnecessary to state, the Internet is accessed by not only those with good intentions but also those who can pose a threat in a variety of ways. It is important to be aware of this fact because it is quite easy to forget how vast of an entity the Internet is and countless masses who use it daily. This makes for the task of safeguarding information from those who mean harm an important responsibility. Some of the ways one can prevent cyberbullying, cyberstalking and other issues are by using names that are gender-neutral. This hides the identity of the user, and this is important for female users because unfortunately they are more likely to be targets compared to male users.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyberbullying.us/research.php&lt;/ref&gt; Also, one should not give phone numbers, addresses and other personal information to strangers for obvious reasons. 

===Safety Tips for Children and Teens===
Monitoring how children and teenagers use the Internet through the computer, smartphone, game console, etc. is the most important step in protecting them. It is recommended to place certain restrictions on how they use the Internet so that they do not access certain sites that might make them more susceptible to dangerous individuals or certain sites (e.g. adult sites). It is also important for older teens to understand the potential ramifications, including not only personal but also legal issues, that can arise from sending explicit messages or pictures via text messaging.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Web-Based Multimedia==

'''Overview'''
[[File:Multimedia.png|thumb|Multimedia]]
Whether you know it or not, you have seen multimedia and you should be semi familiar with it. Multimedia is exactly what is sounds like, multi (many) media (pictures, video, etc.). If you go to humble bundle.com&lt;ref&gt;https://www.humblebundle.com&lt;/ref&gt; you will see an excellent assortment of multimedia. You have a countdown, which is your animation, you have images of the games you can get. When you click on an image you will get an expansion showing you a description and an embedded YouTube&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt; video. Now that you understand the basics you can see all of the different uses of multimedia in your favorite websites. While this sounds great and having multimedia will make any site better, remember too much of anything is not good.

[[File:US Army 53138 United States Army Africa - official website and social media center.jpg|thumbnail|Multimedia website with images, video, and text]]'''Web Based Multimedia Applications''' come in a wide variety and can be found all over the Internet. A website that contains more than one type of media is considered to be multimedia. Sites that contain sound, video, animation, and/or images alongside text fall into this category. Typically, these sites use multiple applications such as these to convey certain information to the viewer of the web page. Manufacturers might use photos and PDF based user's manuals to transfer key points of interest about their products to the viewers. In other cases, multimedia can be used as a teaching tool where visitors learn through instructional videos or a news site might use podcasts and television footage to update their readers through their websites. Images and sound are also employed by many musicians when visiting their sites alongside the text-based dates of their tour. Entertainment also plays a large factor in web based multimedia applications. With the rise of Internet video streaming, people can now watch their favorite t.v. shows when they have the free time to do so, and from anywhere there is an Internet connection. Websites like Netflix and Hulu use sound, video, and often thumbnail photo icons alongside their descriptive text of the shows available. Some things to keep in mind concerning these multimedia applications are Internet connection speed and bandwidth. Most of these video streaming websites; whether news, sports, or t.v. shows, etc. require a minimum broadband connection speed of 500Kbs for standard definition viewing. The minimum speed requirement increases as the definition increases and vice versa. Bandwidth plays an important role as well since some service providers put a cap on the amount of information that can be processed. Most &quot;smart&quot; phone service providers set a cap of 1Gb or 2Gb a month and charge additional fees if this ceiling is ignored. Considering that a standard definition, one hour t.v. show can be close to 200Mb, it is wise to pay attention to the bandwidth being consumed as this can rapidly add up. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/kenshin1017/introduction-to-multimedia-4663053&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimedia Elements==

===The Five Multimedia Elements===
[[File:Gyro.gif|thumb|Animation]]

Text, image, audio, video, and animation are the five multimedia elements. The first multimedia element is text. Text is the most common multimedia element. Text expresses the information the developer is trying to get across to their viewers. Even though pictures grab the viewers’ attention, text is a good idea to include, as well, just in case the picture does not load. The second multimedia element is image. An image catches the viewers’ attention much more quickly than just plain, old text. Almost every multimedia application contains images. The most common images are JPEGS and PNGs. Also, Photoshop and Paint.NET create high tech visual effects which are common with images. The third multimedia element is audio. Most of the time, audio files are deployed using plug-in media players. A few audio formats include RealAudio, MIDI, Wave, WMA, and MP3. The developer will compress the format to shorten the time. Before the file is downloaded, one can stream the audio. The fourth multimedia element is video. The web is the most common place where videos are seen concerning multimedia elements. A few digital video formats are Flash, MPEG, AVI, WMV, and QuickTime. Streaming digital videos can increase the speed of the playback. Developers use videos to hold on to the viewers’ attention. The fifth multimedia website is animation. Animation draws in the younger crowd. AdobeFlash is the most common tool for creating these animations. Animations are the most creative and fun multimedia element! &lt;ref&gt;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/5-components-multimedia-28279.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimedia Web Design==

===Basic Design Principles===
The main thing about designing a website is that the whole point is to create a site that is interesting and will bring customers or people to look at it. Not only that, but you have to keep it interesting; people don’t want to see the same things on a website at all times. It needs to be updated and changed as time passes. Another important thing to remember is that many people aren’t that tech savvy. It is important to keep the website somewhat simplistic. Confusing websites draw people away. It is important to make sure your webpages load quickly, which can be done by choosing multimedia elements carefully and to modify them as necessary, like optimizing photos to make them run as efficient as possible. Nowadays another important thing to consider when creating a website is whether or not people are going to be able to view it from other devices such as their phones, their tablets, or whatever else. It may be beneficial to also create a mobile version of the site.  Its important to look at what browser people can use for this website. Some sites have certain features that can only be accessed by certain browsers, it is important to make sure to use features that work well on all common browsers. It would also be beneficial to use features that don’t require plug-ins. When people visit a site they are not going to want to have to install something just to go on the site or to access something on the site. It is also important to look at the size of the page content. &lt;ref&gt; http://desktoppub.about.com/od/designprinciples/ &lt;/ref&gt; You want to be sure that your information can be seen on all computer screens. 
	
===Using Flow Charts, Page Layouts, and Storyboards===
When talking about website design, a flowchart is used to show how different web pages relate to each other. A flowchart is basically a map of the website. There can be links between the lines of the flowchart to take you where you want to go. When designing a website, you can make it as simple or as complicated as you want. Often times, the flowchart is designed in the early stages of the website because it provides a good building ground for the website. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.edrawsoft.com/flow-chart-design.php &lt;/ref&gt; Page layout is used in the designing of a website. Typically people create two page layouts; one for the home page and one for all the other pages. This is when you design where you want the different logos, like the home page button, and its when you decide how visually exciting you want your website. While it’s important to make it visually interesting, it is also important to keep it simple so that it does not get too confusing. &lt;ref&gt; http://designshack.net/articles/layouts/10-rock-solid-website-layout-examples/ &lt;/ref&gt; Storyboards are also something commonly used in website design. Storyboards are a series of pictures that depict what is going to happen on each screen. They are typically used when creating something animated. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672917/the-8-steps-to-creating-a-great-storyboard &lt;/ref&gt;



===Navigational Design Considerations===
[[File:Refreshable Braille display.jpg|thumb|Braille Display]]
While creating a Web site, it is important not to overlook small details.  The structure of the site is the most significant part for easy navigation.  Headlines and main menus need to be organized in a way that is understandable for users.  Many experts and Internet users agree that it should only take up to three mouse clicks to return back to the main page and to search more easily.  Different forms that are used in Web sites include search boxes, drop-down menus, site maps, text-based hyperlinks, navigation bars, and menu tabs.  Images can also be another hyperlink to transfer to another page on the site.  It is crucial that the Web site has the same links in the same location as the previous page.  Things would get confusing if the user had to look over each navigation button every time they entered a new area on the site.  Long Web pages should be separated into shorter, more concise pages to avoid loading and scrolling.  On many Websites today users will see “Back to Top” to navigate back to the top of the page, mostly on long Web pages.  Most importantly, a link to the Home Page should be listed on every Web page according to the Web site. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_navigation &lt;/ref&gt;

===Access Considerations===
Device Compatibility and Assistive Technology should be taken into consideration while creating a multimedia Web site.  As our society grows with more ways to reach the Internet than just the computer, Web site creators need to be aware of the fact that the public is using their Web sites on Smartphones, Tablets, iPads, and much more.  The layout may be different on these smaller devices than would a desktop computer.  Sites are now creating multiple ways to work with any form of technology.  With stricter disability laws being put into place, we have started to think about different ways to inform the physically disabled via the Internet on Web sites.  Braille display &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display &lt;/ref&gt; and screen readers &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader &lt;/ref&gt; are just some of the newly advanced technology that can be used.  Alternative text &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Alternative_text_for_images &lt;/ref&gt; can be used, which is a text description for a Web page image.  It is displayed when the image is pointed to a can be read by assistive technology.  

==&lt;b&gt;Creating a Web Site using HTML, XML, XHTML, CSSs&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;HTML&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

[[File:HTML Tags.png|thumb|HTML Tags &lt;ref&gt;http://www.compapp.dcu.ie/~humphrys/Notes/Internet/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;p&gt;HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is mostly used to create webpages. HTML is a code made up of small pieces called &lt;i&gt;tags&lt;/i&gt;. Tags are small pieces of the HTML code that give commands to the computer on how to format whatever it is linked to. tags begin with a less than symbol (&lt;), then the command is written, then closed with a greater than symbol (&gt;). That is the beginning tag. Next the text it applies to is inserted. Then, the tag is ended with a less than symbol (&lt;), followed by a common slash (/), then the same command code as it began with, then a greater than symbol (&gt;). So, your basic code will look something like this: &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/(insert code)&gt; Applied Text Here &lt;/(insert code)&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are so many different things you can do with HTML. You can &lt;mark&gt;highlight text&lt;/mark&gt; &lt;mark style=&quot;background:lightblue&quot;&gt;(even in different colors)&lt;/mark&gt;, you can &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;make text different colors&lt;/span&gt;, you can &lt;abbr title=&quot;Create Definitions or Captions that Appear upon Rollover&quot;&gt;(Hover Mouse Here)&lt;/abbr&gt;, as well as &lt;b&gt;bold face&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;I&gt;italicize&lt;/I&gt; text. These are just some of the basic modifications that can be created by using HTML formatting.There are even ways to insert images as well hyperlinks. Here I have inserted [//en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Computer_Information_Systems= A Link to Our Wikibook Homepage] and even the pictures you see to the right. The possibilities are almost endless when using HTML.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The biggest problem with HTML is that most people do not want to take the time to sit down and learn all of the little codes and specifications. It is very useful when trying to organize webpages once it is mastered. HTML allows users the ability to manage where images, videos, animations, and text formatting are all located. It is a very powerful and useful design tool and something that seems to be somewhat overlooked and taken for granted. 
&lt;/p&gt;

===A Brief History Of CSS===
[[File:Mr. Potato Head and Friends.jpg|thumb|The way CSS and HTML work together is very much like a Mr. Potato Head toy. The content of the web page using HTML is the potato itself, whereas the stylish customization using CSS is the collection of items that personalize your potato.]]
To make your website truly stand out, it needs a sense of style greater than what HTML and its ilk can provide. This is where CSSs come into play. CSSs stand for Cascading Style Sheets, and they offer a way to not only specifically style a Web page but even the entire Web site to which it belongs. Before CSSs there had been individuals who created style sheets for their own purposes but thought it unnecessary to publish their developed syntax, believing that each browser should decide how best to display pages to its users. When Web page writers issued complaints that they couldn't customize more deeply, they were generally ignored, forced to deal with browsers that offered consistently fewer options for the sake of streamlining. To address this, a Norwegian by the name of Hakon Wium Lie offered a first draft of Cascading HTML Style Sheets in 1994. He couldn't have imagined how popular his development would become.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/history/&lt;/ref&gt; CSSs offer plenty of room for style without being needlessly complicated like some of its rival setups, such as DSSSL. The easiest way to describe what makes CCS stand out as a language is how it works to separate the content of a page from its display.&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2012/10/24/css-for-dummies/&lt;/ref&gt; CSS3 is the most popular variation of CSS right now, but number 4 is already growing in notoriety.

===Creating the Multimedia Elements===
[[File:Multimedia GANTT Chart.jpg|thumb|Media]]
Multimedia presentation uses graphics, sound clip, video clips, and text to deliver a message to the audience. All you need is a multimedia authoring program and a computer in order to create a presentation. The reason in using multimedia will be able to not only get the message you want to convey to the audience out but it provides a creative way in making it for the viewer. These following are types of situations that would see yourself wanting to use multimedia presentations in order to provide a creative presentation. One is for projects in order to show your teacher or a classmate in a more formal setting, another would be a class exhibit for the library or computer lab, for a more personal use you could utilize it as a diary, and the last two ways would be in a slideshow format and or utilize it for a yearbook. The three C’s in making a good multimedia presentation would be keeping it Clean, being Consistent and bring Character to the presentations. Next you will need to design the presentations in which make it able to be presentable and attract the attention of the audience. To continue, you’ll have to plan your presentation. Make an outline and make sure you understand the major topics of the presentation. Next the presenter will have to choose their media; multimedia elements support the main points of the presentation. Certain data will benefit the presentation as well, like, charts, graphs, maps, images and videos. Afterwards, review revise and rearrange so you know that the information is accurate and ready to be presented.

===Creating the Web Site===
[[file:Python logo and wordmark.svg|thumb|Python is a programming language used in Web design]] 
Web site developers use a number of tools to create Web sites. These can be divided into three large groups: markup languages, scripting languages, and Web site authoring software. '''Markup languages''' are the foundation; they are coding systems that create the overall structure/appearance of the Web page by the use of tags. Tags are commands that allow the Web page designer to arrange text and multimedia. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the dominant markup language used today. The current version is HTML5, and it is intended to replace both HTML and XHTML, another markup language. 

'''Scripting languages''' allow the developer to create instructions, or scripts, that run in the code of the Web page. One example of a very popular scripting language used today is Javascript. Scripting languages are found everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the scripting language Ajax is found in the widely-used services Google Maps and Gmail. When used in combination with markup languages, scripting languages can enable developers to implement a wide-range of features and content into their Web pages.

'''Web site authoring software''' is used to make more complex Web pages where developers can take advantage of commands that automatically generate tags and Cascading Style Sheets, which are used in the look and formatting of what was written by the markup language. This enables the developer to work in a more productive manner because animations, effects, backgrounds, etc. can be applied all at one time. Also, many of these programs feature development tools that test for browser compatibility of the Web page as well as broken links, which ensures the quality of the Web page.

===Testing, Publishing, and Maintaining the Site===
[[File:Website Design.png|thumb|Publishing a Website]] 
It is extremely important, before your webpage goes out, to make sure that it is up and running and functioning at one hundred percent capability. This means that there cannot be any bugs, glitches, or error pages displayed when a user is utilizing your web page. Though this may seem easy enough, there are many different steps that one should go through to make sure their page is up to speed. Every link, icon, animation, picture, and etc., needs to be tested. Many websites like to utilize the software that is out there that will manually do these needed checks for you, however it is still important to keep an eye out personally for anything that could be raising red flags. At this point, after vigorous testing, the site should be set and ready to be published.
All though the page has been successfully published, the work does not stop there. Many people like to think that they are set for the future, but these pages require constant maintenance. The publisher needs to be constantly checking to make sure everything is still running smoothly, things are still up to date, and links and animation are still functioning. With out this much needed maintenance, a site becomes difficult and outdated, and users will go out of their way to make sure that they do not use it.  &lt;ref&gt;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher-help/prepare-publish-and-maintain-your-publisher-web-site-HA010094760.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advantages of E-Commerce'''

[[File:E-commerce.jpg|thumbnail|E-Commerce Electronic Shopping Cart]]For businesses, the most prominent advantages to using E-Commerce are the reduced costs associated with it, the broader customer base, the increased customer satisfaction, and the potentially higher sales it produces. Because E-Commerce transactions are done through a website and not a brick and mortar store, much of the overhead associated with running a retail store is reduced. The need to pay for heating, lighting, staffing, and restocking a store is practically eliminated. This results in fewer employees and smaller facilities which in turn allows for larger capital gains. Usually, only a company headquarters is needed along with a few warehouses that can cover larger areas than a single retail store normally would. Also, more individuals can be reached through a website rather than the small geographical area that a retail store would cover. Multiple retailers are required to cover larger geographical areas, but with E-Commerce anyone anywhere can access the website at anytime! This increases the possible amount of customers dramatically. Websites also allow people to shop from the comfort of their own home without having to consume time and money (gas) to view a companies products in their retail store. Plenty of times have people gone to the store for a specific item only to be disappointed that it wasn't in stock. With E-Commerce this doesn't happen. The comfort provided, the time saved, and the money saved can easily increase the satisfaction of the consumer. The potentially higher sales is another advantage. By using E-Commerce, a business can be open every hour of the year and accessible to everyone across the globe. They're no longer limited by a geographical area or a 40 hr work week.&lt;ref&gt;http://forbstudents.blogspot.com/2009/05/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For Consumers, the greatest advantages lie in it's convenience, selection, customization, price comparison, and potential cost savings. As mentioned above, the convenience of shopping from home (in your underwear if you like) is very appealing to many consumers. Shopping can be done during anytime of the day or night through the use of a website and it's no longer a necessity to rush home from work to buy an item before its store closes. A person can also compare the prices, quality, and features of multiple items from multiple stores. Their selection is no longer limited to the facilities closest to them, but to their attention span. Before, consumers would drive from store to store comparing these characteristics before driving back to make their final purchase. The time, effort, and expense involved in this type of comparison is nullified through E-Commerce. Many individuals want to make their purchases unique to their preferences. With the option to communicate with a company directly through their site instead of buying a pre-manufactured item on a store shelf, the ability to customize the item they are looking for is greatly improved. The company can take the order and payment while putting it through to the warehouse so that the final product to be shipped is tweaked to the consumer's desire. Also, the ability to save on cost is increased for the consumer using E-Commerce. The person can compare prices to find the lowest and often the item can be shipped to their front door for less than it would normally have taken to find it in a motor vehicle. They say time is money, so if your spending less time looking for what you need then you can potentially spend more time working for what you want.&lt;ref&gt;http://tokokoo.com/2010/07/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-e-commerce/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disadvantages of E-Commerce'''

[[File:Wikimedia Servers-0051 19.jpg|thumb|Wikimedia Servers-0051 19]]

As mentioned above, there are a lot of advantages, but it is not perfect. One of these disadvantages is that those who are running the site must keep the site open 24/7 since at any point it is morning somewhere in the world. This takes money to run the servers, and takes money to pay the programmers to make the site in the first place. Also a business that is running a site should make it interesting by having something change, like having a daily deal like Newegg&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newegg.com&lt;/ref&gt; or return coupons like Kohls&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kohls.com&lt;/ref&gt;, otherwise people may not return to the site. Another disadvantage is that anyone can make a website, driving competition and prices. So some sites may spend extra money on multimedia for some extra allure.

As a customer shopping online I always fear someone may be stealing my credit card number and even my identity. But with safe practices online you can avoid this fairly well, yet the risk still looms around. Also if you are buying clothes online, you can't physically touch nor have the ability to try to see if they would fit in the first place. Sure you can ship it back, but that could be expensive.

==E-Commerce Business Models==

===Four E-Commerce Business Models===

[[File:Online Shop.gif|thumb|Online Shop]]

There are four types of E-Commerce business models. The four types of E-Commerce business models are B2C which stands for Business-to-Consumer, B2B which stands for Business-to-Business model, C2C which stands for Consumer-to-Consumer, and B2G which stands for Business-to-Government. When working, selling, or buying with any of these models, it is important to be familiar with what each model contains. B2C represents most of E-Commerce websites. Businesses that sell to consumers are considered B2C. Online stores and shopping are all examples of B2C. B2B are businesses selling products to other businesses. B2B are usually larger companies that are supplying a service to other businesses. For example, office max is a business that sells office supplies to other businesses. Also, they are almost always doing business over the web. C2C is a website that consumers sell to other consumers. People are brought together to sell and buy products for this model. For example, EBay is a common place for consumers to sell and buy items. B2G consists of businesses working with the government. For example, the IRS is a way for businesses to pay their taxes through the web. These four E-Commerce business models are very common in this day-in-age. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecommerce-web-hosting-guide.com/ecommerce-business-models.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==E-Commerce Web Sites==
===Manufacturer and E-Tailer Sites===
[[File:Amazon logo.jpg|thumb|An example of a manufacturer site]]
Manufacturer and E-tailer sites are basically just companies that can sell their product directly to their customers via a website. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.thefreedictionary.com/e-tailer&lt;/ref&gt; They are just online stores. Most websites like this have an online catalog of their products for the consumer to look at and choose their desired product. Then if the product is shipped to the home there is a shipping fee, or some products like music or books can just be directly downloaded. This would include websites like amazon.com, charlotterusse.com, or walmart.com. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping &lt;/ref&gt;

===Subscription Sites===
[[File:Netflix logo.svg|thumb|An example of a subscription site]]
Subscription sites are an online product that a consumer purchases and pays periodically and then receives the product periodically via the Internet. An example would be Netflix, which is a monthly fee and then you can receive streaming of movies or TV shows through the Internet. Some sites are considered subscription sites even if they don’t require a monthly fee. They may just require you to subscribe to their site to receive all the information provided. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.thefreedictionary.com/subscription &lt;/ref&gt;

===Brokerage Sites===
[[File:EBay former logo.svg|thumb|Online Auction Site example]]
A Brokerage Site is used to bring sellers and buyers together to simplify transactions between the two.  The site earns revenue as a form of commission for every sale it incurs. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker &lt;/ref&gt;  Online auction sites are examples of brokerage sites, in that they enable consumers to buy and sell goods and services to one another.  The site acts as a median between the two.  One clear example of this is eBay. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay &lt;/ref&gt;  Business online auction sites are online auctions sites that are mostly for business transactions.  An automatic bidding system is used by eBay so that consumers can easily keep up with the bidding process if he or she wishes to make a bid on a specific item.  There are rules put in place so that every bidder is treated the same.  A dynamic pricing site can be used instead of online auction sites.  Priceline.com is an example of how this works: buyers are allowed to bid on items for sale, and the seller can then make the final decision of who shall receive the item.  Financial brokerage sites are also used between buyers and sellers for stock, bonds, opinions, and more.  These sites earn money by charging for each transaction.  Real estate &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_broker &lt;/ref&gt; and travel are other types of brokerage sites.  A market exchange site matches organizations with different goods or services to sell with buyers and to help the buyers look for specific items that the suppliers can provide.  Commodity exchanges are sometimes used when dealing with natural resources and raw goods.  &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodities_exchange &lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementing E-Commerce==

===Business Models &amp; E-Commerce Applications===
[[File:Tesco Tech Support Advisor.png|thumb|Like this smiling tech support worker, you need to have be both innovative and eager to please if you hope to get your online business off the ground.]]
If you're a business owner living in today's technological age, your eye is surely on expansion through e-commerce. Whether you are the owner in question who is tech-savvy enough to build your own site, or a third-party Web page developer, there are 5 rough steps to keep in mind to ensure the success of your e-commerce endeavors. 

The first of these steps is to just figure out what your website hopes to accomplish. You can either pick one model (such as B2B, or Business to Business) or combine a few of them depending on your ambition and the needs of your business. Within this model, you also need to be making decisions such as whether your site will be taking a Storefront approach (basically being an online version of a physical store) a Subscription approach (where customers pay for premium content that is web-only), or even Affiliate Marketing (where your business would sell the products of another business for a commission).&lt;ref&gt;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/types-ecommerce-business-models-2447.html&lt;/ref&gt; As you browse the Web and study the models of your competitors you'll get a good idea about what is and isn't the goal of the e-commerce site you're creating.

The next important step is deciding on the applications of your e-commerce page. If you're a business owner creating a Web page, it's a given that one part of your site will be online selling, but there are ways you can establish the name of your company that go above and beyond so your customers will remember you in a positive light and keep coming back, hopefully with their friends and family in tow. These extra features are called e-commerce applications and they can range from merely providing in-depth product information to providing technical support, or even letting them track online purchases through the mail. For the adventurous and creative developers, you can program games, surveys, and even music, all for the sake of providing a more intriguing online shopping experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getelastic.com/7-wicked-ecommerce-applications-of-shopping-apis/&lt;/ref&gt;


==Effective E-Commerce Websites==

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce is something we are bombarded with on a daily basis. Any time that we go to the internet we are almost guaranteed to see an ad or access some kind of site that is selling something to consumers. Whether or not we choose to click and access these sites is another story. Although, when we do, there are a few things that these sites can take advantage of to try to ensure user purchases are made. Firstly, these sites are going to want to look appealing to the group they are advertising to (e.g. a website selling kids toys would want to be colorful and full of pictures not just plain black and white text with limited images). Next, it is important that the website be user friendly. This involves: easy navigation, pages loading in a timely manner, and having some special perks like a search box or a dropdown of links to all the main pages on the site. While these are not necessary things to create a website, they are useful things for websites to contain in order to satisfy visitors. Other helpful, but not necessary, things to include are contact information, special promotions, and even social media links so customers can share about their experience with the site&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/essential-things-ecommerce-site-should-have/&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the realm of E-commerce, there are two things that are very important: the shopping cart and security when processing transactions. Have you ever bought (or tried to buy) something from a site and had a hard time finding the shopping cart? Or have you had trouble editing the items in your shopping cart? These problems are big E-commerce no-no's and something most sites do try to avoid. However, they do still happen. The shopping cart is something that, ideally, would be accessible and easy to find from any page on a website, and once you are looking at the items in your cart, it should be simple to modify the items (add or delete products). Another thing that E-commerce sites should do is ensure that their checkout page is in fact secure. When purchases are made online, most people use their credit/debit cards to pay for their items. With the number of people in the world who know how to hack computer systems or decrypt code, it is important that websites ensure the security of such important personal information. Without this security there would be virtually no way to protect yourself from credit fraud or identity theft. While there are still ways for people to access the information, it is much harder to access it from a secured site. There are a few ways to check a sites security including the &quot;http://&quot; section of a URL being green in color, the URL beginning with &quot;https&quot; instead of just &quot;http&quot;, as well as the security certificates that most secure sites will post on their pages to advertise their security to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

==E-Commerce Sales and Marketing Strategies==

===Click Fraud===
[[File:Click.svg|thumb|Click Fraud]]
Click fraud is an illegal practice that occurs when individuals click on the Web site’s advertisements in order to increases the number of click through to the advertiser. The individuals who use click fraud use it in order to increase their own personal banner ad revenues and also by companies who use click fraud as a way to deplete a competitor's advertising budget. Click fraud was once known to be a very large problem within paid searches in which Google was first introduces with the invalid click to be known as a metric. A metric was intended to provide some insight into how much fraud was occurring and ease the minds of advertisers. Google identifies three areas they determine to be invalid clicks: Manual clicks intended to increase your advertising costs or to increase profits for website owners hosting your ads, Clicks by automated clicking tools, robots, or other deceptive software, Extraneous clicks that provide no value to the advertiser, such as the second click of a double-click. The difference between then and now and the source of the invalid clicks of today. Click fraud still occurs in paid search, and at some level always will. However, the engines at this point do a solid job at monitoring the problem. The issue for search marketers is to ensure the metrics don't go out of whack from a normal level of variance. Meanwhile the focus will be on emerging media types where fraud is ahead of the development curve.&lt;ref&gt;http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2261638/Click-Fraud-is-a-Small-Problem-in-Search-These-Days &lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedures for Handling Electronic Financial Transactions===
[[file:Online Shop.gif|thumb|Learn to do it safely]]
There are different ways an e-commerce site can set up payment options, and it is important to understand what type of payment option is best for the nature of the site. Credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, Bill Me Later, and gift cards are the most common payment options used by e-commerce sites. Payment by credit/debit card is the dominant method. Businesses usually open an e-commerce merchant account to allow for these payments. For payment with credit, a buyer makes a transaction with the credit card where money is then transferred from the credit credit card company to the merchant account. For debit cards, money is simply taken from the checking account and transferred to the merchant account. Businesses pay fees to the banks for this service. A relatively new system is for consumers to use low-cost card-swipe devices that enable merchants to get by the higher rates when the card is not physically present. Airline and travel sites are some businesses currently taking advantage of this method. 

Virtual account numbers, smart cards and prepaid credit cards are all used to better improve the security and safety of both the transaction process and the account information of the card holder. These cards can be secured with a PIN and/or a one-time password (OTP) to decrease the chances of a hacker obtaining account information. 

Online payment services, like PayPal, and the use of gift cards, coupons and digital gift certificates are two other popular payment options. PayPal allows individuals to transfer money from their online payment account to another, and it is the prefered payment method for transactions on Ebay.&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.ebay.com/help/pay/paypal.html&lt;/ref&gt; This type of service is prefered because it does not require consumers to reveal their credit card numbers to the merchants, and merchants pay lower fees than conventional credit and debit card purchases. Lastly, gift cards, coupons, and digital gift certificates allow gift recipients to select their own items at an online store. These can be purchased in physical or digital form where the codes are then entered in the checkout process. Also, coupons are becoming much more popular with the increasing use of mobile phones.

===Driving Business through Meta Tags===
[[File:Chuck Norris - Google Search.jpg|thumb|Drive your search engine business through meta tags!]]
Keeping and maintain your company’s website is very important in working towards driving business. Many of us, when we search the Internet, are not just going directly to one specific page. We want to browse and find what pages pull up for the topic in which we are searching for. That is why most of us use search engines such as Google, Yahoo, etc. The problem is, you need to make sure that your getting business and traffic from these searches. Most of the time, people don’t make it past the second page of results to find what they are looking for, so what does a company need to do to make its page relevant? They use meta tags. Basically, these meta tags are things which they know people would be searching to come across a website such a theirs. For example, for a hair salon’s website, they would meta tag things such as haircuts, hairstyles, and many more. This ensures that when someone is using a search engine to find something and they use your meta tag keywords, your business’s web page is going to pop up right with it. This is crucial to making sure that the page is getting the traffic that it needs to drive business. &lt;ref&gt;http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2067564/How-To-Use-HTML-Meta-Tags&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is an Information System?==

[[File:CS Venn Diagram.pdf|thumb|CS Venn Diagram]]
A system is a group of procedures and different elements that work together in order complete a task. Now we can add on to this to get information systems. Information systems&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems&lt;/ref&gt; are much the same, there are elements and procedures to work to complete a task. The difference is information systems are used to generate information for the users on a need bases. information systems manage and process data as soon as they are created, they can also be used for long term planning or just the day to day work. While systems are great and can ease your life, they are static, which means someone will need to change the systems when new needs arise. This is called system development&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life-cycle&lt;/ref&gt;. While it could be costly, there really is a need for system development since things change constantly. Whether there are new laws or a new policy within the company.

[[File:Four-Level-Pyramid-model.png|thumb|Management Pyramid]]Some information systems are meant to be used by all levels of employees while others are specifically designed to handle the needs of employees with certain responsibilities. As one goes higher up the company ladder, it can be seen how responsibilities may increase relative to position. It is for this reason that some information systems are designed to hone in on the needs of certain level employees. At the ground level, employees generally make job related decisions that are based on &quot;on-the-job&quot; input without having to consider how those decisions will effect other departments or employees in other positions. These usually involve transaction systems such as point-of-sales or warehouse systems that record stock and inventory. Operational managers such as supervisors or foremen use separate information systems designed to meet short term goals and gains. They might use systems that show the productivity of employees or the cost effectiveness of certain changes they've made in production. Middle managers are a step up from this and use information systems that house a broader range of information to make more tactical decisions. These decisions are usually aimed at a farther sighted goal than those of Operational managers and often need more intelligence pulled from data systems in order to reach these objectives. Middle managers might be more concerned with how to improve yearly gains and may use systems that will deliver more detailed information about specific locations of factories or retailers in certain states. Executive managers think in terms of the future and the direction of a company related to their peer corporations. They make very strategic decisions to ensure the survival of the entire company as a whole in relation to the economy and competition. The systems they use might include the stock market, which tracks the progress of multiple businesses. Because the needs of each position increases, the decision support systems needed to make well judged verdicts must increase as well. &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Information Systems==
===The Four Essential Information Systems===
[[File:Empresariobaixa.jpg|thumb|Which information system do you use the most?]]

There are many different types of information systems. Even though there are many systems, the four that will be elaborated are the following: transaction processing systems, customer relationship management systems, business intelligence systems, and knowledge management systems. Transaction processing systems are used for processing and outputting functions for the core operations of a business, storage, and data collection. The purpose of this system is to collect input and then produce the output. An online air ticket booking system is an example of a TPS. Customer relationship management systems are usually used by business owners for sales and marketing efforts. This system helps businesses keep record of customer activities, purchasing trends, product defects, and customer inquiries. CRM systems also allow business partners to communicate with each other which contributes to a successful business. Business intelligence systems are essential for businesses to predict sale patterns for their company. BIS are essential in collecting data from different companies. Financial Institutions are an example of this type of system; it is used to create credit risk models that study the number and amount of lending given to the sectors. Knowledge management systems organize the knowledge within an organization and then share it. KMS brings innovation, top quality performance, integration, and knowledge to an organization. Small and large enterprises can benefit from this type of system. Business owners view this system as a valuable attribute to their company because it provides quick responses to their customers and partner questions. &lt;ref&gt;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/types-information-systems-organization-43097.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==System Development==
===The Information Systems Department===
[[File:FBI analyst.jpg|thumb|An IT Analyst]]
The information systems department is also referred to as the information technology department. It is responsible for running, maintaining, and developing the computers and information systems in an organization. They also make sure for the programs to run smoothly. It includes all the computer and network personnel of that organization. The IT person that is most involved in system development is the system analyst. The system analyst manages the things related to designing and implementing modified systems. A person that is very important to system development is the business analyst. It is one of the biggest growing jobs because of the large increase in the use of technology. It is all about finding the most effective use of electronic communication. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-an-it-department.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outsourcing===
[[File:Globe.svg|thumb|Offshore Outsourcing]]
In the industry today, many businesses have been outsourcing their work.  Outsourcing occurs when businesses hire others outside of their company to perform different tasks, like creating new software or databases for the company. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing &lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples of outsourcing today include customer service, technical support, payroll accounting, and credit card processing.  This is becoming more prevalent through the years because outsourcing has many advantages to the business itself.  Offshore outsourcing is another term used, but the work is done in another country.  India, for example, is one country that generates much revenue from offshore outsourcing alone.  Although many speculate that American jobs are at risk, outsourcing to other countries benefits the business as a whole.  The company saves a lot more money, than if they were to keep technical support, customer service, etc. in the primary country of that company.  Another advantage of having offshore outsourcing is that there can always be someone working on a project, gathering information, and helping a client because of the different time zones.  A lengthy project can be completed faster than would a normal project worked on in just the United States because 24 hours a day, somebody is always working on the project.  Homesourcing is a new trend that many companies are taking advantage of, and adopting.  This is the transfer of service industry employment from offices to home-based employees with appropriate telephone and Internet facilities. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homesourcing &lt;/ref&gt;  One downfall of outsourcing is cultural differences.  Language barriers can be detrimental to a company at times.  Another aspect that companies have to look into is security with newly outsourced employees when they are first hiring.

== SDLC - System Development Life Cycle==
The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is composed of six steps. These steps are as follows: preliminary investigation, system analysis, system design, system acquisition, system implementation, and system maintenance. Each step is important and builds up on the step(s) that happened previously. While these are generally the steps always used, they do not always occur in the same order. The effects are still the same &lt;ref&gt;http://www.veracode.com/security/software-development-lifecycle&lt;/ref&gt;. Below is an explanation of each of the six steps.
===Step 1: Preliminary Investigation===
[[File:Magnifying glass2.jpg|thumb|Time to dig deeper and investigate!]]
As the first step in the SDLC, preliminary investigation plays a large role in determining whether or not a system or system modification would be worth making. The main point of doing a preliminary investigation is to determine what problems need to be fixed and what is the best way to go about solving those problems, if solutions do in fact exist. A feasibility report is the product of the preliminary investigation in most cases. The feasibility report is essentially a compatibility test between the current business/system and the new system/modifications. The report will tell companies if they can afford the change, if it will work with the other systems and technology already in their company, and if it will be beneficial to the company to make the changes. If all these things come back positively from the systems analyst, then the system will receive the &quot;all clear&quot; to head to the next step of the SDLC.
===Step 2: System Analysis===
This second step, system analysis, is used to investigate the problem on a larger scale and fine tune all the information a company has on the issue. Data collection and analysis are the two main points of interest inside system analysis. Gathering information about the current system and users allows analysts to develop an idea of what seems to be the real problem and how they should go about fixing it through data analysis. The main outcome from this step is a grouping of organized data about the current system and the new/modified systems improvements to come.  

=== Step 3: System Design ===
[[File:Blueprint for Everglades canals1921.jpg|thumb| When you're designing a system, you are essentially creating a blueprint with your collected data which you build upon in later steps.]]
After all of the data has been analyzed, it is time to design a blueprint for the system that specifies what it will look like and how it will work. First you have to develop the design by using a few key tools. One important tool is the creation of a ''data dictionary'', which describes the characteristics of all data that is used in a system. Other important creations that the systems analyst will use include different diagrams which help to better describe the proposed system. It has been argued by some that the ever-increasing rate of developing technology has made it impossible for the every day systems analyst to do their job thoroughly. The economics of industry are pushing in a way that doesn't favor design, only production.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/waldo/files/ps-2006-6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this is truly the case, system design leaves little room for error, as time is money.

=== Step 4: System Acquisition ===
[[File:Shopping list.jpg|thumb|System Acquisition is a way of going down your shopping list and comparing prices to get the best deals.]]
Once the design blueprint has been approved, it's off to the proverbial grocery store. The organization needing a system will have a set budget and a list of components needed to make their system work properly. With this budget comes a few courses of action. The first thing to think about is whether the company should create their own software for their system or buy the software from others. It is typically cheaper and less time consuming to buy preexisting software but the customization options are limited. If the preexisting software doesn't offer the options required of the system blueprint, then the company will likely have to make custom software to meet their needs.

Assuming that it okay for the company to buy preexisting software, the next step is to choose where to buy from. To help them choose, they can prepare an RFP, or request for proposal, which asks vendors what software the company might need to consider buying. If they already know what software they need and just want potential prices, the company can file an RFQ, or request for quotation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buyingexcellence.com/should-we-use-an-rfp-or-an-rfq/&lt;/ref&gt; After all of the required software has been purchased it is time for the next step.

=== Step 5: Implementation === 
 [[File:Update Manger.png|thumb|This update manager shows all of the updates needed for a computer software, part of the continuous system maintenance]]

In this step, users get the old data ready to be moved, called data migration. Once that is complete, they can begin installing new hardware and software. There are four ways of converting data to new a system: direct conversion- the old system is deactivated and the new one is implemented right away; parallel conversion- both systems are operated at the same time until it is known that the new one is working, then the old one gets deactivated; pilot conversion- only one new system is installed within an organization and once it is known that it works then the rest are implemented; and phased conversion- the new system is implemented by modules by using direct or parallel conversion.  There are some advantages and disadvantages of using each method.  For example, the easiest and fastest method is direct conversion. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://web1.arthurphil-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/~computin/Year12/SDD/02_AppSWAapproaches/assets/MethodsOfImplementation_AdvDisAdv.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; 
The final action in this step is training the users with manuals, for example. 

===Step 6:System Maintenance ===
Often the system maintenance is the ongoing process throughout the life of the system.  Maintenance can include updating software or updating what is already installed. Many of you play an active role in this step already. For example, how many of you keep up with the newest updates for your Apple applications? You are taking part in system maintenance.

== System Development Approaches==

===Traditional Approach===
[[File:Casediagram.GIF|thumb|Example]]
A traditional approach for the system development has five phases which have to be completed in chronological order. First phase is the preliminary investigation. In this process, the team of development investigates the need for possible software automation in the given system. At the end the team creates a document of specific recommendations for the candidate system. It includes the personnel assignments, costs, project schedule, target dates, identifies problems and constraint. The second phase is systems analysis which is the study of a problem, prior to taking some action. It refers to the study of the business area or application, usually leading to the specification of the new system. The third phase is systems design which is defined as those tasks that focus on the specification of a detailed computer-based solution. The analyst focuses on three basic elements: the output that must be provided by the system, the source data, or input that the user will provide to the system, the processing needed to produce the output, given the input. The fourth phase is system acquisition financial institutions should ensure that systems are developed, acquired, and maintained with appropriate security controls. This leads us to the last step which is system implementation, in this phase, the production system is installed, initial user training is completed, user documentation is delivered, and the post implementation review meeting is held. When this phase is completed, the application is in steady-state production. Installation the biggest aspect is that the entire system is planned and built and built before anyone gets to use it or test it, so every aspect to every phase is essential to the traditional approach for system development. &lt;ref&gt; http://vcampus.uom.ac.mu/cse1010e/chapter_8/c8_Sections3.htm &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://business-finance.blurtit.com/105917/what-is-the-traditional-development-approach&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iterative Approach===
[[file:Prototype_sample.png|thumb|An example of a prototype design pattern]]
Unlike the traditional approach, the iterative (repetitive) approach allows for system testing during development&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/may05/bittner-spence/&lt;/ref&gt;. The emphasis here is on incremental changes through a process known as  prototyping. Prototyping is the creation of software application prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping&lt;/ref&gt; Prototypes, generally speaking, are early models of some product that is created for testing purposes. With software prototyping, developers are able to receive crucial feedback from testers early in the beginning stages of development.  For this reason the iterative approach accounts for potential risks that developers face (e.g. accounting for user needs, verifying accuracy of initial project estimates). With that, the iterative approach acts as a response to the traditional development cycle, which is more likely to have “higher software costs and poor estimates of time and cost” due to the expense of changing a finished product. As the product moves closer to release, the cost of implementing changes increases exponentially&lt;ref&gt;http://www.silvercrestconsulting.com/gui/pdf/1237375021.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a difficult task because the whole system has to be modified to incorporate sudden changes, and this can have undesirable results. Prototyping resolves this by knowing what the user really wants, which leads to increased user involvement. Interaction between users and developers is vital because it ensures what tasks need to be accomplished on the end of the developer. Overall the iterative approach addresses some of the problems that might not be possible for the traditional approach to address. 

===The End-User Development Approach===
[[File:Kmail.png|thumb|Using End-user Development Programs for day-to-day activities]]
As opposed to the iterative or traditional approach, which both focus on professional users, the end-user development approach is focused solely on configuring the development of the system and is often done using tools or programs. Instead of having to be highly educated and a professional in the area of software or programming, someone trying to develop a simplistic and easy system can use these programming tools and develop something of their own. A good example of this is sending out an email that someone wanted to be addressed to many people. This is usually used in small businesses, tasks, or daily projects, and is not something that an intricate business would ever use to run their day-to-day software programs. However, it is a nice alternative from having to start all over from the beginning and developing brand new software for simple tasks. The end user development approach is also convenient for a user who wants to make something their own and customize the way the software runs to fit their personal needs. This approach is extremely useful for individuals who don’t have the knowledge, time, or money to put into building new software from the ground up. The software is easy to use, personal, and a great alternative to the other two options. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/end-user_development.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flowchart procedural programming.svg|thumb|Flowchart procedural programming]]
Procedural programming is more or less self explanatory, it’s procedural so it will go step by step in order to solve a problem. This was a much older type of programming language that has since been outdated by object oriented programming. [[File:Object-Oriented-Programming-Methods-And-Classes-with-Inheritance.png|thumb|Object-Oriented-Programming-Methods-And-Classes-with-Inheritance]]Object oriented programming is more focused on objects to make a program instead specific steps. One of the most popular object oriented programming languages is Java&lt;ref&gt;http://www.java.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt;, which is used virtually everywhere. Objects within an object oriented program consists of attributes. If you have ever played D&amp;D&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wizards.com/dnd/&lt;/ref&gt; you know that your character has different attributes that would define them. If you have an object you can change its attributes like size, shape, and color.

[[File:Pair Programming.jpg|thumbnail|Similar to this picture, AOP is complimentary to OOP when together]]Aspect Oriented Programming is a form of programming that compliments Object Oriented Programming (or OOP) by allowing the developer to modify OOP in a way where the system can grow to meet new requirements. It keeps the original model, which was developed in OOP, but allows for new syntax without having to change the compiler being used or reconfigure the editor either. In essence, it is complimentary to the previously developed OOP style and allows the application to adopt new characteristics over its lifetime without having to be completely remodeled or redeveloped. This ability for an application to be adapted to the current trend in technology prolongs the usefulness and life span of the application, which then benefit the users of that application as well. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/01/14/aop.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Development Life Cycle - Analysis, Design, Coding==
[[File:SoftwareDevelopmentLifeCycle.jpg|thumb|SoftwareDevelopmentLifeCycle]]
The following are six steps in the Program Development Life Cycle:

1. Analyze the problem. The computer user must figure out the problem,
and the best program to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;
2.Design the program. A flow chart is important to use during this
step of the PDLC. This is a visual diagram of the flow containing the
program. All in all, this step is breaking down the problem.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Code the program. This is using the language of programming to
write the lines of code. The code is called the listing or the source
code. The computer user will run an object code for this step.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Debug the program. The computer user must debug. This is the
process of finding the &quot;bugs&quot; on the computer. The bugs are important
to find because this is known as errors in a program.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Formalize the solution. One must run the program to make sure there
are no syntax and logic errors. Syntax are grammatical errors and
logic errors are incorrect results.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Document and maintain the program. This step is the final step of
gathering everything together. Internal documentation is involved in
this step because it explains the reasoning one might of made a change
in the program or how to write a program.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.teachbook.com.au/index.php/computer-science/software-development/program-development-lifecycle/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Development Life Cycle - Debugging and Testing, Implementation and Maintenance==
===Debugging===
[[File:Debug.jpg|thumb|Debugging]]
Debugging is basically making sure that a program does not have any bugs (errors) so that it can run properly without any problems. Debugging is a large part of what a programmer does. The first step to debugging is done before you can actually debug the program; the program needs to be changed into machine language so that the computer can read it. It is converted using a language translator. The first goal of debugging is to get rid of syntax errors and any errors that prevent the program from running. Errors that prevent the program from running are compiler errors. These need to be removed right away because otherwise you cannot test any of the other parts of the program. &lt;ref&gt;http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/debugging&lt;/ref&gt;  Syntax errors occur when the programmer has not followed the correct rules of the programming language. Another kind of error is a runtime error, which occurs while the program is running and it is not noticed until after all syntax errors are corrected. Many run time errors are because of logic errors, which are errors in the logic of the program. It could occur when a formula is written incorrectly or when a wrong variable name is used. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.techopedia.com/definition/16373/debugging&lt;/ref&gt;


===Testing/Implementation and Maintenance===
[[File:Typing computer screen reflection.jpg|thumb|Testing]]
Relating to getting a program up and running, many things need to happen before it can be used.  One step is to test the program.  After the debugging process occurs, another programmer needs to test the program for any additional errors that could be involved in the background of the program.  This person needs to perform all of the tasks that an actual user of the program would use and follow.  To ensure privacy rights, test data is used in the testing process.  However, this still has the same structure and feel to the actual data.  The tester needs to check for possible input errors as well, as this would create many problems and issues in the future had it not been checked.  Companies usually implement different types of tests.  An Alpha test &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/alpha+test &lt;/ref&gt; is first conducted, which is on-site at the company, and Beta tests are sent out to different states or countries to ensure the program is 100% ready for use.  The Alpha test occurs before the Beta test.  Once the debugging and testing are finished, the program is now in the system and the program implementation and maintenance phase are completed.  Program maintenance still needs to be kept up, in case of future errors.  This is the most costly to organizations because the programmers need to keep improving and fixing issues within the program.

==Program Development Tools==

===Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Tools===
[[File:Deadline ! (7320523564).jpg|thumb|Programmers are often overworked and need all the help they can get. This is where ALM tools come into play.]]
ALM tools are, surprise surprise, tools that manage an application throughout its entire life cycle. They are very helpful for programmers who are under increasing amounts of stress to develop new programs quickly. The helpfulness comes from wide range of features that the ALM tools can offer. One example is how many ALM programs come with built-in program design tools, along with the ability to generate the program code from the finished design to create the application. This code generating ability saves companies time and money that they don't have to put towards outsourcing, especially if they've got a small number of programming staff. In addition to code generators, another important tool that can be included in ALM programs is ''requirements management''. Essentially, requirements management is defined in exactly that way, referring to keeping track of and managing program requirements as they are defined and then modified throughout the process of developing the program. The larger the company, the nicer ALM toolset they can purchase; there are many ALM toolsets on the market to choose from.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoq.com/research/alm-survey&lt;/ref&gt;
===Application Generators===
[[File:Gnome-preferences-desktop-keyboard-shortcuts.svg|thumb|Keyboard shortcuts (like those used to initiate the use of a macro)]]
Application generators are extremely useful devices. They can be used by amateurs/people with less experience or by professionals. The point of an application generator is to make a task simpler than it is. Even if it is just changing a few basic formatting characteristics, these generators can make it so that the user only has to type in a specific key or command in order for all the actions to happen at once with much less effort. One of these useful generators is called a Macro. A macro is an application generator that simply makes it possible to perform repeated actions instantaneously on a single command. The idea is that it will make reformatting or calculating things much easier, thus saving the operator time &lt;ref&gt;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/macros-demystified-what-they-are-and-why-to-use-them-HA010007210.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. Most Microsoft programs contain a macro recorder which allows users to easily record all inputs and commands they use and associate them with a keyboard shortcut for future repetition. Other application generators create reports and form which make things such as memberships, records (such as medical treatments, history, and vaccinations), and even insurance claims more organized and easier to access by those who should be able to access them.

Other types of tools include device software development tools, 
software development kits (SDKs), application program interfaces (APIs), and rich internet application tools (RIAs). A rich internet application offers many of the same features associated with desktop applications. They are more interacting and engaging that other web-based applciations. Some big names in this area are Microsoft, Adobe, and JavaScript. Microsoft actually has a very put together  developer’s website that goes into some detail about how to create such applications. It includes information such as things to consider before starting an RIA, such as the audience.
&lt;ref&gt; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee658083.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

A few key features about RIAs include direct interaction, partial-page updating, better feedback, consistency of look and feel, offline use, and performance impact. 
&lt;ref&gt; http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/335519/Rich_Internet_Applications?taxonomyId=16&amp;pageNumber=2 &lt;/ref&gt;
 
Direct interaction allows for a wider range of controls, such as editing or drag-and-drop tools. Partial-page updating allows for real-time streaming and cuts down on load time waiting for a response from a server. RIAs can provide users with quicker feedback because of the partial-page updates. Also, it is sometimes possible to use RIAs offline when there is no connectivity. Once downside to RIAs is that smaller devices, such as mobile phones, often times do not have the means necessary to run such applications.

==Programming Languages==


===What is a Programming Language?===
[[File:Programming-Icon string indexing.png|thumb|Program Language]]
A programming language is designed to communicate instructions to a computer and so the computer can interpret the instructions and make sense of them. They are used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and algorithms. There are multiple languages created into this program which are created from different styles or forms. The description of a programming language is known to be split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). The syntax is the form in which the language is presented in and the actual sense or meaning of the instructions is the semantics. A program is written so that it can be understood by computer so that the instructions can be interpreted, translated into so the computer can eventually make sense of it. So the moment you turn on your computer after it starts to run programs, it interprets these instructions, tests the ram and resets all attached devices and loads the operating system from hard disk. Every operation that the computer holds has instructions that someone had to translate into a programming language. With every language, they have to be created, compiled and tested which tends to be a long and complex task.&lt;ref&gt;http://cplus.about.com/od/introductiontoprogramming/p/programming.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categories of Programming Languages===
[[file:Visual Basic for Applications logo and wordmark.svg|thumb|Visual Basic is an example of a high-level programming language.]]
Two categories that programming languages can fall under are procedural (programs that use the procedural approach) and object (for those programs that use the object-oriented approach). However, probably the most common way of categorizing programming languages is by their designation into a tier structure. Programming languages can fall under low-level languages, high-level languages, and very high-level languages. Low-level languages, which are made up of the first generation language, machine language, and second generation language, assembly language, are written at a very low level: programming consists of 0s and 1s for machine language and assembly language includes names and symbols for some of the 0s and 1s. These languages allow computer hardware to read commands quickly, but this happens at the cost of a much steeper learning curve as opposed to higher level languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/machine_language.html&lt;/ref&gt; High-level languages, on the other hand, are easier to use because they are closer to natural language. They are also machine independent: programs written on one computer can be transferred to another computer without modification. This is in contrast to the machine dependent-nature of low-level programs where modification is necessary. Lastly, very high-level languages, also known as fourth-generation programming languages, are more difficult to distinguish from high-level languages. Fourth-generation languages (4GLs) are known to be declarative, which does not specify exactly how a computer should go about processing a command. This results in programmers using very little code. Although, those languages deemed very-high level languages in the past (e.g. Visual Basic, Python, Perl) have now been called simply high-level languages &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high-level_programming_language&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common Programming Languages===
[[File:Fortran_acs_cover.jpeg|thumb|Fortran is one example of a very common programming language.]]
There are many programming languages out there that are still, to this day, used immensely on a day-to-day basis.  Fortran, which is one of the older options, is used mainly in the scientific field for scientists, mathematicians, and formulating numerical formulas. Cobol is another programming language commonly used today, and can typically can be seen utilized in business environments for everyday transactions. This language is seen as extremely time consuming, and more and more businesses today are starting to move away from it, towards quicker processes. Pascal is yet another language that is used commonly in math and science programs. It was originally created as a teaching tool and uses control structures in its software. Another common programming language is Basic. It is one of the most used languages because it can be considered user friendly. It was designed to be an uncomplicated and stressful language that is used typically for interactive programs. It is extremely easy to get to know, and many people enjoy its simplistic and understandable functioning. One aspect of basic is Visual Basic, which again uses their understandable language, but is focused on visual aid. These are just a few examples of the immense and intricate amount of languages that are out there. Though many of these are still used today, it is obvious that some of the older and more time-consuming software is on its way out. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/chat/2880277/posts&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phone book.jpg|thumb|Phone book]]
A database is a collection of data that is saved and organized to allow easy retrieval when needed. In order to maintain and access the database you will need a DBMS (database management system). This kind of system manages and protects data so that the database is safe and secure. Databases consists of tables that consists of records and fields. Databases are not limited to only computers; in fact, a phone book is an example of a database.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit04/primer04_01.phtml&lt;/ref&gt; All of the names alphabetized and each column has its own category. There is a column for your name, phone number, and possibly a street address. With a relational database, all of the data within the row can be pulled up when you are looking for the specific attribute.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Super 80 computer Logic board (reverse).JPG|thumbnail|All that data has to be stored somewhere!]]There are a few advantages to using a database management system. On the plus side, it has the ability to control redundancy, the integrity of the information being stored can be maintained, it can restrict access, it can share data, and can backup/recover information. A database management system can counteract redundancy by compiling the information in one spot. The same way that you can't have two audio files with the same name and extension in a single folder, you can't have the same file in a single database. This controls and can increase storage space. The integrity of the information being stored can also be increased based on the specifications of the database developer. This means that the constraints on the information put into the database (which is determined by the developer) will keep the data stored accurate. So if a database is only able to store pictures, for example, then a music file will be rejected ensuring that a picture will always be retrieved from the database with 100% accuracy. This is a very simple example to get the idea across as the constraints imposed by the developer can determine different things. Databases can also share data as well allowing a developer to build multiple applications off of one source of information rather than having to create new stored files. Databases can also backup and recover data. If a computer system fails during a long, complex update then the database can restore the files to the place in the update when it is becomes operational again.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/what-is-a-database/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-dbms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data Characteristics==
[[File:3 states of data.jpg|thumb|3 states of data]]
Data is a collection of facts. It can be values, measurements, numbers, words, measurements, and observations. Many businesses would not be as successful without data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/data.html&lt;/ref&gt; A data has a hierarchy; this hierarchy is a systematic organization of data. Fields, records, and files are apart of the data organization. Product names or quantities are the lowest level of the hierarchy, and the database is the highest level of the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee633737.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the data definition consists of the following: name, data type, description, and properties. This describes the properties that go into a database. If a computer user wants to look up all of the data definitions for a database, he or she would look up the data dictionary. A few key terms a computer user should be aware of, concerning data characteristics, consist of data field, record, file, and database. A data field contains a single fact of an entity. A record is a collection of related fields. A file is an organization of related business records. The database is the place where files are integrated. &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database&lt;/ref&gt;The data characteristic key terms are essential to be aware of for businesses who use a database.

==Classification of Databases==
===Single-User vs. Multiuser Database Systems===
[[File:Server-database.svg|thumb|Database Server]]
Single-user database systems are located on one computer and they are designed for one user. They are used for personal use and small businesses. Only one person can use the database at a time, so if one user is using the database the other users must wait until that user is done. The other kind is used for bigger businesses. It is a database that is accessed through a network. It is so more than one person can access and change the data in a system. Most use some kind of lock on the database so that there are no conflicts between people making changes. They can be on one computer or multiple computers. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/raminder90/single-user-vs-multi-user-databases&lt;/ref&gt;
===Client-Server and N-Tier Database Systems=== 
Most multiuser database systems are client-server database systems. Basically client-server database systems are servers that have resources for other computers. It is when the client part makes a service request from the server, which completes the request. The client is referred to as the front end and the database server is referred to as the back end.&lt;ref&gt; http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/client-server&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the client-server database systems have more than just the front end and the back end but also a middle part called a tier. These are referred to as n-tier database systems. In these databases the client and the database never communicate directly, all data is passed through the middle layer. The advantages of this database system is that the middle tier provides a layer of abstraction, that way you can change parts of the back end without having to modify parts of the front end. It is also a good way to separate responsibilities; they can also be more efficient. &lt;ref&gt; http://databases.about.com/od/specificproducts/a/architectures.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
===Centralized vs. Distributed Database Systems and Disk-Based vs. In-Memory Database Systems===
[[File:Database-excel.png|thumb|Database Systems]]
Centralized database systems are all located on one computer.  This can either be a server or mainframe computer. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralized_database &lt;/ref&gt; Distributed database systems share a network and the data is divided between several computers connected to that network.  &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database &lt;/ref&gt;  An advantage of a centralized database system is that all information is in one place.  The disadvantage may be that a bottleneck might occur.  Having all information on one computer can make it easier to some users, but difficult for others who want to access the files.  One advantage of distributed database systems is that the database can be accessed using any computer on the network even if all the information is not on one computer.  This is the preferred type of system to use for databases, because information can be easily found.  It also ensures that all data will not be lost, if using the distributed database system over the centralized system.  Because of the recent advances in technology, using the “cloud” is another way to store database information over the Internet for an easy way of storage.  This concept goes hand in hand with disk-based and in-memory database systems.  Most databases are stored on conventional hard drives in computers today, but recently many are switching to in-memory databases. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_database &lt;/ref&gt;  This can hold all data on the main memory of the computer.  This creates faster performances than it would if using the disk-based system.

==Database Models==
===Relational Database Model===
 Relational database management systems are important because they take several related tables and combine them in the least complex way that is possible. Essentially the RDBMS takes these smaller, less compact, tables and finds ways to relate them to one another based on singular variables to avoid repetition as much as possible. When creating such a database there are four main questions to ask: what is the point of this database? what information needs to be included in this database? which variables should be placed in which table to make the end result the least tangled/complicated? and how should this table be formatted? Once all those things are completed, one could use a program such as Microsoft Office's Access&lt;ref&gt;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/create-a-query-based-on-multiple-tables-HA010096275.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; to create a query by choosing specific related fields to display and organize. After this, one could use the query to generate a report which is essentially used to import the selected information into a singular database that would be easier to read through and find information from. 
=== Hierarchical and Network Database Models===
[[File:Database models.jpg|thumb|Database models]]

The hierarchical model is the oldest database models. It organizes date in a tree-like structure, using parent and child data segments. For example, it begins at the top of the tree with a single root. That stems into a lower level segment, which connects to other subordinate segments after. This is used to model one-to-many relationships. A disadvantage of using this model is that it requires data to be stored repetitively in multiple levels. This causes the database to function very slowly because it can be searching for information in lower levels as well.  The network model uses a set structure. A set is comprised of an owner record type, a set name, and a member record type. This type of model shows many-to-many relationships. Parents can have multiple children, and children can have multiple parents. Both of these model types are outdated and no longer used for building new database applications. They are often less flexible than other model types.
&lt;ref&gt;http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/14071/14409392/Learning_Tracks/Ess10_CH05_LT3_Hierarchical_and_Network_Data_Models.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, all paths for accessing the data must be planned ahead of time and cannot easily be changed. Some places you might still see the hierarchical model might be in large systems that use high-volume transaction processing, like banks or insurance companies.

=== Object-Oriented Database Models ===
[[File:Abstract.JPG|thumb|OODBMSs, like this abstract statue, are more difficult to comprehend initially while ultimately promising greater rewards.]]
Whereas other database models can only store conventional data (such as dates, numbers, and text), the ''object-oriented database management system'' (OODBMS) is far more abstract. In an OODBMS, you can store pretty much any kind of data you desire, along with the methods to be used with that data. To retrieve this more complex and varied data, the user sends queries written in ''object query language''(OQL) which is an object-oriented version of SQL. OODBMSs are becoming increasingly prevalent because of the higher demands of computer users today. However, as is the case with any new technology, there is some resistance because of the downsides of OODBMSs. One downside is how editing an OODBMS based application is more time consuming because changes have to be made to the other classes in the application that interact with instances of the parent class, versus an RDBMS system where edits can typically be independent of the parent application.&lt;ref&gt;http://slashdot.org/story/01/05/03/1434242/why-arent-you-using-an-oodms&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the extra difficulties, many important clients continue to operate using a OODBMS, one big example being Chicago Stock Exchange, which uses the system to manage stock trades.

==Databases on the Web==

===Web Databases in Use===
[[file:Amazon-icon.png|thumb|Amazon is just one of many companies that utilize Web databases for their business needs]]
There are many ways Web databases can be used. The most obvious way is the retrieval of information. Web databases provide a means for users to access the massive amount of information the Web has to offer, and this is made possible, in one way, by the use of search sites where databases provide links for the user. Other personal uses for databases include the storage of email addresses, telephone numbers, and other information for one who might create a site for friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.htmlgoodies.com/primers/database/article.php/3478121/To-Use-or-Not-to-Use-a-Database-That-is-the-Question.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On the business end, Web databases allow businesses to create “website polls, feedback forms, and client/customer inventory lists.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ehow.com/info_8219542_database.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is a vital function that both large and small businesses can take advantage of to suite their needs. One, specific example relating to business-use of Web databases is the management of e-commerce-related activities. Here databases are used to provide information like pictures and pricing for products as well as order information and other necessary functions to enable efficient and reliable business transactions. Another feature of Web databases is their ability to display dynamic Web pages. These pages display information that changes depending on the input of the user, like a B2C site showing pages related to the interests of the consumer based on his or her past acivities. From personal to business applications, Web databases are a vital part of addressing the tasks associated with Web-related activity.

===Middleware===
[[File:AC1-Database layout.jpg|thumb|Database Layout]]
This is a computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. It is software that connects two otherwise separate applications, which can resemble &quot;software glue.” For example, there are a number of middleware products that link a database system to a Web server. This provides the user to be able to receive data from the data base by using forms that are displayed on a Web browser, and it enables the Web server to return dynamic Web pages based on the user's requests and profile. As stated previously, the term middleware is used to describe separate products that serve as the glue between two applications. It is, therefore, distinct from import and export features that may be built into one of the applications. It is sometimes called plumbing because it connects two sides of an application and passes data between them. Distributed computing system middleware can loosely be divided into two categories. These categories are those who provide human-time services and those that perform in machine-time. This latter middleware is somewhat standardized through the Service Availability Forum and is commonly used in complex, embedded systems within telecom, defense and aerospace industries.
&lt;ref&gt;  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/http/middleware/  &lt;/ref&gt;

===How Web Databases Work===
[[File:Php ligne de commandes script exemple hdparm.png|thumb|Example of PHP Script]]
In our technological world, we use web-based database requests on a daily basis. We are constantly visiting web pages, clicking on links and using the menu to navigate us through our activity on that page. Using middleware, the web server passes a request on to a database query and the information is stored and passed along to the database server. The database server then uses this information to direct the page to where it was intended to go. CGI Script is another way information is passed along. They use instructions via a programming language and accept and return the websites data to the user. Active server pages are yet another example of scripts used commonly on websites. They are very similar to CGI Scripts, yet they are exclusive because they almost always use VBS script or Java script. PHP Hypertext processor is a language that is becoming more and more popular everyday.  This script is extremely similar to CGI scripts and active server pages yet are more highly compatible with other programs. The script functions using PHP tags and html codes to get their job done. These scripts are just some examples of what is used today and how information in transmitted on a web server. &lt;ref&gt;http://guide.netfronts.com/Database-PHP-ASP/adding_dynamic_web_content.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intellectual Property Rights==

[[File:Copyright.svg|thumb|Copyright]]
'''Copyrights''' are there to protect individuals' work, such as literature, art and music. Enacted in 1976, Copyrights give the original creator rights over what they created. Even if you die, you still retain rights 70 years after your death. So let's say you buy a CD from Zomboy&lt;ref&gt;http://zomboyofficial.com&lt;/ref&gt;, that does not give you the right to do whatever you want with his music. Even though it is now your property, the artist still holds rights over the songs. Often times with trying to prevent piracy, many things will have digital watermarks &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking &lt;/ref&gt; , a slight change to content that most cannot see but identifies copyright holder.

[[File:Trademark Warning Symbol.svg|thumb|Trademark Symbols]]
'''Trademarks''' are words, phrases, symbols, designs, or a combination of these that are used as an identifier in order to help consumers identify and distinguish one product/service from another one which might be similar. This is also referred to as they're &quot;logo&quot;. Trademarks are usually registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPO)and use the letter R enveloped in a circle next to the logo to signify this. Trademarks which are claimed but unregistered are allowed to use the print &lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; alongside they're logo to represent that a claim has been made so as to deter others from using it. The purpose of a trademark is to protect the logo from being used by competitors who may want to &quot;knock off&quot; a more reputable company, though trademarks also protect domain names as well. Many companies want to set up a website using a domain name which matches their product so a consumer can instinctively find they're web address, and a trademark will often safeguard against another company using it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/trademarks/en/trademarks.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patents''' are similar to Copyrights and Trademarks but protect a person's invention rather than they're literary accomplishments or company logos. Patents are usually granted for a 20 year period and legally authorize the sole rights of an individual to manufacture or produce that which s/he invented. Often it is a unique product but it can also be a unique process such as the Born-Haber Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born–Haber_cycle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
[[File:Computer-blue.svg|thumb|do YOU have computer ethics?]]
The general definition of the word &quot;ethics&quot; defines the elements important to humans' morals. Ethics could be referred to as specific values, standards, rules, and agreements. For example, not being involved in software piracy is a matter of ethics. Computer ethics is a set of morals that regulate the use of computers. It is important for computer users to be aware of the ethical use of copyrighted material, the ethical use of resources and information, and ethical use of school, company, and employee information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethicalsociety.org/article/19/about-wes/ethical-culture-our-religious-heritage/faqs-about-ethical-culture/what-does-ethics-mean&lt;/ref&gt; Common issues of computer ethics are the following: privacy concerns, how computer affects society, and intellectual property rights. It is a very common and easy practice to burn a CD or movie for a friend. However, another option would be to tell the friend to buy the CD or movie as an ethical alternative. The privacy of another person is also an ethical issue of today. People's information is easily accessible through the computer; the ethical solution would be to not access another person's private information unless given permission. Ethics certainly guide our behavior, and it is the source of the acts we will and will not part take in.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techterms.com/definition/computerethics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers and Your Health==
===Physical Health===
[[File:Hard at work in the Tampabay Social Media Center. I was able to finally meet some tweeps!.jpg|thumb]]
There are some physical problems that can be caused by computer use such as eyestrain, blurred vision, fatigue, headaches, backaches, and wrist and finger pain. One kind of health problem that occurs is repetitive stress injuries, which is when doing the same thing over and over causes hand, wrist, shoulder, or neck pain. Using the keyboard and the mouse can cause repetitive stress injuries. One repetitive stress injury that is related to repetitive finger movement is carpal tunnel syndrome, which is a painful condition of the hands and wrists. &lt;ref&gt; http://sitemaker.umich.edu/state436/files/Physical_Issues.htm &lt;/ref&gt; Another repetitive stress injury is related with typing on the smaller keyboards of mobile devices and this is called DeQuervain’s tendonitis. There can also be many eye problems caused by looking at a computer screen for too long. Another concern is hearing loss because many portable media devices can be turned up too loud and cause hearing problems. There is also a concern with radiation that can be emitted from wireless devices. There are ways to avoid these physical health problems caused by computers. One way is to make sure that you are comfortable while at the computer and that you use a good chair that will be supportive for your back and neck. It is also important to just be aware of these possible physical health risks caused by computers because it is something that is often overlooked.  &lt;ref&gt; http://www.safety.uwa.edu.au/health-wellbeing/physical/ergonomics/workstation#chairs &lt;/ref&gt;
===Emotional Health===
[[File:Chronic fatigue syndrome.JPG|thumb|Burnout]]
Because of our fast growth and use of technology there are many positive advantages of using computers and much more; however, in recent years emotional health has become an important factor with the use of computers and technology.  The use of computers in general can cause much stress and anxiety for workers in different fields today.  When computers were first introduced to the working field, secretaries had to learn how to change from a typewriter to a keyboard.  Many people now widely understand the use of computers, but the downfall is keeping up with the changing technology. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technostress &lt;/ref&gt;  Every few years a new system, computer design, etc. are updated and sent out to the market.  This makes operating a company more difficult when programs and systems need to be updated.  Because the Internet can be accessed 24/7 the stress of being “on-call” is worrisome to many workers.  They worry they do not have enough down time to themselves, after they come home from work that day.  In the U.S. information is right at citizens’ fingertips, which can sometimes create an information overload.  There is always news to be caught up with, as well as catching up with email, text messages, and social media as well.  Many can become exhausted from being on the computer (or cell phone) too much.  This is called burnout which is long-term exhaustion and diminished interest in work. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_(psychology) &lt;/ref&gt; A more common type of “emotional health” deals with teenagers who have a technology addiction.  Social media plays a huge role in this now today. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder &lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology Access==

===The U.S. Digital Divide===
[[File:Santa fe.jpg|thumb|Helping each other understand and use the Internet builds strong bridges for humanity]]
Though the exact percentage is argued over by the experts, we can be happy to know that in the United States the digital divide continues to shrink. About 80% of the population of the United States uses the Internet. They use the Internet at school, work, home, and everywhere else. It's rare to find a Mcdonalds, one of the lowest common denominator eating establishments, that doesn't have a Wi-Fi connection. Computers and Internet access are always getting cheaper, which is great news because staying connected to the world is such an important quality. We stay alive and thrive through building relationships of all different kinds and the Internet is a powerful means of obtaining these relationships. Not only that, but most jobs today require the use of the Internet in one way or another. Due to the importance of the Internet however, ideally the statistic of users in the United States would be closer to 99%. According to Forbes, there are several reasons why some people have never used the Internet or don't use it very often. The biggest percentage of them said they don't want or need to go online, because they're either too busy or because they think the Internet is a waste of time. A slightly smaller number of them said it is difficult or frustrating to go online, either because they don't understand or are physically unable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2013/10/14/why-15-of-americans-dont-use-the-internet/&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the importance of the Internet is understood the world over, meaning that the digital divide in the U.S. will continue to shrink so our country can stay competitive with Europe and Asia especially.

===Global Digital Divide===
[[File:XO-Beta1-mikemcgregor-4.jpg|thumb|XO-Beta]]
The Global digital divide is an issue that our world seems to be facing more and more as time goes on. Like the US Digital divide, it is a comparison of groups of people with access to technology but on a global scale instead of a country scale. The problem arrises when one country's people has more access to technology and /or communications than another country. Most developed countries have a majority of their population with some access to technology, however it seems that many developing countries lack the technological accessibility that the others have. The largest problem caused by this is the lack of education. The internet today is such a source of information that one could potentially gain their entire college degree while hardly ever stepping foot in a classroom. Many people around the world lack the opportunity to gain an education because of their lack of access to the internet and other technology that would help them to learn things at a faster, easier, or more efficient rate. The internet has so many uses: school courses, communication, language tutoring, translations, calculations, and so many more. &lt;ref&gt;http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/STUDENTS/Lui/index3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assistive Technology===
[[File:Toby churchill after receiving doctorate1.jpg|thumb|Toby Churchill shown with assistive technology]]
The Americans with Disabilities Act requires companies with more than 15 employees to make reasonable accommodations for anyone that has known limitations. Nowadays, there is hardware and software specifically designed to aid individuals with physical disabilities. The most common technology that has been introduced is used to help those who are visually impaired or hard of hearing. There are various input devices available today to assist users communicate, usually on the computer. Braille or large-print keyboards, one-handed keyboards, switches, eye tracking systems, pointing devices, and voice input devices are all used today. In addition to the various input devices, there are output systems as well. The most common one is a screen reader that can read text information for the blind. There are also printers that can print in Braille instead of the conventional ink. Assistive technology is not always the best option, however. Often times it can be too expensive for the individual and not match their exact needs. 
&lt;ref&gt; http://www.pluk.org/Pubs/PLUK_ATguide_269K.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; Devices should be researched and tried out before purchasing. Training for these devices also needs to be taken into consideration. For example, what if this technology stops working for the user?

==Environmental Issues==

===Green Computing=== 
[[File:Green_50x75.png ‎|thumb|The color Green...]]
This refers to the use of computers in an environmentally friendly manner, but computing is not currently as environmental friendly. According to the guide to greener electronics only 2 out of 18 of the Pc are considered on the green rating. The reason is because companies are subjected to make energy and hence cost saving in the face of rising electricity prices. One of the activates that could help environmental savings is existing hardware which can be in place of it there are software’s called LittleGreenGenie. This software permit certain individuals to measure reduce and carbon offset from computer use. Its stats that it takes about 1.8 tons of chemicals, fossil fuels and water to produce a typical desktop computer and there’s about one billion PCs sold. Although putting a computer on standby or sleep mode will save a lot of power, people are unaware that shutting down a computer doesn't completely turn it off because the computer power supply will remain physically switched on. This leads the motherboard still partially on waiting for a signal to boot up again. The following are certain tasks that can be beneficial in reducing energy consumption which are lower power hard drive, visualization, cloud computing, energy effecting coding, improved repair, re-use recycling and disposable and less pollutant manufacture. &lt;ref&gt;  http://www.explainingcomputers.com/green.html  &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics-15th-edition/ &lt;/ref&gt;

===Recycling of Computers and Other Electronics===
[[file:recycle mini.png|thumb|Find a recycling center that accepts electronics]]
Given the reliance of the commercial world on computer technology it is easy to overlook the inherent unsustainability of computer production. Computers have become embedded in contemporary culture and play a crucial role in the global economy, but as the industrialized world continues to degrade the environment one must become aware of the negative impacts of computer use and consequently work with possible ways to reduce them. The Chicago Recycling Coalition states that, on average, 240 kg of fossil fuels are consumed in the process of producing a desktop PC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagorecycling.org/computers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In a time when fossil fuel supplies are decreasing at an alarming rate it is important now more than ever to be conscious of consumer decisions. The issue of fossil fuels aside, computers contain arsenic and mercury while computer monitors can contain several pounds of lead. This is one reason why simply disposing computers into landfills is problematic. Instead, the Chicago Recycling Coalition advises consumers to donate computers to various organizations and charities, give older computers to family and friends who need them, and find locations that offer recycling services. The EPA provides a utility that helps consumers and manufacturers know where they can donate or recycle their electronics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/ecycling/donate.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile devices, PCs and TVs make up the “Electronic Devices” category, and after selecting a device one can choose a company to see what services are offered. 


===Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005===
[[File:TVFree-copyright.PNG |thumb|Movie Copyright Laws]]
There’s no question that copyright laws are pushed to the side when it comes to copying illegal things such as movies, music, and videos. People act as if there is nothing to risk, and it does not matter if you break the law. However, the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, which was passed in 2005, made these offenses just a little bit more serious. The law worked to make three offenses more defined and punishable than they were before. First, it made sure that no one was allowed to bring a camcorder into a movie and record it. This works to stop people from selling movies that they do not have legal copyrights to. Second, it worked to make sure that there was no illegal prerelease of movies that had not yet been released to the public. The act actually states that this offense is punishable by a large fine or even time in jail. Finally, it allowed certain technology to be installed into DVD players that permits the user to automatically skip or mute entire portions of a DVD, allowing them to get passed crude, violent, or inappropriate parts that they would not have wanted to watch. Basically, the law just worked to reinforce previous copyright laws that seemed to be pushed aside without users giving them any consideration. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2005/04/family-entertainment-and-copyright-act-passes&lt;/ref&gt;

''''''Crystalline Basement''''''

Crystalline schists is a general term used by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinout_Willem_van_Bemmelen R. W. van Bemmelen] (1949) which include other lithologies such as gneiss, phylite, slate and marble (Sartono, 1979). This unit is widely distributed in the Indonesian Archipelago, but there is much diversity of opinion as to their age. The crystalline schists certainly do not belong to a distinct geological epoch, neither are they of an archaic age as has been supposed by many earlier authors. Sedimentary deposits of various ages can be altered into crystalline schists by regional metamorphism, aided by contingent processes of diffusion of constituents. Often a succession of alterations can be distinguished under the microscope, giving them a polymetamorphic appearance and enabling us to distinguish between several types of schists (viz. crystalline schists and phyllites) (edited from van Bemmelen, 1970). 

In some areas the transition of fossil-bearing strata made possible a direct age determination, while in other areas only the upper limit is fixed by the age of the first transgressive formation. There are also indications of different metamorphic processes / polymetamorphism.  

Hereunder some instances are mentioned:
* ''Sumatra''
The crystalline schists in South Sumatra (Geological Maps of South Sumatra Nos. I, 2, 4 and 5, scale I : 200,000) and North Sumatra (VAN BEMMELEN, 1932 d) are presumably parts of an old basement complex of pre-mesozoic age. Mesozoic sediments of Sumatra in many localities show a phyllitic facies. In the Islands West of Sumatra exposures of schistose pre-tertiary rocks are known. TERPSTRA (1932) mentions phyllites and amphibolites.from Sipura, and at the West coast of Nias crystalline schists crop out at the base of the Paleogene near Sumasuma. 

* ''Borneo''
The schistose and phylitic formations of the smaller islands on the Sunda Shelf are generally of young paleozoic and upper triassic age (VAN BEMMELEN, 1940 d). Crystalline schists of West and Central Borneo are known as Schwaner Block, named after [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Schwaner Carl Schwaner]. This block is older than Upper Triassic (ZEYLMANS VAN EMMICHOVEN, 1939, p. 21) and partly also older than the Permo-Carboniferous (ZEYLMANS v. E., 1939, pp. 56-58); but also younger formations may have a schistose facies, e.g. the Eocene has obtained in some belts a phyllitic character (TER BRUGGEN, 1935). ZEYLMANS VAN EMMICHOVEN published in 1940 a study, in which he described the schists and gneisses of the Schwaner Mts in Central Borneo, which are considered to be older than the Permo-Carboniferous. The crystalline schists of the Meratus Mountains in SE- Borneo are older than the Alino Formation (? Jurassic acc. to KOOLHOVEN, 1935) which contains detrital matter 
of the schists. 

* ''Sulawesi''
The polymetamorphic crystalline schists of Sulawesi are older than the Mesozoic or Young Paleozoic (BROUWER, 1941, p. 257-258), but there are also phyllites of mesozoic and eocene age (Tinombo Formation, ? Pompangeo Formation, Maroro Formation). 
In VAN BEMMELEN, 1949, contributions to the petrology of the crystalline schists of central Sulawesi were made by WILLEMS (1937), EGELER (1946, 1948) and DE ROEVER (1947).
In Southeast Celebes and Buton BOTHE (1927) distinguishes a metamorphic (phyllitic) facies of the Mesozoic (Kendari facies) from a less or non-metamorphic facies (Buton facies).
In the Northern Moluccas, isolated outcrops of crystalline schists are found on Obi (BROUWER, 1924a, p. 47) and on Bacan (Sibella Mts), which might be metamorphic paleozoic rocks, while in the Sula Islands (BROUWER, 1921 b, 1926) their age could be fixed as pre-Liassic.

* ''Banda Arc'' 
In the outer arc of the Southern Moluccas, crystalline schists are widely exposed. In Seram distinction can be made between phyllites which are pre-upper triassic (presumably Young Paleozoic) and older polymetamorphic crystalline schists (VALK, 1945 and, GERMERAAD, 1946). 
In Leti, transition from epimetamorphic schists to phyllitic rocks with intercalations of permian crinoidal limestones are found (MOLENGRAAFF, 1915). 
In Timor, crystalline schists occur in an overthrust complex of rocks, associated with ophiolites. These schists are at least pre-young Mesozoic, and partly pre-Permian (BROUWER, 1942 b, p. 364). 

* ''Java''
In Java, crystalline schists have been found in the Loh Ulo region where they are partly cretaceous and partly older (HARLOFF, 1929, 1933), and in the Ciletuh area, where their age is uncertain (at least pre-Eocene).

* ''Papua''
In New Guinea and the islands off its North coast, crystalline schists and phyllites are found in the pre-tertiary basement complex, but there is little information on their composition and age (The oldest fossil-bearing strata of the Central Mountains are Silurian). 

* ''Philippines''
In the Philippines, no old crystalline schists are definitively known, the oldest formation being, presumably, young Mesozoic (Baruyen cherts and shales).

The oldest pre-young paleozoic and presumably more or less autochthonous outcrops of crystalline schists are found in the central Sunda Land (West and Central Borneo and Lampung Districts of South Sumatra). The crystalline schists in the circum-Sunda Mountain System forms parts of over-thrust complexes and are partly pre-young Paleozoic, partly Young Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and even Eocene. 
The petrography and facies of these various schists formations will be discussed in the chapter on the regional geology.</text>

=== Description ===

Hofstede's five cultural factors are reconceptualized as ten personal cultural orientations: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Independence|independence]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Interdependence|interdependence]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Power|power]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Social inequality|social inequality]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Masculinity|masculinity]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Gender equality|gender equality]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Risk aversion|risk aversion]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Ambiguity intolerance|ambiguity intolerance]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Tradition|tradition]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Prudence|prudence]]. A new 40-item scale is developed to measure these personal cultural orientations. Much effort has been invested in ensuring validity, reliability, and cross-cultural measurement equivalence of the new scale.

=== Definition ===

Tradition is defined as a personal cultural orientation representing respect for traditional values including hard work, non-materialism, benevolence, social consciousness, morality, and respect for one’s heritage.

=== Items ===

*I am proud of my culture. (0.82)
*Respect for tradition is important for me. (0.75)
*I value a strong link to my past. (0.74)
*Traditional values are important for me. (0.70)

=== Description ===

Hofstede's five cultural factors are reconceptualized as ten personal cultural orientations: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Independence|independence]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Interdependence|interdependence]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Power|power]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Social inequality|social inequality]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Masculinity|masculinity]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Gender equality|gender equality]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Risk aversion|risk aversion]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Ambiguity intolerance|ambiguity intolerance]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Tradition|tradition]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Prudence|prudence]]. A new 40-item scale is developed to measure these personal cultural orientations. Much effort has been invested in ensuring validity, reliability, and cross-cultural measurement equivalence of the new scale.

=== Definition ===

Prudence is defined as a personal cultural orientation that represents planning, perseverance, thrift, and future orientation.

=== Items ===

*I believe in planning for the long term. (0.78)
*I work hard for success in the future. (0.76)
*I am willing to give up today’s fun for success in the future. (0.75)
*I do not give up easily even if I do not succeed on my first attempt. (0.72)

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
This template is for use when you wish to minimise information to be expanded at the user's discretion.

==Usage==
This usage:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{show
|Header!
|Content!
This information here will not show until you click the &quot;show&quot; button. It's then hidden by collapsing the section when you press &quot;hide&quot; button.}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Yields this output:
{{show
|Header!
|Content!
This information here will not show until you click the &quot;show&quot; button. It's then hidden by collapsing the section when you press &quot;hide&quot; button.}}

To use this in a table:
{{Template:Show/Table usage}}

The alignment of the header text and content text can be manipulated using the parameters {{para|headalign}} and {{para|textalign}}.  For example, the usage
&lt;pre&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=300px
|-
|
{{show
|Header!
|Content!
|headalign=center
|textalign=right}}
|-
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;
yields the output
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=300px
|-
|
{{show
|Header!
|Content!
|headalign=center
|textalign=right}}
|-
|}
Note that you should not put the alignment parameters in quotes (i.e., you should not use &lt;code&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, but just &lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt;, or the color of the header may change.  Also, while &lt;code&gt;headalign=right&lt;/code&gt; is possible, it causes the header to overlap with the [show] button.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''First project: camera deconstruction'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

I have been given a minolta sr-t 201 35mm camera with the objective of deconstructing it as far as possible without damaging any of its function.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Assesment'''&lt;/big&gt;

For starters, let's figure out what functions the camera currently has, before I start removing anything.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter extends the chapter on [[Canvas 2D Web Apps/Pages|pages]] by adding a semitransparent overlay to the three pages and moving the buttons from the pages to that overlay. 

An overlay in cui2d is just a page (i.e. a &lt;code&gt;cuiPage&lt;/code&gt;), which is used as an overlay in another page (i.e. its &lt;code&gt;processOverlay&lt;/code&gt; method is called in the process function of the other page). Apart from that, they are just ordinary pages with their own process function (which is called by &lt;code&gt;processOverlay&lt;/code&gt;); thus, an overlay page can in fact be used just like any other page.

===The Example===
The example of this chapter (which is available [http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/overlays/overlays.html online]; also as [http://martin-kraus.org/webapps/overlays/ioverlays.html downloadable version]) adds another (overlay) page and its process function to the example of the chapter about [[Canvas 2D Web Apps/Pages|pages]]. Two buttons are then called from the overlay page's process function. This chapter focuses on how to create an overlay page and how the other pages include the overlay page. See the chapters on [[Canvas 2D Web Apps/Pages|pages]] and [[Canvas 2D Web Apps/Responsive Buttons|responsive buttons]] for other parts.

===Creating Overlay Pages===
Pages that should be used as overlay pages are created like other pages. However, overlays are often not transformable. In this example, the overlay can only be dragged vertically with one finger. If both the page and its overlay are not transformable, then they should have the same dimensions and should use the same layout. If, however, the page is transformable but the overlay is not transformable, things get a bit more complicated. Often, the overlay will be adjusted to either the width or the height of the screen and it will be aligned with one of the corresponding edges. In the example, the width is adjusted and the top edge of the overlay is aligned:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      ...
      var overlayPage = new cuiPage(600, 90, overlayPageProcess);
      overlayPage.isAdjustingHeight = false; // only adjust width
      overlayPage.verticalAlignment = -1; // top align
      overlayPage.interactionBits = (cuiConstants.isDraggableWithOneFinger | cuiConstants.isLimitedToVerticalDragging);
      ...
&lt;/source&gt;

The process function of the overlay page includes two buttons (“previous” and “next”). Since the same overlay is used for all three pages, these buttons are also used for all three pages and, therefore, have to check the current value of &lt;code&gt;cuiCurrentPage&lt;/code&gt; in order to set it to the correct new value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      ...
      function overlayPageProcess(event) {
        cuiContext.fillStyle = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;; // draw in white

        if (button0.process(event, 20, 20, 120, 50, &quot;previous&quot;,
          imageNormalButton, imageFocusedButton, imagePressedButton)) {
          if (button0.isClicked()) {
            if (cuiCurrentPage == secondPage) {
              cuiIgnoreEventsEnd = (new Date()).getTime() + 50; 
                  // ignore events for 50 milliseconds
              cuiCurrentPage = firstPage;          
            }
            else if (cuiCurrentPage == thirdPage) {
              cuiIgnoreEventsEnd = (new Date()).getTime() + 50; 
              cuiCurrentPage = secondPage;   
            }
            cuiRepaint(); 
          }
          return true;
        }
        if (button1.process(event, 150, 20, 80, 50, &quot;next&quot;,
          imageNormalButton, imageFocusedButton, imagePressedButton)) {
          if (button1.isClicked()) {
            if (cuiCurrentPage == firstPage) {
              cuiIgnoreEventsEnd = (new Date()).getTime() + 50; 
                  // ignore events for 50 milliseconds
              cuiCurrentPage = secondPage;          
            }
            else if (cuiCurrentPage == secondPage) {
              cuiIgnoreEventsEnd = (new Date()).getTime() + 50; 
              cuiCurrentPage = thirdPage;   
            }
            cuiRepaint(); 
          }
          return true;
        }
        if (null == event) {
          // draw background
          cuiContext.globalAlpha = 0.3;
          cuiContext.fillRect(0, 0, this.width, this.height);
        }
        return false;  // event has not been processed
      }
      ...
&lt;/source&gt;


===Using Overlay Pages===
In order to use a page as an overlay to another page, its &lt;code&gt;processOverlay(event)&lt;/code&gt; methods should be called from the process function of that other page. In the example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      ...
      // first page

      var firstPage = new cuiPage(400, 300, firstPageProcess);

      function firstPageProcess(event) {
        if (overlayPage.processOverlay(event)) {
          return true;
        }
        if (null == event) {
          // draw background
          cuiContext.fillText(&quot;First page using landcape format.&quot;, 200, 150);
          cuiContext.fillStyle = &quot;#C0C0C0&quot;;
          cuiContext.fillRect(0, 0, this.width, this.height);
        }
        return false;  // event has not been processed
      }
      ...
&lt;/source&gt;

As you might have expected, &lt;code&gt;processOverlay(event)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if it has processed the event, and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.

The other two pages work in exactly the same way.

===Uses for Overlays===
The main use of overlays are menus, icons, and buttons that always stay in the same place on the screen. However, they can also be used for draggable (or transformable) palettes and toolboxes. Moreover, they are useful for dialog boxes. They can even be used to implement a simple window system (however without scrollable content and without the possibility to change the aspect ratio of the “windows”). 

Since they are so versatile, one should ask when not to use them? The main difference of overlays on the one hand and draggables or transformables on the other hand is that overlays are not affected by the transformation of their page. A specific example might be helpful: Imagine an application that presents a zoomable map where the user can click on certain points on the map to get info boxes with additional information about those points. Should these info boxes be overlays or transformables? If they are overlays, the user might quickly clutter the whole screen with info boxes. If they are transformables, the opened info boxes would just move out of sight as the user pans to other parts of the map. However, if the user zooms out, the content of a transformable quickly becomes unreadable while the overlay keeps its readable size. On the other hand, the position of an overlay doesn't tell the user much about the location of the clicked point on the map while a transformable stays close to the clicked point unless the user drags it away. But what if a user wants to compare the content of the info boxes of two points that are far apart? That's much easier with overlays. 

Thus, there are multiple advantages and disadvantages of overlays compared to transformables and draggables depending on the specific application. Therefore, the decision for or against overlays has to be made for each specific case.

===Implementation of Overlays===
The implementation of &lt;code&gt;processOverlay&lt;/code&gt; is relatively straightforward. The steps are:
* Transform the event coordinates since the overlay is usually using a different transformation than the page (for which the event coordinates have been transformed).
* Set the geometric transformation for &lt;code&gt;cuiContext&lt;/code&gt; (again because the page is usually using a different transformation).
* Call the process function of the overlay page.
* Process any unprocessed events by the transformable &lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt; member of the overlay page.
In code: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
/** 
 * Either process the event (if event != null) and return true if the event has been processed, 
 * or draw the page as an overlay (to another page) in the rectangle, which is specified in 
 * window coordinates (if event == null) and return false. This function is usually called
 * by {@link cuiPage.process} of another page.
 * @param {Object} event - An object describing a user event by its &quot;type&quot;, coordinates in 
 * window coordinates (&quot;clientX&quot; and &quot;clientY&quot;), an &quot;identifier&quot; for touch events, and optionally
 * &quot;buttons&quot; to specify which mouse buttons are depressed. If null, the function should
 * redraw the overlay page. 
 * @returns {boolean} True if event != null and the event has been processed (implying that 
 * no other GUI elements should process it). False otherwise.
 */ 
cuiPage.prototype.processOverlay = function(event) {
  var orgEvent = event;

  var transform = {scale : 1.0, x : 0.0, y : 0.0};
  this.computeInitialTransformation(transform);

  if (null != orgEvent) {
    event = {clientX : orgEvent.clientX, clientY : orgEvent.clientY, 
      eventX : orgEvent.eventX, eventY : orgEvent.eventY,
      type : orgEvent.type, buttons : orgEvent.buttons, 
      deltaY : orgEvent.deltaY, wheelDelta : orgEvent.wheelDelta};
    this.computeEventCoordinates(event, transform); // set event coordinates for our transformation
  }
  if (null == orgEvent) {
    cuiContext.save();
    this.setPageTransformation(transform); // set our transformation in cuiContext
  }
  var flag = this.process(event); // call our process function
  
  if (!flag &amp;&amp; null != event &amp;&amp; (this.interactionBits != cuiConstants.none)) { 
    // event hasn't been processed and we have an event?
    event.eventX = event.clientX; // we don't need any transformation here because the initial ...
    event.eventY = event.clientY; // ... transformation is applied to the arguments of ... 
      // ... view.process() and the transformation in view is applied internally in view.process()
    
    var oldTranslationX = this.view.translationX;
    var oldTranslationY = this.view.translationY;
    var oldFlag = this.view.isProcessingOuterEvents;
    this.view.isProcessingOuterEvents = false; // don't let a page process outer events if it is an overlay

    if (this.view.process(event, transform.x, transform.y, this.width * transform.scale, 
      this.height * transform.scale,
      null, null, null, null, null, this.interactionBits)) {
      flag = true;
      // enforce interaction constraints with page
      if (cuiConstants.isLimitedToVerticalDragging &amp; this.interactionBits) {
        this.view.translationX = oldTranslationX;
      }
      if (cuiConstants.isLimitedToHorizontalDragging &amp; this.interactionBits) {
        this.view.translationY = oldTranslationY;
      }
    }
    this.view.isProcessingOuterEvents = oldFlag; // restore page's setting
  }

  if (null == orgEvent) { 
    cuiContext.restore();
  }
  return flag;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Description ===

Three relational competencies were identified: communication, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Cooperation|cooperation]] and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Integration|integration]].

=== Definition ===

Communication refers to the flow of explicit information (Modi/Mabert, 2007) and includes the formal as well as informal sharing of meaningful and timely information (Anderson/Narus, 1990).

=== Items ===

To what extent do the statements apply to the relationship of your company with your suppliers and customers? (1 – strongly disagree; 7 – strongly agree):

*We provide each other with any information that might help us. (0.65)
*Exchange of information takes place frequently and in a timely manner. (0.83)
*We keep each other informed about events or changes that may affect the other party. (0.75)
*We give each other feedback about our performance. (0.70)

I would like to use this template in the hebrew wikibook. As I understand it, I will need to create this template page there and fill it with the relevant markup, and adjust the directionality etc.
But, at a quick glance I don't see where the markup lies, and would love to get a hint and save me some time searching. Or, of course, correcting my understanding of the proccess if I'm wrong.

Thanx!!

==Color Perception==

===Introduction===
Humans (together with primates like monkeys and gorillas) have the best color perception among mammals &lt;ref name=conway2009color&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Conway, Bevil R | year = 2009 | title = Color vision, cones, and color-coding in the cortex | journal = The neuroscientist | volume = 15 | pages = 274-290}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Hence, it is not a coincidence that color plays an important role in a wide variety of aspects. For example, color is useful for discriminating and differentiating objects, surfaces, natural scenery, and even faces &lt;ref name=russell2007real&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Russell, Richard and Sinha, Pawan} | year = 2007 | title = Real-world face recognition: The importance of surface reflectance properties | journal = Perception | volume = 36 | issue = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref name=gegenfurtner2000sensory&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Gegenfurtner, Karl R and Rieger, Jochem | year = 2000 | title = Sensory and cognitive contributions of color to the recognition of natural scenes | journal = Current Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 13 | pages = 805-808}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Color is also an important tool for nonverbal communication, including that of emotion &lt;ref name=changizi2006bare&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Changizi, Mark A and Zhang, Qiong and Shimojo, Shinsuke | year = 2006 | title = Bare skin, blood and the evolution of primate colour vision | journal = Biology letters | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 217-221}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For many decades, it has been a challenge to find the links between the physical properties of color and its perceptual qualities. Usually, these are studied under two different approaches: the behavioral response caused by color (also called ''psychophysics'') and the actual physiological response caused by it &lt;ref name=beretta2000understanding&gt;{{Cite book | last = Beretta | first = Giordano | year = 2000 | title = Understanding Color | publisher = Hewlett-Packard}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Here we will only focus on the latter. The study of the physiological basis of color vision, about which practically nothing was known before the second half of the twentieth century, has advanced slowly and steadily since 1950. Important progress has been made in many areas, especially at the receptor level. Thanks to molecular biology methods, it has been possible to reveal previously unknown details concerning the genetic basis for the cone pigments. Furthermore, more and more cortical regions have been shown to be influenced by visual stimuli, although the correlation of color perception with wavelength-dependent physiology activity beyond the receptors is not so easy to discern &lt;ref name=boynton1988color&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Boynton, Robert M | year = 1988 | title = Color vision | journal = Annual review of psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 69-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In this chapter, we aim to explain the basics of the different processes of color perception along the visual path, from the retina in the eye to the visual cortex in the brain. For anatomical details, please refer to Sec. &quot;Anatomy of the Visual System&quot; of this Wikibook.


===Color Perception at the Retina===
All colors that can be discriminated by humans can be produced by the mixture of just three primary (basic) colors. Inspired by this idea of color mixing, it has been proposed that color is subserved by three classes of sensors, each having a maximal sensitivity to a different part of the visible spectrum &lt;ref name=conway2009color/&gt;. It was first explicitly proposed in 1853 that there are three degrees of freedom in normal color matching &lt;ref name=grassmann1853theorie&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Grassmann, Hermann | year = 1853 | title = Zur theorie der farbenmischung | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 165 | issue = 5 | pages = 69-84}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This was later confirmed in 1886 &lt;ref name=konig1886grundempfindungen&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Konig, Arthur and Dieterici, Conrad | year = 1886 | title = Die Grundempfindungen und ihre intensitats-Vertheilung im Spectrum | journal = Koniglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with remarkably close results to recent studies &lt;ref name=smith1975spectral&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Smith, Vivianne C and Pokorny, Joel | year = 1975 | title = Spectral sensitivity of the foveal cone photopigments between 400 and 500 nm | journal = Vision research | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 161-171}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref name=vos1971derivation&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Vos, JJ and Walraven, PL | year = 1971 | title = On the derivation of the foveal receptor primaries | journal = Vision Research | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 799-818}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

These proposed color sensors are actually the so called cones (Note: In this chapter, we will only deal with cones. Rods contribute to vision only at low light levels. Although they are known to have an effect on color perception, their influence is very small and can be ignored here.) &lt;ref name=gegenfurtner2003color&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Gegenfurtner, Karl R and Kiper, Daniel C | year = 2003 | title = Color vision | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ''Cones'' are of the two types of photoreceptor cells found in the retina, with a significant concentration of them in the fovea. The Table below lists the three types of cone cells. These are distinguished by different types of rhodopsin pigment. Their corresponding absorption curves are shown in the Figure below.

Although no consensus has been reached for naming the different cone types, the most widely utilized designations refer either to their action spectra peak or to the color to which they are sensitive themselves (red, green, blue)&lt;ref name=boynton1988color /&gt;. In this text, we will use the S-M-L designation (for short, medium, and long wavelength), since these names are more appropriately descriptive. The ''blue-green-red'' nomenclature is somewhat misleading, since all types of cones are sensitive to a large range of wavelengths.

An important feature about the three cone types is their relative distribution in the retina. It turns out that the S-cones present a relatively low concentration through the retina, being completely absent in the most central area of the fovea. Actually, they are too widely spaced to play an important role in spatial vision, although they are capable of mediating weak border perception &lt;ref name=kaiser1985role&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Kaiser, Peter K and Boynton, Robert M | year = 1985 | title = Role of the blue mechanism in wavelength discrimination | journal = Vision research | volume = 125 | issue = 4 | pages = 523-529}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The fovea is dominated by L- and M-cones. The proportion of the two latter is usually measured as a ratio. Different values have been reported for the L/M ratio, ranging from 0.67 &lt;ref name=paulus1983new&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Paulus, Walter and Kroger-Paulus, Angelika | year = 1983 | title = A new concept of retinal colour coding | journal = Vision research | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 529-540}}&lt;/ref&gt; up to 2 &lt;ref name=nerger1992ratio&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Nerger, Janice L and Cicerone, Carol M | year = 1992 | title = The ratio of L cones to M cones in the human parafoveal retina | journal = Vision research | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 879-888}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the latter being the most accepted. Why L-cones almost always outnumber the M-cones remains unclear. Surprisingly, the relative cone ratio has almost no significant impact on color vision. This clearly shows that the brain is plastic, capable of making sense out of whatever cone signals it receives &lt;ref name=neitz2002color&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Neitz, Jay and Carroll, Joseph and Yamauchi, Yasuki and Neitz, Maureen and Williams, David R | year = 2002 | title = Color perception is mediated by a plastic neural mechanism that is adjustable in adults | journal = Neuron | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 783-792}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref name=jacobs2007emergence&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Jacobs, Gerald H and Williams, Gary A and Cahill, Hugh and Nathans, Jeremy | year = 2007 | title = Emergence of novel color vision in mice engineered to express a human cone photopigment | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5819 | pages = 1723-1725}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is also important to note the overlapping of the L- and M-cone absorption spectra. While the S-cone absorption spectrum is clearly separated, the L- and M-cone peaks are only about 30 nm apart, their spectral curves significantly overlapping as well. This results in a high correlation in the photon catches of these two cone classes. This is explained by the fact that in order to achieve the highest possible acuity at the center of the fovea, the visual system treats L- and M-cones equally, not taking into account their absorption spectra. Therefore, any kind of difference leads to a deterioration of the luminance signal &lt;ref name=osorio1998estimation&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Osorio, D and Ruderman, DL and Cronin, TW | year = 1998 | title = Estimation of errors in luminance signals encoded by primate retina resulting from sampling of natural images with red and green cones | journal = JOSA A | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 16-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, the small separation between L- and M-cone spectra might be interpreted as a compromise between the needs for high-contrast color vision and high acuity luminance vision. This is congruent with the lack of S-cones in the central part of the fovea, where visual acuity is highest. Furthermore, the close spacing of L- and M-cone absorption spectra might also be explained by their genetic origin. Both cone types are assumed to have evolved &quot;recently&quot; (about 35 million years ago) from a common ancestor, while the S-cones presumably split off from the ancestral receptor much earlier&lt;ref name=gegenfurtner2003color /&gt;.

The spectral absorption functions of the three different types of cone cells are the hallmark of human color vision. This theory solved a long-known problem: although we can see millions of different colors (humans can distinguish between 7 to 10 million different colors&lt;ref name=beretta2000understanding /&gt;, our retinas simply do not have enough space to accommodate an individual detector for every color at every retinal location.

===From the Retina to the Brain===
The signals that are transmitted from the retina to higher levels are not simple point-wise representations of the receptor signals, but rather consist of sophisticated combinations of the receptor signals. The objective of this section is to provide a brief of the paths that some of this information takes.

Once the optical image on the retina is transduced into chemical and electrical signals in the photoreceptors, the amplitude-modulated signals are converted into frequency-modulated representations at the ganglion-cell and higher levels. In these neural cells, the magnitude of the signal is represented in terms of the number of spikes of voltage per second fired by the cell rather than by the voltage difference across the cell membrane. In order to explain and represent the physiological properties of these cells, we will find the concept of receptive fields very useful.

A ''receptive field'' is a graphical representation of the area in the visual field to which a given cell responds. Additionally, the nature of the response is typically indicated for various regions in the receptive field. For example, we can consider the receptive field of a photoreceptor as a small circular area representing the size and location of that particular receptor's sensitivity in the visual field. The Figure below shows exemplary receptive fields for ganglion cells, typically in a center-surround antagonism. The left receptive field in the figure illustrates a positive central response (know as ''on-center''). This kind of response is usually generated by a positive input from a single cone surrounded by a negative response generated from several neighboring cones. Therefore, the response of this ganglion cell would be made up of inputs from various cones with both positive and negative signs. In this way, the cell not only responds to points of light, but serves as an edge (or more correctly, a spot) detector. In analogy to the computer vision terminology, we can think of the ganglion cell responses as the output of a convolution with an edge-detector kernel. The right receptive field of in the figure illustrates a negative central response (know as ''off-center''), which is equally likely. Usually, on-center and off-center cells will occur at the same spatial location, fed by the same photoreceptors, resulting in an enhanced dynamic range.

The lower Figure shows that in addition to spatial antagonism, ganglion cells can also have spectral opponency. For instance, the left part of the lower figure illustrates a red-green opponent response with the center fed by positive input from an L-cone and the surrounding fed by a negative input from M-cones. On the other hand, the right part of the lower figure illustrates the off-center version of this cell. Hence, before the visual information has even left the retina, processing has already occurred, with a profound effect on color appearance. There are other types and varieties of ganglion cell responses, but they all share these basic concepts.

On their way to the primary visual cortex, ganglion cell axons gather to form the optic nerve, which projects to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus. Coding in the optic nerve is highly efficient, keeping the number of nerve fibers to a minimum (limited by the size of the optic nerve) and thereby also the size of the retinal blind spot as small as possible (approximately 5° wide by 7° high). Furthermore, the presented ganglion cells would have no response to uniform illumination, since the positive and negative areas are balanced. In other words, the transmitted signals are uncorrelated. For example, information from neighboring parts of natural scenes are highly correlated spatially and therefore highly predictable &lt;ref name=kersten1987predictability&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Kersten, Daniel | year = 1987 | title = Predictability and redundancy of natural images | journal = JOSA A | volume = 4 | issue = 112 | pages = 2395-2400}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lateral inhibition between neighboring retinal ganglion cells minimizes this spatial correlation, therefore improving efficiency. We can see this as a process of image compression carried out in the retina.

Given the overlapping of the L- and M-cone absorption spectra, their signals are also highly correlated. In this case, coding efficiency is improved by combining the cone signals in order to minimize said correlation. We can understand this more easily using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of a given set of variables by transforming the original variables, to a set of new variables, the principal components (PCs). The first PC accounts for a maximal amount of total variance in the original variables, the second PC accounts for a maximal amount of variance that was not accounted for by the first component, and so on. In addition, PCs are linearly-independent and orthogonal to each other in the parameter space. PCA's main advantage is that only a few of the strongest PCs are enough to cover the vast majority of system variability &lt;ref name=jolliffe2002principal&gt;{{Cite book | last = Jolliffe | first = I. T. | year = 2002 | title = Principal Component Analysis | publisher = Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This scheme has been used with the cone absorption functions &lt;ref name=buchsbaum1983trichromacy&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Buchsbaum, Gershon and Gottschalk, A | year = 1983 | title = Trichromacy, opponent colours coding and optimum colour information transmission in the retina | journal = Proceedings of the Royal society of London. Series B.

The PCs that were found in the space of cone excitations produced by natural objects are 1) a luminance axis where the L- and M-cone signals are added (L+M), 2) the difference of the L- and M-cone signals (L-M), and 3) a color axis where the S-cone signal is differenced with the sum of the L- and M-cone signals (S-(L+M)). These channels, derived from a mathematical/computational approach, coincide with the three retino-geniculate channels discovered in electrophysiological experiments &lt;ref name=lee1988physiological&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Lee, BB and Martin, PR and Valberg, A | year = 1998 | title = The physiological basis of heterochromatic flicker photometry demonstrated in the ganglion cells of the macaque retina | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 404 | issue = 1 | pages = 323-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref name=derrington1984chromatic&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Derrington, Andrew M and Krauskopf, John and Lennie, Peter | year = 1984 | title = Chromatic mechanisms in lateral geniculate nucleus of macaque | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 357 | issue = 1 | pages = 241-265}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using these mechanisms, visual redundant information is eliminated in the retina.

There are three channels of information that actually communicate this information from the retina through the ganglion cells to the LGN. They are different not only on their chromatic properties, but also in their anatomical substrate. These channels pose important limitations for basic color tasks, such as detection and discrimination.

In the first channel, the output of L- and M-cones is transmitted synergistically to diffuse bipolar cells and then to cells in the magnocellular layers (M-) of the LGN (not to be confused with the M-cones of the retina)&lt;ref name=derrington1984chromatic /&gt;. The receptive fields of the M-cells are composed of a center and a surround, which are spatially antagonist. M-cells have high-contrast sensitivity for luminance stimuli, but they show no response at some combination of L-M opponent inputs&lt;ref name=shapley1990visual&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Shapley, Robert | year = 1990 | title = Visual sensitivity and parallel retinocortical channels | journal = Annual review of psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 635--658}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, because the null points of different M-cells vary slightly, the population response is never really zero. This property is actually passed on to cortical areas with predominant M-cell inputs&lt;ref name=dobkins2000comparison&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Dobkins, Karen R and Thiele, Alex and Albright, Thomas D | year = 2000 | title = Comparison of red--green equiluminance points in humans and macaques: evidence for different L: M cone ratios between species | journal = JOSA A | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 545-556}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The parvocellular pathway (P-) originates with the individual outputs from L- or M-cone to midget bipolar cells. These provide input to retinal P-cells&lt;ref name=gegenfurtner2003color /&gt;. In the fovea, the receptive field centers of P-cells are formed by single L- or M-cones. The structure of the P-cell receptive field surround is still debated. However, the most accepted theory states that the surround consists of a specific cone type, resulting in a spatially opponent receptive field for luminance stimuli&lt;ref name=martin2001chromatic&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Martin, Paul R and Lee, Barry B and White, Andrew JR and Solomon, Samuel G and Ruttiger, Lukas | year = 2001 | title = Chromatic sensitivity of ganglion cells in the peripheral primate retina | journal = Nature | volume = 410 | issue = 6831 | pages = 933-936}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Parvocellular layers contribute with about 80 % of the total projections from the retina to the LGN&lt;ref name=perry1984retinal&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Perry, VH and Oehler, R and Cowey, A | year = 1984 | month =  | title = Retinal ganglion cells that project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in the macaque monkey | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 1101--1123}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Finally, the recently discovered koniocellular pathway (K-) carries mostly signals from S-cones&lt;ref name=casagrande1994third&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Casagrande, VA | year = 1994 | title = A third parallel visual pathway to primate area V1 | journal = Trends in neurosciences | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 305-310 | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Groups of this type of cones project to special bipolar cells, which in turn provide input to specific small ganglion cells. These are usually not spatially opponent. The axons of the small ganglion cells project to thin layers of the LGN (adjacent to parvocellular layers)&lt;ref name=hendry2000koniocellular&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Hendry, Stewart HC and Reid, R Clay | year = 2000 | title = The koniocellular pathway in primate vision | journal = Annual review of neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 127-153}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

While the ganglion cells do terminate at the LGN (making synapses with LGN cells), there appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between ganglion cells and LGN cells. The LGN appears to act as a relay station for the signals. However, it probably serves some visual function, since there are neural projections from the cortex back to the LGN that could serve as some type of switching or adaptation feedback mechanism. The axons of LGN cells project to visual area one (V1) in the visual cortex in the occipital lobe.

===Color Perception at the Brain===

In the cortex, the projections from the magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular pathways end in different layers of the primary visual cortex. The magnocellular fibers innervate principally layer 4Cα and layer 6. Parvocellular neurons project mostly to 4Cβ, and layers 4A and 6. Koniocellular neurons terminate in the cytochrome oxidase (CO-) rich blobs in layers 1, 2, and 3&lt;ref name=callaway1998local&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Callaway, Edward M | year = 1998 | title = Local circuits in primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey | journal = Annual review of neuroscience | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 47-74}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Once in the visual cortex, the encoding of visual information becomes significantly more complex. In the same way the outputs of various photoreceptors are combined and compared to produce ganglion cell responses, the outputs of various LGN cells are compared and combined to produce cortical responses. As the signals advance further up in the cortical processing chain, this process repeats itself with a rapidly increasing level of complexity to the point that receptive fields begin to lose meaning. However, some functions and processes have been identified and studied in specific regions of the visual cortex.

In the V1 region (striate cortex), double opponent neurons - neurons that have their receptive fields both chromatically and spatially opposite with respect to the on/off regions of a single receptive field - compare color signals across the visual space &lt;ref name=conway2001spatial&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Conway, Bevil R | year = 2001 | month =  | title = Spatial structure of cone inputs to color cells in alert macaque primary visual cortex (V-1) | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 2768-2783}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They constitute between 5 to 10% of the cells in V1. Their coarse size and small percentage matches the poor spatial resolution of color vision &lt;ref name=conway2009color /&gt;. Furthermore, they are not sensitive to the direction of moving stimuli (unlike some other V1 neurons) and, hence, unlikely to contribute to motion perception&lt;ref name=horwitz2005paucity&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Horwitz, Gregory D and Albright, Thomas D | year = 2005 | title = Paucity of chromatic linear motion detectors in macaque V1 | journal = Journal of Vision | volume = 5 | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, given their specialized receptive field structure, these kind of cells are the neural basis for color contrast effects, as well as an efficient mean to encode color itself&lt;ref name=danilova2006comparison&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Danilova, Marina V and Mollon, JD | year = 2006 | title = The comparison of spatially separated colours | journal = Vision research | volume = 46 | issue = 6 | pages = 823-836}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref name=wachtler2003representation&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Wachtler, Thomas and Sejnowski, Terrence J and Albright, Thomas D | year = 2003 | title = Representation of color stimuli in awake macaque primary visual cortex | journal = Neuron | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 681-691}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other V1 cells respond to other types of stimuli, such as oriented edges, various spatial and temporal frequencies, particular spatial locations, and combinations of these features, among others. Additionally, we can find cells that linearly combine inputs from LGN cells as well as cells that perform nonlinear combination. These responses are needed to support advanced visual capabilities, such as color itself.

There is substantially less information on the chromatic properties of single neurons in V2 as compared to V1. On a first glance, it seems that there are no major differences of color coding in V1 and V2&lt;ref name=solomon2005chromatic&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Solomon, Samuel G and Lennie, Peter | year = 2005 | title = Chromatic gain controls in visual cortical neurons | journal = The Journal of neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 19 | pages = 4779-4792}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One exception to this is the emergence of a new class of color-complex cell&lt;ref name=hubel1985complex&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hubel| first = David H | year = 1995| title = Eye, brain, and vision | publisher = Scientific American Library/Scientific American Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, it has been suggested that V2 region is involved in the elaboration of hue. However, this is still very controversial and has not been confirmed.

Following the modular concept developed after the discovery of functional ocular dominance in V1, and considering the anatomical segregation between the P-, M-, and K-pathways (described in Sec. 3), it was suggested that a specialized system within the visual cortex devoted to the analysis of color information should exist&lt;ref name=livingstone1987psychophysical&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Livingstone, Margaret S and Hubel, David H | year = 1987 | title = Psychophysical evidence for separate channels for the perception of form, color, movement, and depth | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 3416-3468}}&lt;/ref&gt;. V4 is the region that has historically attracted the most attention as the possible &quot;color area&quot; of the brain. This is because of an influential study that claimed that V4 contained 100 % of hue-selective cells&lt;ref name=zeki1973colour&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Zeki, Semir M | year = 1973 | title = Colour coding in rhesus monkey prestriate cortex | journal = Brain research | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 422-427}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this claim has been disputed by a number of subsequent studies, some even reporting that only 16 % of V4 neurons show hue tuning&lt;ref name=conway2006color&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Conway, Bevil R and Tsao, Doris Y | year = 2006 | title = Color architecture in alert macaque cortex revealed by fMRI | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | pages = 1604-1613}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Currently, the most accepted concept is that V4 contributes not only to color, but to shape perception, visual attention, and stereopsis as well. Furthermore, recent studies have focused on other brain regions trying to find the &quot;color area&quot; of the brain, such as TEO&lt;ref name=tootell2004search&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Tootell, Roger BH and Nelissen, Koen and Vanduffel, Wim and Orban, Guy A | year = 2004 | title = Search for color 'center(s)'in macaque visual cortex | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 353-363}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PITd&lt;ref name=conway2007specialized&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Conway, Bevil R and Moeller, Sebastian and Tsao, Doris Y | year = 2007 | title = Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex | journal = 560--573 | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 560-573}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relationship of these regions to each other is still debated. To reconcile the discussion, some use the term posterior inferior temporal (PIT) cortex to denote the region that includes V4, TEO, and PITd&lt;ref name=conway2009color /&gt;.

If the cortical response in V1, V2, and V4 cells is already a very complicated task, the level of complexity of complex visual responses in a network of approximately 30 visual zones is humongous. Figure 4 shows a small portion of the connectivity of the different cortical areas (not cells) that have been identified&lt;ref name=fairchild2013color&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fairchild| first = Mark D | year = 2013| title = Color appearance models | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

At this stage, it becomes exceedingly difficult to explain the function of singles cortical cells in simple terms. As a matter of fact, the function of a single cell might not have meaning since the representation of various perceptions must be distributed across collections of cells throughout the cortex.


===Color Vision Adaptation Mechanisms===
Although researchers have been trying to explain the processing of color signals in the human visual system, it is important to understand that color perception is not a fixed process. Actually, there are a variety of dynamic mechanisms that serve to optimize the visual response according to the viewing environment. Of particular relevance to color perception are the mechanisms of dark, light, and chromatic adaptation.

====Dark Adaptation====
Dark adaptation refers to the change in visual sensitivity that occurs when the level of illumination is decreased. The visual system response to reduced illumination is to become more sensitive, increasing its capacity to produce a meaningful visual response even when the light conditions are suboptimal&lt;ref name=webster1996human&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Webster, Michael A | year = 1996 | title = Human colour perception and its adaptation | journal = Network: Computation in Neural Systems | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 587 - 634}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:DarkAdaptation.pdf|thumb|right|upright=1.75|alt=Dark adaptation. During the first 10 minutes (i.e. to the left of the dotted line), sensitivity recovery is done by the cones. After the first 10 minutes (i.e. to the right of the dotted line), rods outperform the cones. Full sensitivity is recovered after approximately 30 minutes.|Fig. 5. Dark adaptation. During the first 10 minutes (i.e. to the left of the dotted line), sensitivity recovery is done by the cones. After the first 10 minutes (i.e. to the right of the dotted line), rods outperform the cones. Full sensitivity is recovered after approximately 30 minutes.|page=1]]

Figure 5 shows the recovery of visual sensitivity after transition from an extremely high illumination level to complete darkness&lt;ref name=fairchild2013color /&gt;. First, the cones become gradually more sensitive, until the curve levels off after a couple of minutes. Then, after approximately 10 minutes have passed, visual sensitivity is roughly constant. At that point, the rod system, with a longer recovery time, has recovered enough sensitivity to outperform the cones and therefore recover control the overall sensitivity. Rod sensitivity gradually improves as well, until it becomes asymptotic after about 30 minutes. In other words, cones are responsible for the sensitivity recovery for the first 10 minutes. Afterwards, rods outperform the cones and gain full sensitivity after approximately 30 minutes.

This is only one of several neural mechanisms produced in order to adapt to the dark lightning conditions as good as possible. Some other neural mechanisms include the well-known pupil reflex, depletion and regeneration of photopigment, gain control in retinal cells and other higher-level mechanisms, and cognitive interpretation, among others.

====Light Adaptation====
Light adaptation is essentially the inverse process of dark adaptation. As a matter of fact, the underlying physiological mechanisms are the same for both processes. However, it is important to consider it separately since its visual properties differ.

[[File:LightAdaptation.pdf|thumb|right|upright=1.75|alt=Light adaptation. For a given scene, the solid lines represent families of visual response curves at different (relative) energy levels. The dashed line represents the case where we would adapt in order to cover the entire range of illumination, which would yield limited contrast and reduced sensitivity.|Fig. 6. Light adaptation. For a given scene, the solid lines represent families of visual response curves at different (relative) energy levels. The dashed line represents the case where we would adapt in order to cover the entire range of illumination, which would yield limited contrast and reduced sensitivity.|page=1]]

Light adaptation occurs when the level of illumination is increased. Therefore, the visual system must become less sensitive in order to produce useful perceptions, given the fact that there is significantly more visible light available. The visual system has a limited output dynamic range available for the signals that produce our perceptions. However, the real world has illumination levels covering at least 10 orders of magnitude more. Fortunately, we rarely need to view the entire range of illumination levels at the same time.

At high light levels, adaptation is achieved by photopigment bleaching. This scales photon capture in the receptors and protects the cone response from saturating at bright backgrounds. The mechanisms of light adaptation occur primarily within the retina&lt;ref name=shapley1984visual&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Shapley, Robert and Enroth-Cugell, Christina | year = 1984 | title = Visual adaptation and retinal gain controls | journal = Progress in retinal research | volume = 3 | pages = 263-346}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As a matter of fact, gain changes are largely cone-specific and adaptation pools signals over areas no larger than the diameter of individual cones&lt;ref name=chaparro1995human&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Chaparro, A and Stromeyer III, CF and Chen, G and Kronauer, RE | year = 1995 | title = Human cones appear to adapt at low light levels: Measurements on the red-green detection mechanism | journal = Vision Research | volume = 35 | issue = 22 | pages = 3103-3118}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref name=macleod1992visual&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Macleod, Donald IA and Williams, David R and Makous, Walter | year = 1992 | title = A visual nonlinearity fed by single cones | journal = Vision research | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 347-363}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This points to a localization of light adaptation that may be as early as the receptors.  However, there appears to be more than one site of sensitivity scaling. Some of the gain changes are extremely rapid, while others take seconds or even minutes to stabilize&lt;ref name=hayhoe1991adaptation&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hayhoe| first = Mary | year = 1991| title = Adaptation mechanisms in color and brightness | publisher = Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Usually, light adaptation takes around 5 minutes (six times faster than dark adaptation). This might point to the influence of post-receptive sites.

Figure 6 shows examples of light adaptation &lt;ref name=fairchild2013color /&gt;. If we would use a single response function to map the large range of intensities into the visual system's output, then we would only have a very small range at our disposal for a given scene. It is clear that with such a response function, the perceived contrast of any given scene would be limited and visual sensitivity to changes would be severely degraded due to signal-to-noise issues. This case is shown by the dashed line. On the other hand, solid lines represent families of visual responses. These curves map the useful illumination range in any given scene into the full dynamic range of the visual output, thus resulting in the best possible visual perception for each situation. Light adaptation can be thought of as the process of sliding the visual response curve along the illumination level axis until the optimum level for the given viewing conditions is reached.


====Chromatic Adaptation====
The general concept of chromatic adaptation consists in the variation of the height of the three cone spectral responsivity curves. This adjustment arises because light adaptation occurs independently within each class of cone. A specific formulation of this hypothesis is known as the ''von Kries adaptation''. This hypothesis states that the adaptation response takes place in each of the three cone types separately and is equivalent to multiplying their fixed spectral sensitivities by a scaling constant&lt;ref name=macadam1970sources&gt;{{Cite book | last = MacAdam| first = DAvid L| year = 1970| title = Sources of Color Science | publisher = MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If the scaling weights (also known as ''von Kries coefficients'') are inversely proportional to the absorption of light by each cone type (i.e. a lower absorption will require a larger coefficient), then von Kries scaling maintains a constant mean response within each cone class. This provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for maintaining the perceived color of objects despite changes in illumination. Under a number of different conditions, von Kries scaling provides a good account of the effects of light adaptation on color sensitivity and appearance&lt;ref name=webster1995colour&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Webster, Michael A and Mollon, JD | year = 1995 | title = Colour constancy influenced by contrast adaptation | journal = Nature | volume = 373 | issue = 6516 | pages = 694-698}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref name=brainard1992asymmetric&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Brainard, David H and Wandell, Brian A | year = 1992 | title = Asymmetric color matching: how color appearance depends on the illuminant | journal = JOSA A | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = 1443-1448}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The easiest way to picture chromatic adaptation is by examining a white object under different types of illumination. For example, let's consider examining a piece of paper under daylight, fluorescent, and incandescent illumination. Daylight contains relatively far more short-wavelength energy than fluorescent light, and incandescent illumination contains relatively far more long-wavelength energy than fluorescent light. However, in spite of the different illumination conditions, the paper approximately retains its white appearance under all three light sources. This is because the S-cone system becomes relatively less sensitive under daylight (in order to compensate for the additional short-wavelength energy) and the L-cone system becomes relatively less sensitive under incandescent illumination (in order to compensate for the additional long-wavelength energy)&lt;ref name=fairchild2013color /&gt;.</text>

The barrel Cortex is a specialized region in somatosensory cortex responsible for processing the tactile information from whiskers. As every other cortical region, the barrel cortex also preserves the columnar organization which plays a crucial role in information processing. Information from each whisker is represented in separate, discrete columns analogous to “barrels”, hence the name barrel cortex. Rodents use whiskers constantly to acquire sensory information from the environment. Given their nocturnal nature, tactile information carried by whisker forms the primary sensory signals to build a perceptual map of the environment. The whiskers on the snouts of mice and rats serve as arrays of highly sensitive detectors for acquiring tactile information as shown in Figure 1 A and B. By using their whiskers, rodents can build spatial representations of their environment, locate objects, and perform fine-grain texture discrimination. Somatosensory whisker-related processing is highly organized into stereotypical maps, which occupy a large portion of the rodent brain. During exploration and palpation of objects, the whiskers are under motor control, often executing rapid large-amplitude rhythmic sweeping movements, and this sensory system is therefore an attractive model for investigating active sensory processing and sensory-motor integration. In these animals, a large part of the neocortex is dedicated to the processing of information from the whiskers. Since rodents are nocturnal, visual information is relatively poor and they rely heavily on the tactile information from whiskers. Perhaps the most remarkable specialization of this sensory system is the primary somatosensory ‘‘barrel’’ cortex, where each whisker is represented by a discrete and well-defined structure in layer 4.

These layer 4 barrels are somatotopically arranged in an almost identical fashion to the layout of the whiskers on the snout i.e. bordering whiskers are represented in adjacent cortical areas &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;. Sensorimotor integration of whisker related activity leads to pattern discrimination and enables rodents to have a reliable map of the environment. This is an interesting model to study because rodents use whisker to “see” and this cross modality sensory information processing could help us to improve the life of humans, who are deprived of one sensory modality. Specifically, blind people can be trained to use somatosensory information to build a spatial map of the environment &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Ascending pathway of rodent whisker-related sensorimotor system.png|thumb|Figure 2. Schematic demonstrating the ascending pathway of rodent whisker-related sensorimotor system.]]




The tactile information from the whiskers on the snouts is carried through the trigeminal nerves, which terminate at the trigeminal nucleus as shown in Figure 2. The ascending pathway starts with the primary afferents in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) transducing whisker vibrations into neuronal signals, and projecting to the trigeminal brainstem complex (TN). The TN consists of the principal nucleus (PrV), and the spinal sub-nuclei (interpolarisSpVi; caudalisSpVc; the detailed connectivity of the oralis sub-nucleus is unknown and is omitted in the figure). The SpVi falls into a caudal and rostral part (SpVic and SpVir). The classical mono-whisker lemniscal pathway (lemniscal 1) originates in PrV barrelettes, and projects via VPM barreloid cores to primary somatosensory cortex (S1) barrel columns. A second lemniscal pathway originating from PrV has been recently discovered which carries multi-whisker signals via barreloid heads to septa (and dysgranular zone) of S1. The extra-lemniscal pathway originates in SPVic and carries multi-whisker signals via barreloid tails in VPM to the secondary somatosensory area. Finally, the parelemniscal pathway originates in SpVir and carries multi-whisker signals via POm to S1, S2, and primary motor area (M1). The different colours of connections indicate three principal pathways through which associative coupling between the sensorimotor cortical areas may be realized. Black indicates direct cortico-cotical connections. Blue shows cortico-thalamic cascades. Brown represents cortico-sub-cortical loops. Projections of S1 and S2 may open or close the lemniscal gate (i.e. gate signal flow through PrV) by modulating intrinsic TN circuitry.

The sensory neurons make excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the trigeminal nuclei of the brain stem. Trigemino-thalamic neurons in the principal trigeminal nucleus are organized into somatotopically arranged ‘‘barrelettes,’’ each receiving strong input from a single whisker as shown in (Figure 3). The principal trigeminal neurons project to the ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus of the thalamus, which is also somatotopically laid out into anatomical units termed ‘‘barreloids’’ VPM neurons respond rapidly and precisely to whisker deflection, with one ‘‘principal’’ whisker evoking stronger responses than all others. The axons of VPM neurons within individual barreloids project to the primary somatosensory neocortex forming discrete clusters in layer 4, which form the basis of the ‘‘barrel’’ map as shown in Figure 3.

=== Whisker information processing in Barrel Cortex with specialized local microcircuit ===

The deflection of a whisker is thought to open mechano-gated ion channels in nerve endings of sensory neurons innervating the hair follicle (although the molecular signalling machinery remains to be identified). The resulting depolarization evokes action potential firing in the sensory neurons of the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve. The transduction through mechanical deformation is similar to the hair cells in the inner ear; in this case the contact of whiskers with the objects causes the mechano-gated ion channels to open. Cation-permeable ion channels let positively charged ions into the cells and causes depolarization, eventually leading to generation of action potentials. A single sensory neuron only fires action potentials to deflection of one specific whisker. The innervation of the hair follicle shows a diversity of nerve endings, which may be specialized for detecting different types of sensory input &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

The layer 4 barrel map is arranged almost identically to the layout of the whiskers on the snout of the rodent. There are several recurrent connections in layer 4 and it sends axons to layer 2/3 neurons, which integrates information from other cortical regions like primary motor cortex. These intra-cortical and inter-cortical connections enable the rodents to achieve stimulus discrimination capabilities and to extract optimal information from the incoming tactile stimulus. Also, these projections play a crucial role in integrating somatosensory information with motor output. Information from whiskers is processed in the barrel cortex with specialized local microcircuits formed to extract optimal information about the environment. These cortical microcircuits are composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons as shown in Figure 4.

=== Learning whisker based object discrimination &amp; texture differentiation ===

Rodents move their sensors to collect information, and these movements are guided by sensory input. When action sequences are required to achieve success in novel tasks, interactions between movement and sensation underlie motor control &lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; and complex learned behaviours &lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;. The motor cortex has important roles in learning motor skills &lt;sup&gt;[6-9]&lt;/sup&gt;, but its function in learning sensorimotor associations is unknown. The neural circuits underlying sensorimotor integration are beginning to be mapped. Different motor cortex layers harbour excitatory neurons with distinct inputs and projections &lt;sup&gt;[10-12]&lt;/sup&gt;. Outputs to motor centres in the brain stem and spinal cord arise from pyramidal tract-type neurons in layer 5B (L5B). Within motor cortex, excitation descends from L2/3 to L5 &lt;sup&gt;[13, 14]&lt;/sup&gt;. Input from somatosensory cortex impinges preferentially onto L2/3 neurons. L2/3 neurons &lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; therefore directly link somatosensation and control of movements. In one of the recent studies &lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;, mice were trained head fixed in a vibrissa-based object-detection task while imaging populations of neurons &lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;. Following a sound, a pole was moved to one of several target positions within reach of the whiskers (the ‘go’ stimulus) or to an out-of-reach position (the ‘no-go’ stimulus). Target and out-of-reach locations were arranged along the anterior–posterior axis; the out-of reach position was most anterior. Mice searched for the pole with one whisker row, the C row, and reported the pole as ‘present’ by licking, or ‘not present’ by withholding licking. Licking on go trials (hit) was rewarded with water, whereas licking on no-go trials (false alarm) was punished with a time-out during which the trial was stopped for 2 seconds. Trials without licking (no-go, correct rejection, go, and miss) were not rewarded or punished. All mice showed learning within the first two or three sessions. Performance reached expert levels after three to six training sessions. Learning the behavioural task was directly dependent on the motor related behaviour. Naive mice whisked occasionally in a manner unrelated to trail structure. Thus, object detection relies on a sequence of actions, linked by sensory cues. An auditory cue triggers whisking during the sampling period. Contact between whisker and object causes licking for a water reward during a response period. Silencing vM1 indicates that this task requires the motor cortex; with vM1 silenced, task-dependent whisking persisted, but was reduced in amplitude and repeatability, and task performance dropped.


=== Neural Correlates of Sensorimotor learning mechanism ===


Coding of touch in the motor cortex is consistent with direct input from vS1 to the imaged neurons. A model based on population coding of individual behavioural features also predicted motor behaviours. Accurate decoding of whisking amplitude, whisking set-point and lick rate suggests that vM1 controls these slowly varying motor parameters, as expected from previous motor cortex and neurophysiological experiments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Ideal Gas Law ==

The first concept we will derive and study is the Ideal Gas Law. You may be familiar with the Ideal Gas Law in the form &lt;math&gt;{\it PV}={\it nRT}&lt;/math&gt; from a general chemistry course, where ''P'' is the pressure, ''V'' is the volume, ''n'' is the number of moles of particles, ''R'' is the Ideal Gas Constant, and ''T'' is temperature. This equation can be used to describe a closed system filled with ideal (non-interacting, randomly moving) gas particles.

=== Derivation ===
Understanding and deriving this law from first principles is our first step to obtaining a grasp of thermal biophysics. Let's first write the Ideal Gas Law in a new manner. This is considered the more &quot;physics-y&quot; formulation of the Ideal Gas Law, and it is easier to derive. This new formulation is &lt;math&gt;{\it PV}={\it Nk}_{{B}}T&lt;/math&gt;. The only difference between the two is that the latter contains an ''N'' that represents the number of particles in a system rather than the number of moles of particles. Also, the constant is no longer the Ideal Gas Constant ''R'' but Boltzmann's constant ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''. Boltzmann's constant relates energy with temperature at the level of each individual particle.

Consider a closed system of a cylinder and piston. The distance from the piston to the other side is ''x'', and the area of the piston (and the other side of the cylinder) is ''A''. The cylinder is filled with monatomic ideal gas particles that are moving ballistically and randomly around inside.
 
The cylinder in its current state is 3 dimensional. The particles are allowed to move up and down, left and right, and forward and backwards. However, imagine that we squeeze the cylinder down to an infinitely small tube such that the particles only have the ability to move only left and right. This greatly decreases the complexity of the proof as we only have to worry about one dimension rather than three. 


[[File:Pistons.jpg|thumb|Piston and 1 dimensional piston to test the Ideal Gas Law]]


It is at this point that we should state a few assumptions of the proof thus far. Assumptions are important to understand as they give us guidance to the validity, applicability, and general understanding of the proof and consequent concepts that are drawn from it. First, we assume that all particles are moving at the same speed. At first glance, this assumption seems preposterous. However, when taken as a whole, a large number of particles  (think ''1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;'') do behave with an aggregate average speed. This idea of &quot;average&quot; is a concept that will reappear many times throughout statistical mechanics. This idea is only valid with large systems, but since that is what we are usually concerned with in thermal physics, then this assumption will hold.

The second assumption is that collisions are elastic and momentum is conserved. This means that when a particle with mass ''m'' and with velocity ''v'' collide with one of the ends of the container, then &lt;math&gt;p_{{i}}={\it mv}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{{f}}=-{\it mv}&lt;/math&gt; where ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the momentum of the particle before collision and ''p&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the momentum after collision.

You may recall that &lt;math&gt;F={\frac {{\it dp}}{{\it dt}}}&lt;/math&gt;. So 

:&lt;math&gt;\left| F \right| ={\frac { \left| \Delta p \right| }{\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left| F \right| ={\frac { \left| p_{{f}}-p_{{i}} \right| }{\Delta t}} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left| F \right| ={\frac { \left| {\it -mv}-mv \right| }{\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left| F \right| =2\,{\frac {{\it mv}}{\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt;

You may be wondering what value we chose for ''Δt''. We will let ''Δt'' be the time it takes for a particle to move from one end of the tube to the opposite end of the tube and collide. This restriction ensures that each and every particle collides exactly once with one side of the tube during time ''Δt''. Here, we make our third assumption that half of the particles will collide with the left end and the other half will collide with the right end. The sum of the force imparted by each individual particle that collides with the right end would give the total force felt on the right end from the particles. Or, more succinctly &lt;math&gt;F_{{{\it right}}}=\Sigma\,\,{\frac {2m_{{i}}v_{{i}}}{\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt; where ''i'' goes from 0 to only ''N/2'' since only half of the particles collide on the right side in the allotted time. Also, it should be noted that &lt;math&gt;F_{{{\it right}}}=-F_{{{\it left}}}&lt;/math&gt; since the same number of particles collide on the left, but in opposite direction. This equation greatly simplifies down to 
:&lt;math&gt;F_{{{\it right}}}={\frac {N}{2}}{\frac {{\it 2mv}}{\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_{{{\it right}}}={\frac {{\it Nmv}}{\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that pressure on one end of the tube ''P'' is the total force felt at that end divided by the area of the end &lt;math&gt;P_{{{\it right}}}={\frac {F_{{{\it right}}}}{A}}&lt;/math&gt;. 

By substitution, &lt;math&gt;P_{{{\it right}}}={\frac {{\it Nmv}}{A\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;V={\it Ax}&lt;/math&gt;, then after solving for ''A'',   &lt;math&gt;P={\frac {{\it Nmvx}}{V\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt; by substitution. Remember what ''x'' represents: the total length of one end to the other of the tube. Since ''Δt'' was the time it took for a particle to move from one end of the tube to the other, then it follows that &lt;math&gt;v={\frac {x}{\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt;. By substitution, &lt;math&gt;P={\frac {{{\it Nmv}}^{2}}{V}}&lt;/math&gt;, or
:&lt;math&gt;{\it PV}={{\it Nmv}}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;


Now, we will invoke a principle that you may not have heard of before. According to the '''Equipartition Theorem''', any quadratic degree of freedom may store an average of &lt;math&gt;1/2\,k_{{B}}T&lt;/math&gt; of energy. Since the velocity term is quadratic, then it follows the Equipartition Theorem. The Equipartition Theorem is not a theorem that is proven here; it will simply be assumed true. There are many degrees of freedom that need to be considered for these particles: translational, rotational, and vibrational motion. Since we have restricted ourselves to a one-dimensional system, then there is only one translational degree of freedom. There are in fact no degrees of rotational freedom. This may seem strange, but it is a phenomenon that arises from Quantum Mechanics. Since the particles are monatomic and spherical, it is impossible to distinguish one rotational configuration from another. This means that these rotational states admit no extra degree of freedom. There is no degree of freedom that arises from vibrational motion since the particles are monatomic. Therefore, the kinetic energy ''KE'' of the particle contains only 1 term &lt;math&gt;{\it KE}=1/2\,{{\it mv}}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the kinetic energy is quadratic, then by the Equipartition Theorem &lt;math&gt;1/2\,{{\it mv}}^{2}=1/2\,k_{{B}}T&lt;/math&gt;, or with a little simplification &lt;math&gt;{{\it mv}}^{2}=k_{{B}}T&lt;/math&gt;. By substitution back into the pressure equation above, &lt;math&gt;{\it PV}={\it Nk}_{{B}}T&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The Difference between ''n'' and ''N'' ===

Be sure that you do not get confused with the difference between ''n'' and ''N''. The number of moles in the ideal gas is denoted by ''n'' while the number of ''particles'' is denoted by ''N''. To a physicist, it is usually more helpful to think in terms of the particles rather than the number of moles. This will become exceptionally clear when we begin to study the amount of disorder in a system.

== Work ==

Now imagine an outside force is exerted on the piston. When a force is applied onto the system, the piston compresses by a certain distance ''Δx''. You may remember from an earlier physics class that ''Work'' can be calculated as &lt;math&gt;W=F \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;F = PA&lt;/math&gt;, then by substitution &lt;math&gt;W={PA} \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''AΔx'' is just the change in volume ''ΔV'', then &lt;math&gt;W={P} \Delta V&lt;/math&gt;. Essentially, work shows the amount of energy that enters or leaves the system whenever the piston moves in or out. The primary focus in Thermal Physics is to keep track of the total energy in a system. It seems that one exchange of energy between systems is through the work that is either done on or being done by the system. Another type of energy that needs to be monitored is the amount of ''heat'' that enters or leaves the system. Ultimately, work and heat energy are the only two quantities to keep track of to determine the total change in energy. This gets us to the ''First Law of Thermodynamics''
:&lt;math&gt;U(total energy)=Q(heat)+W(work)&lt;/math&gt;

More often than not, it may be more prevalent to measure a change in the energy of the system
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta U = Q + W &lt;/math&gt;,
where the deltas (''Δ'') have been left off of the right side because heat and work are not necessarily conserved quantities.

=== Isothermal Processes ===

An isothermal process is a process that occurs while temperature remains constant. First, recall the state equation of an ideal gas &lt;math&gt;{\it PV}={\it Nk}_{{B}}T&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;P={\frac {{\it Nk}_{{B}}T}{V}}&lt;/math&gt;. Also, recall that work in a system for constant temperature is &lt;math&gt;W=P \Delta V&lt;/math&gt;.  Since it is possible for both volume and pressure to change, and pressure can be written as a function of volume, then work can be written as a function dependent on volume &lt;math&gt;W={\frac {{\it Nk}_{{B}}T\Delta V}{V}}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, if you take small increments of &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; and then added them all up to obtain the total change in volume, then work could be calculated as&lt;math&gt;\int_{Vi}^{Vf} {\frac{Nk_{B}T}{V}}\,dV&lt;/math&gt;. Since an isothermal process is being considered, then &lt;math&gt;Nk_{B}T&lt;/math&gt; is constant and can be pulled out of the integral. After integrating, &lt;math&gt;W={\it Nk}_{{B}}T \left( \ln  \left( V_{{f}} \right) -\ln  \left( V_{{i}} \right)  \right) &lt;/math&gt;. By rules logarithms,  &lt;math&gt;W={\it Nk}_{{B}}T\ln  \left( {\frac {V_{{f}}}{V_{{i}}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;. For such an isothermal process (where the temperature remains constant), all of the energy that enters or leaves a system can be found with this work equation.

=== All about Perspective===

When the piston is compressed, we perform work on the system and the volume decreases. As can be seen from the above equation, a final volume that is smaller than the initial volume will give a negative value.  This means that if we want to determine whether energy is entering (positive work) or leaving (negative work) a system, then the work equation needs to have a sign flipped &lt;math&gt;W=-{\it Nk}_{{B}}T\ln  \left( {\frac {V_{{f}}}{V_{{i}}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;. Or once again from the rules of logarithms, &lt;math&gt;W={\it Nk}_{{B}}T\ln  \left( {\frac {V_{{i}}}{V_{{f}}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;. This illustrates an important concern in thermal physics. It is imperative that the energy being discussed is qualified in terms of the ‘’system’’ or its ‘’surroundings’’. In most cases, a negative value stands for energy leaving the system and a positive value indicates energy entering the system. This being the case, our equation for work must be written as &lt;math&gt;W = -P \Delta V&lt;/math&gt; to ensure that compression (decrease in volume) leads to positive work on the system.

Welcome to the first unit of the Elementary Spanish guide! 

In this lesson you will learn how to talk about your family. Most of the material will be in the present tense so it will focus on talking about your family today. Future lessons will cover talking about your family growing up or planning future activity with your family. For this lesson just focus on the present. 

By the end you will be able to count to 10, know a dozen words for various family members, and be able to ask and answer some basic questions about your family in conversation with other parents.

= Lessons = 

All of these lessons focus on the same topic, talking about family, but each one is focused on the material you need to talk with different groups of people: your fellow parents following this guide, your children, and personal acquaintances who already know Spanish. 

You should start with the first lessons, &quot;[[/Beginner/|1. Talking with each other]]&quot;, and then proceed to the rest as you have time. The language exchange events will only focus on these &quot;Talking with each other&quot; lessons so no need to worry if you do not have time for the other ones before the next meeting. Each unit will follow this pattern.

* '''[[/Beginner/|1. Talking with each other]]'''
* '''[[/Intermediate/|2. Talking with your children]]'''
* '''[[/Advanced/|3. Talking with acquaintances]]'''

= Resources =

These are some handy phrases for language students, especially if you begin practicing with acquaintances and native speakers in the community. If you ever get stuck in conversation, these phrases can help smooth everything out and get you back on your conversational feet.

Practice with these terms in this interactive exercise: [http://wikiotics.org/es/ElementarySpanish-Family1-Part1  Question practice activity]


''Please keep in mind that in these basic lessons, we are not including the formal form of address &quot;USTED&quot;. This is the form of address you would use when speaking to someone in a superior social position. This form is much less commonly used by adults in a community of equals, like our community, so we will not be covering it in the introductory lessons. For now it is enough to know that you are learning the informal, every day, Spanish and that there is a more formal variety you could use.''

== Example dialogues == 
[http://wikiotics.org/es/Present_Family_Beginner_2?oldid=3319 Dialogue 1 audio activity]

=== Dialogue 1 ===

In the following dialogue, Michelle and Daniel are meeting for the first time. Michelle has two children and Daniel has one. They are exchanging details about their kids.
 
Michelle: Hola. Me llamo Michelle. ¿Cómo te llamas?

Daniel: Hola Michelle. Yo me llamo Daniel.

Michelle: Mucho gusto. ¿Cuál es tu hijo o hija?

Daniel: Mi hija es María. Ella tiene seis años. Está en el primer grado.

Michelle: O. Que bien. Yo tengo dos hijos. Se llaman Jaime y Jazmín.

Daniel: Que bonitos nombres. ¿Cuántos años tienen?

Michelle: Jaime tiene cuatro años y Jazmín tiene ocho años.
 
Notice how “tiene” was used for singular and “tienen” was used for plural.

=== Dialogue 2 ===
[http://wikiotics.org/es/Present_Family_Beginner_1 Dialogue 2 audio activity]

In the following dialogue, Matthew and Eliza catch up. They haven’t seen each other in a while and inquire about each others’ families.

Matthew: ¡Hola Eliza!

Eliza: ¡Hola Matthew! Mucho tiempo sin verte. ¿Cómo está tu familia?

Matthew: Mi papá está muy bien. Va a la escuela para aprender inglés. Mi mamá también está bien.  Ella está trabajando mucho. Mi esposa está visitando a su familia en Tejas. Se llevó a los niños.

Eliza: Entonces, ¿te quedaste solito?

Matthew: Solito con las plantas. ¿Como está tu familia?

Eliza: Mi familia esta creciendo. Voy a tener otro bebé.

Matthew: ¡Felicidades!

Eliza: Si. Éramos cinco y ahora somos seis. Me encanta el numero seis.

Welcome to the second unit of the Elementary Spanish guide! Congratulations on your hard work so far. 

In these lessons you will learn how to talk about jobs. Like the last unit &quot;[[../Present_Family/|Family 1]]&quot; the material in this unit will will be in the present tense so it will focus on talking about the job you have today or your conversation partner's job. 

By the end you will be able to talk about basic kinds of jobs and working environments as well as share your opinions about them.

= Lessons = 

Just like the last unit, all of these lessons focus on the same topic but each one is focused on the material you need to talk with different groups of people. You should start with the first lessons, &quot;[[/Talking with each other/|1. Talking with each other]]&quot;, and then proceed to the rest as you have time. The language exchange events will only focus on these &quot;Talking with each other&quot; lessons so no need to worry if you do not have time for the other ones before the next meeting.

* '''[[/Talking with each other/|1. Talking with each other]]'''
* '''[[/Talking with your children/|2. Talking with your children]]'''
* '''[[/Talking with acquaintances/|3. Talking with acquaintances]]'''

      <comment>Alternative syntax to avoid the error</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Exercise
&quot;Select the name and price of all products with a price larger than or equal to $180, and sort first by price (in descending order), and then by name (in ascending order).&quot;

shows an error saying that I can't sort by name. Probably needs different data type

Alternative Syntax that can be used to avoid the error : 

ORDER BY Product.Price DESC, CAST(Product.Name AS nvarchar(50))</text>

Erica: Buenos días. 

Alejandro: ¡Buenos días!

Erica: ¿Qué celebraste cuando estabas creciendo?

Alejandro: Celebrábamos día de los muertos.

Erica: Eso suena espantoso. ¿Es como Halloween?

Alejandro: No. Casi nada tienen similar. Es una manera de celebrar gente en nuestra familia que estabas vivos pero ahora están muertos. La muerte es parte de la vida.

Erica: ¿Usan ropa especial?

Alejandro: Una gente usa ropa tradicional de nuestros antepasados. Las mujeres usan vestidos muy lindos y anchos de muchos colores. La gente le gusta pintar su cara de calaveras.

Erica: Muy interesante.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.68}}

This tutorial will redo the previous [[../../Ray Tracing|Ray Tracing]] lesson, this time using Cycles rendering. Start with a copy of the same document you created last time; we will keep the same geometry, but redo all the materials, and then you can compare the final results to see how the different renderers perform.

Open the ray-tracing document. Switch the renderer [[File:Blender263RendererSelectionMenu.png]] to Cycles. We previously defined two materials: the world background with the “magic” texture, and the glass for the cubes. So we will need to redo these.

For all but the most basic plain diffuse materials, Cycles requires you to use the Node Editor. You should have done the [[../../Nodes|prior introduction]] to this; please review that, if not. Cycles material nodes are not the same as Blender Internal [[../../Material Nodes|material nodes]]; but the basic mechanics of node editing are the same.

== The Magic Sky ==
[[File:Blender268CyclesWorldNotUsingNodes.png|thumb]]
Let’s try fixing the background material first. Go to the World [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]] context in the Properties [[File:Blender269PropertiesIcon.png]] window. It should look something like at right. What happened to all the world settings? Nearly all of them have disappeared!

But see that big “Use Nodes” button? It’s big so that you will find it hard to miss. Click it.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesWorldUsingNodes.png|thumb]]

OK! Now there are a few more settings, but still not much. For all the fun stuff, we must go into the Node Editor.

You probably have a Timeline [[File:Blender269TimelineIcon.png]] window across the bottom of your Blender screen layout. Change the window type to Node Editor [[File:Blender269NodeEditorIcon.png]], and increase its height. (Or add a new window if you don’t already have one, and make it a Node Editor.) In its header, next to the menu titles, you should see a group of 3 icons [[File:Blender268NodeEditorTypeIcons.png]] indicating what type of nodes you want to edit: if you hover over them, from left to right, you should see tooltips identifying them as respectively “shader nodes” (i.e. Cycles materials), “compositing nodes” and “texture nodes”. It is the “shader nodes” we want.

With shader nodes selected, you will see another pair of icons [[File:Blender268NodeEditorShaderTypeIcons.png]] appear immediately to the right of these three: these indicate whether to edit shader nodes for a selected Object, or for the World. It is the World that we want.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268NodeEditorShaderWorldDefault.png|thumb]]
Soon as you select the World shader, the following should appear in the Node Editor window. Note the special “Background” and “World Output” nodes: you must have these in the World shader, but note that “Color” input terminal on the Background node? That’s just itching to have something plugged into it.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268ShaderNodeEditorAddTextureMenu.png|thumb|upright]]
Bring up the menu to add a node, with {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}}. Look for the Texture submenu, which should look like at right. Select the “Magic Texture” item.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268NodeEditorShaderWorld+Magic.png|thumb]]
This will add a new node representing the texture; connect its “Color” output to the “Color” input on the Background node, like at right.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesGlassRender1.png|thumb]]
Now if you hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render, you should see your new magic World background.

{{Clear}}

== Here Comes The Glass ==
Make sure the cubes are selected in the 3D view. Go to the Materials [[File:Blender255MaterialContextButton.png]] context in the Properties window. As before, you will see very few settings, and a big “Use Nodes” button. Click it.

In the Node Editor, remember there are two icons for selecting what type of shader/material nodes to edit, the Object one and the World one? Click the Object one this time.

[[File:Blender268NodeEditorShaderObjectDefault.png|thumb]]
As before, you will see an initial default node setup, like at right.

This time, there is only one node that needs to be present for the node setup to work correctly, and that is the Material Output node. Click with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the node titled “Diffuse BSDF”, and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|DEL}} to get rid of it.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268ShaderNodeEditorAddShaderMenu.png|thumb|upright]]
Now bring up the Add {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}} menu, and this time look for the Shader submenu. We will need three items from here, so add them one at a time:
* A Glossy BSDF to give the shiny surface (note the default Roughness setting in this node is 0.2, set it to zero)
* A Refraction BSDF to give the effect of light refracting through the transparent material, and
* A Mix Shader to combine the two.

Ah, but how do we combine the two? Remember the '''Fresnel factor''' we talked about in the Blender Internal tutorial? Well, in Cycles, there’s a node for that!

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268ShaderNodeEditorAddInputMenu.png|thumb|upright]]
In the Add {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}} menu, bring up the Input submenu. In there, you will see a Fresnel node type. Add one of these. You will see it starts with a default IOR (Index of Refraction) value of 1.45, which is about right for glass.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268NodeEditorShaderObjectGlass.png|thumb]]
Finally, connect together your little collection of nodes like this. See how the Fresnel factor controls the mixing proportion of the Glossy and Refraction shaders? A larger input factor to the Mix shader means a higher proportion of its second (lower) shader input, while a smaller factor gives a higher proportion of its first (upper) shader input. The higher output Fresnel factor corresponds to the regions closer to the edges of the object, where you want more reflection, while the lower value corresponds to the interior regions, where you want more transparency.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesGlassRender2.png|thumb]]
And finally finally, hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to see what the result looks like.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Does it look grainy, and not as clear as this? Increase the number of samples in the Sampling panel in the Render [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]] context, as you learned to do in the [[../Introduction to Cycles|previous tutorial]]. The picture here was done with 500 samples.}}.

{{Clear}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Why not just use the Glass BSDF?''' You might have seen this in the Add Shader menu, above. However, this doesn’t seem to produce the right effect: it seems little different to the Refraction BSDF, without providing much in the way of glossy reflections.}}

== Adjustable Refraction ==
You may have noticed that the above collection of nodes includes ''two'' different fields labelled “IOR”: the one on the Fresnel node, and the one on the Refraction BSDF. The former governs the transition between transparency and reflectivity, while the latter governs the actual refraction through the material. In the real world, the two would always be the same, since they are the same physical quantity.

With the [[w:List_of_refractive_indices|right IOR]], this same node setup can be used to represent other transparent materials. Instead of having to set the value in two places, why not just set it in one?

[[File:Blender268NodeEditorShaderObjectGlass2.png|thumb]]
To do this, add {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}} another node, from the Input submenu, of type Value. This will feed a fixed value that you specify into any number of output terminals. Connect its Value output to the two IOR inputs, on the Fresnel and Refraction BSDF nodes. Here I have set its value to 1.45, which is a suitable value for glass.

== A Reusable Custom Shader ==
What if you wanted to have multiple transparent materials in a document? Would you need to go through all the above setup every single time?

Naturally you wouldn’t. Instead, you can define a custom ''node group'', and insert that into a Node Editor setup wherever you want, as many times as you want.

Start with the node setup as in the previous screen shot. Select {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} the Value node supplying the IOR value, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|DEL}}ete it. Now look at the remaining four nodes, the Fresnel input and the three shader nodes (apart from the material output)? Select these, and only these, in any of the usual ways: press {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} once or twice to deselect everything, then {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the first node and {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|RMB}} on the rest, or drag a {{B3D:N2P/Do|BKEY}}ox selection around the desired nodes.

[[File:Blender268CustomShaderNodeGroup1.png|thumb]]
Now, with these nodes selected, select “Make Group” from the “Node” menu, or use the keyboard shortcut {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|GKEY}}. Also press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}} to bring up the Properties shelf at the right side of the Node Editor window. The result should look like at right. Notice a couple of things:
* The greenish background indicates you are editing a node group, not the entire node setup
* The blocks with yellow headers, labelled “Group Input” and “Group Output”: these define the input and output terminals for the entire node group: inputs to the group appear as outputs on the Group Input block, and outputs from the group appear as inputs to the Group Output block. Any terminals within the group not connected to these will not be visible outside the group.

You can press {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} to switch out of editing the node group and back into editing the entire node setup, where you will see your group appear as a single block entitled “NodeGroup”. Try this if you want to have a look, then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} to get back into editing the group again, because we haven’t finished setting it up yet.

[[File:Blender268CustomShaderNodeGroup2.png|thumb]]
First of all, we need an input to specify the IOR value. Click on the IOR input terminal on the Fresnel node, and drag to the right edge of the Group Input node. Blender should automatically create an output terminal named “IOR” on the Group Input node, with a wire running to the Fresnel IOR input.

[[File:Blender268CustomShaderNodeGroup3.png|thumb]]
Now click on this Group Input IOR terminal, and drag another wire to the IOR input on the Refraction BSDF node.

[[File:Blender268CustomShaderNodeGroup4.png|thumb]]
Glass often has a colour. This colour affects light passing through the material, while glossy reflections remain uncoloured.

To create a colour input terminal for our node group, just drag from the “Color” input terminal on the Refraction BSDF node to the right edge of the Group Input node; as before, Blender will automatically add a new Group Input terminal and connection.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CustomShaderNodeGroupResult.png|thumb]]
Now press {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} to finish editing your custom node group. This will take you back to the overall node setup, with your custom node still selected. Its name will be shown in the Properties panel in the Properties shelf at the right; change this from the default “NodeGroup” to something more meaningful, like “Custom Glass”.

And now you can add back the input Value node you deleted, to supply a value to the IOR terminal. And similarly you can add an RGB node to feed into the glass colour. Or, since each value only needs to feed one input terminal, you can type them directly into the unconnected inputs on your Custom Glass node.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268ShaderNodeEditorAddGroupMenu+CustomGlass.png|thumb]]
And furthermore, your custom node is now present in the Add Group menu, ready for you to insert somewhere else, in this or another node setup.

Note that the node definition itself is not duplicated when you insert another instance of your custom node. Each instance operates on its own separate input values and produces its own corresponding separate output values, but any changes you may subsequently make to the internal definition of the node group will automatically take effect everywhere you’ve already used it.

Many of the references both in the text and in the cited sources are not cataloged properly. These references should: a) connect to a source outside the Wiki universe and use superscript to do so, as no templates or inside references have been created, or b) create the template or inside reference, using valid web links. For example, &quot;Rogers vs. Okin,Template:West&quot; and &quot;Ingraham vs. Wright&quot; are dead links.

Is there some other word for &quot;a collection of encyclopedia articles&quot; that would be less confusing?

[[File:Blender268TextureContext.png|thumb|upright|Material texture settings]]
In the Properties [[File:Blender269PropertiesIcon.png]] window, you will find the Texture [[File:Blender255TextureContextButton.png]] context, which looks like at right.

At the top you will see a row of three icons [[File:Blender268TextureCategoryIcons.png]], which indicate texture settings to view and change:

* [[File:Blender268TextureIconWorld.png]] World Texture — a texture to use for the sky backdrop
* [[File:Blender268TextureIconMaterial.png]] Material Texture — a texture associated with the currently-selected material
* [[File:Blender268TextureIconBrush.png]] Brush Texture — a texture used for some other purpose.

There are two main types of textures in Blender:
* Image/Movie textures
* Procedural textures (all other types in the Type menu).

An image/movie texture allows a two-dimensional image (which might be static or moving) to be wrapped around the surface of a three-dimensional object in some way. Alternatively, a procedural texture directly maps a predefined three-dimensional mathematical function to the surface coordinates of the object.

The “Coordinates:” popup menu defines how positions on the object surface are mapped to positions within the texture coordinate space. All of these options specify automatic mapping algorithms, except one: the “UV” option. This one lets you work within the UV/Image Editor, where you ''unwrap'' the surface of the mesh onto a flat rectangle showing the texture image (this really only works with Image/Movie textures), and then move sections of the mesh around to make them show corresponding parts of the texture.

The “Projection:” popup menu further controls how the two-dimensional surface of the object is mapped to a two-dimensional Image/Movie texture. It seems to have no effect for procedural textures.

The “Offset:” and “Size:” X, Y and Z values allow simple adjustments of the position and scaling of the texture. Note that the size values work the opposite way to what you might expect: larger values here make the texture ''smaller'' along the corresponding dimension.

The image at right shows the common settings panels for all material texture types. Additional panels will appear depending on the chosen texture type; the settings shown are for the “None” texture, which is the same as having no texture at all.

A material may have more than one texture associated with it. At the top of the material texture settings (see above), is a list of the ''texture slots'' associated with the material. Slots may be empty (unused), and slots containing a texture may be enabled or disabled, by checking or unchecking the box at the right of the list item. Disabling a texture slot stops it having an effect on the material, which is the same as deleting the texture from the slot altogether, except it is easier to revert. This can be useful when trying to debug the effect of a combination of textures on the material.

== World Textures ==
[[File:Blender268TextureContextWorld.png|thumb|upright]]
World texture settings look similar to material settings: again there are a number of slots, and there are mapping and influence options. But the mapping coordinates types are different (and there is no UV option), and the influence types are more limited.

==Summary==
'''&lt;p&gt;Although most of the time the styles of a web-page's author would suffice, the Opera browser has long provided facilities for its users to modify the appearance of the page, and all recent Opera versions allow ''user style-sheets''.&lt;/p&gt;'''

'''&lt;p&gt;In fact, the local ''user'' can provide ''several'' style-sheets, one for ''general'' use that affects ''every'' page, and others that are used instead when ''specific'' pages are opened.   The browser also has a number of ''built-in style sheets'' to improve viewing for the visually impaired and for testing.&lt;/p&gt;'''

'''&lt;p&gt;Changed styles are perhaps best regarded for making a page easier to read, but the study of the CSS cascade itself requires an ability in styles adjustment.   Another more obvious use is the design of a web-page, where endless testing is the rule as opposed to the exception.&lt;/p&gt;'''

'''&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, those interested in studying CSS styles need not purchase expensive program packages. Whereas such programs have advantages for those seeking quick results the web itself is the best source of examples, and can be studied at any time.   With the introduction of web-developer software to browsers all of the necessary features are already available.&lt;/p&gt;'''

'''''&lt;p&gt;This page explains how to configure the style settings of the Opera 12.16 browser for its main areas of use, and provides some sample text files and tutorials to assist in their study.&lt;/p&gt;'''''
&lt;br&gt;

==Modes Overview==
'''The ''Style Options'' settings select the style ''sources'' that will participate in the browser's CSS cascade.'''   The settings can be switched between either of two complete sets of selections called ''Presentation Modes'', or just ''modes''.

'''There are ''two main modes'' of working, named the ''Author Mode'' and the ''User Mode''''', and these can be selected within the main menus of the browser.   These names for the modes are necessary to identify them but are in fact poorly chosen, as will be explained later.   Specifically, modes are ''switched'' in the browser's ''View / Style'' menu.   However, the ''default'' mode selection, the one that applies after every start or restart, is made within the browser's ''preferences'' with ''View / Style / Manage Modes... / Presentation Modes / Default Mode.''   Switching via the ''View / Style'' menu does not require a restart, while any change to the default selection always does.

'''Each of the modes is represented by a column of detailed selections''' of its own in the browser's preferences at ''View / Style / Manage Modes... / Presentation Modes''.   If ''identical'' selections were to be made in each of these columns then both modes would include the same features for the cascade;   that is to say they ''both can do the same thing''.   To further labor the point, the so-called ''Author mode'' could just as easily be set up to contain only ''user'' features and vice versa.  

'''However, it is perhaps as well to honor the fixed names of these modes''', until such time as Opera allows them to be chosen by the user.   By making ''different'' selections in these columns, two completely different configurations can exist, and can be applied by simply switching modes.   For example, it would be possible to set the default to ''Author Mode'', and its associated column with a single selection of ''Page Style Sheet'', (Opera code for ''all of the author styles'').   The other column, for the ''User Mode'' might have two selections, ''Page Style Sheet'' and ''My Style Sheet'', (Opera code for ''the entire set of user sheets'').   In this way the modes could be easily switched from ''normal browsing'' to ''normal browsing plus user styles''.   

'''The user ranks are formed from three separate sources'''.   These are Opera's ''Built-in'' style-sheets, the ''User'' style-sheet ''user.css'', and any of a set of selectively used ''Site-specific'' style-sheets.   Depending upon which of these is installed or selected at any one time, ''any one or all of them'' might be merged in the browser's styles cascade at the user levels.              
&lt;br&gt;

==Terminology==
The generally accepted terminology that is used within the subject has no doubt evolved in its use, but has been largely delivered by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).   It is of interest here only because it needs to be distinguished in meaning from some of the terminology used in the settings of the Opera browser.

===CSS Common Parlance===
These are a few of the commonly accepted meanings:
*'''Style-sheet''':   A text file that contains styles for a web-page.   It is distinguished from other text files by its ''.css'' suffix. 
*'''Style Sources''':   Locations of styles such as ''author styles'', ''user styles'', and the browser's own ''client styles''.   It is also used to describe any sub-sets of these three, such as ''head styles'', ''in-line styles'' etc. 
*'''User Agent (UA) Style Sheet''':   Styles in the browser's own style-sheet, or its equivalent. 
*'''The User Styles''':   Styles written into a local style-sheet held on the user's computer.
*'''The Author Styles''': Styles from the author's linked style-sheets, the document head styles, and any in-line styles. 
*'''Inheritance''': Propagation of styles to a child element from a parent element when it has no such styles of its own.
*'''Initial Values''': CSS Property values used as defaults when all other styles acquisition has failed.

===Opera-specific Terminology===
The meanings below are far from intuitive, bearing in mind the complexity of the cascade, so it is important to understand them.   Within the ''Presentation Modes'' dialog these terms mean: 
*''''''Page Style Sheet'''''' : This means ''The Author Styles''. That is styles from the following ''sources'':
**'''The author's linked style-sheets''', and
**'''The document head styles''', and
**'''Document in-line styles.        
*''''''My Style Sheet'''''' :   This means any or all of the ''sources'', (set of user style-sheets) that comprise:
**'''The local user style-sheet ''user.css''''', and
**'''Site-specific local style-sheets''', and
**'''Opera's built-in style-sheets'''
*''''''Author Mode'''''': A mode label of convenience.  It refers to one of two identical columns of selections that can be set  to include any or all of the style sources for the cascade.   It need not in fact pertain only to ''author styles.''
*''''''User Mode'''''': A mode label of convenience.  It refers to one of two identical columns of selections that can be set  to include any or all of the style sources for the cascade.   It need not in fact pertain only to ''user styles.''

===CSS2 Style Importance Ranks===
The browser's presentation modes can be set to allow the full cascade or some filtered version where some importance ranks are excluded, and the sections below ([[Style_Presentation_Modes_in_Opera_12.16#Mode_Selections_in_Detail|'''Mode Selections in Detail''']]) itemize these inclusions and exclusions for the various settings so that there is no ambiguity.   The cascade rankings in Table 1 are those for CSS Level 2, though their number is set to increase in Level 3. 

Style declarations can have a special marking to give them added priority over ''normal'' declarations and they use the ''!Important'' keyword to identify them.   They are called ''Important'' declarations.    In sorting its lists the browser segregates the ''important'' declarations from any ''normal'' declarations.   The browser then recognizes the five ''Importance Ranks'', or ''Importance Layers'', of Table 1, where ''rank 1'' has the lowest importance and ''rank 5'' has the highest.        
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;table border=0 align=left cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5px style=&quot;background:transparent;layout:automatic;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;'''Table 1:   Cascade Importance Ranks for CSS Level 2'''&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width:50px;&quot;&gt;'''rank 1'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;&quot;&gt;'''The Browser default styles'''&lt;br&gt;Styles listed in the  User Agent (UA) Style Sheet, or some equivalent implementation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''rank 2'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''The User Normal Style Declarations'''&lt;br&gt;Those in the ''user'' style-sheet ''&lt;u&gt;without&lt;/u&gt;'' an !Important marking. Normal declarations from any active ''site-specific'' and ''built-in'' style-sheets are also merged here.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''rank 3'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''The Author Normal Style Declarations'''&lt;br&gt;Those in the ''author's'' set ''&lt;u&gt;without&lt;/u&gt;'' an !Important marking.&lt;br&gt;They comprise styles from the document head, linked style-sheets, and in-line styles.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''rank 4'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''The Author !Important Style Declarations'''&lt;br&gt;Those in the ''author's'' set ''&lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt;'' an !Important marking.&lt;br&gt;They comprise styles from the document head, linked style-sheets, and in-line styles.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''rank 5'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''The User !Important Style Declarations'''&lt;br&gt;Those in the ''user'' style-sheet ''&lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt;'' an !Important marking.&lt;br&gt;!Important declarations from ''site-specific'' and ''built-in'' style-sheets are also merged here.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br clear=both&gt;

Browsers resolve the styles for a page tag by tag.  In establishing which of several competing property values is to be selected for an HTML tag, browsers first sort all of the relevant styles by their property names.   Then within any similar properties, they are sorted according to their ''importance ranks''.   If the matter is still not resolved, they are further sorted for their ''specificity''.   If after all of this they still are matched in priority, they are selected according to their ''source order''; that is to say, the one that is encountered last by the browser is selected.   Refer to [[The_CSS_Cascade|'''The CSS Cascade''']] for further details and a detailed example of the process.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==The Main Setting Scenarios==
Although there are many possible scenarios in which Opera's presentation modes might need to be set, they fall into four main categories:
*'''The default behavior of the browser''':   All author and user CSS styles are excluded from the cascade.   In this setting the browser's default style-sheet applies and very little else.   It is maintly of interest for those who need reassurance as to the content of the default style-sheet or the priorities of the preference settings. 
*'''The author-styles-only configuration'''.   All ''user styles are excluded'' from the cascade.   This is the main browsing setting for Opera, and includes all of the author's linked, head, and in-line styles.  
*'''The user-styles-only configuration'''.   All ''author styles are excluded'' from the cascade.   In this mode only the set of ''user'' sheets can apply.   This mode allows good separation from all author styles, and finds use in testing and user style-sheet design.
*'''The combined author-user configuration'''.   ''All style sources are cascaded''.   This is the mode to study the full interaction of styles in the CSS cascade.   In particular, it is needed to confirm the correct switching of site-specific style-sheets and the importance rank effects of an ''user.css'' style-sheet.      

The settings are simple to make but for those who are unfamiliar with them, they are explained in  [[Style_Presentation_Modes_in_Opera_12.16#Detailed_Style_Mode_Settings|'''Detailed Style Mode Settings''']].   Some notes are provided to help install style-sheets at [[Style_Presentation_Modes_in_Opera_12.16#Installing_User_Style-sheets|'''Installing User Style-sheets''']]. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Choosing Style Modes==
===Quick Presentation Mode Settings===   
For a quick setup of ''Presentation Modes'' and styles, the following is recommended:
*'''Default Style Mode Setting''':   Select ''Author Mode''.   The browser will always start in this mode for normal web browsing.
*'''Author Mode column''':   Select only ''Page Style Sheet'', the best mode for normal web-browsing.
*'''User Mode column ''':   Select only ''Page Style Sheet'' and ''My Style Sheet'', the best combination for full-cascade working.   You will need to install a suitable ''user.css'' style sheet to take full advantage of this setting, though it could be installed as an empty style-sheet and added-to later.
With these recommended settings the casual user can easily switch between them using the ''View / Style'' menu choices.   For those who need more assurance, the sections below itemize the inclusions and exclusions in detail for each selection.     

'''The ''Presentation Modes'' dialog can be accessed in ''Tools / Preferences / Advanced / Content / Style Options / Presentation Modes'', or via the ''View / Style / Manage Modes... / Presentation Modes'' menu selections.'''

===Opera's Style Mode Gotchas===
There is good deal of blurred or downright misleading terminology used in Opera's own help pages, and some facilities touted by the browser itself would seem to be inoperable.   Although it is fair to say that all of its ''main'' features work well, these clarifications may help:
*''''''My style sheet'''''' means the user style-sheet made by the computer user, and any site-specific variants.   Perhaps more surprisingly, it also includes any or all of Opera's ''built-in'' style-sheets.   The reason is that all of these are logically merged into one ''user style-sheet'' for the cascade.
*''''''Only ONE user.css'''''' should exist.   If more than one ''user.css'' file exists, even in different folders, styles confusion will result at some stage.   Use ''site-specific'' style-sheets rather than several ''user.css'' files.   This author is convinced that there is still more to understand on this point, but that the restriction described here will control the matter.   Knowledgeable persons are invited to modify this understanding accordingly.
*''''''The @Import rule'''''' that allows an author style-sheet to itself import more style-sheets should not be used in any sheet within the ''user'' set, though of course it can form the heading of any author's sheet.  
*''''''Page style sheet'''''' means the entire author styles source; the in-line styles, the head styles, and the imported style sheets, and not just the style-block in the document head section.        
*''''''User mode' versus 'Author mode'''''' has little or no meaning since at present identical style cascades can be created with each.   That is to say, although the mode descriptions in the sections below have used the ''Author mode'', making the same selections in ''User mode'' will do exactly the same thing.   The duplication of these selections seems at first sight to be fairly redundant, but it allows fast switching between any two mode constructions.
*'''''Fast presentation mode switching''''' allows the user to have a different set of selections in each of the ''Author'' and ''User'' modes and a fast change from one to the other.  The best way to change these modes is to use Opera's ''View / Style'' menu, since it requires no browser cache-clearing or re-start.   The mode choice in the ''Presentation modes'' dialog could also be used but it is a default setting and would need a restart.  However, for long sessions and to avoid confusion it is more convenient to change the default setting to the one that is of most interest.
*'''''Redundant modes?'''''   Both of the ''Page fonts and colors'' and the ''My fonts and colors'' have defied understanding.   Until more information becomes available to the contrary, it might be best to leave these modes unchecked.   ''My link style'' is intended to change link colors to the settings in ''Tools / Preferences... / Webpages'', but it has been found to be inoperative in recent tests.  
*''''''Site-specific style-sheets'.''''' The site specific style-sheets (any number) are just substitutes for the ''user.css'' style-sheet, and the choice between the two is made automatically whenever the special site is accessed.   They  work only in a mode where the ''My style sheet'' is selected.
*'''''Site-specific style-sheet installation uses the ''right-click'' method'''''.  The method is as follows: With the Opera browser displaying the site for the intended site-specific style-sheet, right-click and select ''Edit Site Preferences...''.   This adds the current site and selects it for edit.   Select ''Display'' then add the path to the css file for the specific site.  Press ''OK'' and reload the site if necessary to see the effect.  There is no way to ''switch off'' the general use of site-specific style-sheets, though the list of those sites so installed are found at ''Preferences / Content / Advanced / Manage Site Preferences...''.   Using this list instead of the right-click method to ''add'' style-sheets has proved troublesome.  
*'''''Opera's 'built-in style-sheets'''''' can be applied in any presentation mode that allows the cascading of ''user style-sheets'', that is, any mode with a ''My style sheet'' box ticked.   In this event they are merged at the user style-sheet level, most often with an !important marking.  
&lt;br&gt;

===Detailed Style Mode Settings===
{{dropimage|hbgc=beige|cbgc=beige|width=600px|ff=tahoma|cp=3em|background=transparent|align=center|Detailed Style Mode Settings- Opera 12.16|
2=&lt;br&gt;
This section will explain briefly how to set the browser's presentation modes for the four main areas of use.   These are:
*'''The default behavior of the browser''':   All author and user CSS styles are excluded from the cascade. 
*'''The author-styles-only configuration'''.   All user styles are excluded from the cascade.
*'''The user-styles-only configuration'''.   All author styles are excluded from the cascade.
*'''The combined author-user configuration'''.   All five importance ranks are included in the cascade.

'''The ''Presentation Modes'' dialog can be accessed in ''Tools / Preferences / Advanced / Content / Style Options / Presentation Modes'', or via the ''View / Style / Manage Modes... / Presentation Modes'' menu selections.'''
&lt;br&gt;

{{hiddenh2|The Default Behavior of the Opera Browser}}&lt;br&gt;
[[image:default mode clip.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1.   The settings to study the default browser style behavior in Opera.   Notice that all of the boxes are de-selected.]]&lt;br&gt;

To study default behavior, all of the applied user and author styles must be excluded.   Figure 1 shows the settings for this configuration.   

{{hiddenh4|Excluded}}
In this configuration, very few styles are applied; specifically ''excluded'' are:
*'''The set of all user style-sheets, i.e:'''
**The user stylesheet ''user.css''
**Site-specific style-sheets
**Opera's built-in style-sheets
*'''The author's downloaded style-sheets'''
*'''The author's document head styles'''
*'''The author's in-line CSS styles''' 

{{hiddenh4|Included}}
These are ''included'':
*'''The browser's default style-sheet'''
*'''The author's in-line HTML attributes'''
and in addition, at all times and in every configuration:

'''The Opera browser applies limited font settings''' from the ''Preferences/ Advanced / Fonts'' dialog as if they had been merged with the appropriate selectors of the browser's default style-sheet. The detailed font families and font-sizes are applied, for example, correctly sized main body font, headings, pre tags, etc., but the properties for each font seem limited to:    
*'''font-family'''
*'''font-size/line-height'''

The font item shown in ''Preferences/ Webpages'' is just an extract of this set so it could be said also to apply.   The user's choice of link colors are not applied, but this feature can be selected independently.   Notice that apart from various text boxes, the default browser style-sheet does not contain font declarations for the body of the document, these being supplied by the preference settings.
&lt;br clear=right&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh2|The Author-styles-only Configuration}}&lt;br&gt;
[[image:author mode clip.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2.   The presentation mode settings to allow only author styles.   Notice that only the top box , ''Page style sheet'', has been ticked.   Additionally, on the underlying dialog, the ''author mode'' should be selected.]]&lt;br&gt;
This configuration specifically excludes the user style-sheet, but allows all of the features introduced by the web-author.  Figure 2 shows the settings for this configuration. It is used also to remove the user style-sheet at times when it intrudes, and allows normal browsing of both local and external web-pages.   The list item's name might well be responsible for the confusion that surrounds these settings;  the term ''Page style sheet'' seems to imply a reference to the internal sheet's styles in the head of the document, but as shown below, it applies to ''all'' of the author's styles. 

{{hiddenh4|Excluded}}
The following are excluded:
*'''The set of all user style-sheets, i.e:'''
**The user style-sheet ''user.css''
**Site-specific style-sheets
**Opera's built-in style-sheets

{{hiddenh4|Included}}
These are ''included'':
*'''The author's in-line HTML attributes'''
*'''The author's in-line CSS styles''' 
*'''The author's downloaded style-sheets'''
*'''The author's document head styles'''
*'''The browser's default style-sheet'''
&lt;br clear=right&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh2|The User-styles-only Configuration}}&lt;br&gt;
[[image:user mode clip.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Figure 3.   The presentation mode settings to allow only the user style-sheets (note plural).   Notice that only the middle box , ''My style sheet'', has been ticked.   Additionally, on the underlying dialog, the ''author mode'' should be selected.]]&lt;br&gt;

This configuration is useful for testing a user style-sheet made by the PC user, and for studying or modifying the formats produced by the built-in set of Opera style-sheets.   It is not usually the choice for normal browsing since it is likely to produce too complex a format.

This  configuration excludes all of the author styles, and applies only the user style-sheets.  Here the term ''user style-sheets'' includes any installed user style-sheet, and any built-in style-sheet selections from the list on the browser's menu ''View / Style''.   The user style-sheet is not physically changed but rather a logical merging of these two takes place, acting in the cascade as if selections from the built-in set were added to the ''end'' of the user style-sheet.   It is assumed, but at present unclear as to whether or not the sequence of these built-in style-sheets is maintained in their listing.

Figure 3 shows the settings for this configuration.

{{hiddenh4|Excluded}}
These are ''excluded'':
*'''The author's in-line CSS styles''' 
*'''The author's downloaded style-sheets'''
*'''The author's document head styles'''

{{hiddenh4|Included}}
These are included:
*'''The set of all user style-sheets, i.e:'''
**The user style-sheet ''user.css''
**Site-specific style-sheets
**Opera's built-in style-sheets
*'''The author's in-line HTML attributes'''
*'''The browser's default style-sheet'''
&lt;br clear=right&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh2|The Combined Author-user Configuration}}&lt;br&gt;
[[image:full cascade mode clip.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Figure 4:   The presentation mode settings to allow for full five-level cascade behavior.  Notice that only the first and middle boxes, the ''Page style sheet'' and ''My style sheet'' boxes, have been ticked.   Additionally, on the underlying dialog, the ''author mode'' should be selected.]]&lt;br&gt;

This configuration allows the best opportunity for study of the full cascade behavior.    The combination of these two settings permits the inclusion of all five of the importance ranks, as well as the introduction of the browser's built-in styles.

Figure 4 shows the settings for this configuration.
{{hiddenh4|Excluded}}
There are no style sources excluded provided that they exist.

{{hiddenh4|Included}}
These are ''included'':
*'''The author's in-line HTML attributes'''
*'''The author's in-line CSS styles''' 
*'''The author's downloaded style-sheets'''
*'''The author's document head styles'''
*'''The browser's default style-sheet'''
*'''The set of all user style-sheets, i.e:'''
**The user style-sheet ''user.css''
**Site-specific style-sheets
**Opera's built-in style-sheets
&lt;br clear=right&gt;


{{hiddenh2|Site-specific Style-sheet Modes}}

There is no separate mode for site-specific style-sheet use since it is just a part of the user set.   When the ''My style sheet'' selection is made, then all three of the following sheets are active provided that they are installed, and in the case of the built-in sheets, provided that they are selected.   The user style-sheet set is comprised of:
*The user style-sheet ''user.css''
*Site-specific style-sheets
*Opera's built-in style-sheets
The ''site-specific'' style-sheet is best thought of as an automatically applied substitute for the ''user style-sheet''. When a site previously identified to the browser is opened, the prevailing ''user.css'' style-sheet is replaced by the specific sheet. When the site is changed to one without specifics the user.css style-sheet is used again.

It is true to say that an installed ''site-specific'' style-sheet will never be cascaded with a standard ''user sheet'', because these two are alternatives to one another, but that a selection from the built-in set could become cascaded with either of these.  Whereas separating the built-in set involves just a de-selection, doing so for the other two without the need for eventual re-installation becomes awkward.   The solution may be to leave both in place and to comment out the styles rather that removing the sheets themselves.

The site-specific style-sheet will work automatically in any mode where the ''user'' style-sheet can work, namely whenever the ''My style sheet'' presentation mode setting is chosen, regardless of whether in an Author or User setting.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh2|Other Presentation Modes}}
&lt;p&gt;The function of some remaining modes has been elusive.   Both of the ''My fonts and colors'' and the ''Page fonts and colors'' modes seem to do nothing at all.  In fact, they resemble the default behavior, so they might well be redundant features.   The ''My link style'' mode allows the user to select colors for the hyperlinks on all web-pages, so might cause confusion when building style-sheets.   It has been de-selected in these notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Installing User Style-sheets==
{{dropimage|hbgc=beige|cbgc=beige|width=600px|ff=tahoma|fs=1em|cp=3em|background=transparent|align=center|Installing User Style-sheets-Opera 12.16|
2={{hiddenh2|General Background Points}}
'''''These introductory points explain and distinguish between the three user style-sheet types within the user set'''''.

'''There are ''two'' kinds of ''user style-sheets'' ''' that can be applied;   the first is the kind that is applied for all sites in general, and called ''user.css'', and there is only one of these; the second is a set of site-specific style-sheets, each of which is applied to a particular site.   Site specific sheets can have any reasonable name with a css suffix, ''except user.css''.   The site-specific sheet will be automatically applied instead of ''user.css'', in any situation where ''My style sheet'' has been selected in the ''Presentation Modes''.   Sections have been provided below to explain the installation of both of these style-sheets, but the reader should refer to details elsewhere in the main page for the use of the various presentation modes.

There is another set of style-sheets built into the Opera browser.   These are listed via the ''View / Style'' menu, and those that are selected are merged with user style-sheets.   This can happen in any mode where user style-sheets can function.

The installation of each of the three kinds of user style-sheet is explained in the sections below.        
&lt;p style=&quot;width:700px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

{{hiddenh3|Make a Blank ''user.css'' Style-sheet}}
*Open Notepad, the Windows accessory.
*Open the save-as dialog.
*Ensure that the save directory is your documents folder.
*Change the ''Save-as type:'' selector to All Files (*.*).
*Enter the file name as ''user.css'', making sure that any ''txt'' suffix is removed.
*Press Save.
The ''user.css'' file need not have any styles in it before installation.   Styles can be added by editing the file in Notepad at any future time.
{{hiddenh2|Installing the User Style-sheet ''user.css''}}&lt;p&gt;The Opera browser can be set to merge the Author and User styles in accordance with the full use of the CSS cascade, or it can be set for author styles only, user styles only, or no styles at all.   These settings are made in the browser's  ''Presentation Modes'' section, and a drop-box tutorial has been enclosed on the main page to explain exactly what each selection does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make use of and study the full five-rank cascade, a user style-sheet needs to be added to the browser.  This section explains how to install the user style-sheet and at the same time sets the mode for the possible merging of all five style sources.   The configuration does not distinguish between local web pages and external ones, so this setup is ideal for both local study and the style modification of pages made by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This screen is obtained by selecting the ''Advanced'' tab then the ''Content'' menu item.   Selection of ''Style Options'' on this screen will open a dialog to enter the path to your User Style-sheet. (See Figure 2.)&lt;/span&gt;]]

Enter the full path to ''user.css'', your User Style-sheet, in the ''My style sheet'' text box, or use the ''Choose'' button to search for the file.  The other tick-boxes on the form need not be of concern at this time.    Without hitting the ''OK'' button select ''Presentation Modes'.   (See Figure 3.)&lt;/span&gt;]]

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


{{hiddenh2|Installing Site-specific Style-sheets}}
A site-specific style-sheet is best thought of as an automatically applied substitute for the ''user'' style-sheet ''user.css''.   When a site previously identified to the browser is opened, the prevailing ''user.css'' style-sheet is replaced by the specific sheet.   When the site is changed to one ''without'' specifics the ''user.css'' style-sheet is used again.

That is not to say that the specific sheet takes over ''all'' formatting on its own, but that it is ''cascaded'' in the usual way.   It is true to say that an installed ''site-specific style-sheet'' will work in any mode where the ''user style-sheet'' can work, namely whenever the ''My style sheet'' presentation mode setting is chosen, regardless of whether in an ''Author'' or ''User'' setting.

There are issues in trying to install a site-specific style-sheet in Opera, but there is a way that works.   It has been found that the only working method is to use the ''right-click'' menu while the site in question is already displayed on the screen.   The procedure is:
*'''''Make sure that the ''user.css'' style-sheet is installed''''' for the ''general'' case, whether or not it has any styles in it.   If there is no such sheet then install one in accordance with the instructions elsewhere on the main page, and make sure that presentation mode in use has ''My style sheet'' selected.   Make another style-sheet (with a different name) for your specific site.  ''This'' sheet can have any reasonable name with a css suffix.
*'''''Display the page intended for site-specific styles'''''
*'''''Right click the chosen page'''''. Select ''Edit Site Preferences...'' then ''Display''.   This reveals the ''My style sheet'' address box.   At this time the dialog applies only to the displayed site.
*'''''Enter the path to the intended style-sheet''''' for that site, or find it by browsing.   
*'''''Press ''OK'' to exit the dialog'''''.
*'''''Reload the site to see the effect''''', and confirm that it is specific by selecting another site to see its unmodified styles.      

The site-specific style-sheets will operate whenever there is a setting that allows the ''user.css'' style sheet to participate in the cascade, and the switching process will be automatic.   Any number of different site-specific style-sheets can be made and for any number of sites.  
If confusion is to be avoided, it is important to recall that the user set of style-sheets can be quite large.

The user style-sheet set is comprised of:
*'''The user style-sheet ''user.css'''''. There is only one of these, possibly applied to every site.
*'''Site-specific style-sheets'''.   There could be any number of these, but applied only to specific sites. 
*'''Opera's built-in style-sheets'''.   About sixteen of these are selectable, and they apply to every site.  
In general, style-sheets can be installed without having any styles in them at all, so the ''user.css'' sheet could well be empty when a site-specific test is in progress.   The use of comment markings in style-sheets is useful for the temporary removal of styles that cause confusion.

'''To remove a site-specific style-sheet''':
*Right click the page while it is open and select ''Edit Site Preferences...''.
*Choose ''Display'' and delete any file path in the ''My style sheet'' text box.
*Press OK to remove the site-specific style-sheet.
In the event that the styles matter is still not resolved by its removal, the user should recall that there there might be a ''user.css'' style-sheet and ''built-in'' style-sheets under the the ''user'' category.   Also, if more that one ''user.css'' sheet exists, there might be further confusion.   

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh2|Installing the Built-in Style-sheets}}
This group is perhaps the simplest to install and remove.   The built-in style sheets will be added to the user set when they are selected in Opera's ''View / Style'' menu, and they are removed individually or collectively by their de-selection.    For these and any member of the user set to apply, the ''My style sheet'' box must be ticked in whichever mode is in use.

Because settings made in either of the ''Presentation Mode'' columns will produce identical results, one column could be set up for normal work and another to include the user set.   However, because selecting ''User Mode'' will also include any ''User.css'' and ''site=specific style-sheets'', care is needed to ensure that their inclusion is intended. 

Note that when the user mode is selected via the main browser menus, all of the selections in the ''User Mode'' column of the ''Presentation Modes'' will be applied.  In fact, making the mode selection via the menus allows switching between the two modes without any need for a browser restart, whereas the similar mode switch in the ''Presentation Modes'' is a default setting, and will re-establish its selection at each re-start.   

 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh2|Removing the Various User Style-sheets}}
&lt;p&gt;To remove the user style-sheet temporarily or otherwise, de-select the ''My style sheet'' box in the author column of ''Presentation Modes'', then select ''OK'' at each dialog until you are out of the browser preferences.   Note that when changes to the preferences ''other than'' the user style-sheet are made, it will be necessary to close the browser and reload the page before the changes can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, because the de-selection of the ''My style sheet'' presentation mode will also prevent the use of built-in style-sheets and site-specific style-sheets, it might be as well to consider the use of comment markings within the user style-sheets for the temporary 'removal' of styles.   In this way the one can be removed without affecting the other.   The built-in style-sheets are more easily de-selected in the ''View / Style'' menu settings.

==Sample Files for CSS Study==
This section provides a sample ''web-document'' and its linked ''author style-sheet'' for testing table styles.   At least, the text of each is given and it remains for the user to copy their contents into files of his own.   The texts described are found in the drop-boxes below, identified as ''tables.css''  and ''table styles.htm'', and making use of these files should save some time for those who have only a passing interest in the subject.

{{hiddenh2|Make Files for Testing}}
{{hiddenh3|Make the ''table styles.htm'' File}}
*Open Notepad, the Windows accessory.
*Copy all of the text in the ''table syles'' drop-box to the clipboard.
*Paste the contents into Notepad.
*Open the save-as dialog.
*Ensure that the save directory is your documents folder.
*Change the ''Save-as type:'' selector to All Files (*.*).
*Enter the file name as ''table styles.htm'', making sure that the ''txt'' suffix is removed.
*Press Save.
The ''htm'' file is made.

{{hiddenh3|Make the ''tables.css'' File}}
Use the same method as above, with the exceptions;
*Copy the contents of the ''tables.css'' drop-box into a new Notepad file. 
*Save the file as ''tables.css'', in the same folder as ''table styles.htm''.
These two files can now be used to study the effect of the style-sheet on the web document.   Note that any number of such  style-sheets could be referenced in the head section of the web-document, each with a separate ''link-tag'' entry. 

{{hiddenh3|Make a ''user.css'' File}}
Additionally, a ''user style-sheet'' could be made in the same way as for the ''tables.css'' example.   If this is done, then it must be named as ''user.css''.   It need not initially contain any styles, and can be installed in accordance with the instructions in the drop-box labelled ''Installing User Style-sheets-Opera 12.16''.   User styles can be added to it in Notepad at any later stage.

{{hiddenh2|Open and Edit the Files}}
First of all these points should be noted; 
{{hiddenh4|Saving and Caching}}
*In general, an edited style sheet must always be ''saved'' before it can be applied to a page.
*In general, an edited web-document must always be ''saved and reloaded'' before it can be viewed with its changes.  To reload:
**Press the ''reload'' button on the Opera tool-bar.  If not displayed, the tool-bars can be configured with ''View / Toolbars / Customize...''
**Alternatively, press the ''Apply Changes'' button while on the ''Source'' window. 
**Re-open the web-page in the browser.
*Developer utilities such as Opera's ''Source'' editor and Opera Dragonfly also allow ''temporary'' changes in a document to be viewed ''without'' saving.
*At times the browser cache needs ''cleared'' before changes are seen.   Choose any of these access methods:
**''Tools / Delete Private Data...''.   Clear all items except ''Delete entire cache'', then press ''OK''. 
**''Tools / Preferences / Advanced / History''.  Press ''Empty Now'', then ''Press OK''.
**''Tools / Preferences / Advanced / History''. Set the ''Empty on exit'' tick box, and restart the browser.
*When Opera's ''preferences'' are changed, a browser re-start is usually needed.

All that is needed now to display the off-line web-page is to open the ''htm'' file in Opera.   Because the author style-sheet ''tables.css'' is referenced in the head section of the document, it will be used to format the page.

{{hiddenh4|To Open the Web-page}}
This can be done as follows:
*In the relevant documents folder, ''right-click'' the ''htm'' file, then select ''Open with... / Opera Internet Browser''. 
*Alternatively, set Opera as the default program for this file type.  To do so, right-click the page, then ''Open with.../ Choose default program...''.
*The web-page could also be set to open with a bookmark or a panel on ''speed Dial''.

{{hiddenh4|To Edit the Web-document}}
Since the ''htm'' file is just a text file it can be edited directly within Notepad.   To do so, right-click the file in the documents folder then ''Open with... / Notepad''.  If it is done in this way the file needs to be saved before being opened again or re-loaded in the browser.   However, there are some advantages to working on the file while it is open in Opera.   For one thing, the effect of changes can be seen immediately, and the file need not be saved unless the effect is right.
To edit the web-document in Opera proceed as follows:
*Open the web-page, then ''right-click'' the page.   Select ''Source''.
*Make any modifications to the text in the editing window that opens.
*When the changes are made, press the ''Source'' window's tool-bar button ''Apply Changes''.
*Select the tab for the main page to see the effect of the changes.
*To save the changes permanently, press ''Save'' in the ''Source'' tab.

{{hiddenh4|To Edit the Style-sheet}}
Like the ''htm'' file, the ''css'' file is just a text file and can be edited directly in Notepad.
This can be done as follows:
*In the relevant documents folder, ''right-click'' the ''css'' file, then select ''Open with... / Notepad''. 
*If it is not already consider making Notepad the default program for 'css'' files.
*After making changes, save the file, and for convenience, minimize it to the task-bar.
*Reload the web-page to see the result.   Any of the following methods could be used to do this:
**Press the ''reload'' button on the Opera tool-bar.  If not displayed, the address tool-bar can be customized to include it.
**Alternatively, press the ''Apply Changes'' button while on the ''Source'' window, then select the main page tab.
**Re-open the web-page in the browser.

==Opera Dragonfly==
[[image:Dargonfly2.png|thumb|right|400px|Figure 1:   The main parts of the Opera Dragonfly display, with markings for the buttons mentioned in these notes.]]
The ''Opera Dragonfly'' utility is a part of the Opera browser.   It allows the user to study the styles used for any web-page, and can make interactive style changes to the local copy.   It occupies a part of the screen along with the web-page under study.

A full description of the utility is not possible here, but for those seeking more information, refer to the Opera page [http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/documentation/ '''Opera Dragonfly Documentation'''].    Some of its facilities are listed in the sub-sections below.  

===Open Dragonfly===
There are two methods that can be used to open the program:  
*'''From the Opera drop menus'''; proceed to ''Tools / Advanced / Opera Dragonfly''.  
*'''By right-clicking a part of any web-page'''; then selecting ''Inspect Element'' from the right-click menu opens Dragonfly with the element  highlighted in document code and all of its relevant styles displayed in a separate panel.
Note that when the web-page is changed, Dragonfly must be restarted to purge the data of the previous site.

===Initial Settings===
The ''general'' settings for Dragonfly's use are accessed from the ''right-hand button menu''.   The ''facilities in use'' however, are chosen using the buttons on the ''left side of the window''.   The following mode settings are recommended for the study of styles, and are assumed for the majority of the points that follow:  With Dragonfly open:
*Select ''Documents'' in the main button menu.
*Choose ''Select an element on the page to inspect it'' from the ''Documents'' sub-menu.
*Choose ''Highlight selected element'' from the ''Documents'' sub-menu.
*Choose ''Expand the DOM tree'' from the ''Documents'' sub-menu.
*Select the ''Styles'' tab in the right-hand panel.

===Viewing Documents===
*'''To view the HTML web-document and its relevant style-sheets'''.
**'''To view the HTML code of the web-page:'''   If it is not already selected, choose ''Documents'' from Dragonfly's main  buttons menu.  The code of the document appears in the left-hand panel, with a choice of layouts determined by the chosen buttons.   Then, ''single-clicking'' an element of the document will select it.   When this is done, the web-page will be highlighted for that element and the relevant selector is shifted to the top of the styles display.
**'''To view the style-sheets and scrips in use:'''  When styles are displayed in the right-hand panel, the source of each style-block is shown with a link to the style-sheet itself.   Simply follow that link to open the style-sheet.   Alternatively, use the ''Resources'' button on the main buttons menu to access all such features. 
**'''To modify the web-document:'''   With the document open in the left-hand panel,  ''double-clicking'' an element opens it for editing.   Both text and structure can be changed in this way with an immediate update of the web-page during the changes.
Opera also allows viewing and saving of a web-document with the browser's right-click menu item ''Source''

===Viewing Page Styles===
*'''To study the styles used for an element of a web-page:'''   For all of the features discussed here, first make sure that the buttons ''Select an element on the page to inspect it'' and ''Highlight selected element'' are selected in the ''Documents'' sub-menu.   These two buttons allow the graphical interaction between the various panels of the program and the web-page itself.   For example, when some part of the screen or the document panel are clicked with the mouse, then the following can be expected:    
**'''The clicked element of the web-page is highlighted'''.
**'''The tag sequence for the selected element is displayed''' on Dragonfly's footer.
**'''The element's location is highlighted in the document code''' of the left-hand panel.
**'''The cascaded styles are displayed for that element''' in the right-hand panel, and its contents include or access these features:  
***Style sources, inheritances, and computed values.
***The full properties set that applies to that element.
***The addition of the browser's ''initial values''.
***A layout of the element's box model.
***Search facilities for document text and selector interactions.
***Facilities to change the styles of the active page.
When Dragonfly is ''not yet open'', right-clicking a page element, then selecting ''Inspect Element'' will initiate similar actions.

===Editing Page Styles===
*'''To modify the styles used for the active page:'''  Select the buttons as in the ''Study of Styles'' section.   These changes are implemented immediately on the web-page, and of course affect only the local display:
**'''To edit the cascaded CSS styles''':  A selection of typical actions includes:
***'''Remove a CSS property from the cascade'''.   Select ''Styles'' in the right-hand panel.   Tick-boxes are revealed for each declaration when hovering over them with the mouse.   Simply clear a tick-box or select it to remove or add the declaration to the cascade of styles.   The effect of doing so will be shown immediately on the displayed web-page.   
***'''To edit an existing style declaration'''.   Again, in the right-hand panel, and with ''Styles'' selected, ''Double-click'' a declaration to edit it like a text box.   The result will be seen on the web-page in-process, though this feature is not available for User Client Style-sheet entries.     
***'''To add entirely new style-blocks'''.   On the ''Styles'' tab of the right-hand panel, scroll to the bottom of the styles listing.   Enter style-sheet blocks into the text box there and press ''Apply'' to show the result on the web-page.   The new entries will be merged with the cascaded set, with due regard to their ''importance rank'' and ''specificity'', and their ''source order'' is taken as if applied at ''the end'' of the cascaded set.  The ''Apply'' button can also restore the page when such an addition is deleted.
***'''To modify the web-page itself.'''   The best way is to right-click the web-page and select ''Source''.   This opens the web-document for editing.   It can be saved as a local copy with the ''Save'' button of the source page, and the changes can be applied to the web-page for immediate viewing with ''Apply Changes''.

===Target and Text Search===
*'''To search for web-page features'''. In each case a list is returned with an item count.  Two important uses include the following: 
**'''To find ''text'' of any kind within the web-page'''.   On the right-hand panel select ''Search'' and then in the button list that appears, select ''Text''.  Enter a search word or phrase into the text box to obtain a list of search results.   Selecting any of the listed results highlights its location in the document code of the left-hand panel.
**'''To find a list of selector ''targets''''':   That is, find all the parts of the web-page whose styles will be affected by a given selector.   On the right-hand panel select ''Search'' and then in the button list that appears, select ''Selector''.  Enter a selector name into the text box, either an ''existing'' selector name or a ''proposed'' one, to obtain a list of the targeted elements for its styles.   Selecting any of the listed results highlights its location in the document code of the left-hand panel, and in addition highlights the affected element on the web-page itself.
&lt;br&gt;

==CSS Tutorials ==
A selection of brief tutorials is given below.   The intention is to provide short pieces that instruct in the basics of the subject matter, rather than indulging in lengthy discourse.   There is a listing on the use of style-sheet selectors, and an explanation of specificity and some other things.

For those who intend to study CSS by changing the content of style-sheets and web-documents, it may be as well to issue a standard reminder about the caching of files.
*'''When a browser preference (option) is changed''' a browser re-start is most often needed before it can take effect.
*'''When a web-page or a style sheet is changed''', the expected changes are unlikely to be seen unless the browser cache is first cleared and the page re-loaded.   Much confusion can result if this point is overlooked.   The cache-clearing methods for each browser are different, but there is usually a feature within the browser's preferences (options).   Sometimes drop-menu items provide for faster cache clearing, but at  other times it may be necessary to set the options to clear the cache on closure, then restart the browser to display the change.   For the Opera browser examples below, the most convenient way to empty the browser cache is by the use of the drop-menu item ''Tools / Delete Private Data...''  

&lt;br&gt;
===Selectors for Style-sheets===
{{dropimage|hbgc=beige|cbgc=beige|cp=3em|ff=tahoma|width=600px|background=transparent|align=center|1=Selectors for Style-sheets|2={{hiddenh2|Basic Style-sheet Selector Use}}
&lt;p style=&quot;width:700px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
;Tag Selectors: Tag selectors are the simplest selectors.  They are just the text-part of the HTML tag whose style is being defined.  In general however, a selector is so-named because it is used to ''select'' or ''target'' a part of the web-page with its styles.    It can also be compounded with other terms to provide for more selective targeting.

It is the left-most part of a style expression, up to but not including the first curly bracket.

A simple style with a paragraph tag's selector looks like this: 

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;p {font-size: 10pt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

:and the above style could be applied automatically to all simple paragraphs on a web-page.   Sometimes the selectors are grouped to save typing; then the same styles can be made to apply to the entire comma-separated group, like this: 

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;p, div, table, ul {padding: 1em} &lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

:When we intend to write declarations for ''every'' tag on the page, we can use the ''universal'' selector, the asterisk, like this:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;* {font-family; Arial, Sans-serif}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

:We can also conditionally style paragraphs.   If the styles were to apply only when the paragraph tags are nested within div tags, we could  write the selector for that as:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;div p {line-height:1.8em;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}   


;Class Selectors: A class-selector is a selector that is allied with a class; that is, a complete set of styles.   To use it the class name must be declared within the associated tag.  It has more specificity than a simple tag selector, but less than an ID selector.  The class can be used as many times as necessary throughout a page, and several classes can be declared within one element. In the style-sheet we could define the class with say;

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;.thetop {font-family: Arial;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

:And to apply these styles to say, a paragraph tag in a document we can write the declaration in the document as:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;thetop&quot;&gt; Some paragraph text &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

:When the following two classes are declared together in the same element, the styles of the two individually defined classes will be merged:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;firstpara headings&quot;&gt;The text&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

:If the ''selector'' is written as shown below, the styles will be applied only to elements where both classes are declared:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;.firstpara.secondpara{}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

;ID Selectors: These should only be used once in a page, and only one can be declared within an element.   They have the greatest specificity, second only to in-line styles.   A typical id definition can be written in the style-sheet as:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;#Tailpiece {color:gray;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

:and we declare the ID for use in the document with say;

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;Tailpiece&quot; &gt;This is the text &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}


;Contextual Selectors: These describe the styles to apply when tags are nested within one another.  In this example the selector will only  apply to paragraph tags that are nested within division tags.   For that we write:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;div p {padding: 1em;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

:and it would be applied when the tags in the document look something like this: 

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The is the text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

:Combining a few of the above ideas, here are the styles for the same nested paragraphs, but now one has declared a class and the other an ID:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;poem&gt;div p.firstpara {background:green}
div p#tailpiece {font-size:30pt}&lt;/poem&gt;}}


;Attribute Selectors: These are selectors that have an attribute in square brackets modifying their action in a conditional way.  To color all items with a title of &quot;CSS Work&quot; we might write in the style-sheet:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;[title=&quot;CSS Work&quot;] {color: blue}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

To select any element with the sub-string ''able'' in the value of its title attribute, we write:   

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;[title*=&quot;able&quot;] {color: red}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

Other attributes might include ''alt'', ''class'', ''id'', ''lang'', ''style'', ''title'',and  html attributes such as ''align'', ''cellspacing'' ect.


;Pseudo Classes:  These are classes that condition behavior, like that of selecting links on the page.   We might write:

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;a:active {color:purple}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
  

;Pseudo Elements:   These are elements that can access such features as the 'first-line' and  'last-line' of paragraphs, and that allow additional control in the page. For example, they also allow the targeting of the ''first cell in a row'', or ''every even or odd row''.

To make the first letter of all paragraphs bold, we could write:     

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;p:first-letter {font-weight:bold}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

The ''first of type'' pseudo element selects the ''first'' child element of its parent that matches the construct.
For example, to make the entire first columns of all tables bold we could write the selector as:     

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;table td:first-of-type{font-weight:bold;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

The ''last of type'' pseudo element selects the ''last'' child element of its parent that matches the construct.
This selector draws a totals line above the last row of tables declaring the ''totals'' class:     

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;table.totals tr:last-of-type{border-top:2px solid darkgrey;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

The ''nth child'' and ''nth of type'' pseudo elements can used to selectively target elements by pattern.
This first example below colors ''every odd row'' of every table:         

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;table tr:nth-child(odd) {background: #FFF;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

This next example colors every table's ''even rows''.

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;table tr:nth-child(even){background:linen;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

The third example shows the general form for table ''row coloring''; this case colors every third row starting with row number two:
{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;table tr:nth-child(3n+2){background: grey;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

To color even ''columns'', two pseudo elements can be compounded as follows.   This example colors ''every even cell'' in ''every  row'' of every table.   Both of these parts could take more complex arguments.
{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;table tr:nth-of-type(n) td:nth-of-type(even) {background:lightpink;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

;Important styles:   These are declarations in user, author, or any other style-sources with high priority. See page for details:e.g.     

{{block|ff='Courier New'|fs=1.2em|&lt;nowiki&gt;p{font-weight:bold !important;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

{{hiddenh2|Selectors and ''Nested'' Tags}}
Nested elements are elements whose opening and closing tags are themselves bounded by a complete set of other tags.   The examples below will make the matter clear.   The html code below is used for demonstration.   In it there are many nested tag-sets (representing elements).   For example, the table is completely nested within a pair of division tags, and all of that is completely nested between a pair of body tags.

The notion of nesting is not limited to ''adjacent'' tag pairs.   That is to say, in the above example, the table is also considered to be nested within the body tags, despite the fact that the division tags are located between them.   In determining which selectors might apply to a particular tag in the document, the browser gives consideration to the nest in which the tag is located.   In the example below it is assumed that the browser is attempting to find the relevant nested tags for the first heading tag, h2.   

'''Figure 1: An HTML extract to show nested tag pairs.'''
&lt;source lang=html4strict style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--  Sample html code for the nesting example 
Go to the examples below for an explanation --&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;First Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Column 1 Heading&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Column 2 Heading&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Cell 1 text&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cell 2 text&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Second Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;class1&quot;&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li id=&quot;id1&quot;&gt;First list item text
      &lt;li&gt;Second list item text
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[image:Tag nest red.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2:   This diagram shows the possible selectors as nodes.   It follows the extract of Figure 1.   Notice that where declarations exist there are two possible routes to specifying selectors, one for the tag ''with'' the declaration and one ''without''.]]
&lt;poem&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Usually, with practice, the web-page builder can see the relationships within the tag sets by simple inspection, but here the nested tag pairs will be listed and explained.   In the extract above, the h2 tag that is nested within a division has ''four'' possible nestings, and these imply that there are four possible ways to write selectors that ''include that tag''.   That is to say, ''on its own'' or set ''at least somewhere'' between complete tag pairs.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
In Figure 2 can be seen all of the possible selectors that could apply to the extract of Figure 1, with the exception of those that include the universal selector and the omitted root element ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.   Any selector that works at all can be made by joining a trail of selectors that ends with the target tag.  The set that is produced should be space-separated, but need not include any more that is needed to obtain the required specificity, and any tags within the sequence could be omitted.   The examples below show the simple selectors that ''might'' be written for the first heading tag of Figure 1: 

The four case are:

'''1.  The trivial case...'''
The tag on its own...
''A style-sheet selector '''h2''' would target the first heading with a specificity of 1.   Such a selector would also affect every other h2 heading as well''.
    
   &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First Heading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''2.  Nested within the div tags...'''
''A style-sheet selector '''div h2''' would also target the first heading, this time with a specificity of 2.   This selector could affect only the  first heading since the second one is not nested within any div tags''. 
    
    &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;First Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
  
'''3.  Nested within body and div tags...'''
''A style-sheet selector  '''body div h2''' would target the first heading, with a specificity of 3.  Because the second heading is not nested within a division, this selector could affect only the  first heading.''
   &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;First Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''4.  Nested within body tags...'''
Notice that even with intermediate tags ignored, that this is considered nesting too.
''A style-sheet selector  '''body h2''' would target the first heading with specificity 2.   Because both headings are nested in the body, it would affect them both.''
   &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;First Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''The addition of ''classes'' and ''id'' declarations''' to the target tag would allow for more specific targeting of styles, perhaps avoiding any confusions that might otherwise arise.   Doing so also greatly increases the number of ways to specify selectors.   The section below provides an example that includes such declarations.   In the interests of learning, it lists a few of the selector formats that ''could'' be encountered for a typical paragraph tag, though not all of these are the best choices for doing so. 
&lt;/poem&gt;


{{hiddenh2|Selectors with Classes and Id's}}

'''Figure 3:   An HTML extract for the example with declarations.'''
&lt;source lang=html4strict style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;body id=&quot;topid&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;textA&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;someid&quot; class=&quot;class1 class2&quot; style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;textB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[image:Tag nest2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 4:   This diagram shows the possible selectors as nodes.   It follows the extract of Figure 3.   Notice that where multiple declarations exist they can be combined to produce more complex selectors.   Most of these would never find use in practice.]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Figure 3 shows a fairly usual arrangement of tags where a paragraph is nested within a division tag set, and all of that is assumed to be within the body tags of the web document.   In addition, note that there are ''declarations'' within the paragraph tag; one ''id'', two ''classes'' and an ''in-line style''.   The division tag has declared an ''id'' within it.   The addition of these declarations allows a large number of variations in the available selectors for the second paragraph, though from the theoretical sixty-four variations, only about twenty or so will ever find much use.

Notice also that there is another paragraph tag, but it belongs to a different nest.   It is simply nested within the body tags and has no connection with the division tag pair.   When styles are written for paragraphs, some styles will affect ''both'' of these paragraphs and others will affect only one or the other.

'''Refer to Figure 3.  Any or all of the following selectors could be used to list styles for the ''second'' of the two paragraphs, the one with all the declarations.   A note is provided for the cases where the ''first'' paragraph tag would also be affected.'''

;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;topid p:For a paragraph that is nested within any element with a declaration id= “topid”.   Optionally, there could be a tag in between these two.  (Note that changing the last term allows many selectors and definitions). Affects both paragraphs in this case.  Specificity=at least 101
;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;topid * p:For a paragraph that is nested within any element with a declaration id= “topid”.   Necessarily, there must be a tag in between these two.  (Note that changing the last term allows many selectors and definitions). Affects only the second paragraph here.  Specificity=101
;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;:Every element that is capable of displaying the added styles.  Affects both paragraphs.   Specificity =0 
;An in-line style within the paragraph tag:Where a paragraph contains a style declaration.   Specificity=1000
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Calculate Specificity===
{{dropimage|hbgc=beige|cbgc=beige|width=600px|ff=tahoma|fs=1em|cp=3em|background=transparent|align=center|1=How to Calculate Specificity|2=&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh2|Style Declaration Specificity}}
&lt;p style=&quot;width:700px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
Specificity is to the extent to which declarations lack generality; the extent to which they apply to a tag on the page as opposed to their applying to tags in general.   The method of deciding such a matter has been developed to a considerable extent.

The method that is used calculates a weighted sum that represents the specificity.  The way to calculate specificity is as follows:

For any given style-sheet entry, examine its selector, for example, &lt;nowiki&gt;''div.p''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.   The selector is sometimes simple, having only one element, or like this, complex, with more than one.   Construct a value for its specificity by adding to a total as follows: 
*'''For a universal selector (*) or an inherited value, add zero to the specificity total. '''
*'''For an in-line style, add 1000 to the total.'''   These are found only on the document.
*'''For every ID selector mentioned, add 100 to the total.'''
*'''For every class, pseudo-class, or attribute, add 10 to the total'''. 
*'''For every simple tag element and pseudo-element, add 1 to the total.'''

The highest value of specificity among competing style declarations '''within any one level''' results in its representing that level in the overall cascade.   (See the graphic within the main page).

===Inheritance of Styles===
{{dropimage|hbgc=beige|cbgc=beige|cp=3em|ff=tahoma|width=600px|background=transparent|align=center|1=Inheritance of Styles|2=
{{hiddenh2|Inheritance of Styles}}
The ''inheritance of styles'' means the use of styles from a ''parent'' element when suitable styles have not been specified for the ''child'' element.   The ''inheritance'' of styles takes place ''after'' the cascade, filling in the missing property values where possible, and when this cannot be done, by applying ''initial values'', default values for the CSS properties themselves.   Note the following points:
*'''A ''parent'' element''' is any element whose tags totally enclose another set of tags, the tags of the so-called ''child'' element.
*'''Inheritance takes place from a parent element to a child element''', if at all, and can be transferred to any depth of nesting where the child of one becomes the parent of the next.
*'''The ''calculated'' values of the previously established ''cascaded'' values are inherited''' and not the properties themselves.   Because the ''cascaded values'' no longer have any ''importance rank'' or ''specificity'' associated with them, these factors have no bearing on ''inheritance'' either.
*'''If the child element has a ''relevant style'' specified for it''' then the parent cannot pass styles to it by inheritance.
*'''Even an HTML attribute can block inheritance''' if it exists as a relevant style in the child element.  This occurs because attributes are given equivalent CSS formats to act in the cascade.   They do so within the browser style-sheet.    
*'''The ''initial values'' of CSS properties''' do not take part in the cascade.   ''After'' the cascade, if no style was specified, then an attempt is made to solve the problem by ''inheritance'', then if that is still not possible, the ''initial value'' as found in the ''CSS Property Definition Table'' is used.   Reasons why an initial value may be taken include:
**'''The property is not specified and cannot in any case be inherited'''
**'''The property value is present but it's value is set to  ''initial'' .'''
*'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; for HTML5 Standard is assumed.'''  These notes will apply to web-documents whose top-line entry matches the one here.   For certain other ''doctypes'' the inheritance of property values might fail entirely. 
The examples below help to explain the basic points.

Inheritance takes place as a part of ''default'' actions, ''after'' the ''cascaded values'' have been resolved.   This assumption makes the writing of examples difficult.   Therefore, the reader should assume that the styles shown in the examples below have already been resolved by the ''cascade'' as being valid for these elements. 
&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Simple Inheritance}}

&lt;source lang=html4strict style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- Figure 1 --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body style=&quot;font-size:16px; line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt;   
        &lt;p&gt;This is the test paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Refer to Figure 1.    In the case above the ''paragraph'' font-size and line-height will be the same as for the ''body'' tag.   In this case the ''div'' tag ''inherits'' from the ''body'' tag since the div has no such properties specified.  The paragraph ''inherits'' from the ''div'' for the same reason.

When specified at a given level, relative ''line-height'' is always calculated as a multiple of the same element's calculated font-size, but where line-height is inherited, the calculated value of line-height of its parent is used.   The next example illustrates this.   Relative ''font-size'' is always calculated as a multiple of the parent's calculated font-size.

The line height will be applied as a value as close as possible to its calculated 24px, (16px x 1.5).
&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Inheritance with Relative Values}}

&lt;source lang=html4strict style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- Figure 2 --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body style=&quot;font-size:16px; line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;div style=&quot;font-size:1.25em; line-height: 1.6em;&quot;&gt;   
        &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:1.5em;&quot;&gt;  /* inherits calculated line-height value as 32px */               
              This is the test paragraph
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Refer to Figure 2. In this slightly more complex case the div's calculated font-size is 20px and based on this, the font-size for the paragraph is calculated to be 30px, (16px x 1.25 X 1.5 = 30px)   

The line-height for the paragraph is inherited from the div element, since it has no such style of its own, but it is not the 1.6em that is inherited but the calculated value of line-height as it exists for the div.  

The paragraph's font-size is then 30px and the line-height becomes a mere 32px, (16px x 1.25 x 1.6 = 32px).
&lt;br&gt;

{{hiddenh3|The Use of the Initial Value}}

&lt;source lang=html4strict style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- Figure 4 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Assume that the browser default font-size is 16px  --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body style=&quot;font-size:1.5em;&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;div style=&quot;font-family:Garamond; font-size:1.5em;&quot;&gt;   
        &lt;p&gt;This is the test paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to Figure 4. In this example the paragraph's text will be styled in Garamond face, with font-size 36px.   Attempts by the div level to inherit a specific  value for the font size fails, since neither ''div'' or ''body'' tags hold a font-size measurement.   The ''initial value'' however, as set by the browser's default options is 16px and this value is taken by the body tag to make its calculated value 24px.  In turn, the div tag inherits 24px and then calcuates its own to be 36px.   The paragraph inherits the values Garamond and the 36px from the div tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Systematic Deduction of Inherited Value}}
[[image:Inheritance2.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 5:  A methodical approach to determining inherited values.]]

The estimation of inherited values is complex for a web user, but it is rarely needed where styles are fully specified.   For a browser, the matter needs to be a more methodical process.

Refer to Figure 5 for a strategy chart for such a process.  After the cascade has run its course, the inheritance run then starts at the outermost tag of the document tree and works inward toward  the target tag.   The outermost tag that could contain a style is the ''html'' tag, the next is the body tag, and so on, and any of these tags could be required to contribute styles through inheritance.   

Recall that ''inheritance'' can propagate from the ''parent element'' to the ''child element'' only if the child element has no cascaded style for that property of its own.   When there is no such style but inheritance is still not possible, then the ''initial value'' for that property is taken instead.  For example, this might happen in an  HTML element that has no font-size declared, either in style-sheets or on the page.   The initial value for font-size would be used, and might even be inherited by nested elements.   All CSS properties have ''initial values'' as defaults, written into a Property Definition Table as a part of the browser's design process.

&lt;p&gt;With such a model either the ''cascaded'', ''inherited'', or ''initial'' values will be assigned during any one iteration of the loop.   In a practical situation there would not be a single run but several, not just to the deepest target, but including all of the side runs also.   Nor would there be just one CSS property that is of interest, but rather all of the properties that can apply to that element.   The scenario that perhaps serves best to understand the scope of what is done, is to imagine dozens of properties being considered at the same time at every iteration, then several more passes to get the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

===Errors and Other Things===
{{dropimage|hbgc=beige|cbgc=beige|width=600px|ff=tahoma|fs=1em|cp=3em|background=transparent|align=center|1=Errors, Comments, and White-space|2=&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;width:700px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
{{hiddenh2|Style-sheet Errors}}
When a style-sheet finds an error, it tends to ignore the feature in which it is found.
*'''If the ''selector'' is illegal''' :   This might happen if some character in it is not permitted by the CSS standard.   If that happens then all of the styles in the declaration block associated with it are ignored.   Parsing continues with the next valid selector.
*'''If the ''declaration block'' is malformed''':   For example, there might be a missing opening bracket.   When this happens the entire declaration block is ignored.   Parsing continues with the next valid selector.
*'''If an illegal ''property'' is found''':   For example, there might be a misspelling.   The entire declaration is ignored.   Parsing continues with the next valid declaration in the same declaration block, or the next selector.
*'''If there is an illegal ''value'' ''':  As in the property case, the entire declaration is ignored and the parsing continues with the next valid declaration in the same declaration block, or the next selector.
*'''If a ''semicolon'' is missing from the last declaration in a declaration block''':   The styles are unaffected.
*'''If a ''semicolon'' is missing from any other declaration in a declaration block''':   The style with the missing semicolon and the one that follows it will be ignored.   Parsing continues with the next valid declaration after those two, or the next selector.


{{hiddenh2|In-line Style Errors}}
In-line styles are parsed in the same way as style-sheets, so the second of two contesting styles applies.   Problems mostly arise when the parentheses are missing:
*'''Removing the parenthesis from the end of the block:'''   This can cause a paragraph to vanish completely!'''   This can be demonstrated using the in-line style for the first paragraph of the example in the main page.
*'''Removing the leading parenthesis''':   This causes more strange behavior - the first declaration of the two is applied but not the second.
*'''If two in-line style blocks exist:'''   The second is ignored.'''
*'''A missing ''semicolon'' at ''other than the end'' of the declaration block:'''   This causes the declarations on both sides of the missing semicolon to be ignored.
*'''A missing ''semicolon'' at the ''end'' of the last declaration''':   Has no effect on the styles.


{{hiddenh2|Comments in Style-sheets}}
Comments can be added to the style-sheet as follows:
&lt;pre style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey; background:white; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
 /*  This is my style-sheet user.css              
 These are comments and they are ignored by the parser. 
 Notice that the outside bounding characters are forward slashes,
 and that there are asterisks on the inside of each  */

p{
font-size: 30px;   /* this is also a valid comment */
}

/* comment characters can also be used to temporarily disable css styles for testing */

&lt;/pre&gt;


{{hiddenh2|Comments in HTML Document Pages}}
Comments for HTML are different from the ones for CSS style-sheets.   Comments are added to HTML with:
&lt;pre style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey; background:white; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!--  This is an HTML comment and it is ignored by the parser. --&gt;
 &lt;!--   Notice the form of the leading and end symbols   --&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;


{{hiddenh2|White-space in CSS and HTML}}
White-space in style-sheets is largely ignored, so the layout can be spaced for ease of reading.   Here are a few of the more obvious points.
*White-space can ''surround'' properties, values, selectors, declaration blocks, and whole style-rules.
*Individual words such as in properties, values, and selectors, should not be ''broken'' with space or line breaks.
*Line breaks are not permitted within individual style declarations, though breaks between complete declarations are to be expected. 

*Declarations should not be broken with line breaks.   The need for this rarely arises when a neat layout has been adopted.    


{{hiddenh2|The URL Path}}
When a style-sheet is referenced in the head section of a web-document, there are certain assumptions that can be made:
*If no path other than the file name is given, the browser can assume that the style-sheet is to be found in the same folder as the web-document itself.
*If a full path is given, in the case of Opera, spaces are tolerated in the folder names.  In the event that a browser objects to spaces, then replacing the spaces with ''%20'' will solve it.
*A local path can be given for a style-sheet on the local computer.   


{{hiddenh2|About @import}}
Any number of style-sheets can be added to a web-page by making a separate link reference for each in the head section of the page.   With the @import directive, additional style-sheets can be added to the linked style-sheet itself.  

That is to say, any of the style-sheets listed in the head section of the document can themselves import ''further'' style-sheets.    In practice this means placing a separate ''@import'' directive for each additional style-sheet, at the top of the ''linked'' style-sheet.   For example: these three additional sheets will be merged with the one in which they are mentioned:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot; style=&quot;background:white; border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;
@import &quot;first.css&quot;;
@import &quot;second.css&quot;;
@import url('http://help.opera.com/css/styles.css');

/*   This is main.css, the sheet referenced in the web-page's head section */

body{
font-size:1em;
}

/*    etc...   */
&lt;/source&gt;  
Note the following:
*There can be no typing above the import directives, but a blank line is permitted.
*The parentheses are optional for Opera but some browsers like Internet Explorer might expect them.
*A semi-colon after each import directive is essential.
*The style-sheets will run in sequence &quot;after&quot; the sheet in which they are listed.
*Entries without a path will be assumed to be located in the same folder as the web-document itself.
*Optionally, the ''url'' format can be used to import a known style-sheet.   See the third example above, and notice that it has ''single'' quotes.

===HTML Attributes===
{{dropimage|hbgc=beige|cbgc=beige|width=600px|ff=tahoma|fs=1em|cp=3em|background=transparent|align=center|1=HTML Attributes|2=&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh2|HTML Attributes}}
&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;width:700px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Default Styles}}
Before the introduction of CSS style-sheets the formatting of web page elements was carried out with so-called ''HTML attributes''.   These are basic style rules, and the set differs for each HTML element.    In the absence of any author and user CSS styles, the formatting of a web page is handled by a combination of:
*The browser's default CSS style-sheet, (or built-in style set).
*Any HTML attribute inheritance or CSS inheritance that may still apply.
*Settings in the browser's preferences (options).
*The HTML elements' attribute default values.
*HTML attribute values purposely written into the HTML tags.

The formats ''&lt;nowiki&gt;STYLE=&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', ''&lt;nowiki&gt;ID=&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''&lt;nowiki&gt;CLASS=&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' are themselves HTML attributes that allow the assignment of CSS styles to HTML tags.   That is to say, when we write in-line styles into an HTML tag, or declare an id or class,  we use HTML attributes to do it.

Although the above list has only one CSS source mentioned (the browser's default style-sheet), it is convenient to think of most of these items as comprising the default browser set.   In fact, some developer utilities such as Opera Dragonfly list the equivalent CSS properties of added HTML attributes as if they had originated in the browser's default style-sheet.   For example, where there is an attribute entry ''align=center'', it is implied as having been written in the default style-sheet as ''text-align:center''.   Additionally, the same utility lists font details from the browser preference settings as though they had also originated as CSS code within the browser's default style-sheet.   Most of the time this will not pose any problems for understanding, but it is as well to bear it in mind where there is confusion.

{{hiddenh3|Attribute Inheritance}}
Attribute values as well as CSS values can be propegated to child levels by ''inheritance''.   For example, ''align=center'' within a tag at any parent level will affect paragraphs at levels far below, assuming that the paragraph has no such style of its own.    
&lt;br&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Attribute Priorities}}
Because HTML attributes and CSS styles might still be found together in web pages it is as well to comment on their relative precedence in use.   CSS values supersede simple HTML attribute values when they apply to the same style on the same element.   In fact, it is only when no CSS style has been expressed that an HTML attribute could apply its formats.

Because of these priorities it may be incorrect for developer tools like Opera Dragonfly to treat attributes as though they were part of the browser's default style-sheet.   Clearly even a default browser's CSS style should override an attribute.   These priorities are difficult to test in the absence of access to a browser's default sheet, but fortunately the number of situations where confusion might arise are becoming vanishingly small.      

{{hiddenh3|Attribute Disuse}}
Until recently, some HTML attributes had been easier to apply than CSS, but increasingly, CSS styles are being introduced to fill the gaps.   For example, the alignment of block elements at a page's center with the HTML attribute expression ''&lt;nowiki&gt;align=center&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' can now be done with the CSS declaration ''margin:auto'', and recent versions of CSS now allow for the convenient merging of table cells.   For those who do ''not'' have access to the style-sheet (users of Wiki), and who need to apply padding for table cells, there seems to be no substitute for the table-level HTML attribute ''&lt;nowiki&gt;cellpadding=length&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', or endlessly adding padding to every cell.   With each new version of HTML, various attributes fall into disuse, for example, the attribute ''align'' becomes unavailable in HTML5.      

Although the CSS cascade applies only to the resolution of CSS styles, unless regard is also given to these additional default sources, the user will be denied a full understanding.   Listings of HTML attributes and ''their'' element defaults are to be found in texts on HTML code itself, and will be found to vary between the HTML versions.

== Read and discuss ==
 Acts 4:32-37 and Exodus 35:20-29; 36:2-7.
== What is cooperation? ==
Willingness to work together; give
and take. Learning to cooperate is
when a person thinks about and
balances their own needs and wants
with another person’s needs and
wants. Some people think that
cooperation means a child does
what the adult wants. That’s not the
case. True cooperation is a give and
take between people that ends up
with something they both agree on.
Cooperation is a skill that must be
learned.

== Why is cooperation important in your family, school, and church? ==
== Role play a Bible story about cooperation. ==
== Sing a cooperation song. ==
Cooperation Hop Song by Sandy Patty. Listen this song in this link [https://myspace.com/sandipatty/music/song/cooperation-hop-album-version-30810009 Cooperation Hop]

Isn't the above example a bit misleading because that's not an XForms document but a regular HTML document?  It's not completely pointless as xforms:repeat + TABLE doesn't mix very well in most implementations, so using DIVs as tables is still a good trick.

: Yes, this is a very good point.  I put the example in the cookbook as a buildup to some of the examples that need to insert text into tables using the FireFox extension.  This is the only way I know how to do it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===== Is this snippet correct? The examples look like they might be clients but the shosts.equiv needs to be &quot;oriented to just the list of hosts&quot;.  I'm confused.  =====

The /etc/shosts.equiv identifies which addresses are allowed to try authenticating. Keep this file simple and oriented to just the list of hosts. It provides only the first cut, anyway. For fine tuning, use sshd_config to set or revoke access for specific users and groups.&lt;br /&gt;
client1.example.org&lt;br /&gt;
192.168.0.102&lt;br /&gt;
client8.example.org -bull&lt;br /&gt;
@statcluster&lt;br /&gt;

: host means a machine connected to the net, either a client or a server.  But overall it could use some clarification.  [[User:Larsnooden|Larsnooden]] ([[User talk:Larsnooden|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Larsnooden|contribs]]) 08:56, 3 September 2013 (UTC)

:: It would help me if the difference between shosts.equiv and ssh_known_hosts was explained.  I currently think shosts.equiv is a really badly named whitelist of clients IPs while ssh_known_hosts is another really badly named file, this time a list of clients and their public keys.  It seems bonkers and I hope I'm wrong!  Thanks much for your (Lars) effort in trying to explain this.

::: shosts.equiv is the list of machines whose users are allowed to be considered for host-base authentication.  ssh_known_hosts is a register of machines and their public keys.  Those machines that are on both lists are allowed to try to authenticate. ~ [[User:Larsnooden|Larsnooden]] ([[User talk:Larsnooden|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Larsnooden|contribs]]) 18:47, 3 September 2013 (UTC)</text>

== Find, read, and write Matthew 4:4. Discuss its importance with an adult. Write what you learned. ==

{{Bible verse|book=Matthew |chapter=4|verse=4|version=NIV|text=Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”}}

* '''Who do you think said it?''' Answer: Jesus said it. He was speaking to Satan. 
* '''What do you think it means?''' Answer: Satan was tempting Jesus, trying to get Him to eat. Jesus replied by letting him know that prayer and meditating on God’s Word is just as essential to living as is food for our physical needs. Note: Read Matthew 4:1-4 to show the full meaning of the text. *

== Discuss with an adult the importance of reading God’s word every day. Write down your conclusions. ==
It is important for us to read our Bibles everyday in
order to ensure our relationship with our Heavenly
Father stays strong. Reading His Word and praying
helps strengthen our bond and increases our chances to
share Him with others.
{{BookCat}}

== Find and read 2 Timothy 2:15, Psalm 119:11, and Psalm 119:105 NIV. Why do we study the Bible? ==

{{Bible verse|book=2 Timothy |chapter=2|verse=15|version=NIV|text=Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.”}}

{{Bible verse|book=Psalm |chapter=119|verse=11|version=NIV|text=I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.”}}

{{Bible verse|book=Psalm |chapter=119|verse=105|version=NIV|text=Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.”}}

== Talk about how to prepare yourself for reading God’s Word. Write down four Bible study habits. ==

* To set aside time, every morning or every evening.
* Start with a prayer before you begin your study. Ask the Holy Spirit to be with you as you read and help you understand. “Scripture can only be understood thro' the same Spirit whereby it was given.&quot; John Wesley
* Be sure to pause during your reading. Think about what you have read and how you can apply it to your life and your journey with Christ.
* d. Your reading should be closed with prayer asking God to help you remember the message and hold it in your heart.

== Read one of the following Bible stories. ==
* Hannah prays for a son- 1 Samuel 1:1-28
* Noah’s Ark - Genesis 6:5-Genesis 8
* Baby Moses - Exodus1-2:10
* Namaan the Leper - 2 Kings 5:1-16
== Make a bookmark to use while you study your Bible. ==
Print out this [http://%5B%5BFile:Bread%20memory%20verse.pdf|thumb|Matthew%204:4%20Bookmark%5D%5D Matthew 4:4 Bread Bookmark]and wrap it in cellophane bag and tie a ribbon at the end. The illusion will be of a loaf of bread.

==Starting a SWING Project==

Let us first consider how to start a Swing project.

A reasonable first step is to create a window; we will after all need some kind of container or display into which we can place contents.
In Java SWING, the class that represents a top-level window is known as a &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt;.
We can create a JFrame simply enough:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class StartingSwing {

    public static void build() {        
        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;title&quot;);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                build();
            }
        });
    }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

Some of this is simple enough: the &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt; class represents a window, and the instance that we have created, &lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;, will represent a specific window.
We may reasonably assume that the single String argument here provided, which we have specified as &lt;code&gt;&quot;title&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is the title that we wish to give the window.

The &lt;code&gt;setDefaultCloseOperation&lt;/code&gt; specifies what we want done when the user clicks the &quot;close&quot; button on our window.
In Swing, the default action is to hide the window; if we want event processing to cease and our program to exit, we must specify this explicitly.
This might seem odd, but consider that a program might have multiple windows, or might include background processes that we do not with to terminate; we would not wish to dispose of all of these resources simply because one window was closed.

Similarly, frames do not necessarily start out visible; a large GUI program might contain many frames.
To save time later, it might be convenient to construct many frames (holding different components of our application) when our programs start, even if we may only immediately make use of a few of them.
For this reason, we need to tell the system to mark our particular frame as visible.

The &lt;code&gt;pack&lt;/code&gt; function requires some explanation: simply, it computes the layout of our frame.
The frame we have constructed above is empty - we have not specified any contents.
An empty frame is not particularly useful; generally, we will fill a frame with 'widgets' to display information and allow the user to interact with the application.
Swing will need some kind of policy to determine where on the screen our widgets will be placed, how large they will be, and how their sizing and positioning will change as the user interacts with the application - if the user resizes the window, for example.
The &lt;code&gt;pack&lt;/code&gt; function instructs the Swing library to compute the initial positioning and sizing for whatever widgets that we may have placed into the frame - in this case.

Finally, we note the somewhat odd contents of the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function.
Recall that, in general, in order for our program to process events, somewhere there must be an 'event loop' running.
In the specific case of Swing, the system arranges to start an event loop for us - it does so whenever we &lt;code&gt;show()&lt;/code&gt; a frame.
This event loop is started in its own thread, a fact which creates some complications for us - it requires us to deal with potential concurrency issues.

As a general rule (the reasons for we shall revisit), operations on the components of a GUI need to occur in the thread running the event loop.
This includes 'building' the GUI in the first place, and so we need to ensure that our GUI construction routine occurs on the event-loop thread.
This is what is happening in our main loop: we are declaring an instance of the &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; class, which represents a Thread in Java, we are arranging for that &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; to call our GUI-building function, and we are asking the system to perform that operation on the event-dispatch thread.
The notation is somewhat dense; this is in part because it does not necessarily serve our purposes to completely unpack this now.
We will revisit the issue of multithreading in GUI applications somewhat later.

== Listen to the parable found in Matthew 13:3-9. Read two other verses about seeds: ==

{{Bible verse|book=Matthew|chapter=13|verse=3-9|version=NIV|text=''Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. Whoever has ears, let them hear.”''}}

{{Bible verse|book=Genesis|chapter=1|verse=11|version=NIV|text='' It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.''}}

{{Bible verse|book=Mark|chapter=4|verse=31|version=NIV|text=''Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so.''}}

{{Bible verse|book=Matthew|chapter=17|verse=20|version=NIV|text='' He replied, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”.''}}

== What does a seed need in order to grow? ==

Seeds need proper temperature, water and oxygen for them to germinate. A good soil location and proper light will also determine if a seed will germinate well or not. Oxygen and water are taken in through the seed causing the cells to enlarge.

== Observe and discuss what happens when a seed sprouts. ==

During germination, water diffuses through the seed coats into the embryo, which has been almost completely dry during the period of dormancy, causing a swelling of the seed; the swelling is often so great that the seed coat is ruptured. With the absorption of oxygen by the seed, energy is made available for growth. The foodstuffs stored in the endosperm or in the cotyledons are broken down by enzymes into simpler substances that are transported through the embryo to the various centers of growth. The radicle is the first portion of the embryo to break through the seed coat. It develops root hairs that absorb water and attach the embryo to particles of soil. The hypocotyl then lengthens, bringing the plumule and often the cotyledon or cotyledons above the surface of the soil. If the cotyledons are brought into light, they develop chlorophyll and carry on photosynthesis until the true foliage leaves develop from the plumule. In many plants, especially members of the grass family, the cotyledons never appear above the surface of the soil, and photosynthesis does not occur until true leaves develop; the plant meanwhile subsists on food stores in the seed. From the time of germination until the plant is completely independent of food stored in the seed, the plant is known as a seedling.

== Name some ways that seeds are naturally spread? ==
[[File:Female coco de mer seed.jpg|thumbnail|Coco de Mer]]

Seeds travel in many ways. Birds help spread seeds by their waste after eating the seeds. Some seeds travel by the wind, and others float in the water, and even by the fur on animals


== Name the largest and smallest seeds you have ever seen? ==

* Largest: The largest seed is the double coconut or coco de mer (Lodoicea maldivica) from Seychelle Isands. It is a giant fan palm, the coconut can take up to 10 years to develop, weigh up to 50 lbs., and reach 12 inches in length and nearly three feet in circumference.
* Smallest: The smallest seed is from an orchid, and is less than half the diameter of a grain of table salt.

== Taste a variety of edible seeds. Have fun exploring new things! ==
== Collect and identify at least 2 different seeds of each category: ==

=The effect of high-impact exercise on Osteoporosis=

==Background==

=====What is osteoporosis?=====
Osteoporosis is a condition in which there is a reduction in the mineral density of a bones matrix. This reduction in bone mineral density makes the suffering individual more susceptible to bone fractures than those with a higher bone mineral density, ie. those without osteoporosis.

=====Prevalence in Australia=====
In 2007/08, it was estimated that osteoporosis affected 3.4% (692,000) of all Australians&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2011, July 29). Arthritis and Osteoporosis in Australia: A Snapshot, 2007-08. Retrieved September 5, 2013, from Australian Bureau of Statistics: http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4843.0.55.001main+features32007-08&lt;/ref&gt;. This estimate has more than double since 1995 in Australia, from 1.5% to 3.1% of the total population&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2011, July 29). Arthritis and Osteoporosis in Australia: A Snapshot, 2007-08. Retrieved September 5, 2013, from Australian Bureau of Statistics: http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4843.0.55.001main+features32007-08&lt;/ref&gt;.
According to [http://www.osteoporosis.org.au/ Osteoporosis Australia], over 1 million people in Australia suffer from osteoporosis at present.&lt;ref&gt;Osteoporosis Australia. (2013). Risk factors for Osteoporosis. Retrieved September 3, 2013, from http://www.osteoporosis.org.au/about/about-osteoporosis/risk-factors/&lt;/ref&gt;

==High-Impact Exercise and Osteoporosis==

=====What is High-Impact Exercise?=====

=====High-Impact Exercise and it's effect on Osteoporosis=====

=====Limitations of High-Impact Exercise on Osteoporosis=====
As osteoporosis can occur throughout the entire body, high-impact exercise may not be applicable to certain sectors of the body suffering from osteoporosis. For example, it may be difficult to target the bones of the arms or shoulder regions with high-impact exercises. In these cases, other treatments options may be preferred over high-impact exercise.

Also, as the bones are weakened in osteoporosis patients, they may not be able to withstand high-impact exercises without fracture. In these cases, other treatments may also be better suited.

=== '''&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;Exercise and it's effects on Schizophrenia''' ===


Schizophrenia is a destructive mental illness that affects the brains ability to understand what is real and what is not. It is mental disease that affects approximately 1 % of the world’s population. The term schizophrenia means &quot;split mind&quot; where the person thought process and emotional response are not connected.The disease schizophrenia was first used in 1911 by a swiss man named Dr Eugen Bleuler to diagnose patients. There are a variety of types of schizophrenia such as 

1- [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000936.htm Paranoid-Type ]schizophrenia; delusions of conspiracy and or delusions of persecution. Can also have auditory hallucinations. 
2- [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000937.htm Disorganised-Type]: Unorganised thought processes, speech and behavior. This particular type of schizophrenia contains the flat effect.
3- [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/catatonic-schizophrenia/DS00863 Catatonic-Type]: extremes in behavior such as hyperactivity to extreme lethargic and immobility.
4- [http://psychcentral.com/lib/undifferentiated-schizophrenia/000150 Undifferentiated-Type]: This category is for symptoms that do not fall into the other classifications of schizophrenia.
5- [http://psychcentral.com/lib/residual-schizophrenia/000149 Residual-Type]: When patients symptoms become less or diminish.
    
Further information about types of Schizophrenia cane be found here: [http://ssmhealth.adam.com/content.aspx?pid=10&amp;gid=000047 Types of Schizophrenia]

=== Causes ===

This disease can be caused by a number of things such as;

•	Genetics

•	Environmental factors such as stress

•	Drug abuse

=== Treatment ===

Current methods of treating patients with schizophrenia are ;

•	[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2811142/ Cognitive behavioral therapy](CBT)

•	Medications such as [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/mental-health-medications/index.shtml Anti-psychotics]

Getting help is crucial in helping schizophrenic patients gain control of their lives. Such help is found at the APS [http://www.psychology.org.au/FindaPsychologist/Default.aspx?ID=1204 Australian Psychology Schizophrenia contact]. Here they can help find the closest psychologist that specialises in treatment or help of schizophrenic patients.
Further information about schizophrenia and its physiological effects of patients can be found in the following links;

 [http://www.psychology.org.au/community/schizophrenia/ Australian psychology Schizophrenia]

===Exercise and Schizophrenia===

Physical activity has had many benefits in helping schizophrenia patients. Besides the obvious benefits of exercise such as weight loss, decreased blood pressure, lower risk of cardiovascular disease, increase aerobic fitness and muscle mass gains there are more disease specific adaptions from exercise for schizophrenia patients (refer to figure 1). The following link gives some information as to why exercise may be good for people with schizophrenia. 

 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004412.pub2/pdf/standard Cochrane review: Exercise Therapy for Schizophrenia Patients]

=== Statistical Evidence ===

A study by Vancampfort, 2010 has shown that physical activity has also had significant effects in cardiovascular and metabolic parameters {Vancampfort, 2010 #205}. Some studies have shown that when implementing physical activity for schizophrenics that exercise is associated with less depressive symptoms. This also works visa versa that with less depressive symptoms comes a stronger adherence to exercise {Marzolini, 2009 #206}. It has been shown through numerous studies that exercise has a positive effect on negative symptoms and depressive states/psychiatric states {Acil, 2008 #214} {Behere, 2011 #211} {Gorczynski, 2010 #225}. 

Particular types of exercise have been found to be more beneficial for patients with schizophrenia.  Yoga has been found to have a better outcome for mental state and significantly better quality of life scoring {Gorczynski, 2010 #225}. It has also had less psychopathology. Through this schizophrenia patients have had better occupational functioning and improved quality of life {Duraiswamy, 2007 #210} {Behere, 2011 #211}. Yoga and aerobic exercise have also been shown to decrease anxiety levels and psychological stress {Behere, 2011 #212}. The difference in the effect of aerobic exercise or yoga sessions doesn’t seem to have a significant difference in effect on schizophrenia patients {Behere, 2011 #212}. 

Other adaptions that have been found in schizophrenia patients are an increase in hippocampal volume. This has been associated with an increase in the N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio in the hippocampus. This same study also found that there was a better recall of short term memory after the aerobic exercise intervention {Pajonk, 2010 #208}.Refer to Figure 1 for a summary of exercise effects on schizophrenia.

Aside from less depressive symptoms and psychiatric states exercise in general is a great social outing for patients {Vancampfort, 2010 #205. Depending on the living status of a patient whether they are in hospital, psychiatric ward or prison exercise acts as a support group where they can help each other and talk to each their about current issues or struggles. Exercise groups can also help people engage in social practice and develop people skills.

Figure 1- ''Represents a comparison of general exercise effects that would be expected and exercise effects that are more specific to the nature of schizophrenia.''


=== Summary ===

In summary of all studies and experiments it becomes apparent that the mild to moderate physical activities have a more of a beneficial effect on mental states, physical attributes, psychiatric states and quality of life more so than high intensity activities over a 2-3 month period. In saying this exercise is not a cure to schizophrenia however it does reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia. There is very limited research into high intensity anaerobic exercise to compare results to so currently Yoga and aerobic exercise is the only available literature. It is uncertain whether this is a short-term fix or whether a long term effect on patients.

Further research is needed over longer periods of time to apply a specific exercise prescription to schizophrenia patients.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Anxiety Disorder==
While it is common for most people to experience anxiety at one or more points of time in their life, this does not classify them with a General Anxiety Disorder. Those diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder experience severe, disabling anxiety which has a prolonged negative impact on their function at work, home, school or general life. 
(Anxiety Treatment Australia)

“On order for man to succeed in life, god provided him with two means, education and physical activity. Not separately, one for the soul and the other for the body but for the two together. With these two means, men can attain perfection” (Plato, fourth century bc)

==Symptoms==
Each of the specific forms of anxiety disorders will have their own set of symptoms that lead to their own prognosis, however, commonly people with GAD will experience constant and chronic worry about their health, family, money, work, etc. This worry will continue every day, sometimes all day, and interfere with social activities and relationships. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.anxietycanada.ca/english/index.php retrieved 17/10/13 &lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside with these symptoms, it is common to experience the following physiological symptoms; 
* Muscle tension
* Fatigue
* Restlessness
* Difficulty sleeping
* Irritability
* Edginess
* Gastrointestinal discomfort/diarrhea &lt;ref&gt; http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad/symptoms retrieved 17/10/13 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Common Treatments==
Treatment for GAD can be broken down into 3 different categories, psychological treatments, medical treatments and other treatments. 

Psychological Treatments: &lt;ref&gt; http://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/anxiety/treatments-for-anxiety/psychological-treatments-for-anxiety retrieved 1/10/13 &lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive Behaviour Therapy; A patient undergoing CBT works with a professional to analyse the ways they think and act that may be causing them anxiety.
* Behaviour Therapy; While behavior therapy is a major part of CBT it differs in that it focuses completely on increasing the patient’s level of activity and pleasure in life. 


Medical Treatments: &lt;ref&gt; http://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/anxiety/treatments-for-anxiety/medical-treatments-for-anxiety retrieved 17/10/13 &lt;/ref&gt;
* Antidepressants; Antidepressants are designed to correct the imbalance of chemical messages through neurons in the brain. People do not need to be experiencing depression symptoms for antidepressants to be an effective method of controlling anxiety.
* Benzodiazepines; Benzodiazepines are a form of sedative and can be used as a short-term method (two –three weeks) of reducing anxiety and assisting to cope with panic attacks. Long term used is not recommended, as they are known to be addictive. 


Other Treatments: &lt;ref&gt; http://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/treatment-options/other-sources-of-support retrieved 17/10/13 &lt;/ref&gt;
* Family &amp; Friends; Family members can offer support, understanding and help for an individual suffering from anxiety. They offer a way to keep the individual connected and feeling confident. 
* Exercise; Exercise can assist by lifting mood, improving sleep and increasing energy levels. It also offers opportunities to socialize and block out negative thoughts. 
* Diet; A good diet will generally give people a sense of well being, assisting with the individuals outlook on life. A nourishing diet can also improve mood and maintain healthy brain functioning.
* Relaxation Therapy; Relaxation therapy helps to relax the muscles, which in turn may help to reduce anxious thoughts and behaviours.

==Benefits of Exercise on GAD==

Exercise can help reduce anxiety through a number of means. &lt;ref&gt; Mental Health Foundation &quot;Let's get Physical&quot; http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/awareness-week-2013-report/ retrieved 21/10/13 &lt;/ref&gt; Exercise allows the person to; 
* Reduce tension levels
* Reduce stress
* Increase energy levels
* Improve and regulate sleep
* Feel a sense of achievement
* Lower anger and frustration levels
* Regulate appetite levels
*Increase their social life

==Optimal Exercise==
Persons wishing to assist with treatment for generalized anxiety disorders should undergo an exercise program under the supervision of a professional. 
An exercise program should be written incorporating 3-4 sessions per week of low to moderate intensity exercise at around 30-40% of VO2 max (light jogging, cycling, swimming etc.). 
&lt;ref&gt; Mi Rye Suh, R. N., Hyuk Jung, H., Bae Kim, S., Sik Park, J., &amp; Seok Yang, W. (2002). Effects of regular exercise on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Renal failure, 24(3), 337-345. retrieved 21/10/13 &lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, leisure activities or sports are advised, particularly those involving high social interaction. These are intended to encourage socializing and to allow the person to work their way into situations that tend to bring on panic. 

The program should last, with proper adherence, 3-12 weeks to take full advantage of the benefits. Programs lasting less than 3 weeks have been shown to have little to no impact on anxiety levels, while programs lasting longer than 12 weeks have shown less promising results. One explanation could be that motivation levels for programs lasting longer than 12 weeks tend to be lower. Revaluation of the program should be made every 2-3 weeks to ensure its relevance. 
&lt;ref&gt; Herring, M. P., O'Connor, P. J., &amp; Dishman, R. K. (2010). The effect of exercise training on anxiety symptoms among patients: a systematic review. Archives of Internal Medicine, 170(4), 321. retrieved 21/10/13 &lt;/ref&gt;

Programs involving high levels of resistance training and high intensity exercise should be avoided where possible. Studies have shown that resistance training and high intensity exercise could in fact be increasing anxiety levels.
&lt;ref&gt; O'Connor, P. J., Raglin, J. S., &amp; Martinsen, E. W. (2000). Physical activity, anxiety and anxiety disorders. International Journal of Sport Psychology, 31(2), 136-155. retrieved 21/10/13 &lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation, in combination with exercise, has been shown to decrease overall anxiety levels in people with high anxiety. Relaxation for 20 minutes a day has been shown to have a profound impact on those suffering from anxiety. Correct technique isn’t as important as personalizing the experience to create the least stressful environment possible.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics came as an historical afterthought. It is often phrased in terms of thermal equilibrium (equal temperature), however, the basic idea may be applied to all types of equilibrium.

''If system A is in equilibrium with system B, and system B is in equilibrium with system C, then system A is in equilibrium with system C.''

Consider an ice chest full of ice and a soda can in the chest. The inside of the ice chest is system A. The can is system B. The soda is system C. If the ice has had time to bring the can to 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, system A is in thermal equilibrium with system B. If the can has had time to bring the soda to 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, system B is in thermal equilibrium with system C. We could also say this system is in mechanical equilibrium since there is no volume change occurring once everything is 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.

The first law of thermodynamics deals with the conservation of energy.

&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = W + Q&lt;/math&gt;

Its essence is that all changes in energy, &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; of a system can be tracked by work &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and heat energy &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

==Learning German==

Hi there Fihalhohi! I see you are learning German with the [[German]] Wikibook. I studied the language at school myself several years ago, and I find the internet is a great way to access additional material to keep in practice. 

Another site I like is the one at Deutsche Welle, which has the advantage that it marks your answers automatically as you complete the lessons. Also, your answers are kept in a private area so you are not publishing your mistakes for everybody to see. 

See [http://www.dw.de/learn-german/deutsch-interaktiv/s-9572 http://www.dw.de/learn-german/deutsch-interaktiv/s-9572].

Heart Complications In elderly endurance athletes refers to a class of diseases that impact on the normal functioning of the heart. These heart complications inlude; 

*Arterial Fibrillation (AF). The uncoordinated twitching of the heart muscle in the atrium (irregular heart beat) (1) 
*Lone Artrial Fibrillation (LAF). Similar to (AF), but an isolated attack that can last anywhere from a few hours to a week. 
*Heart fibrosis. Scaring and thickening of the heart muscle. (3)
*Hypertrophy of the hear (figure) 


Heart complications in elderly endurance athletes refers to he/she being aged over 60 years of age. Nine out of ten elderly endurance athletes have developed heart abnormalities, some cases servre and other's manageable. . Up to 50% of elderly endurance athletes who consistently train at a vigorous level can suffer from fibrosis of the heart muscle.

Non-modifiable risk factors such as age and family history, are strong predictors of an individual will be at greater risk of developing heart complications. Modifiable risk factors include; moderate-high exercise is fine the persistent vigorous exercise is problematic, inadequate rest and recovery, poor diet and obesity are two risk factors that can be well controlled.


==Heart Complications in Elderly Endurance Athletes==


Increasing vigorous physical activity in terms of endurance based exercise will increase the risk of developing AF, LAF, and Hypertrohpy of the heart muscle. A combination of aerobic endurance training combined with regular/adequate rest, recovery and consistent testing of potential heart abnormalities will result in;
*Firstly increased quality of life.
*Increased cardiovascular adaptations.
*Increased strength and functional capacity of the heart and body
*Decreasing fatmass or BMI. 
*Greater prospect of exercise program adherence&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Sedentary Behaviour== 
Increased sedentary behaviour has been shown to increase the risk of heart complications. There are several lines of evidence for a relationship between sedentary behavior and health, including epidemiological investigations of sedentary behavior and mortality or risk of heart complications and chronic disease.</text>

==What is Alzheimer's?==
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia that causes degradation of the brain via oxidation. AD is consistent with the aging process and symptoms can include:

*Memory loss
*Personality changes (mood swings)
*Cognitive decline 
*Inability to cope with everyday activities
*Loss of coordination.

==Risk Factors==
Risk factors of AD can be both non-modifiable and modifiable.

* Being sedentary

* Smoking status

* Diet

* Drug use

* Age

* Family history

==Benefits of exercise==

''Aerobic exercise''

Aerobic exercise has been shown to be the most beneficial when it comes to slowing the process of Alzheimer's. Participating in approximately 30 minutes a day of low to moderate intensity exercise has been linked with a increase in cerebral blood flow. This increase in cerebral flow improves brain vascularity and helps maintain neural synapses.

''Anaerobic exercise''

Short, high intensity bouts of exercise using the anaerobic energy system has not been consistent with the improvements in cerebral blood flow and improvement in cognitive function as has been shown with aerobic exercise. This is because anaerobic exercise does not utilize oxygen as a primary energy source, therefore oxygen does not travel to the brain as efficiently as it would in aerobic exercise.
Although anaerobic exercise does not carry the same oxygen delivery capacity as aerobic exercise, it can still be useful to patients suffering from AD. Incorporating skills requiring coordination has also been proven to increase neural synapses and maintain overall brain volume. Engaging in leisurely anaerobic sports like golf and tennis contributes to improved cognition among AD patients.

==Prevention for Alzheimer's Disease==
''Diet and physical activity''
Participating in regular physical activity as well as managing diet throughout the mid-life has been shown to decrease some AD risks by up to 60%. Exercise and diet helps in reducing the vascular risks associated with AD as well as lowering the risk of diabetes, which is also a risk factor</text>

Pascualina is a spinach pie which is often eaten in Uruguay. It is made with spinach or silver beet, sauteed onions and a home made pastry. You can cheat and make it with a store bought puff pastry.

==Ingredients==
*3 onions chopped finely
*1kg frozen spinach (defrosted)
*1/2 nutmeg freshly grated
*250gms cream cheese or ricotta
*6 eggs
*4 sheets frozen puff pastry
*Olive oil
*Salt and pepper to taste
*Egg wash
==Procedure==
#Pre-heat oven to 190 degrees Celsius.
#Saute onions until golden.
#Add spinach, cream cheese, nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste. Stir through until all ingredients are mixed together. Put aside to cool slightly.
#Line a rectangular tray with puff pastry ensuring the pastry reaches right up to the edge of the tray.
#Spread out the filling over the puff pastry, and with a spoon make 6 holes in the filling so you can pour in the whole eggs. #Crack eggs one by one and pour into the holes.
#Cover the pie with more pastry sealing the edges.
#Brush pastry all over with egg wash and bake in a hot oven for 40 minutes until pastry is golden.
#Serve with roasted sweet potato and steamed green beans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Ingredients'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

4 large eggs&lt;br /&gt;
250 g dessicated coconut&lt;br /&gt;
200 g white sugar&lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp vanilla extract&lt;br /&gt;
2 tbs water (optional)&lt;br /&gt;
'''Method'''&lt;br /&gt;
Pre heat your oven to 180 degrees. Mix all ingredients in a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;
If your paste is too thick to pipe with a large piping tip, then add the water, and keep adding one tablespoon of water at a time until you get a consistency you can pipe. If your eggs are extra large, you may not need the extra water.&lt;br /&gt;
Bake in a medium to hot oven for 30 minutes or until done.&lt;br /&gt;</text>

&quot;The resultant BPSK spectrum&quot;  image is wrong. As the binary input data string has no DC component, there is no component at fc  in the modulated signal.</text>

by Tuğba BAHÇEKAPILI

We live in a world which is changing with rapid technological developments that affect our lives directly and change our habits. As world is changing people are expected to have some skills in order to adapt to the complex world. Herein 21century skills can be pointed which include Learning and Innovation Skills, Information, Media and Technology Skills, Life and Career Skills (21st Century Skills, 2011). 

[[File:Eds Skills.png|Skills]]
:
Figure 1. 21st Century Student Outcomes and Support Systems (21st Century Skills, 2011) 

As seen one of the skills is Information, Media and Technology Skills that includes;

* Information Literacy
* 
* Media Literacy 
* 
* ICT (Information, Communications and Technology) Literacy

But today there is an ongoing debate on are technology courses can be a part of the curriculum or how technology education can be. This issue can be derived from the nature of technology. Technology education viewed as an ill defined area because of its position as an academic school subject, problems about establishment of professional bodies, teacher preparation and professional development of teachers, and the socio-political environment of schooling (Jones, Buntting &amp; Vries, 2011). As technology education considered in schools, Jones, Buntting and Vries conclude that crafts were part of the curriculum at pre-existing but nowadays the key factor is design in technology education. Today there are many representations of technology education depends on the context. Jones, Buntting and Vries analyzed technology education in different countries and identified different types of representations under technology education as shown in figure 2.

Figure 2. Representations of technology education emphasized in different countries. E: Elementary (Years 1–8), S: Secondary (Years 9–12), (Jones, Buntting &amp; Vries, 2011).

In Turkey, the emphasis is also technological literacy. The technology education curriculum consists of three learning domains; basic procedures and concepts, use of information technology, advanced practices in information technology. In addition, science process and ethics and social values in information technology are another two learning domains that distributed through the curriculum (Ministry of Education, 2012). 
Apart from the curriculum or what to be learned today it is most important to determine how teaching, learning and assessment can be done in technology education context. In this point educators need to understand the nature of their discipline and select appropriate pedagogies, also need to consider how technology education take place and what teachers need to do in order to increase students’ experiences (Jones, Buntting &amp; Vries, 2011). 
In the international handbook of technology education the area of progress in technology education was explained under some topics. One of them is the changing pedagogy in technology education. In the early phases of technology education the process focused on learning specific skills in which teachers demonstrate the content that is skills related to technology use then students tried to do what the teacher does with technology (Vries, 2006). But today the focus is changed, it is obvious that today’s students born in a technology mediated environments and called as digital natives so expectations from them is to develop their own ideas about technology. For example the main focus in computer programming is not only to gain programming skills to students but also problem solving and critical thinking. Thus the methods in teaching technology are changed from demonstration to cognitive apprenticeship, authentic learning or constructivist approach (Snape and Turnbull, 2013). In these point teachers need to prepare learning environments that student can engage with the projects, take risks, have opportunity to solve the problems that they encountered and use his creativity (Loveland, 2012).
Therefore, this chapter aims to a new approach to technology education with technological pedagogical content knowledge framework (TPACK). The review of the current literature on TPACK revealed that there were many articles located about using technology in various disciplines generally in science and mathematics. But there is a limited research in terms of technology education. So this chapter firstly focuses on pedagogical aspects of technology education and critics about the possible use of TPACK framework in technology education context.

== '''Technology Education Perspectives'''== 

In order to find out the research needs for technology education Ritz and Martin (2012) conducted study using a Delphi technique. Researchers tried to put forth the most important issue that needs to be researched related to K-12 technology (and engineering) education. As a result ten areas stand out for the most important issues; 
* Abilities students develop through the study of technology education
* There is insufficient understanding of learning that takes place through the technology curriculum
* Designing for sustainability and global citizenship 
* Technological conceptual knowledge 
* How do students learn in technology education 
* Specialized pedagogical content knowledge for technology education 
* The assessment of technological performance 
* How students learn technology 
* Understanding the nature of technology 
* There is a need to understand the nature of designing
Another issue that researchers examined was the most important issues that need to be researched related to preparation of teachers to better teach the technology as a school subject. As a result of the analysis researchers came up with eight issues listed below;
* Lack of understanding about the epistemic beliefs of teaches 
* How should design activities, aimed at concept learning, be taught by teachers
* Understanding of pedagogical content knowledge 
* Methods of assessment in technology education, particularly of practical work 
* How do teachers’ beliefs affect program delivery 
* Teacher trainees’ conceptions of designing 
* The nature of collaborative learning in technology education
* Meaning of technology education by practicing teachers
These findings from Ritz and Martin’s (2012) study help us criticizing technology education today. As the findings of needs to be researched related to K-12 technology education examined it was seen that the learning process and pedagogical issues such as specialized pedagogical content knowledge for technology education were mostly emphasized rather than what to be learned. It is the same when research needs related with the preparation of teachers were examined.
In the literature there were studies examining pedagogical content knowledge of technology teachers. Rohaan, Taconis and Jochems (2012) analyzed Subject matter knowledge (SMK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), attitude, and self-efficacy domains of teacher knowledge in terms of technology education. As a result they concluded that while teachers had sufficient levels of technology knowledge as subject matter they had insufficient levels of pedagogical content knowledge. But it is critical for teachers to have pedagogical qualifications applying in technology education domain such as inquiry-based and problem-based learning. Also having an understanding of the nature, purpose, and characteristics of technology education is critical for providing hands-on technology activities. The researchers also performed path analysis to make connections about the domains of teacher knowledge they analyzed. They found that knowledge of technology was an influencing factor on how to teach technology as PCK and is also influences teachers’ self efficacy. By the way self self-efficacy influences teachers’ attitude towards technology.
As a perspective for technology education Snape and Turnbull (2011) examined authenticity and suggest dimensions of it significantly related with technology education; authentic pedagogy and instruction, authentic teachers and learners, authentic activities. The researchers added that when these dimensions were combined with rich contexts, social construction, meaningful connections and student engagement the outcomes of technology education will become better as shown in figure 3. 



[[File:Eds Authentic technology.png|Authentictechnology]]

Figure 3. A model of authentic technology for producing quality technological outcomes (Snape and Turnbull, 2011).

On the other side such as other disciplines technology teacher can use educational technologies to enhance the learning process. But selecting appropriate technologies can be confusing so there are models to help teachers in this process. In this point Bart (2011) introduces S.E.C.T.I.O.N.S. which is a decision-making model to select appropriate technologies explained below.

S: Information about students (demographic information, learning styles)
E: The ease of use (E) of the technology
C: Cost
T: Teaching (T) style of the teacher
I: Interaction (how the technologies will engage and motivate the student)
O: Organization (support from administrators)
N: Novelty
S: Speed and security

== '''TPACK framework in technology education'''== 

In the previous part, pedagogical issues and educational technology use related with technology education were emphasized. But in order to use technology to enhance student learning in technology education educators need to consider pedagogies together with the specific technologies to teach a specific topic in technology education. So, new emerging knowledge TPACK can be a useful framework to address these concerns. TPACK refers to teaching a certain topic with pedagogical techniques by using technology that providing meaningful learning experiences to students (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006). TPACK framework consists of three domains: pedagogy, technology and content; and intersections among them. In technology education domain, at the first look it seems that technology as content and technology as tool to enhance learning are overlapping. But it is important to distinguish these two domains within TPACK framework. As a content students try to learn how to use technologies to solve problems on the other side teachers use technologies which can be thought as educational technologies to help students to learn content better (Loveland, 2012).  So there is need to examine the use of educational technology in technology classrooms.  Even technology teachers are accustomed to use technologies in their classroom it is critical to select and use technologies that promote self-reflection and higher-order thinking of students (Loveland, 2012).  

Educational technology and technology education, while separate entities within education, share many commonalities, and as a result, provide synergies for teaching (Loveland, 2012, p.134).  

In the digital age technology teachers were encountered with the digital natives in the classrooms. By the way developing problem solving and critical thinking skills of students become more important rather learning technological skills. Thus the pedagogies that technology teachers use can be insufficient and needed to be changed (Loveland, 2012). In this point TPACK framework can be a flexible model to decide to use which pedagogies with which technology in which context.  

It was mentioned that there were limited studies in the literature about using TPACK in technology domain but in one of the study Doukakis, Psaltidou, Stavraki, Adamopoulos, Tsiotakis and Stergou (2010) examine the TPACK levels of secondary computer science teachers. As a result they indicate that teachers are less confident with their pedagogical content knowledge and technological content knowledge.
There were many tools to measure TPACK as described in measuring TPACK chapter. TPACK-deep scale is one of them which is different from the other measurement tools in terms of its structure. It has sub-factors which were: design, exertion, ethics and proficiency. This tool views TPACK as a whole entity as shown in figure 4 (Kabakci Yurdakul, Odabasi, Kilicer, Coklar, Birinci &amp; Kurt, 2012).

Figure 4. TPACK-deep framework and its factors (Kabakci Yurdakul, Odabasi, Kilicer, Coklar, Birinci &amp; Kurt, 2012)

In this chapter The TPACK framework shown in figure 3 used a lens for criticize technology teachers in terms of TPACK. Thus for a technology teacher it is important to consider these issues related with TPACK.

* Design: How well is a technology teacher in creating and developing curriculum plans, teaching and learning environments, combining appropriate technological tools and resources to maximize learning technology topics and related skills? 
*  
* Exertion: By using appropriate technologies and solutions how a technology teacher implement her/his design plans and conduct assessments and evaluations? 
*  
* Ethics: What are the issues related with legal and ethical behaviors for a technology teacher in terms of technology-related ethical issues and teacher professional issues? 
*  
* Proficiency: How can a technology teacher be proficient for being leadership in terms of integrating technology into teaching technology? How can a technology teacher demonstrate the innovative use of technological resources while teaching technology?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Item to add for Magnetic Interactions section ==

August, 2013 Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS test a new propulsion system developed in the University of Maryland's Space Power and Propulsion Laboratory. An electromagnetic propulsion technology called the Resonant Inductive Near-field Generation System (RINGS) that uses a combination of electromagnets (magnetic fields and reaction wheels) in spacecraft in formation that can move and change their attitude and even spin increase their service life by reducing the need for a propellant.

The term propulsion system may be an imprecise definition since the concept it is more focused in changing the relative position/attitude of components in a group of spacecraft flaying in group, Electron Magnetic Formation Flaying (EMFF), without changing the center of mass of the group than imparting continual propulsion.

According to an MIT study when EMFF is perfected, it will have a wide number of applications including interferometers, space telescopes where each satellite carries a section of mirror, generating artificial gravity, creating a magnet shield against solar radiation storms, and clearing space debris by using their spin to toss the debris into a safer trajectory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To whom it may concern,
The list of links proposed in the Video Production/Independent Online Video Distribution page is not a list of links that could help an indy video producer or maker publish his/her video. It is rather a list of a certain and single type of political activism sites and forums that also use video as a mean to forward political ideas in actual social, racial, political and economic struggles. That said anyone can agree or not to the ideas or the ideals portrayed there, it's not really the point. Rather the fact that info or links about non-political but major indy video distributors have been thoroughly ignored. By the way, politically toned videos and documentaries on sociopolitical issues are to be found aplenty in 'real' distribution sites, however it will not be the only type of subject and never presented under a single flag.[[Special:Contributions/2.192.95.59|2.192.95.59]] ([[User talk:2.192.95.59|discuss]]) 21:27, 5 September 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please be aware that some of the links are no longer correct and some resources have been rendered obsolete due to changes in policy and regulation.  However, many of the resources are currently still of value and you can update any links to more relevant material

In October 2011, ITTE, together with partners Core-Education and the University of Bedfordshire, were awarded funding from JISC/HEA for a ‘Digital Literacy and Creativity’ project.  The project focuses on the use of Open Educational Resources (OER) to raise the level of digital literacy in higher education.  As part of this project, some of the ICT-Tutors resources will be revised and updated and, where this occurs, the ‘new’ resources will be hosted on the ITTE website.

The materials were originally made available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/ Open Government Licence (OGL).]

This template is supposed to appear at the top of every page under [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary]] to help readers navigate through the list.

'''Do not add this template ''directly'' to a page''' (unless you have a good reason to ignore this rule). Instead, '''add the {{tl|Cocktails list header}} template to each page'''. It incorporates this template inside the page header, so also adding this template directly would result in it appearing twice on a page.

This section explores Boyle’s Law and the relation between the pressure and volume of an ideal gas. In general, Boyle’s Law states that as the volume decreases, the pressure of an ideal gas increases. The opposite is also true: as the volume of an ideal gas increases, the pressure decreases as a result. In other words, these two properties are inversely related. For simplicity, we will only consider gases that are at a constant temperature.

[[File:Lab picture.jpg|thumb|Figure 1. Weights were added to a cup steadied on top of a syringe. Using LoggerPro and a Vernier pressure sensor, the pressure (''mg/A'') and volume can be measured to see the dependencies for Boyle's Law. One can also [http://www.vernier.com/innovate/inexpensive-adiabatic-gas-law-apparatus/ measure temperature] to verify the process is isothermal.]]

Let us consider the isothermal process in which an ideal gas remains at a constant temperature. The formula PV = NkBT 
describes the state of a gas at some point. This can be rearranged so that pressure equals: &lt;math&gt; P = \frac{Nk_BT}{V} &lt;/math&gt;, where ''N'' is the number 
of particles, ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the Boltzmann constant, ''T'' is temperature in Kelvin, and ''V'' is volume in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  To illustrate this relationship, Figure 1 shows the inverse relationship of pressure related to volume.
[[File:Figure 1. Pressure related to volume.png|thumb|Figure 2. Pressure vs. volume obtained using the method described here.]]

To calculate the work done on an ideal gas, the formula &lt;math&gt;W = -P \Delta V&lt;/math&gt; must be considered. Recall that pressure and volume are inversely related, so if pressure changes then volume will also undergo a change. Since both variables are changing, we must use the integral to consider this change: &lt;math&gt; W = -P dV = -\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \frac{Nk_BT}{V} dV &lt;/math&gt;. If we then take out the constants, this formula can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt; W = -Nk_BT \int_{V_i}^{V_f} \frac{1}{V} dV &lt;/math&gt;. Evaluating the integral gives us the following equation: &lt;math&gt; W = -Nk_BT \Bigg( ln(V_f)-ln(V_i)\Bigg) &lt;/math&gt;, which can also be written as: &lt;math&gt; W = Nk_BT ln \Bigg( \frac{V_i}{V_f} \Bigg) &lt;/math&gt;. This is the work done for an ideal gas with a constant temperature and a change in volume.


To illustrate Boyle's Law, you can do a simple experiment involving a syringe, weights, and a pressure meter. Figure 1 and 3 shows the setup used for this demonstration. First, measure the pressure when there are no weights placed on top of the syringe. This should be atmospheric pressure, which is around 101,325 Pascals. To measure the change in pressure and volume, begin by placing weights on top of the syringe until the plunger moves to the next milliliter mark. At this point, measure the mass, pressure, volume, and distance from one milliliter marking to the next. Continue with this procedure until the plunger reaches the 1 milliliter marking or until the pressure sensor reaches its maximum reading. Once you have collected all the data, graph the pressure versus volume. You can also calculate the work done by using the derived formula above and compare it to the formula &lt;math&gt; W = mgx &lt;/math&gt; where ''m'' is the mass in kg of the weights, ''g'' is the gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''x'' is the distance the plunger moved in meters. 

Figure 3 displays a diagram of the experimental setup where the plunger has gone down one milliliter (from 5 mL to 4 mL) due to the force of the 400 g pushing on the top of the plunger. The syringe is hooked up to a pressure meter which displays the pressure readout in kPa on the computer screen using LoggerPro.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
{{tl|Cocktails list entry}} is a template designed for use within the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary]] subpages.

=== Usage ===
;All attributes
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Cocktails list entry
|name     = &lt;!-- the name of the cocktail --&gt;
|see      = &lt;!-- enter the portion of the page name link under Bartending/Cocktails/&lt;name&gt; of the main entry --&gt;
|see-link = &lt;!-- use if the actual page name differs from the visible name entered under 'see' --&gt;
|image    = &lt;!-- only the filename with the extension; e.g. filename.jpg --&gt;
|img-size = &lt;!-- defaults to '100px', which generally is a good size for the list of cocktails --&gt;
|ingr     = &lt;!-- start a bulleted list on the next line --&gt;
|descr    = &lt;!-- a written description, especially important if there is no image --&gt;
|method   = &lt;!-- how you make the cocktail --&gt;
|notes    = &lt;!-- or 'notes' if you have more than one; for multiple, start a bulleted list on the next line --&gt;
|iba      = &lt;!-- IBA official cocktail: 'yes' for link or the numerical ID of the page on IBA's Website --&gt;
|iba-link = &lt;!-- if 'iba' is not 'yes', overrides default link to a specific page ID on IBA's Website --&gt;
|iba-text = &lt;!-- if 'iba' is not 'yes', the visible name for the link; defaults to 'Official Website' --&gt;
|sources  = &lt;!-- or 'source'; a comma separated list of reliable third-party sources: Website, books, etc --&gt;
|see-also = &lt;!-- enter one or more complete wikilinks or interwiki links to related pages or articles --&gt;
|btg      = &lt;!-- Bartending Guide entry; if set to 'yes', it defaults to Bartending/Cocktail/&lt;name&gt; --&gt;
|books    = &lt;!-- English Wikibooks page; no default value, so it must be a full page name --&gt;
|wiki     = &lt;!-- English Wikipedia article; if set to 'yes', uses the entry name for the article name --&gt;
|media    = &lt;!-- Wikimedia Commons category; if set to 'yes', uses the entry name for the cat name --&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Except for '''''name''''', all the parameters are optional. However, an entry with nothing other than a name is completely useless. At a minimum, there should be a ''description'' (or the shorter ''descr'') and/or a ''method''. It also is very nice to include an ''image'' and ''ingredients'' (or the shorter ''ingr'').

If there is a page in the Bartending Guide for the cocktail, then you '''must''' include it using the ''btg'' parameter or the ''books'' parameter (if it is stored somewhere other than under &quot;Bartending/Cocktails/&quot;).

The parameters ''notes'' and ''sources'' both have singular names that are preferred if you only have a single note or source to add. Please correct this usage if you notice someone added or removed a note or source causing a mismatch in the entry.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
Displays a common header across all the subpages of the [[Bartending|Bartending Guide]] [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary|List of Cocktails]].

Note that the template grabs the first letter of the subpage name and displays it, assuming that the template is on one of the subpages. This template should not be used elsewhere unless you also add a method of avoiding that assumption.

=== Usage ===
At the top of each subpage of [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary|Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary/]], add the following two lines:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Cocktails list header}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

This will add the following header to the page, along with a detailed table of contents (TOC). Neither the header nor the TOC will not appear if the subpage is transcluded into another page.

;Apple Martini (aka Appletini)
:Vodka and either apple juice, apple cider or apple liqueur. Typically, the apple vodka is shaken or stirred with a sweet and sour mix and then strained into a Martini glass. May be garnished with a slice of Granny Smith apple.

;Apple Pie Shooter
:2 oz (6nbsp;cl) apple juice, 1 oz (3&amp;nbsp;cl) vodka, whipped cream in a can, and cinnamon sugar in a salt or pepper shaker. Two people are required. The designated drinker sits in a chair with head back and mouth open.  The second person pours the apple juice and then the vodka into the mouth.  In order for the full taste of the drink to come out, the drinker must keep his or her throat closed, this also prevents choking.  The second person then adds a good size shot of whipped cream and a light sprinkling of the cinnamon sugar.  The drinker then sits up, swishes to mix the ingredients, swallows.  There can be different recipes for this shot; some do 1 part vodka, 1 part apple juice; others do 2:1 parts, it all depends on how strong the shot is wanted.

;Apricot Pie
:0.5&amp;nbsp;oz (1.5&amp;nbsp;cl) light rum, 0.5&amp;nbsp;oz (1.5&amp;nbsp;cl) sweet vermouth, 4 dashes each of apricot brandy and lemon juice, 2 dashes of grenadine. Shake mixture with ice and strain into a glass.

;Around The World
:Brandy, Whisky, Gin, Vodka, rum,Tequila &amp; Beer.

;Avenger
:2&amp;nbsp;oz (6nbsp;cl) vodka, 1&amp;nbsp;oz (3&amp;nbsp;cl) energy drink, 2&amp;nbsp;oz (6nbsp;cl) orange juice, 2&amp;nbsp;oz (6nbsp;cl) pineapple juice, dash lemon juice, dash bitters. Use a Collins glass with or without ice, dash in the lemon juice and bitters, add the energy drink, fill up the glass with even amounts of orange and pineapple juice, stir all ingredients, garnish with a lemon wedge. The Avenger is a sweet party cocktail with a tropical flavour, originating from Melbourne, Australia.

;Aviation
:2&amp;nbsp;oz (6nbsp;cl) gin (or vodka), 1&amp;nbsp;oz (3&amp;nbsp;cl) lemon juice, 1&amp;nbsp;oz (3&amp;nbsp;cl) maraschino liqueur. Shake or stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass. Serve with a cherry. Common brands of maraschino are Maraska, Luxardo and Stock. Other cherry-flavoured liqueurs or the syrup from maraschino cherries should not be substituted, as they are much sweeter and have a very different taste.</text>

Erica: Hola. Te veo en este tren todos los días. ¿Vas a trabajar?

Vanessa: Si. Tengo un viaje de una hora cada mañana.

Erica: ¡Yo también! Trabajo en una panadería en el Lower East Side. ¿En que trabajas?

Vanessa: Yo soy una maestra. Trabajo en el Lower East Side tambien.

Erica: ¿A que horas empiezas?

Vanessa: Los niños empiezan a las ocho de la mañana.

Erica: ¡Te gusta llegar al trabajo muy temprano!

Vanessa: Este tren es impredecible. Puedo tomar el cuatro o cinco para ir a trabajar. Ha habido un montón de construcción esta semana pasada. Prefiero llegar al trabajo temprano que tarde.

Erica: Eso tiene sentido. Los niños dependen en ti.

Vanessa: ¡La gente que toma café en esta área también dependen en ti!

Erica: Tienes razón. He trabajado en esta panadería por cinco años y hay gente que viene todo los días que son como familia ya.

Vanessa: ¿Ordenan la misma cosa todo los días?

Erica: Exactamente lo mismo todo los días.

Vanessa: Bueno, esta es mi parada. Ten un buen día.

Erica: Tu también.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is part of the IBA template family. It is used in the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary|Bartending Guide Cocktails Glossary]], but it is generic enough that it should be usable in other situations.

==IBA templates==
* '''{{tl|IBA-cocktail}}''' (or simply {{tl|IBA}} - identifies cocktails that are recognized by the [[Bartending/Organizations/International Bartenders Association]]

==Parameters==
# The type of cocktail: One of three recognized values (although unrecognized or empty values will default to the value of &quot;official&quot;)
#* &quot;official&quot; - For cocktails designated by the IBA as &quot;Official Cocktails&quot; of the IBA
#* &quot;win&quot; or &quot;winning&quot; - For cocktails selected as &quot;Winning Cocktails&quot; at an IBA competition
# Link ID or URL: This is an optional parameter. The IBA Website's URL have a unique parameter named &quot;id&quot;. Entering the number here taken from the URL following &quot;id=&quot; will automatically generate a link to that page on the IBA Website. If the ID cannot be determined, you can copy the entire URL here; however, that might make it more difficult to update links later if the IBA changes things on their Website.
# Link text: This is an optional parameter. The template displays &quot;Official Website&quot; as the default text for any generated link. You may specify any text here to override the default. This either has to be the third parameter ''or'' the named parameter '''text='''.

==Examples==
;IBA-cocktail with no parameters
 {{tl|IBA-cocktail}}
Produces the following output: {{IBA-cocktail}}


;IBA-cocktail with &quot;official&quot; as the first parameter
 {{tlx|IBA-cocktail|official}}
Produces the following output: {{IBA-cocktail|official}}&lt;br /&gt;
Which is the same as was produced with the default values.


;IBA-cocktail with &quot;winning&quot; as the first parameter
 {{tlx|IBA-cocktail|winning}}
Produces the nearly the same output: {{IBA-cocktail|winning}}&lt;br /&gt;
However, the color of the badge is different, and the text is wikilinked to a different part of the article.&lt;br /&gt;
Note that you could substitute the shorter &quot;win&quot; for &quot;winning&quot;, and the result would be identical.


;IBA-cocktail with &quot;official&quot; as the first parameter and an ID for the second parameter
The complete URL for an [[Bartending/Cocktails/Alexander|Alexander]] (obtained by right-clicking on the IBA's link and opening the link in a new tab or window) is&amp;#x003A;&lt;br /&gt;
:[http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=89&amp;tmpl=component&amp;task=preview&amp;Itemid=532 http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content'''&amp;id=89'''&amp;tmpl=component&amp;task=preview''&amp;Itemid=532'']&lt;br /&gt;
Note the bolded portion: &quot;&amp;id=89&quot; The number 89 is the ID number that we need to use. Please do not confuse it with the &quot;&amp;Itemid=532&quot; at the end of the URL; that is a completely different (and useless for us) part of the URL.
 {{tlx|IBA-cocktail|official|89}}
Produces the following output:&lt;br /&gt;
{{IBA-cocktail|official|89}}&lt;br /&gt;
Following the &quot;Official Website&quot; link above should take you directly to a slightly different page than you were on, but it should display the same drink along with additional information.


If you really like to be precise, you always can specify an ID value with the parameter name:
 {{tlx|IBA-cocktail|official|id=89}}
{{IBA-cocktail|official|id=89}}


;IBA-cocktail with &quot;winning&quot; as the first parameter and an ID for the second parameter
Winning Cocktails do not have individual pages, but are found on pages organized in multi-year collections. The URL for the IBA Winning Cocktails (2010-2019) collection is&amp;#x003A;&lt;br /&gt;
:[http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=159&amp;Itemid=530 http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id='''159'''''&amp;Itemid=530'']&lt;br /&gt;
Again, note the bolded portion: &quot;&amp;id=159&quot; The number 159 is the ID number that we need to use to access that page. Please do not confuse it with the &quot;&amp;Itemid=530&quot; at the end of the URL.
 {{tlx|IBA-cocktail|winning|159}}
Produces the following output:&lt;br /&gt;
{{IBA-cocktail|winning|159}}&lt;br /&gt;
Following the &quot;Official Website&quot; link above should take you back to the original page than you were on.


;Using full URLs for links
If you are unable to determine the correct ID number, you can try entering the full URL of the page. It is not the preferred way to do it, but it is better than not including any link. The parameter name &quot;link=&quot; is required for this to work.
 {{tlx|IBA-cocktail|official|link=http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=89&amp;tmpl=component&amp;task=preview&amp;Itemid=532}}
{{IBA-cocktail|official|link=http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=89&amp;tmpl=component&amp;task=preview&amp;Itemid=532}}
 {{tlx|IBA-cocktail|winning|link=http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=164&amp;Itemid=559}}
{{IBA-cocktail|winning|link=http://www.iba-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=164&amp;Itemid=559}}
 
;Replacing the link text with default links
If you want to change the link text from &quot;Official Website&quot; to something else, like &quot;Alexander: After Dinner Cocktail&quot; or &quot;IBA Winning Cocktails (2010 - 2019)&quot;, that is easy to do. Using the parameter name &quot;text=&quot; is strongly recommended, and it is required if the text contains certain special characters (the equals sign being the most notorious troublemaker).
 {{tlx|IBA-cocktail|official|89|text=Alexander: After Dinner Cocktail}}
{{IBA-cocktail|official|89|text=Alexander: After Dinner Cocktail}}
 {{tlx|IBA-cocktail|winning|164|text=IBA Winning Cocktails (2010 - 2019)}}
{{IBA-cocktail|winning|164|text=IBA Winning Cocktails (1960 - 1969)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the early 21st century, social drama in Switzerland is given strong impetus by Jakob Bärfuss (?-?) with &quot;Alices reise in die Schweiz&quot; (Alice's voyage in Switzerland, 2007) concerning the limits of euthanasia. 

==Alice's voyage in Switzerland==

Time: 2000s. Place: Hamburg, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland.

In an apartment in Germany, Dr Gustav Strom, an euthanasialogist, explains to Alice the procedure involved in preparing for assisted suicide. She must travel to Switzerland, where the procedure is legal, though with many constraints on the unpaid practitioner. He advises Alice to tell her mother, Lotte, of her intention. Thinking that Lotte might try to prevent her suicide, she is hesitant, but at last does so. At first Lotte does not believe her, then tries to make her change her mind, but without success. Hearing of Gustav's practice and believing in its humanitarian purpose in alleviating needless pain, Eva asks Gustav for a position as his assistant, which he accepts, specifying details on how she must look in front of the client. &quot;No makeup, no perfume,&quot; he orders. &quot;You are young: that alone may be a provocation.&quot; A second client, John, an Englishman, is about to be injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital when he asks for a glass of whiskey. It makes him drunk, reminding him that his mother believed one spent eternity in the state one died in, so that he calls off their agreement, though promising to return. Since her daughter has already tried to kill herself in the past, Gustav tries to obtain from Lotte her consent to his services, but she resists. Subject to a chronic disease whose symptoms have worsened, John returns with a crutch, but is nevertheless unable to submit to the injection, though once more promising to return. Because of his commitment to assisted death, Gustav is eradicated from the Order of Physicians. Unable to prescribe pentobarbital, he is forced to change his method. He gives him flunitrazepam, a minor tranquillizer, combined with covering of the head with a plastic bag. Though previously he had approved of the doctor's humanitarian purposes, the owner of his apartment no longer does. Because of his persistence, Gustav is arrested and interviewed by a psychiatrist, but then released. John returns but, despite being an estimated two weeks from death as a result of his disease, he is unable once again to submit to the procedure. After leaving her mother in a numbed state, Alice returns to the doctor in a shabby apartment, drinks the sedative, but, contrary to their agreement, asks the doctor to place the bag over her head. For legal reasons, Gustav insists she does so herself. Alice obeys and dies.

Ulrich Richter, co-president of the oil company, Richter &amp; Havers, is angry that his business partner, Garret, has convinced the board of directors on reducing the price of oil without consulting him. Because of the danger Garret represents within the company, Ulrich convinces Nold Havers, the other co-president, and Nold's son, Kurt, of the need to have him murdered. He hires Basilio, an employee at his private firing range and secretly his bastard son but adopted by Jeremias, mainly responsible for preparing the firearms. Basilio succeeds in killing Garret and burying him without a trace. To consolidate power within their ranks, Ulrich forces his daughter, Elena, to marry Kurt. Ulrich's son, Evard, arrives for the wedding ceremony of his sister. Since being told he accidently shot his mother at the age of ten, when actually his father killed her at the firing range, Evard has lived aloof from business matters, to his father's disappointment. To his further grief, Evard wants to divulge he is Basilio's half-son, because the latter, unconscious of the incestuous relation, has been for several years Elena's lover. Unable to convince his son to desist, Ulrich hires Celio, another employee at the firing range, to murder him. A third employee, Fabio, informs Celio that Jeremias, whom all three employees hate, has accidently fallen down a flight of stairs and is seriously injured. Celio believes Fabio pushed him down, which the latter denies in great fear. Jealous at Kurt's happiness, Basilio murders Elena during the wedding ceremony and escapes with her dead body. When Evard catches up to Basilio, he gives up and hangs himself. On seeing Celio arrive, Evard immediately understands he is to be his father's next victim and submits himself to being shot to death. Ulrich and Nold decide to cede control of the company to Kurt. At the end of a business deal with a cardinal concerning a Renaissance painting from the Vatican, Ulrich starts feeling sick and begs him to absolve his sins during confession, but becomes anguished when the pardon comes too easily. He dies terrified at imagined flames about his person. To Fabio's disappointment, Celio, as the new boss, becomes a second Jeremias to him, a tyrant bitterly complaining about the quality of his work.

This template generates a table of examples for use in template documentation.

== Usage ==
&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
 &amp;#123;{template example row|arg1}&amp;#125;
 &amp;#123;{template example row|arg1|arg2|arg3}&amp;#125;
 &amp;#123;{template example row|arg1|arg2|arg3|arg4|arg5}&amp;#125;
 &lt;/table&gt;

 &lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
 &amp;#123;{template example row|arg1|notes=...}&amp;#125;
 &amp;#123;{template example row|arg1|arg2|arg3|notes=...}&amp;#125;
 &amp;#123;{template example row|arg1|arg2|arg3|arg4|arg5|notes=...}&amp;#125;
 &lt;/table&gt;

 &lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;

This template tests whether a value is numeric (or at least, that it can be treated as such by the expression ParserFunction).

=== Usage ===
By default, simply writing &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Isnumeric|1,327}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (where 1,327 is an example number) will pass through the parameter if it's numeric and be blank if it's not. If the parameter &lt;code&gt;boolean=true&lt;/code&gt; is given, as in &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Isnumeric|1,327|boolean=true}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then the template will output &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; if numeric and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; if not numeric.

=== Examples ===
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;code&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;result&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
{{Template example row|1,327.50}}
{{Template example row|9,999 (1950)}}
{{Template example row|9999999999999}}
{{Template example row|500 metres}}
{{Template example row|500*500}}
{{Template example row|9.999e50}}
{{Template example row|1+1}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adjectives always come after the noun. Otherwise they are called determiners.
 
* '''oga porã''' - the beautiful house
* '''jagua kane'o''' - tired dog
 
However, a personal determiner can make the adjective become a qualifying verb.

* '''ChePorã.''' - I am beautiful.
* '''CheKane'o''' - I am tired.

When an adjective follows a conjugated verb, it becomes an adverb.

* '''Pe karai omba'apo Porã.''' - This sir works well.

Also, if there is no determiner before the adjective, it is a noun.

* '''Kane'o ñande mboJavy.''' - The tiredness made us commit a mistake.
 
Adjectives may also become nouns when suffixed with '''Kue''' (oral) or '''ngue''' (nasal).
 
* '''Puku''' - thick
* '''Pukukue''' thickness
* '''Morotĩ''' - white
* '''Morotĩngue''' whiteness

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

{{tl|{{PAGENAME}}}} inserts the name of the template currently being documented.  It is equivalent to either &amp;#123;{PAGENAME}&amp;#125; or &amp;#123;{BASEPAGENAME}&amp;#125; depending on whether the currently viewed page is the documentation subpage or the template itself (which presumably transcludes the documentation subpage via {{tl|template doc}}).

=== Usage ===
Returns &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2|1}}} if {{{1}}} is numeric &amp; {{{3|0}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; otherwise.

==Examples==

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Notes==
This template will not recognize formatted numbers, which is by design since formatted numbers will break expression parsers.  To remove the formatting from a number, you can wrap the number first in &lt;nowiki&gt;{{formatnum:&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''number'' &lt;nowiki&gt;|R}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 

&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;code&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;result&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|1,000.50|a number|not a number}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}}|1,000.50|a number|not a number}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yoruba (natively ''èdè Yorùbá'') is a Niger–Congo language spoken in West Africa. The number of speakers of Yoruba was estimated at around 20 million in the 1990s.

The native tongue of the Yoruba people is spoken, among other languages, in Nigeria, Benin, and Togo and in communities in other parts of Africa, Europe and the Americas. A variety of the language, Lucumi, is the liturgical language of the Santeria religion of the Caribbean. The language is also used in Ketu, a branch of the Candomblé religion in Brazil.

It is most closely related to the Owo and Itsekiri language (spoken in the Niger-Delta) and Igala spoken in central Nigeria, which are smaller languages spoken in neighbouring regions.

      <comment>/* Consonants */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The structure of Yoruba syllables is slightly different from English. There are three kinds of syllables that may be formed:

*Consonant + vowel
*Vowel alone
*Syllabic nasal

==Consonants==

|-
|Y y 
|{{IPA|j}}

|}

In Benin, Ṣ/ṣ and V/v are represented, respectively, as Sh/sh and W/w.

==Vowels==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Letter

! Pronunciation of the letter (English approximation)
|-
|A a
|{{IPA|a}}
|Like ''a'' in ''father''
|-
|E e

|Almost like in ''say'', but a single release
|-
|Ẹ ẹ 
|{{IPA|ɛ}}
|Like in &quot;well&quot;
|-
|I i

|-
|Ọ ọ 
|{{IPA|ɔ}}
|Like in &quot;wall&quot;
|-
|U u
|{{IPA|u}}
|Like in ''you''
|}

In Benin, Ẹ/ẹ and Ọ/ọ are represented, respectively, as Ɛ/ɛ and Ɔ/ɔ.

==&quot;N&quot;==

The letter ''n'', in Yoruba, does not exist as a phoneme, but it may have three uses, depending on the context:

* Syllabic nasal
* Nasal vowel
* Allophone of &quot;l&quot;

===Syllabic nasal===

When a syllable is formed only by an ''n'', it is called a syllabic nasal. It may have different pronunciations, depending on the following consonants.

When it precedes a vowel it is a velar nasal /ŋ/, like in ''sing''. In other cases its place of articulation is homorganic with the following consonant, using the same place of articulation.

===Nasal vowel===

When ''n'' follows a vowel by the end of the syllable, it causes the preceding vowel to be nasalised. The vowel may either be ''ẹ'', ''i'', ''ọ'' or ''u'', that get a nasal vibration during their respective realisations. Sometimes, nasal ''ọ'' sounds pretty much like nasal ''a''. However, vowels ''a'', ''e'' and ''o'' cannot be nasalised.

Sometimes, nasal vowels are not represented not by a preceding, but by a succeeding ''n'' (see below.)

In IPA, nasalisation is represented by a tilde (~) over the vowel. 

===Allophone of l=== 

The letter ''l'' can never precede a nasal vowel. If it appears in such environment, the nasal vowel is written as oral (that is, without the succeeding ''n'') and the ''l'' is written as ''n'', pronounced /n/, like in English.

==Tone==

Yoruba is a tonal language with three level tones: high, low, and mid (or &quot;the default tone&quot;.)
 
Every syllable must have at least one tone, a syllable containing a long vowel can have two tones. Contour tones (i.e. rising or falling tone melodies) are usually analysed as separate tones occurring on adjacent tone bearing units (morae) and thus have no phonemic status.

Tones are marked by use of the acute accent for high tone (⟨á⟩, ⟨ń⟩), the grave accent for low tone (⟨à⟩, ⟨ǹ⟩). Mid is unmarked, except on syllabic nasals where it is indicated using a macron (⟨a⟩, ⟨n̄⟩).

Colloquial writing and even some literary texts may ignore diacritics, usually these representing tone, but also the dot used under ''e'', ''o'' and ''s'', seen as completely different letters.

==Salutation==

Depending on the time of the day, different salutations may be used.

* '''Ẹ káàárọ.''' - good morning
* '''Ẹ káàsán.''' - good afternoon
* '''Ẹ Kálẹ.''' or '''Ẹ Káàlẹ.''' - good evening or good night

To present yourself, you can use the following expression:

* '''Orúkọ mi ni ...''' - My name is...

To ask how the person is:

* '''Ṣe dádá nì?''' - How are you?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Welcome to the ICT tutors support website==
This website is for newly appointed tutors to initial teacher training

The purpose of this website is to provide you with information, guidance, support and advice to help you make the transition from teaching school pupils to training prospective teachers of ICT.

The resources on this website are organised as follows:
* Sources of support - information on induction and research support offered by ITTE, the Teacher Training Resource Bank, other associations offering support and on keeping up to date
* Tutor Issues - information and ideas to help you develop the knowledge and skills needed to train inexperienced teachers
* Teaching and Learning - information and resources you can use with trainees on teaching ICT
* Assessment - information and resources to help you assess trainees and teach them how to assess their students
* Research - guidance on how to become an accomplished researcher, plus information on research relevant to your new role
* Resources - useful links and information on materials you might need as a teacher trainer
* Glossary - abbreviations and acronyms associated with ICT and ITT
This site was developed as part of a project (funded by the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) 2004 to 2009) to improve the quality of initial teacher training in ICT, with a particular focus on supporting new ICT tutors in the UK. 

Please help us to meet your needs by telling us what you think of it so far and giving us your suggestions for improvements or additions. Also, if you have queries that are not answered here, contact us and we will do our best to resolve them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Acknowledgements==

Phases 1 and 2 of this induction project have been completed.

===Phase 1 - 2004-2006===
The IT Network ITT Induction Project, funded by the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) from 2004 until 2006, developed this website and provided an induction programme for new secondary ICT tutors each year.

The project was guided by a steering group with representatives drawn from the major UK ICT subject associations.

The team of contributors who developed the content for the website in Phase 1 were:

* Richard Bennett, University of Chester 
* Margaret Hancock, Independent consultant
* Michael Hammond, University of Warwick
* Steve Kennewell, University of Wales Swansea
* David Longman, Richard Clarke and Lynne Jones, University of Wales Newport
* David Short, Park View School, Chester le Street, Durham
* Neil Stanley, Liverpool John Moores University
* Georgina Stein and Nyree Scott, client [c&amp;it] research, development &amp; publication unit, Canterbury Christ Church University College
* Mary Webb, Kings College, London
* John Woollard, University of Southampton

===Phase 2 - 2006 - 2009===
ITTE took over the project from the IT Network in the summer of 2006. The TDA agreed to fund the project for a further three years. Whilst the brief was similar to that in phase 1, the project scope was widened to include primary and post-16 ICT tutors. We also aimed to give more recognition to the fact that trainee teachers, too, may find the materials useful. A summary of the ITTE project proposal, including proposed new resources, can be downloaded here:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
Since ITTE was formed in 1986 it has supported the initial teacher training departments of universities and colleges of education in the United Kingdom with respect to the permeation of information communication technology (ICT) throughout all aspects of the learning process. 

During 2003 – 2006, ITTE contributed to the IT Network Induction Project. This was a project designed to support new ICT tutors in initial teacher training. In 2006, ITTE was awarded the contract to manage phase two of the project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Research? Where do I start?==
Feeling daunted by your institution’s expectations of your research? Have you a hypothesis you are just dying to investigate but aren’t sure where to start or how to proceed? ITTE is keen to encourage quality research in the UK. 

==Research Guidance==
Check out the [[research section]] on this website for guidance and advice written specifically for new researchers. The section on Doing Research contains helpful pointers to get you started.

==Research Seminar Sponsorship==
Sponsorships are being offered to budding researchers wishing to attend the ITTE Research Seminar, which takes place every two years at the Møller Centre, Churchill College, Cambridge. Nine new tutors were sponsored to attend the 2008 seminar and the same number of sponsored places will be available for the February 2010 seminar. Sponsorship covers the cost of the seminar fees. Eligible tutors are those who have been in UK-based ITT, teaching ICT for three years or less at the start of the seminar. Information about how to apply will be posted here the term before the event and circulated to ITTE members.

==Workshop and Research Mentorship==
Support to engage in research is offered in the form of a one-day workshop, early in the summer term , and subsequent partnership with a research mentor. Ten tutors attended the 2009 workshop and a similar number will be supported in 2010. The workshop and mentor service will be provided free of charge. A requirement of those participating in this scheme is that they publish an article in the ITTE newsletter or make a presentation at the Annual ITTE Conference or the ITTE Research Seminar. The target is that they publish a paper in any relevant educational journal. Joint publication with a mentor is encouraged. UK-based tutors within the first three years of their ICT ITT appointment will be given priority but those in their 4th or 5th year will be considered if there is spare capacity within the allocated budget. Further details of the next workshop will be available here and circulated to ITTE members early in 2010.

==Engaged in research already?==
If you are engaged in research, have several publications under your belt and would be willing to help a budding researcher to develop their research/publication skills by being a mentor and, possibly, a co-researcher, then please send your CV to Margaret Danby using the link below. This isn’t a competitive situation. Having access to your CV will help us to match new researchers to a mentor with similar interests.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you become a teacher trainer you may find that the support systems that served you well as a teacher are no longer available to you or are not as helpful to you in your new role. In this section we provide information about a range of associations that may be able to provide the support you need.

==Higher Education Academy==

Individuals or bodies concerned with higher education may become members of the Higher Education Academy by completing an accredited course or submitting the required evidence directly to the organisation.

The three categories of professional recognition available for members are Associate of the Higher Education Academy (AHEA), Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) and Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (SFHEA). The first two are conferred by either the Recognition Scheme or completion of an Academy accredited programme which incurs a one-off fee of £50, whilst the third is by Recognition Scheme only and incurs a one-off fee of £200. Establishments applying to become Centres of Excellence in teaching and learning have found membership beneficial as a means of proving dedication and a source of required evidence. Being a member of the Higher Education Academy enables you to become involved in shaping future national policy and to influence new initiatives relating to higher education by taking part in debates on key issues.

The Higher Education Academy organises regional forums and special interest conferences, which are usually free of charge, or otherwise carry a small fee. In addition, the Higher Education Academy hosts an Annual Conference in the summer at cost of approximately £425 for members for the full conference or £225 per day. It also provides facility for on-line networking, three newsletters a year, suggests publications and offers discounted books/journals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Keeping up to date is a concern for all tutors. Government departments and agencies and professional associations have informative websites and publications but looking for the latest information on each of them is time consuming.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''&quot;It was like I had to shift the lens ……. of the way I look at teaching I mean. I've had to shift from thinking about how I taught in school to how my students are learning to teach from me here in this place, and that's what I really had to learn in the first year; well no, the first two years here, if I'm honest.&quot;''
Sonia – on transferring from teaching in school to training teachers in university (Murray, 2004)

The transfer from being a successful teacher in school to training prospective teachers in higher education is an exciting experience. There are some similarities to teaching pupils, but the differences in the methodology, focus, structure, philosophy, expectation and outcome in preparing students to become teachers can initially prove to be quite daunting. This Tutor Issues section aims to provide you with some information and ideas to help with the transition.

This section includes the following:
* teaching approaches and the role of the tutor;
* ideas for delivering high quality training;
* the Standards for QTS;
* an overview of the various routes into teaching.

Other sections of this website cover related issues such as:
* the expectation that you will engage in research;
* the assessment of trainees against the Standards.

To help you begin the process of shifting your perspective from the pupils to trainee teachers it might be helpful to consider your new role in relation to the learning triangle:

This model provides us with a means of examining the learning situation. The notion is that learning is successful when all three arms of the learning relationship represented by the triangle are in equilibrium. In terms of the relationship between you as a tutor and your trainees the following issues need to be examined:

Tutor-related issues:
* Your subject knowledge
* Your pedagogical knowledge and beliefs
* Your teaching experience and ability

Task related issues:
* The learning activities you use with trainees
* The resources you use and/or prepare
* The assessment methods used 

Learner related issues:
* Trainees' subject knowledge and experience
* Trainees' attitudes and motivation
* Trainees' intellectual ability
* Trainees' knowledge and experience of teaching approaches

Tutor-related Issues

==Your subject knowledge==
As a teacher you may have been in the comfortable position of knowing more about ICT than most of your pupils. However, you will probably have already been in situations where some pupils were sufficiently motivated to become expert in particular fields of ICT – such as website development or games programming. As a teacher education tutor it is likely that most of your trainees will know more about at least one aspect of ICT than you. In some cases, those who have had previous careers may have highly specific knowledge of ICT applications in a work related setting. This can initially be very intimidating. However, it should be remembered that your role as an ICT teacher educator is to help the students appreciate that their role as an ICT teacher is to cover the full range of ICT knowledge, skills and understanding addressed by the various exam boards, curricula and syllabi which they are likely to encounter in schools. In effect, you act as a bridge between their highly focused experience and the reality of the classroom. Your subject knowledge is therefore not only related to an appreciation of the ICT curricula in their various forms, it is also related to ways of helping students discover ways of making this accessible for learners.

To enhance your knowledge of the content of various exam board syllabi and curricula go to the Exam Boards page on this site.

==Your pedagogical knowledge and beliefs==
There are two aspects to this – your knowledge and beliefs about the most effective ways to educate pupils – and your knowledge and beliefs of how to train teachers.

If you have been a school-based mentor, you will probably have already had an opportunity to reflect on your own and others' classroom practices. You will probably have made explicit your views on teaching effectiveness and guided student teachers as they develop classroom management strategies. You will probably already have realised that the most effective approach is not one which attempts to clone your own teaching styles and approaches, but attempts to build on each trainee's personality, preferred teaching styles and past experience.

It is beyond the scope of this web resource to provide you with all the information, guidance and materials you will need to develop your capabilities as a teacher trainer. The following pointers and resources might prove useful however.

The principal purpose of a teacher education course is to enable the students to become independent, informed and effective classroom practitioners. The work of Donald Schon has had a profound effect on the training of teachers. His concepts of the 'reflective practitioner' and 'reflection-on/in-action' have guided the work of many researchers and educationists concerned with enhancing the quality of teaching effectiveness. (See: [http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-schon.htm http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-schon.htm] for more information).

What has proved useful to those engaged in teacher education has been to employ models and rubrics such as the learning triangle used in this section to help their students analyse the factors underlying the effectiveness of their own and others' teaching.

For further information and advice on approaches to teacher education, see:

Fish, D. (1995) Quality Learning for Student Teachers: University Tutors' Educational Practices, London, David Fulton – see particularly Chapter 9 which focuses on ways of engaging students in practical discourse.

See also:

Cowan, J. (1998) On Becoming an Innovative University Teacher: Reflection in Action, Buckingham, SRHE &amp; Open University Press – see particularly Chapter 4 for other models of reflective practice

==Your teaching experience and ability==
As a newly appointed tutor, you will have your past career to draw upon, but very quickly you will form working relationships with teachers in the schools which are in partnership with your training institution. Although the schools may be teaching the same curricula and syllabi, you will find a range of different approaches and philosophies being adopted. What you may find useful is to identify school-based colleagues who are employing interesting or innovative approaches and arrange visits to enable all your trainees to engage in a shared experience. Furthermore, you will find it very useful to make contacts with and visit colleagues in similar institutions. This can best be achieved by joining a professional association such as ITTE (The Association for IT in Teacher Education) or Naace. Participating in the discussion forums and attending conferences organised by these bodies will help with networking and sharing in experiences with colleagues in a similar situation to yourself. 

See the section of this website for further information on professional bodies and other sources of information relevant to ICT and teacher education.

==Task-related Issues==

===Learning activities appropriate for ICT teacher education===
Teaching in school is not the same as teaching in Higher Education. It is likely that the majority of students who participate in an ICT teacher training course will have studied at university and so have an expectation as to how they will be taught in their PGCE course. It may be several years since you studied at university and as a student you may not have been aware of the different teaching approaches to which you were subjected. This section provides you with an overview of various types of activities which you could employ – with particular reference to ICT education.

===a) Teaching approaches===
Lecture– the traditional stand-up lecture is probably the approach you will use least. The numbers of students you will be teaching, the relationships you will aim to develop with your students and also the content matter of your work do not lend themselves to this mode of delivery.

'''Tutorial'''– group tutorials will probably feature strongly in your range of approaches. These can vary in delivery but will often comprise some input from you followed by discussion. As the course progresses, you will increasingly draw upon your students' experiences as starting points for discussions. Individual tutorials will also form part of your armoury – particularly when you need to address particular aspects of a student's progress arising, say, from their school placement(s).

'''Seminar'''– small groups, pairs or individual students prepare and present information on a given topic to the rest of the group. This is a useful means of enabling students with particular expertise to share their knowledge and experiences with the group. It also provides you and the students with an opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness of aspects of others' teaching approaches, such as the use of resources and the clarity of explanations.

'''Demonstrations'''– these can take two forms – one in which you (or a student or colleague) demonstrates the use of a piece of software or piece of equipment – and the other in which you (or a colleague or student) demonstrates a teaching technique. Tutors in some training institutions teach model lessons which the students are required to replicate for analysis by their fellow students.

'''Workshops'''– hands-on activities enabling the students to develop their own skills in the use of ICT resources – or to practise their teaching skills.

'''Directed task / activity'''– students are given clear directions as to what they are required to do. These tasks can be set as 'homework' tasks to be prepared prior to a forthcoming session, or can assigned via distance learning materials such as a Virtual Learning Environment (see below). You may decide to set your students a specific task to be carried out during their school placement (e.g. logging particular classroom incidents, or gathering examples of pupils' work for later in-depth analysis).

'''Distance / online learning'''– most HEIs have invested in virtual learning environments (VLEs) or managed learning environments (MLEs) which enable tutors to place learning materials online for students. These resources have great advantages for teacher training courses as students are required to spend a large proportion of their time in school. At their most basic level, VLEs can be used to place information and copies of the tutor's lecture notes online for students to access. At their most sophisticated, the discussion boards and interactive tools can be used imaginatively to enable students to build a shared understanding of their role as an emergent teacher.

===b) Effective group work===
The most effective approaches to learning and teaching in Higher Education sessions involve some form of groupwork. Various strategies are suggested, some of which may be familiar to your work as a teacher, but others are more specific to Higher Education where there is an expectation that students will be more autonomous.

'''Buzz groups''' - A topic is introduced by the tutor with questions on key aspects (e.g. How would you deal with….). Students break into groups to discuss their response to the question(s). A nominee from each group feeds back the thoughts of the group to the rest of the class.

'''Snowball''' - Tutor asks a question, students write their own thoughts and ideas. They then share their thoughts in pairs or threes. The pairs/threes then combine into larger groups and reach a consensus. The tutor then asks the groups for their responses.

'''Brainstorm''' - Whole class brainstorms ideas focused on a theme (e.g. classroom control). The ideas are written on board by tutor. Groups work together to categorise the ideas into common themes.

'''Case study''' - A case study of a classroom situation is distributed. Students work in groups to reflect on the significance of the situation (e.g. what should the teacher do next). Ideas are then shared with the rest of the class.

'''Peer explaining''' - Groups are given different pieces of information (or research the information themselves) and are expected to summarise the information into a five minute explanation for the rest of the class.

'''Flowcharting''' - As above, but each group produces a flow chart or diagram to summarise a process (e.g. teaching a new topic through a series of activities).

'''Peer teaching''' - A leader is asked to prepare to teach the others in the group a new skill, technique or piece of knowledge. Not only does this reinforce the leader's understanding of the topic (and provide the others with focused input), it helps the students practise and evaluate teaching skills.

'''Jig-saw''' - A topic is divided into, say, four sub-topics – or four differing viewpoints are given of a topic. Students are divided into four groups – each member of the group is assigned a letter. Each group studies one of the sub-topics to reach a common understanding. New groups are formed, using the letters (i.e. all the As, all the Bs, etc. together) so that each new group now includes one person from each of the previous groups. The representative from each of the previous groups must now teach their topic to the others in the group.
The educational background to these activities and more are described in the following texts:

Biggs, J (1999) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, Buckingham, SRHE &amp; Open University Press – see particularly Chapter 5 for suggestions on how to organise sessions to support active learning

Petty, G. (1998) Teaching Today: A Practical Guide, Cheltenham, Nelson Thornes – Part 2 provides a comprehensive overview of interactive approaches to learning and teaching appropriate for the HEI and school classroom 

Geoff Petty's website – http://www.geoffpetty.com/ – includes information and downloadable resources related to active learning and teaching (eg 25 ways to teach without talking)

===c) Resources===
The resources needed for your new job as an ICT teacher education tutor are dependent largely on whether you are joining an established course or you are setting up a new course. 

One would hope that if you are taking over or joining a course which has been running for several years most of the resources will already have been acquired. This will include not only the software and hardware needed for the subject teaching, but also the handouts and web-based resources required for the pedagogical aspects. However, you will undoubtedly find it necessary to review the existing materials to familiarise yourself with what is already available and to decide what needs replacing, improving or to identify what is missing.

If you are setting up a brand new course (or revamping an existing programme), you will clearly have a much bigger job on your hands. Whilst there is no single definitive strategy which will guarantee success you might find the following useful in planning and preparing for your first cohort of students:
#Refer to the Standards for QTS, interpreting them in relation to your subject and your trainees
#Find out how the course is structured – who covers what and when
#Decide on the content for subject knowledge sessions, using the syllabi and curricular documentation relevant to the schools in which your students will be placed as a starting point
#Clarify the number and length of sessions available to you as a subject tutor
#Check on the hardware and software which is currently available – find out the procedures for placing orders for anything which is missing
#Check on the availability of hardware resources and ensure all planned workshop sessions are booked into the institution's timetabling system
#Check on the assessment arrangements for your sections of the course – clarify the focus for any assessment tasks under your control
#Plan in outline the sessions – ensuring you cover aspects of learning and teaching as well as ICT subject knowledge
#Find out (if possible) the background experiences of your intended cohort
#Prepare support materials for the students
For more information on supporting students refer to the Delivering high quality training section of this website. 

===d) Assessment methods===
There is a tendency to assume that assessment is what happens at the end of the course when the students demonstrate that they have or have not met the Standards. Whilst summative assessment is significant for any programme, formative, diagnostic and self-referenced assessment is essential for the progressive development of a student teacher's competency.

====i) Audits====
Probably, the most important form of assessment for you as a new tutor is the initial audit of the students' experiences and skills. These audits are designed to inform you about the levels of experience of individuals and common needs of the cohort and to raise the students' awareness of what is intended to be covered in the course. Audits or tests of ICT knowledge and understanding can be administered through questionnaires or checklists which can be delivered online. ICT skills and experience can be also audited but the questions will have to be carefully framed to enable the students to respond objectively. For example, asking a student to rate the extent of their knowledge of database design on a five point scale will yield highly unreliable results – those who know little might assume they are quite competent, whereas those who have completed a course in database design might realise they have only scratched the surface. Better to provide statements about their use of databases which they can select as being most applicable – e.g. &quot;I have created a simple relational database&quot;.

Examples of online audits:
*NGfL ICT audit for teachers
*The ITTE audit (with details as to where you can acquire it
*Newcastle upon Tyne University ICT audit
Audits of this sort cannot be regarded as 'assessments'. They do not objectively test the students' knowledge, skills and understanding but provide you with self-reported information about their experiences. See also Auditing ICT Skills and also a critique of audits

====ii) Other forms of assessment====
Further information about the assessment of trainees and teaching them about assessment in schools can be found in the assessment section of this website.
 
==Learner-related issues==

As teacher educators we have two sets of learners to deal with – your trainee teachers and the pupils they teach. This page focuses primarily on the trainees and your relationship with them.

===Trainees' subject knowledge and experience===
In the task-related issues section we note the importance of discovering the trainees' levels of subject knowledge when they join the course – by means of an audit. This section focuses on the range of background experiences which your trainees may have before joining the course. 

The majority of those joining PGCE courses will have recently completed an undergraduate course associated with ICT. However, these courses are extremely diverse. Some may have followed single honours courses and hence will have an in-depth knowledge of a range of ICT topics. Their subject knowledge is likely to be quite deep and broad, but there will inevitably be some aspects of the National, GCSE, A Level or GNVQ curriculum with which they lack confidence. 

A number of trainees will have followed combined honours courses, which will have provided them with a range of different experiences with ICT. Some will have focused on web-based technologies, whilst others may have concentrated on aspects of ICT related to business. The subject knowledge of these trainees will inevitably be less secure and less broad. There will be insufficient time during the course for you to cover all areas of the ICT curriculum in sufficient depth and hence the usefulness of the initial audit. You will also find it worthwhile to accumulate and/or develop a range of self study materials to support the development of trainees' subject knowledge. Fortunately, the range of paper- and computer-based study materials for secondary school courses is extensive. See task-related issues section for more information.

There will inevitably be trainees who have decided to change their careers and join the course with experience from commerce, the computer industry or business. They might have highly specialised knowledge but will probably lack the breadth of experience of recent graduates. Often, those changing career are highly committed and willing to put considerable effort into meeting the requirements of the course. Self study materials are of particular value to them.

===Trainees' attitudes and motivation===
It is to be hoped that those joining a teacher training programme are committed and enthusiastic. However, PGCE, GTP and RTP courses are very intensive and trainees are often placed under considerable pressure to meet the requirements within the limited timescale. As a tutor, you may have little influence over your trainees' attitudes towards teaching but you might have opportunities to affect their levels of motivation as the course progresses. In addition to contributing to the trainees' levels of confidence by providing them with ideas, information, frameworks and resources; making yourself available for tutorials, either face to face or via email or video conferencing, can have an important influence on trainees' motivation and willingness to 'stay the course'. 

At times, you will be called into school by mentors who are concerned about a trainees' progress or have anxieties over their professionalism. Trainees' professional attributes form part of the Standards for QTS and hence are assessed. It is part of your responsibilities as a teacher educator to ensure that trainees not only appreciate what is expected of a teacher, but provide good role models for their pupils. Clearly, these issues need to be addressed with sensitivity and tact.

===Trainees' knowledge of teaching approaches===
Although some trainees may commence their ITT courses with some background experience of teaching it is likely that the majority will have limited or little first hand knowledge of what it is to be a teacher. It is therefore your responsibility to introduce them to the finer principles of learning and teaching. You will, of course, have your own experience as a teacher on which to draw but there is an expectation that you will provide trainees with a pedagogical framework which will enable them to structure their approaches to learning and teaching. Although ICT education is a relatively recent curriculum subject, considerable research has been conducted into the educational bases for ICT education. The following provides an overview of the key educational principles related to current classroom practice:

====i) Constructivism====
The key theory underpinning most educational practice in school today

Preface
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a big field, and this is a big book. We have tried to explore the full breadth of the field, which encompasses logic, probability, and continuous mathematics; perception, reasoning, learning, and action; and everything from microelectronic devices to robotic planetary explorers. The book is also big because we go into some depth. 
The subtitle of this book is &quot;A Modern Approach.'' The intended meaning of this rather empty phrase is that we have tried to synthesize what is now known into a common framework, rather than trying to explain each subfield of AI in its own historical context. We apologize to those whose subfields are, as a result, less recognizable. 
New to next edition
This edition captures the changes in AI that have taken place since the last edition in 2003. There have been important applications of AI technology, such as the idespread deployment of practical speech recognition, machine translation, autonomous vehicles, and household robotics. There have been algorithmic landmarks, such as the solution of the game of checkers. And there has been a great deal of theoretical progress, particularly in areas such as probabilistic reasoning, machine learning, and computer vision. Most important from our point of view is the continued evolution in how we think about the field, and thus how we organize the book. The major changes are as follows: 
We place more emphasis on partially observable and nondeterministic environments, especially in the nonprobabilistic settings of search and planning. The concepts of belief state (a set of possible worlds) and state estimation (maintaining the belief state) are introduced in these settings; later in the book, we add probabilities. 
In addition to discussing the types of environments and types of agents, we now cover in more depth the types of representations that an agent can use. We distinguish among atomic representations (in which each state of the world is treated as a black box), factored representations (in which a state is a set of attribute/value pairs), and structured representations (in which the world consists of objects and relations between them). 
Our coverage of planning goes into more depth on contingent planning in partially observable environments and includes a new approach to hierarchical planning. 
We have added new material on first-order probabilistic models, including open-universe models for cases where there is uncertainty as to what objects exist. 
We have completely rewritten the introductory machine-learning chapter, stressing a wider variety of more modern learning algorithms and placing them on a firmer theoretical footing. 
We have expanded coverage of Web search and information extraction, and of techniques for learning from very large data sets. 
20% of the citations in this edition are to works published after 2003. 
We estimate that about 20% of the material is brand new. The remaining 80% reflects older work but has been largely rewritten to present a more unified picture of the field.

Overview of the book
The main unifying theme is the idea of an intelligent agent. We define AI as the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of learning as extending the reach of the designer into unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning. We treat robotics and vision not as independently defined problems, but as occurring in the service of achieving goals. We stress the importance of the task environment in determining the appropriate agent design. 
Our primary aim is to convey the ideas that have emerged over the past fifty years of AI research and the past two millennia of related work. We have tried to avoid excessive formality in the presentation of these ideas while retaining precision. We have included pseudocode algorithms to make the key ideas concrete; our pseudocode is described in Appendix B. 
This book is primarily intended for use in an undergraduate course or course sequence. The book has 27 chapters, each requiring about a week's worth of lectures, so working through the whole book requires a two-semester sequence. A one-semester course can use selected chapters to suit the interests of the instructor and students. The book can also be used in a graduate-level course (perhaps with the addition of some of the primary sources suggested in the bibliographical notes). Sample syllabi are available at the book's Web site, aima.cs.berkeley.edu The only prerequisite is familiarity with basic concepts of computer science (algorithms, data structures, complexity) at a sophomore level. Freshman calculus and linear algebra are useful for some of the topics; the required mathematical background is supplied in Appendix A. 
Exercises are given at the end of each chapter. Exercises requiring significant programming are marked with a keyboard icon. These exercises can best be solved by taking advantage of the code repository at aima.cs.berkeley.edu. Some of them are large enough to be considered term projects. A number of exercises require some investigation of the literature; these are marked with a book icon. 
Throughout the book, important points are marked with a pointing icon. We have included an extensive index of around 6,000 items to make it easy to find things in the book. Wherever a new term is first defined, it is also marked in the margin.
About the Web site aima.cs.berkeley.edu, the Web site for the book, contains implementations of the algorithms in the book in several programming languages, a list of over 1000 schools that have used the book, many with links to online course materials and syllabi, an annotated list of over 800 links to sites around the Web with useful AI content, a chapter-by-chapter list of supplementary material and links, instructions on how to join a discussion group for the book, instructions on how to contact the authors with questions or comments, instructions on how to report errors in the book, in the likely event that some exist, and slides and other materials for instructors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to QTS Standards==
The aim of this resource is to exemplify the revised standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) in the context of teaching Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as a subject. This page introduces you to the concept of standards. Additional pages provide 

* [[A holistic (or ‘whole picture’) description of trainee teachers]] reaching the standards in respect to: professional attributes; professional knowledge and understanding; professional skills. 
* [[Evidencing progress towards the standards]] and issues in making formative and summative judgements. 
* [[Atomised (or ‘piece by piece’) exemplification of each standard]]. 

This resource does not address the Initial Teacher Training (ITT) Requirements, or ‘R standards’, as these are likely to be dealt with at an Institutional level, rather than subject level. These can be found at: http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/doc/r/revised_itt_requirements.doc .

This whole Standards section is available as a Word document which you can download here:

===The Audience===
The audience for this resource is, in the first instance, new ICT Initial Teacher Education (ITE) subject tutors. However it will also be valuable for established subject tutors, subject mentors in school, to trainee teachers themselves and anyone who might be asking ‘what do the standards mean in the context of teaching ICT’.

===Why standards?===
The standards approach was developed in England and Wales to better focus teacher trainers, mentors and trainee teachers themselves on the knowledge, skills and attitudes involved in becoming an effective teacher. In favour of the approach, standards are often seen as integral to target setting, summative assessment and progression both within teacher training and beyond. For example, the QTS (Q) standards are intended to be seen alongside core (C) teacher standards, threshold (T) standards, Excellent Teacher (E) standards and Advanced Teacher standards (A) (http://www.tda.gov.uk/teachers/professionalstandards.aspx) and to be consistent with the Common Core of Skills and Knowledge for the Children’s Workforce (http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/deliveringservices/commoncore) as an integrated and consistent approach to teacher development. However, the approach has always had its critics: standards can be decontextualised and, at worst, lead to a ‘tick box’ approach to teacher development. There is, then, a longer debate to be had about the ‘standards approach’, which is beyond the scope of this resource. 

===Our challenge===
Our challenge is to inform that debate by providing a perspective on the revised standards. Trainee teachers are engaged in a continual cycle of developing professional knowledge and understanding through the application of professional skills in their planning, teaching, assessing and evaluating. This is embodied in Figure 1 and is reflected within the standards.

==Holistic description of trainee teachers==

When someone asks us about a trainee teacher’s progress we might begin by offering a ‘best fit’ description – ‘she is struggling’; ‘he is doing OK’, before referring to progress against individual standards. However these descriptions can be misleading if we do not have a shared understanding of what we mean by ‘OK’ and ‘doing well’. 

In order to provide a starting point for debate, we, therefore, consider four imaginary trainee teachers: one who is struggling; one who is making satisfactory progress; one who is making good progress and one who is making very good progress towards the Q standards. These trainee teachers are then referred to within the exemplification that follows. 

The descriptions are not comprehensive but provide a ‘snap-shot’ of where they might be on the journey to meet the Q standards. To keep these best-fit descriptions concise we refer to what might be thought as key standards. In particular we focus on how these trainee teachers:
* Have a commitment to collaboration (see Q6)
* Reflect on and improve practice (see Q7a)
* Are creative and constructively critical (see Q8)
* Have knowledge and understanding of a range of teaching and learning strategies (see Q10)
* Demonstrate secure subject knowledge (see Q14)
* Plan lessons and sequences of lessons (see Q22)
* Teach (see Q25)
* Assess (see Q26)
* Establish a purposeful learning environment (see Q30).
However, it is important to remember that all the standards must be met despite the fact that some may have more immediacy than others. What further complicates this form of analysis is that, in reality, trainee teachers may be at different stages in relation to different standards at different times. However, we still regard this approach as valid. 

===1 ‘Struggling to meet the standards’===
In university this trainee teacher appeared to be knowledgeable and confident, but in his assignments and discussions with mentors he struggled to explain conceptually how approaches such as personalised learning enabled learners to learn more effectively (Q14). In school he had difficulty coping with the teaching and learning cycle, particularly assessment of learning (Q26). 

He appeared uneasy and hesitant in front of the class on his own, but was quite successful working as part of a team (Q6). When introducing a new topic he found it difficult to strike a balance between exposition and hands on activity (Q22). With problematic classes he sent learners to undertake practical activities before fully explaining a task. With more pliant classes he talked for too long. He often engaged in unproductive exchanges with learners (Q30). He was overwhelmed by all the information he had to act upon. He needed a great deal of mentor support. 

Over time, he gained confidence and was more consistent in managing children. At times learners appeared to enjoy his lessons. However, he still had difficulties in applying his subject knowledge in a school context. He had a good degree in IT and industrial experience to draw upon but he found it very difficult to break concepts down for children (Q25). When planning, he often focused on ICT skills rather than capability and underestimated the range of abilities in his classes. Lesson evaluations did not focus enough on learners learning. (Q7a)

He acknowledged the problems with classroom management but did not respond well to advice about how to better apply subject knowledge (Q8). His mentor felt he had to tread carefully and that the trainee teacher was not being proactive enough (Q10).

===2 ‘Making satisfactory progress’===
In university this trainee teacher was able to show a growing understanding of ICT pedagogy. She recognised that teaching was going to be a challenge for her and acted accordingly. In school she familiarised herself with the relevant policies and support systems and was keen to seek advice. She was positive and professional in developing relationships with learners. She volunteered to help out in an ICT lunchtime club (Q6).

Initially her delivery in the classroom was a little ‘robotic’ and nervous. Over time she grew in confidence, employing proven and successful routines for planning and teaching of classes (Q30). Most of her lessons would be split into three parts (Q22). Introductions were well rehearsed but, sometimes, learning objectives were not made clear. Explanations were factual but did not capture the imagination of the children (Q14).

During question and answer sessions she found it difficult to vary the types of questions asked, or to react quickly to changing circumstances. She moved around the classroom and monitored learner progress effectively. She was good at working with individuals. Most lessons ended with a plenary or summary (Q25). 

She made sensible and intuitive decisions about assessing learners’ work but found it difficult to identify how much of it was their own and how much was as the result of the input of others (Q26). In her planning she tended to stick rigidly to the schemes of work used in the department, rarely adapting materials (Q10) or responding to her own lesson evaluations (Q8). She responded well to advice but struggled to come up with her own solutions to address the professional difficulties identified above (Q7a).

===3 ‘Good Progress’===
This trainee teacher positively involved himself in the cycle of professional learning. From the start of his course he was able to demonstrate understanding of the theoretical principles that underpin ICT teaching and how skills relate to capability. In school, he was confident and well prepared and able to start team teaching with his mentor very quickly (Q6). He readily acted on advice. 

When teaching his own classes he provided detailed lesson plans that balanced activities with discussion and built in opportunities for group work (Q22). He pre-planned his questions and over time developed a range of assessment strategies (Q26). He established effective routines for class management and set out his expectations of behaviour, in line with school policy (Q10). He was also able to find learner friendly terms to explain lesson aims and concepts (Q14). 

He showed he could consistently teach structured lessons with clear objectives. These lessons were generally engaging for learners (Q25) (Q30). He used his evaluations as a pointer to where he needed to improve (Q8). He sought out feedback from others and looked for models to extend his teaching. When he encountered difficulties, he could usually identify the reasons why himself and sought his own solutions to address them (Q7a). 

===4 ‘Very good progress’===
She was genuinely interested in the principles that underpin ICT teaching (Q14), ICT as a subject and the contribution technologies make to the changing nature of learning and teaching. She actively contributed to university sessions (Q6) and her assignments were insightful and well researched. She recognised that teaching itself would be a challenge.

In school she quickly won the trust of teachers due to her reliability and willingness to help (Q6). When starting whole class teaching she provided detailed lesson plans that balanced activities with discussion and built in opportunities for group work (Q22). She was aware how different types of activity appealed to different types of learner and sought to offer variation in how she taught and presented her material to particular learners. She established effective routines for class management and encouraged learners to take responsibility for their own learning (Q25). 

She employed enquiry based learning when appropriate. She adapted schemes of work to make them more relevant and appealing and promoted learner creativity (Q30). She was consistently trying to extend her range of teaching styles (Q10) and used her evaluations of lesson and assessment of learning (Q26)to inform her future practice (Q8). Other teachers saw her as an asset to the department and to the school. When she encountered difficulties, she could identify the reasons why herself and sought her own solutions to address them (Q7a).

==Evidencing Standards==

An interpretation of the standards is more an art than science. An unthinking tick box approach will not work. The key is to consider the evidence over an extended period of time and ask what is your ‘best fit’ judgement based upon the information you have. This information is likely to be in the form of observations, questioning, lesson plans, meeting records, examples of learner’s work, conversations with other teachers; with other adults; assignments; and conversations with the trainee teacher themselves. 

It is important to remember that trainee teachers are at the beginning of a journey of professional development. Obtaining QTS is the minimum requirement and we should strive to push all trainee teachers beyond this baseline in true preparation for their NQT year.

Standards can and should be used as more than just an exercise in making a summative judgement. They can give a picture of the progress a trainee teacher has made at a particular point in time but more importantly, can help identify areas for development to meet QTS and beyond. For example a session with a trainee teacher might cover:
* the general picture: here a mentor might discuss general progress towards the Q standards and the evidence on which this is based.
* a focus on a particular standard: here a mentor might discuss an area to develop in terms of say questioning (see Q25) as a way of drawing learners into a lesson and checking their understanding.
* a modelling of a solution: here a mentor might make suggestions and show the trainee teacher how to script questions in advance; make notes on the range of question types used by other teachers; how to allow learners to discuss in pairs the answers to questions before asking anyone to put up a hand.
* application of a possible solution: here classes could be identified in which the new approach is used and arrangements made for observing the new strategy in action
* review of that solution: here a time put aside for discussing progress together

==Exemplification==

In this part of the resource we provide a table with each Q standard listed, a comment, which is our explanation of the standard, suggestions of possible ways of evidencing that standard, exemplification with reference to the holistic descriptions of trainee teachers, mentioned above. There is also a suggested overlap with the 02/02 QTS standards. 

The tables are substantial so we have included them as separate downloadable documents. They are also included in the full document of this Standards section, which you can download using the link at the bottom of this page.

===1 Professional Attributes===
These are probably the most generic and intuitive standards. A trainee teacher can easily show a willingness to listen to others and courtesy towards those trying to help. However, some require further exemplification.

Download Word document: StandardsEx1.doc (94K)

===2 Professional Knowledge and Understanding===
It is unclear what the TDA mean by ‘understanding’ in this context, but in our view is it vital that all teachers know why they do things.

By implication knowledge and understanding and awareness could be demonstrated theoretically but use and adaptation requires a context. The most effective context is a learning environment e.g. ICT classroom. City Learning Centre (CLC) or the home.

The challenge that is generated by all the standards in this section is to get the balance right between theory and practice in terms of the sources of evidence.

The balance will possibly be more theoretical than practical but it depends where the trainee teacher is in the training cycle.

ICT trainee teachers may struggle initially with academic writing and will need support, particularly if they hope to achieve a postgraduate level qualification.

===3 Professional Skills===
Skills have to be demonstrated, but trainee teachers must understand why they do things.

The most effective context is a learning environment e.g. ICT classroom, City Learning Centre (CLC) or the home.

The challenge that is generated by all the standards in this section is to get the balance right between practice and theory in terms of the sources of evidence. 

The balance will be more practical than theoretical but it depends where the trainee teacher is in the training cycle.

==How the standards have changed==

Although, the revised standards are in many ways more succinct than those from 02/02 QTS standards, there are a number of key themes that seem to reflect current political thinking.

# The whole revision is underpinned by ‘Every Child Matters’, particularly in relationship to: effective communication and engagement with children, young people and families (Q4); child and young person development (Q20); safeguarding and promoting the welfare of the child (Q22); supporting transitions; multi-agency working (Q4, Q20); sharing information(Q4). It is, therefore, very important that all ITE ICT courses include work relating to ECM and that trainee teachers have good knowledge of its principles.&lt;br/&gt;For more information see: [[The Every Child Matters website&lt;br/&gt;http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/deliveringservices/commoncore/]]&lt;br/&gt;Ofsted (2006), Every Child Matters: the implications for inspection&lt;br/&gt;Universities Council for the Education of Teachers (UCET) document ‘Every Child Matters and Teacher Education: Towards a UCET position paper’ and further documents at http://www.ucet.ac.uk/
# The revision is informed by the ‘Remodelling of the Workforce agenda’, with a number of standards specifically relating to it. This is not a new concept, but its profile has been raised, which has implications for trainee teachers in school. (Q4, Q5, Q20, Q32, Q33). They must have evidence of working with others, such as technicians and teaching assistants. For more information on this go to http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/deliveringservices/workforcereform/
# Assessment has been subdivided into formative (Q12, Q27, Q28) and summative (Q11). This reflects the Assessment for Learning Strategy, so should not pose a particular problem for courses.
# The use of data by trainee teachers is now a specific standard (Q13). It is now more important that partnership schools give trainee teachers the opportunity to access learner data.
# In Q3(b), and Q7 trainee teachers are now required to reach a level of competency which in the past has been more associated with NQT standards.
# Some standards that have been difficult to address in the past have been ‘watered down’ or disappeared e.g. school visits are not mentioned and EAL becomes part of a standard not a standard on its own. EAL is regularly highlighted in NQT surveys as the most problematic area, so cannot be ignored in ITE courses. Citizenship is not mentioned, although I would expect it to be in Q23. It is still desirable for trainee teachers to be familiar with it. Setting and getting in homework does often cause difficulties for trainee teachers, so now they have to plan it only (Q24).
# There is, on the face of it, a distinction between theory (Professional Knowledge and Understanding, Q10 – Q21) and practice (Professional Skills Q22 – Q33), though they should not be treated separately. Knowledge and understanding are best demonstrated through practice.
# Theories for learning have a more prominent place – this has major implications on how some courses are organised, probably at a generic level and particularly GTP and SCITTS. (Q14, Q18)
# It is good to see the introduction of a standard encouraging a critical approach (Q8). This is particularly relevant to technology and we should continue to expect trainee teachers to question and be critical of government guidelines and strategies.
# The concept of coaching is introduced (Q9). There are different definitions for coaching. The definition used is that given by the Centre for the Use of Research and Evidence in Education at http://www.curee-paccts.com/index.jsp
# ‘Personalised learning’ has a very high profile in a number of standards (Q10, Q19, Q25) and will need to paid particular attention.
# Creativity is also mentioned. There are different definitions for creativity. The definition used is that given by the National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (NACCCE) at http://www.dfes.gov.uk/naccce/ . I welcome any move towards creativity but this definition seems to focus on what learners do and does not include what the trainee teacher does. Creative teaching should not be forgotten.
# Trainee teachers now have two standards on literacy, numeracy and ICT – one on supporting the teacher (Q17) and one on developing the learner (Q23). The latter may be a challenge for some and courses may want to revisit this area.
# E-learning has become the focus for the application of technology to learning and teaching (Q25). 

Finally, Q10 and Q25 are in effect ‘know the theory of teaching’ and ‘do it in practice’. They form the bulk of what is done in ITE partnerships. It is important not to let trainee teachers and schools forget the other standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Delivering High Quality Training==

In making decisions about factors that might affect course outcomes for ICT and IT in ITT your professional judgement is essential. Although you work within frameworks determined by the Training and Development Agency for Schools and by the ICT and IT curriculum taught in your partnership schools, it is up to you to decide in detail what makes a good course.

No subject is, or should be, static. ICT is especially affected by change, both in the technologies we have to use and in the applications and affordances resulting from those new technologies. This presents a challenge to the ICT Subject Specialist. Your role is to be both normative (that is, you should enable trainees to teach effectively in schools as they are presently structured) and innovative. That is, you should constantly develop the subject content that trainees acquire and the way in which that knowledge is taught or applied in learning and teaching. The Professional Standard Q8 requires that trainees have a creative and constructively critical approach to innovation.

Your mission as an ICT subject specialist teacher educator is to fulfil both roles.

In the following pages we set out some of the factors that can affect the quality of course outcomes.

There are no simple answers. It is not possible to point you in the direction of a single set of resources, materials or documents that will provide complete solutions. There are only frameworks, constraints, and choices. There are not even any syllabuses or appropriate schemes of work to draw from.

In this respect the tutor's role in ITT is perhaps more challenging than teaching in a secondary school. At the same time it is more rewarding because individual tutors and teams of tutors are the architects of good quality provision.

Good quality ICT teachers are more than just practitioners who can produce good results from GCSE and A level students. Not only will they have to develop a subject expertise, but must ensure that even non-specialist students have skills, knowledge and understanding to function in a society where many of the current driving influences are ICT related. ICT is a key skill.

Further to this, ICT is unique in its ability to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in other subjects. In good practice this should be a natural and unremarkable occurrence but is probably most evident in the primary phase where the same teacher delivers across the range of subjects. It may be less intrinsic in the secondary phase where subjects are taught more discretely and by different individuals. There may even be an ethos of protection which discourages overlap into other subject areas.

A good ICT teacher in a secondary school, therefore, can make a significant difference to standards generally that would not be the case, for example, with a good history teacher. However, trainee teachers need to be informed to be aware of the ‘value added’ nature of the role and the significance of the cross curricular implications of ICT.

Firstly, these individuals would need to be &quot;public relations&quot; sensitive – not everyone will welcome what may be seen as an intrusion into their subject teaching, however effective the ideas or well meaning the intentions. Secondly, the trainees would have to be prepared to learn beyond their own subject and to have more than a passing familiarity with the requirements of the curriculum as a whole. Thirdly, a very solid grounding in pedagogy is necessary to ensure that the enhancement potential of ICT is fully understood and used appropriately.

Good ICT teachers have the potential to be very special. If this is recognised and exploited at the training stage, everybody will ultimately benefit.

The Professional Standards Q1 to Q33

All ITT courses in England are required to work within the framework published by the Training and Development Agency for Schools - Professional Standards for Teachers Qualified Teacher Status. These are set out in the document which can be obtained from the TDA website: Professional Standards for Teachers Why sit still in your career?

==The Professional Standards Q1 to Q33==

Q1 to Q9 Professional attributes - how trainees should behave&lt;br/&gt;
Q10 to Q21 Professional knowledge and understanding - what trainees should know&lt;br/&gt;
Q22 to Q33 Professional skills - what trainees should be able to do

An alternative approach is to consider the Professional Standards as a set of themes.

A most important document is TDA0396 - Professional Standards for Qualified Teacher Status and Requirements for Initial Teacher Training. This too contains the Professional Standards but also contains the requirements placed upon ITT Institutions 

R1.1 GCSE requirement&lt;br/&gt;
R1.2 Degree requirement&lt;br/&gt;
R1.3 to R1.5 the suitability of applicants

R2.1 to R2.7 refer to the training requirements.

In Northern Ireland, further information can be obtained from
http://www.deni.gov.uk/index/teachers-pg
and the equivalent standards are described in
http://www.deni.gov.uk/teacher_education_partnership_handbook-3.pdf

The Scottish Government provides support through http://www.teachinginscotland.com

The Welsh Assembly Government has introduced QTS standards which are similar to the QTS standards in England where appropriate, but vary to cover issues specific to Wales. http://www.teachertrainingwales.org

==Getting the Right Students==

Selecting and recruiting the right students for a course is a critical factor in delivering high quality outcomes. All ITT providers must ensure all of the following:

* GCSE of grade C or equivalent in English and mathematics - a level 2 certificate is insufficient; it needs to be accompanied by evidence of a breadth of understanding and experience in the subject area.
* Recruits to programmes to teach pupils aged 3 to 11 years must also have a GCSE of grade C or equivalent in a science subject.
* A first degree or the equivalent - the TDA places the responsibility for deciding the degree equivalence upon the ITT provider.
* All entrants must be subjected to a CRB enhanced disclosure.
* All entrants must be interviewed and it must be established that they have the academic capability and the qualities, attitudes and values to be a teacher. They must be able to read effectively and be able to communicate in standard English.
* The training must be resourced and structured to enable the trainees to demonstrate all of the Professional Standards. There must be equality of access to resources and training. The training must take account of the individual needs.
* The training must cover at least two stages of education and trainees must have experience of the stages before and after the ones they are trained to teach.

Recruitment into teacher training for Computing is difficult in many areas of the UK. Consequently, there is a tension between the need to meet quotas and fill the course and ensure high standards of recruitment.

One tension is the desire to have trainees with degrees in computing. A strategy may be required to accommodate applicants whose first degree is not computing. For example...

===Entry without a degree in computing===
Those applicants with degrees in business studies, information systems, joint honours may be accepted unconditionally because of the level of IT/ICT/computing in their studies. Those with degrees with no computing element would have requirements to evidence their capability to work at graduate level in an aspect of computing and have sufficient skills, knowledge and understanding to be able to support pupils at all levels (attainment targets) in the Key Stage 3 and 4 National Curriculum. Applicants may have requirements placed upon them to complete before the start of the programme including some or all of these: provide copies of prior assignments in the IT field that are at level 4; write a 3000 word assignment about an aspect of applied computer technologies considered to be at level 4 (undergraduate); provide a report of their commercial experience of using IT and/or training in the IT field and/or voluntary work in IT related field. This requirement varies between providers.

Other activities can be introduced in an attempt to ensure that entrants have the required qualities and capabilities.

For example, ''Applicants do not necessarily have to have a computing degree but must have significant computing skills, training and experience. Trainees without a traditional computing degree are accepted on the programme providing that they have the appropriate experience, expertise and motivation. You must have skills in all 'office' software (in particular database management and spreadsheets), ability to create and publish web pages and some programming/scripting experience at some level between writing macros/VBA and PASCAL/C++ inclusive. As a Information Technology trainee teacher you should consider that you are undertaking to work at GCE Computing standard (see syllabus, for example, http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce.php).''

''Applicants need to show those qualities of personality, presentation, confidence and sensitivity required to be a teacher. Also, they need to show an awareness of the current educational process and a knowledge of the work of schools. We strongly recommend obtaining classroom experience before the interview. Candidates will normally have had recent experience of a secondary school ICT classroom. Teaching is a challenging and rewarding profession; teaching ICT is a very good way in which we can enhance the lives of young people.''

''In preparation for the interview we advise you to spend time in a secondary school observing ICT classes, reading National Curriculum documents/textbooks and talking to IT/ICT teachers so that you can, with confidence, talk about what teaching ICT is like. You must be convincing of your informed desire to become an ICT teacher. We regard this as especially important when someone is leaving another field of employment to train as a teacher.''

''If you are offered and accept a place, then a number of additional ‘Requirements of Entry’ (in the form of pre-entry experiences) will be specified. You will set yourself targets to achieve, that will strengthen your teaching potential, before starting the course. For example: visit the local library and browse the children’s computer books; create a number of web pages and post them to a server; obtain a GCE level computing text book and become familiar with its organisation; review all the generic functions of a word processor, spreadsheet, database management program, web page editor and a graphics program (including drawing, painting and charting); use LOGO. By accepting a place on the course, you are acknowledging that you have good skills in all forms of office-type software (see above). You are also stating you have good capability in handling new software, being able to explore functions in a systematic as well as an imaginative way.''

As part of the qualifying process, trainee teachers must complete the QTS Skills Tests after the programme starts. Details can be found at http://www.tda.gov.uk/skillstests.aspx

===How to Gauge the Appropriate Level of Study===

There are two broad ways to look at the depth of study required for ITT courses:

'''Students are taught sufficient ICT to enable them to the teach the target Key Stage of the course they are following.'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the 'just enough' approach. Most useful in cases where ICT courses are part of a wider curriculum of subjects, and/or where ICT is taught in a cross-curricular context.
In relation to meeting the standards, we would assume that there is a minimum threshold of knowledge and expertise that enables a trainee to &quot;meet the standards&quot;. This approach allows us to define and apply this minimum threshold.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Students are taught to the highest level attainable in relation to the standards and criteria of the courses they are following, regardless of target Key Stage.'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, specialist subject study courses or modules would be more likely to teach content to this level.
The definition of &quot;highest level obtainable&quot; is open. For degree level courses we would assume that the student will work to a level beyond that of the Key Stage they are likely to teach (by implication this means beyond 'A' level). For postgraduate courses we would assume that this level of knowledge and expertise is in place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course, mere &quot;quantity&quot; of knowledge is not enough. We also have to think about the level at which knowledge is understood and the level to which trainee teachers can communicate that knowledge and understanding - that is the pedagogic content knowledge.

A PGCE is sometimes described as post-graduate in name but not in nature, and indeed to be genuinely post-graduate all or most of the content of the program would have to be pitched at Masters’ level. The structure of PGCE courses will vary from one provider to the next but generally they tend to be pitched at level 5/6 with the understanding of teaching practice occasionally assessed at level M. 

Some institutions differentiate between students by offering the PGCE in two ways:
* '''Professional Graduate Certificate of Education''' - studied post-graduate but not achieving Masters level;
* '''Postgraduate Certificate in Education''' - studied and achieving standards equivalent to Masters level.

This differentiation can be achieved by students electing to study at Masters level or their work is submitted and is summatively assessed to be at professional or postgraduate level.

Guidance and further explanation of the structures and levels found in Higher Education courses can be found on the [[QAA http://www.qaa.ac.uk/]] website, following the links Academic Infrastructure &gt; Subject benchmark statements &gt; Master's level benchmark statements. The statements pertinent to computing and education have not yet been developed but there is a summary of discussions from the event held in February 2006, providing an overview of opinions surrounding the possibility of developing benchmarks for academic programmes at M level.

The second issue is the depth to which trainees are required to engage with the subject pedagogy and the subject itself. Subject pedagogy usually presents less of a problem as candidates are often required to reflect upon and critically evaluate their own and others' practice, thus fulfilling the appropriate criteria for the level. The delivery of subject knowledge can present more of a problem as the academic level of the course requires an engagement at a level far above that required in terms of operational delivery of the subject.

For PGCE students with an appropriate degree this is not usually a problem. For some QTS courses, and in particular two year top up from HND models, additional support may be necessary. The TDA provide subject enhancement programmes which may be as short as 10 days and as long as 12 months. A further consideration here is the phases that trainees are expected to teach on as the level of subject knowledge required at KS5/AS/A2/AVCE/Diploma level will inevitably be far more detailed than that required for key stages 2, 3 and 4. There is also the tension between the computing body of knowledge and the ICT body of knowledge. The two are blurred and elements of traditional programming are becoming more relevant in ICT including:

* LOGO to give spacial and algorithm awareness;
* Scratch, Greenfoot, etc. to give awareness of sequencing and algorithm;
* Game authoring tools like Game Maker, to develop narrative and scripting skills;
* Control technology programming languages and graphical interfaces such as Crocodile Clips and Flowol that develop logic and programming.
* Macro writing in office-type software, such as OpenOffice, to show automation of processes.
* HTML and associated web page construction to show the values of scripting and organisation of data (folder structure).

Some 11-16 QTS courses meet their obligation to &quot;engage with the expectations, curricula, strategies and teaching arrangements in the age phases immediately before and after the ones they are trained to teach&quot; by requiring trainees to spend time in those classrooms and make presentations to their peers at a level above that they are trained to teach. For example, a directed activity might be to: ''teach to the rest of the group an assigned computing topic through a short lesson of no more than 15 minutes and create a web page and three A4 sheets including: an activity sheet, a worksheet and an information sheet then locate the topic in the GNVQ GCE AVCE GCSE curriculum [2.1d]'' Topics are assigned from: CPU; Prolog; Keywords; Logic; Normalisation; Sorting; Queues; Stacks; Encryption; Binary; GIF/JPEG; JavaScript; VisualBasic; Encryption; Compression; Recursion; VBA; SQL; Linux; Interrupts; PSS etc.

==Equipping students with sufficient pedagogical knowledge==

How can tutors ensure that they equip students with sufficient pedagogical knowledge and understanding to become effective and reflective teachers?

All PGCE and QTS courses should have modules on teaching studies or similarly titled elements that address this aspect of professional practice. Typical areas that are covered include:
* Strategies for differentiation
* Inclusive education
* Classroom management
* Pupil motivation
* Effective planning, delivery and evaluation
Resources to assist in the delivery of these topics can be found at:
Becta 
TeacherNet

Opportunities for trainees to develop teaching skills should also be included as an early part of the course with teaching studies used as an opportunity for trainees to try out short teaching events (microteaching) to peers, sample marking and moderation sessions and having a go at exam papers likely to be sat by pupils.

==The Features of Quality Provision==

Quality and Standards in Secondary Initial Teacher Training (2003) is the Ofsted report on three years’ inspection of Secondary ITT courses, 1999-2002. Although the report does not cover ICT specialist courses some useful indications of the features of good quality provision in this area are indicated. There is some lack of clarity in the report about the quality of ICT specialist subject courses. On the whole the report treats ICT as a cross curricular issue and treats it in terms of the use of ICT in the teaching of other subjects.

In general terms, trainees’ fitness to teach was found to be good and their use of ICT greatly improved. The introduction of 4/98 in 1999 was found to be useful in this regard and had helped to raise the standards in terms of what trainees were taught about the use of ICT in subject teaching. Annex B contained a comprehensive list of skills and concepts associated with the educational use of ICT including the terms provenance and provisionality when associated with the worldwide web. However, poor resources in some partnership schools continued to hamper development. In addition, too few trainees had knowledge of or strategies for dealing with transition from KS2 to KS3 and trainees’ use of assessment to inform planning continued to be weak.

Generally providers made '''ineffective''' use of subject knowledge audits. Self-audits were felt to be almost useless whereas in the best practice audits were systematically collected and analysed by staff and strategies were in place to help trainees develop their areas of weakness in the subject.

The role of the school mentor in ensuring that subject knowledge is adapted for teaching purposes is crucial but at times was found to be poor. In the case of the embedded use of ICT in subject teaching, mentors’ own lack of knowledge resulted in poor trainee development. This was found to be particularly the case in training that was entirely school-based.

Training was often found to be effective and of good quality where
* recent developments in the subject are covered to ensure trainees are up-to-date when they start work;
* assignments are linked to school experience;
* a systematic programme of skills development is provided;
* there is good integration between subject study, school experience and professional studies;
* trainees' subject knowledge is systematically audited, and monitored.

The following year, the Annual Report from Ofsted made this limited reference to ICT in ITT &quot;Secondary teacher training has improved in a number of areas. Trainees are now better prepared to use ICT in their teaching. The Key Stage 3 Strategy receives appropriate attention and has helped to improve aspects of trainees’ teaching, for example, planning in subjects such as ICT&quot;. http://live.ofsted.gov.uk/publications/annualreport0304

In subsequent years, Ofsted has not commented upon the use of ICT in ITT nor the teaching of the subject of ICT.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The purpose of this resource is to provide you with the knowledge, skills and understanding you need to support and train school-based mentors with whom you will be working as a university tutor or co-ordinator for a school-based training provider. The processes, procedures and documentation used by each training provider may differ – but the purposes and outcomes will be the same: to enable student-teachers to maximise their potential in becoming effective teachers. These resources are designed to support you in achieving this objective.

===Overview of the resource===

'''What is mentoring and coaching?'''&lt;br/&gt;
This provides you with background information about the role of the mentor, the coach and the co-coach (or peer-coach). This should help to clarify your understanding of the interplay between these roles and thus support you when training mentors and coaches.

'''The skills of mentoring and coaching'''&lt;br/&gt;
This section explores the skills and strategies which mentors and coaches need to employ to carry out their roles. This includes: review and reflection, observation and feedback, target setting and assessment.

'''Training, developing and supporting mentors and coaches'''&lt;br/&gt;
This section provides you with some ideas and resources for inducting and developing the expertise of mentors with whom you will be working. Training for mentors can be provided through formal, centre-based training sessions or through one-to-one school-based contact. Included in this section are examples of activities and resources which might prove useful in clarifying your role in training and supporting mentors with whom you are working.

'''Quality assurance of school-based provision'''&lt;br/&gt;
Part of your role in co-ordinating school-based training as an ICT tutor will be to ensure that the quality of the experiences which trainees have is comparable and that assessments are fair, whatever the circumstances. Keeping track of the progress of mentors and the situation in the schools with which you have contact is part of your responsibility. This section explores ways in which this can be achieved.

'''Background information and literature'''&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, information relating to some of the background literature underpinning the work of the mentor and coach are provided. Inevitably, the information provided is partial and selective. You only have to enter the terms ‘mentoring and coaching’ into a search engine to appreciate the range and diversity of resources, approaches and techniques which are presently available - for not only is mentoring and coaching the province of teacher education, it underpins professional development in the commercial sector.

==What is Mentoring and Coaching?==

===Introduction===

The definitions for mentoring and coaching vary according to the source consulted. There are considerable vested interests involved in providing mentoring and coaching, particularly for large corporate organisations. As a consequence, there is a lot of research into effective practice in mentoring and coaching – though much of it is not of direct relevance to initial teacher training. However, some of the principles underlying mentoring and coaching are generalisable, regardless of whether the ‘client’ is a middle manager in a multinational company or a trainee ICT teacher in a small urban secondary school.

===What is the difference between mentoring and a coaching?===

Whilst there is little common agreement, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is the difference between mentoring and coaching?……there probably can't be a definitive answer to this. The two terms seem to be increasingly linked and are often used interchangeably 
The Impact Factory (n.d.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

as we shall see, there is a common pattern running through the definitions accessed from various sources.

===Mentoring===

In terms of mentoring, the common theme seems to be one of career development:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mentoring is...''&quot;off-line help by one person to another in making significant transitions in knowledge, work or thinking&quot;''&lt;br/&gt;
Clutterbuck &amp; Megginson (2004)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

''Mentoring: helping to shape an individual’s beliefs and values in a positive way; often a longer term career relationship from someone who has ‘done it before’''&lt;br/&gt;
Robert Dilts (2006)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

''Mentoring is the broader of the two concepts. It has a career progress-oriented dimension with psycho-social development functions, incorporating counselling and friendship.''&lt;br/&gt;
NCSL (2003)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Mentoring:
* is an ongoing relationship that can last for a long period of time
* can be more informal and meetings can take place as and when the mentee needs some advice,
* guidance or support
* is more long-term and takes a broader view of the person
* has a focus on career and personal development
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Brefi Group (n.d.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In terms of teacher education and training, the above suggests that mentoring is a broad, overarching concept which is related to supporting a trainee in making the significant transition from being a student teacher (or trainee) to becoming a newly qualified teacher.

===Coaching===

Similarly, for coaching another common theme emerges:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Coaching is…''&quot;a process that enables learning and development to occur and thus performance to improve. &quot;''&lt;/br&gt;
Parsloe (1999)

''Coaching: helping another person to improve awareness, to set and achieve goals in order to improve a particular behavioural performance.''&lt;/br&gt;
Robert Dilts (2006)

''Coaching tends to be seen as an aspect of mentoring: a more narrow focus relating to an individual’s job-specific tasks, skills or capabilities''&lt;/br&gt;
NCSL (2003)

Coaching:
* Relationship generally has a set duration
* Short-term (sometimes time-bounded) and focused on specific development areas/issues
* Focus is generally on development/issues at work
* The agenda is focused on achieving specific, immediate goals
* Coaching revolves more around specific development areas/issues

The Brefi Group
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Which suggests that coaching is more specifically focused on helping a trainee to develop specific skills and competences.

===Mentoring and Coaching for Initial Teacher Training===

====Roles and responsibilities====
The specific titles for those engaged in partnership arrangements for Initial Teacher Training (ITT) vary across providers and sometimes across different programmes in the same institution. However, regardless of the nomenclature, the roles and responsibilities will inevitably be very similar:

''Associate Teacher / Student Teacher / Trainee / Mentee / Coachee''&lt;/br&gt;
Some ITT providers strive to avoid using the term ‘trainee’ as it implies a skills-based vocational approach rather than a collegial model of professional development. As will be seen in the skills section, it can be argued that it is equally as important for those being mentored and coached to receive training in their roles and responsibilities as it is for those providing the mentoring and coaching. As can be seen, this is largely dependent on whether the provider regards the mentoring process as one of apprenticeship or reflective practice (See Background information). To avoid confusion, those who are training to become teachers will be referred to throughout this resource as student-teachers.

''Classroom Mentor / Teacher Mentor / Subject Mentor''&lt;/br&gt;
In effect, this role is fulfilled by the teacher or teachers who work alongside the student-teacher in the classroom on an everyday basis. In some schools or settings, the teacher-mentor will be primarily responsible for mentoring and coaching the student-teacher, with occasional support from the professional mentor or university mentor. However, in some schools, regular formal observations and target setting sessions are provided by the professional mentor in liaison with the teacher mentor. Very rarely now, will the lead for mentoring a student-teacher be taken by the university mentor.

''Senior/Lead/Co-ordinating/Professional mentor''&lt;/br&gt;
Most schools in partnership with HEI providers will be expected to appoint a mentor to oversee mentoring within the school. In some cases, a lead mentor may have responsibility for co-ordinating mentoring across a cluster of schools. It would be expected that the professional mentor will become involved in supporting the development of mentoring and coaching within the school or cluster.

''University tutor/mentor''&lt;/br&gt;
Dependent on the partnership arrangements under which the provider and schools operate, the university tutor’s role will vary. In some cases, the University Tutor will act in the full capacity as a mentor, observing students’ practice, providing feedback and setting targets. At the other extreme, the university tutor may have little contact with the trainees in a school and will work more with the school-based mentors, checking on general progress, quality assuring, moderating assessments and providing support and training for mentors.

''Link Tutor''&lt;/br&gt;
Some providers identify tutors with responsibility for liaising with a cluster of schools. This role differs from that of the University Tutor, for example, some HEI providers devolve responsibility for arranging placements and the quality assurance of the training to Link Tutors.

''Partnership/Placement tutor/coordinator/manager''&lt;/br&gt;
Most HEI providers have at least one designated member of staff with responsibility for managing and co-ordinating placements and partnership arrangements with school and settings. In some cases, this person will have a full-time commitment to this process whilst in others the tutor concerned will also have a teaching commitment.

-------

Given the definitions for mentor and coach, it could be argued that a subject mentor in a school might well be a coach primarily who occasionally steps into the role of a mentor. Whereas, a co-ordinating or professional mentor (and indeed the University Tutor) is more likely to be, first and foremost, a mentor who occasionally steps into the role of coach.

In 1997, The Centre for the Use of Research and Evidence in Education (CUREE) was sponsored by the DfES, the GTC, The National Strategies, NCSL, the QCA and the TDA to produce a national framework for mentoring and coaching which would be relevant to teacher training. Although the framework’s focus is principally on the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of teachers, it has some resonance with Initial Teacher Training (ITT).

A feature of this document is that it aims to clarify the relationship between the coach and the mentor and attempts to overcome some of the issues associated with the corporate or commercial view of coaching, which argues that the skills of the coach are independent of the profession to which it is being applied. In other words, anyone can coach another. The CUREE Framework therefore identifies the roles as ‘mentor’, ‘specialist coach’ and ‘co-coach’. This latter role covers situations where two teachers or trainees may be working alongside and supporting each other.

The CUREE framework (1997) will underpin much of the material in this resource. This is to avoid confusion when outlining terms and also to provide you with a common reference point. At times, however, where the framework lacks specificity or where alternative viewpoints are more relevant, other sources will be used.

==The Skills of Mentoring and Coaching==

So what is involved in being a mentor and/or a specialist coach? If the aim of teacher training is to allow each trainee to maximise their potential as a teacher, how can we ensure that those working with trainees in school are employing effective strategies?

This resource uses the National Framework for Mentoring and Coaching as the basis for its definitions of mentoring and coaching. As can be seen what constitutes mentoring and coaching is the focus for much debate. The National Framework was developed by CUREE and has been accepted by many of the national organisations concerned with education (ie the DfEE, the TDA, the NCSL, the QCA and the National Strategies).

The National Framework identifies the following skills for mentoring:

Mentors:
* relate sensitively to learners and work through agreed processes to build trust and confidence
* model expertise in practice or through conversation
* relate guidance to evidence from practice and research
* broker access to a range of opportunities to address the different goals of the professional learner
* observe, analyse and reflect upon professional practice and make this explicit
* provide information and feedback that enables learning from mistakes and success
* build a learner’s control over their professional learning
* use open questions to raise awareness, explore beliefs, develop plans, understand consequences and explore and commit to solutions
* listen actively:
#* accommodating and valuing silence
#* concentrating on what’s actually being said
#* using affirming body language to signal attention
#* replaying what’s been said using some of the same words to reinforce, value and reframe thinking
# relate practice to assessment and accreditation frameworks
Similarly, the framework details the skills needed for effective 'specialist coaching':

Specialist coaches:
# relate sensitively to learners and work through agreed processes to build trust and confidence
# model expertise in practice or through conversation
# facilitate access to research and evidence to support the development of pedagogic practice
# tailor activities in partnership with the professional learner
# observe, analyse and reflect upon the professional learner’s practice and make this explicit
# provide information that enables learning from mistakes and success
# facilitate growing independence in professional learning from the outset
# use open questions to raise awareness, explore beliefs, encourage professional learners to arrive at their own plans, understand consequences and develop solutions
# listen actively:
#* accommodating and valuing silence
#* concentrating on what’s actually being said
#* using affirming body language to signal attention
#* replaying what’s been said using the same words to reinforce, value and develop thinking
# establish buffer zones between coaching and other formal relationships
As can be seen, there is considerable overlap between the two sets of skills. These can therefore be sorted into three categories: those specific to mentoring, those specific to specialist coaching and those common to both.

Skills common to mentoring and coaching
* relating sensitively to learners and work through agreed processes to build trust and confidence
* modelling expertise in practice or through conversation
* observing, analysing and reflecting upon professional practice and make this explicit
* providing information that enables learning from mistakes and success
* using open questions to raise awareness, explore beliefs, develop plans and understand consequences
* listening actively:
** accommodating and valuing silence
** concentrating on what’s actually being said
** using affirming body language to signal attention
** replaying what’s been said using some of the same words to reinforce and value thinking

Let’s unpack and explore each of these areas of skill:

Relating sensitively to learners and work through agreed processes to build trust and confidence
Much of this centres on the relationship which the mentor or coach forms with the student-teacher (and vice versa). A key issue here is to ensure that the participants are well informed about the ‘agreed processes’. Making sure trainees are briefed about the expectations we have for them on placement, checking they are properly prepared, that the documentation they will be using and the formats they will have for the presentation of evidence in their teaching files and professional files or logs is part of this process. Similarly, it is important that mentors are provided with the information they need to fulfil their role. Although mentor training and professional development is a key part of this process, taking care that they receive documentation and have ready access to the resources they need is part of your responsibility as the University/Link Tutor. 

Further to this, school-based mentors may need to be alerted to specific issues relating to the student-teacher which might affect their progress or the relationship between mentor and student. For example, there may have been issues arising from a previous placement which have affected a student's self-confidence or self-image. Clearly such information will need to be communicated sensitively to ensure the mentor's judgements and assessments are not compromised. However, you will need to make the decision that in some cases, forewarned is forearmed. 

Background literature developing aspects of the formation, development, monitoring and maintenance of professional relationships include:
• Abell et al. (1995) - The role of the mentor
• Kay and Hinds (2005) - Developing a relationship
• Egan (2002) - A counselling approach
• Goleman (1998) - Emotional Intelligence / competence 
Refer to the Background Information section for more detail

Modelling expertise in practice or through conversation
This is likely to be more appropriate for the teacher/subject mentors who will be working more closely with the student-teacher on a daily basis. However, arrangements could be made for student- teachers to observe teachers who are not working directly with them – for example, in another department or even in another school, particularly with examples of excellent practice in a particular field or where a teacher has a particular approach to, say, behaviour management which might be of benefit. Opportunities could also be provided for student-teachers to observe others’ practice through video or webcam.

Research suggests that modelling is most effective when a clear focus has been identified for the observer prior to the observation of practice. When a need for modelling has arisen as part of target setting or action planning, then the types of behaviour, strategies or techniques can be discussed and unpacked beforehand.

General background information on modelling can be drawn from:
• Cruess, Cruess &amp; Steinert (2008) - Role Modelling 
• UKCLE (n.d.) - Reflection on and in practice
Refer to the Background Information section for more detail

Observing, analysing and reflecting
As indicated above, observation of practice is more effective when the observer has an agenda or has been briefed on a particular focus for the observation. The same is equally applicable for mentors as for student-teachers. A pre-observation discussion is valuable in providing an opportunity to discuss the background and purposes to the activity being observed, to negotiate agreed focuses and to ensure that opportunities are not missed.

There is considerable debate as to who benefits most from analysing and reflecting in a mentoring/coaching relationship. Those who favour competency-based approaches to mentoring would suggest that it is the role of the mentor to analyse the mentee’s practice and provide feedback (against pre-defined competencies). This accords with a Standards-based approach to teacher-training which requires mentors to assess ‘trainees’ progress in relation to a set of nationally-defined criteria. However, as can be seen in the ‘What is mentoring and coaching’ section of this resource, coaching is often regarded to be a subskill of mentoring. Hence, a mentor will, at times, become a coach when identifying specific aspects of practice in need of development and providing specific targeted support. Many models of coaching adopt a more reflective, even reflexive, stance – in which coaches encourage coachees to reflect on their practice, to analyse for themselves their strengths and areas for improvement. The aim here is to encourage the student-teacher to become more independent, self-aware and resourceful in developing his or her practice. 

Observation of practice can be provided through video. Some providers have issued their student-teachers with portable technology to enable them to record their own practices for later reflection and analysis whilst others have set up webcams for video streaming between school and university. Issues such as permissions, confidentiality and data protection must be considered before these strategies are considered, however.

More information of models of mentoring and coaching are provided in the Background Information section. A few key aspects related to this field include:
• Brill, Kim &amp; Galloway (2001) - Cognitive Apprenticeship
• Hoffman-Kipp, Artiles &amp; Lopez-Torres (2003) The Reflective Practice
• Lave. &amp; Wenger (1991) Situated Cognition
• McNally et al (2004) Informal Learning

Providing information
The ways in which information is provided by mentors and coaches for student-teachers is, of course, dependent on the circumstances. Many schools provide a welcome or briefing pack for student-teachers, often based on a staff handbook. The content, format, structure and presentation of these will vary from school to school, but this contents list may be useful if you are wishing to induct a new school or review existing handbooks. Formal information about the policies and practices of the school and/or department might be available in documentation and student-teachers should be encouraged to access these, particularly those relating to the school’s behaviour management procedures, aspects of health and safety, inclusion and equality.

It is usually the responsibility of the ITT provider to supply information about the placement; its structure, focus, expectations, processes and procedures, assessment arrangements and roles and responsibilities. This is most often provided in paper-based format for ease of access and use, but some providers are making increasing use of web-based portals for the dissemination of information and documentation – even if just for back-up.

The provision of more specific information relating to the placement and the student-teacher’s roles, responsibilities and timetabling commitments tend to lie more with the teacher-mentor. Similarly, the responsibilities for managing more specific day-to-day information about the student-teacher’s progress (eg team-planning, feedback, target-setting, reflections, and action planning) need to be clarified.

All the above, enable the student-teachers to gain a clear picture of their progress – the procedures they should be following, the expectations for their practices and the information about their ongoing performance.

For more information on raising awareness of roles and responsibilities, see the section on training, professional development and support for mentors.

Using open questions
Questioning techniques have been shown to be highly effective in learning and teaching situations – to encourage the learners to draw upon their own understanding in framing a response. The majority of coaching and mentoring approaches also stress the importance of effective questioning, for similar reasons. Ideally, student-teachers should be identifying and formulating their own responses to the issues which arise from their practice and hence the role of the mentor and coach should be to encourage them to develop the awareness needed to reflect on their own practices. Often it will be necessary, and more cost-effective in terms of effort, for the mentor/coach to make a limited number of specific suggestions or recommendations for action, particularly during the early stages of the student-teacher’s practice – particularly where issues of health and safety are concerned. But even then, probing the student-teacher’s viewpoint prior to giving a response may reveal that he or she is already aware of the issue.

A further benefit of effective questioning as an approach for mentoring and coaching is that it models good practice for classroom teaching, particularly if the student-teacher’s attention is drawn to the methods and strategies being used.

There is considerable background research and information on questioning approaches to learning, teaching and development, but you may find some of these sources useful:
• Aschner-Gallagher’s Questioning Techniques
• Bloom’s Taxonomy
• Zeus &amp; Skiffington (2002) - dialoguing
Also refer to the Background Information section for more detail

Listening actively
Active Listening is a well-documented technique which is employed in a range of fields from counselling, through mentoring and coaching to personalised learning. It involves the listener in continually probing, seeking clarification, testing ideas, summarising and giving feedback to ensure that the information which is being received is congruent with what was transmitted. It is particularly valuable when coaching a student teacher, especially when seeking to ascertain the student’s view of a situation or event. Combined with effective questioning, the coach can often learn as much, sometimes more, about a learning event than the coachee. Increasingly, with the increased focused on personalisation, ‘learning conversations’ are being used with children to check on their progress and understandings. The techniques are broadly similar.

To find out more, you could explore the following:
• Robertson (2005) - Outline of active listening techniques
• Atherton (2005) - conversational learning theory
• Carl Rogers - Reflective listening
Also refer to the Background Information section for more detail

Skills specific to mentoring
As we have seen in the section on 'What is Mentoring and Coaching', the role of the mentor is considered to be more global than that of the coach. The mentor is expected to support the mentee through a significant career transition and could be involved in making an assessment or appraisal of performance. In terms of supporting student-teachers in developing practice and more specifically in meeting the required Standards for QTS, the following additional skills are required.

Relate guidance to evidence
A key factor in supporting student-teachers is helping to ensure they are not only addressing the Standards for QTS but are providing evidence of their performance. Providers will vary as to how this information is accumulated but most provide some sort of mapping system for relating evidence to the requirements. This may sometimes be accompanied by a portfolio (or e-Portfolio) in which evidence is compiled. Mentors have a role in guiding student teachers in identifying the types of evidence which are appropriate, monitoring the evidence-gathering and assessing the relevance, quality and range of the evidence provided. Mentors also have responsibility for ensuring they are accumulating clear evidence of the student- teachers’ performance in relation to the requirements, particularly when justifying their assessments through moderation.

As can be seen in the section on Quality Assurance, ensuring that robust and reliable evidence is being accumulated by student-teachers and mentors is a prime concern. This is not only to ensure that decisions on pass/fail or grades are equitable and fair, but also to ensure that if there are disputes, the decisions reached are accountable and verifiable.

Broker access to a range of opportunities
Whereas a coach tends to work one-to-one with a coachee on a particular focused aspect of practice, a mentor may decide to arrange additional opportunities for a mentee to gain experience. For example, this may be through the observation of a leading practitioner, discussions with a specialist (eg a SENCo), participation in staff development or collaborative planning sessions, involvement in parents’ meetings or school events, visits to neighbouring schools (eg a feeder primary school), etc.

Provide feedback / Relate practice to assessment
Feedback can be provided at various stages in a placement. The sort of feedback which is likely to be provided immediately following an observation of a lesson or activity is more likely to be reflective and developmental, employing the techniques of effective questioning and active listening. In terms of mentoring, feedback is more likely to be focused on the extent of the student-teacher’s progress in meeting aspects of the Standards. It might, therefore, be summative as well as formative. As indicated above, assessments of practice are more convincing and robust when related to evidence – indeed, it could be argued that assessments must be based on evidence. This is particularly important when dealing with student-teachers whose progress is causing concern as the focus will be on the aspects of practice which need attention rather than the characteristics of the individual concerned (see below).

For more information on providing feedback see:
• Whitmore (2002) - The GROW model of coaching
Refer to the Background Information section for more detail

Target-setting and action planning
A significant omission from the Coaching and Mentoring Framework is target setting and action planning. In terms of guiding a student-teacher in meeting the requirements laid out in the Standards for QTS, having a series of clear, achievable goals is an essential part of the process of review and forward planning.

Most will be familiar with the acronym for setting SMART targets:
• Specific, Measurable, Agreed, Realistic, Time phased
Whitmore (2002) also suggests targets should be PURE:
• Positively stated, Understood, Relevant, Ethical) 
and CLEAR:
• Challenging, Legal, Environmentally sound, Appropriate, Recorded

The processes for setting targets and action planning and the procedures for recording, monitoring and reviewing progress against targets and actions varies in detail between providers but the products are largely similar. In some cases, targets are set following an observation of practice, whilst other providers prefer to discuss target setting at regular (eg weekly) review meetings. Action planning tends to be more long-term or, in some cases, arising from a ‘cause for concern’ procedure.

The process by which goals or targets are identified, negotiated, discussed and agreed will vary, not only between providers but across mentors within a single partnership. This will be dependent on the relationship between the mentor and mentee and the stage the mentoring relationship has reached (See below). For example, a student-teacher with little previous experience of teaching at the start of his first placement may have difficulty identifying and setting his own targets, whereas it is to be hoped that a confident student-teacher towards the end of a final placement will be considerably more proactive in setting her own targets.

For more information on developing mentors’ and student-teachers’ skills in target setting refer to the section on mentor training and professional development. You may also find the following useful in providing some background information:

Other related areas which you may want to explore further include:
• Problem-based learning / Progressive enquiry
• Mind Mapping (eg Buzan) and Concept / Cognitive mapping (Tolman)

Building a learner’s control
As indicated in the subsection above, a key objective for a mentor is to develop the mentoring relationship from one of dependence on the part of the mentee to independence, by shifting the locus of control from mentor to mentee. It is very important that training providers have a clear appreciation of the background of each student-teacher from the moment he or she enters the course, to ensure that the right sort and level of support is provided and that those involved in school-based training are aware of this. Many ITT programmes have comprehensive strategies for identifying the training needs of their students and, through a training plan, personalise training activities and the focus of school-based experience to meet those needs. 

As student-teachers become more experienced and confident, their needs will change, and hence the training plan will have to be continuously reviewed, modified and adapted. You may find it useful to refer to some of the models of the mentoring relationship to help identify and monitor the progress of your students through the programme.

Models of mentoring and coaching identify stages through which a mentoring relationship progresses. For example:
• Technical, practical, critical, emancipatory (Furlong, J., Hirst, P. H., Pocklington, K. &amp; Miles, S. (1988))
• formal, cordial, friendship (Martin, S. (1994)) 
• early idealism, survival, recognising difficulties, hitting the plateau, moving on (Maynard, T., Furlong, J. (1993)) 
• Mutual Admiration, Development, Disillusionment, Parting, Transformation (Phillips-Jones, L. (n.d.))
Refer to the Background Information section for more detail

Regardless of the labels, these models suggest an effective mentoring relationship is one which shifts over time. However, the omnipresence of assessment against the Standards means that a key element of control remains in the hands of the mentor. The introduction of grade criteria (OFSTED, 2008) which go beyond the Standards by adopting a ‘best fit’ approach adds a further level of complication to the assessment process but does seem to be an attempt to move away from the ‘box-ticking’ competency approach to mentoring to one which lends itself more to a reflective, learner-centred model.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skills specific to specialist coaching

Facilitate access to research and evidence to support the development of pedagogic practice
In HEI-based ITT it is assumed that the HEI will provide student-teachers with access to research and, for example, inspection evidence to support the development of their practice. With the vast majority of PGCE programmes now being assessed at Masters Level, it is hard to imagine that student-teachers would not be expected to draw extensively on research to analyse, evaluate and reflect upon key aspects of practice. The impending introduction of the school-based Masters in Teaching and Learning could impact on where and how student-teachers will gain access to research evidence, particularly those following school-based training routes into teaching. 

The extent to which school-based mentors have access to and utilise research evidence in carrying out their role will be dependent on the training and ongoing support they receive from their provider(s) and also their motivations, interests and background. (See Training and Development Section)

It has been argued, particularly by Argyris and Schön (1974, 1976, 1993), that professionals develop ‘theories of action’ and ‘theories-in-use’ which inform and help to rationalise and develop their practices. The notions of ‘single- and double-loop learning’, ‘reflection-on, reflection-in and reflection-through-action’ (Schön, 1983) are powerful in helping both coach and coachee to make their implicit and developing theories more explicit and hence susceptible to scrutiny, testing and challenge.

Tailor activities in partnership with the professional learner
A key task of the teacher-mentor, in collaboration with the student-teacher, professional-mentor and university-tutor, is to manage the day-to-day activities which will enable student-teachers to develop their skills, knowledge and expertise. These activities can arise formally through negotiated target-setting and action planning or less formally as issues and opportunities arise.

Facilitate growing independence in professional learning from the outset
As indicated in the mentoring section above (see Build a learner’s control), having an awareness of the stages through which the coaching relationship is developing will help the coach gradually shift responsibility for target setting and action planning to the coachee. 

Whitmore (2002), for example, outlines the GROW model which stresses the importance from the outset of a coachee’s ‘awareness and responsibility’ for the actions which are agreed and taken in a coaching relationship. 

Establish buffer zones between coaching and other formal relationships
As a university tutor you will become increasingly aware of the range of coaching and mentoring relationships which develop between teacher-mentors, professional-mentors and student teachers. Sometimes there will be clashes of personality which impinge upon the coaching relationship and occasionally informal aspects of the relationship affect the objectivity of the judgements which are being made – ie the coach and the coachee become ‘too pally’.

Helping school-based mentors to be aware of the conflicts in role between being a colleague, an assessor and a friend is an important part of the training process (see Training and Professional Development) as is the importance of basing judgements on evidence (see above).

Training and Professional Development in Mentoring and Coaching


This section provides you with some ideas and resources for inducting and developing the expertise of mentors with whom you will be working. Training for mentors can be provided through formal, centre-based training sessions or through one-to-one school-based contact. Included in this section are examples of activities and resources which might prove useful in clarifying your role in training and supporting mentors with whom you are working.

The type and focus of the training you provide will be dependent on a number of interrelated factors: the particular role of the recipients, their background experience of teaching, their existing knowledge and experience of mentoring and coaching, the partnership arrangements, your role, the nature and purpose of the training and the location of and circumstances determining the training. For example, training could take place on a one-to-one basis with a mentor during a school-visit; alternatively, the training may take place as part of a one-day conference for all types of mentor across the whole partnership. Similarly, the training could be provided online, through the provision of documentation and resources, via the student-teachers or through university-tutors.

Some of the strategies and approaches you may want to consider in providing support for your mentors might include:
• One-to-one ongoing support via university tutors and/or link tutors
• One-to-one support for teacher-mentors provided by professional mentors
• Cascade training provided to link tutors and/or professional mentors which is then disseminated to teacher-mentors
• Training manuals, booklets, leaflets and documentation for consultation on a need-to-know basis
• Online activities, materials and resources for mentors
• Online discussion-boards, blogs and FAQs to address ongoing needs
• Cluster-based training sessions for mentors with a common interest
• Centre-based induction and update sessions for target groups of mentors
• Centre-based ‘training’ sessions for specific groups of mentors
• Centre-based conferences to address identified needs or particular initiatives
• Local or regional conferences and briefings

Rather than attempting to anticipate the range of approaches which you may decide to adopt, this section will focus on the purposes of the training, leaving you to determine the most appropriate means by which the training and development is delivered.

The model of training and development which is proposed here draws upon several sources and is based on experience across a range of providers. It aims to address the skills and knowledge needed for effective mentoring and coaching in an ITT setting by organising training activities according to the needs of the recipients.

Introduction to mentoring and coaching
Intended audience
Anyone engaged in mentoring ITT student-teachers would benefit from a general introduction to mentoring and coaching. Those who have been involved in mentoring and coaching for some time may benefit from an update on current developments.

Content
There are two elements to this awareness raising; an introduction to the principles of mentoring and coaching and an introduction to the practices, policies and procedures used by the training provider.

The principles of mentoring and coaching
• What is mentoring and coaching
• Models of mentoring and coaching
• What are the skills of mentoring and coaching

The practices, policies and procedures of mentoring within our partnership
• Clarification of the roles and responsibilities of those engaged in mentoring and coaching within the partnership (ie Who)
• Overview of the training programme – where the school-based element(s) fit into the training programme as a whole (ie What)
• Policies and procedures – an overview of the practices of managing school-based training particular to this partnership (ie How)
• Documentation – overview of paperwork required by the provider in managing the school-based components of the programme and where to find it (ie Which)
• Expectations and outcomes – what is expected of the student-teachers and of the mentors at key points in the programme (ie When)

Mentoring
Intended audience
As can be seen from the other sections of this resource (What is menotoring and coaching?|199|2#), it is assumed that mentoring is more likely to be the primary focus of the university tutor and professional mentor, in managing, assessing and monitoring the training process. However, teacher-mentors will need to be aware of some of the issues included here, particularly those relating to the assessment and target setting.

Content
The Mentoring process
• Models of mentoring
• Establishing, maintaining and developing working relationships with student-teachers, university tutors and mentors.

Inducting student-teachers
• Welcome packs and procedures for inducting student-teachers into the school or setting
• Clarification of roles, responsibilities and expectations for all involved, and where to go for support, guidance and assistance

Facilitation for mentoring
• Arranging training opportunities within the placement – timetables, access to specialists, identifying relevant activities in relation to training plans and expectations for a placement

Monitoring
• Checking on progress (of student-teachers and mentors)
• Quality assurance of the ongoing support being provided and moderation of assessments (eg through paired observations and assessments)
• The ‘cause for concern’ procedure for student-teachers at risk of failing

Assessment
• Interpretation and application of the Standards and OFSTED grade criteria
• Accumulating evidence for addressing the Standards
• Recognising effective practice appropriate for a newly qualified teacher
• Moderating assessments and dispute management
• Action planning and target setting

Coaching
Intended audience
Although teacher-mentors are those most likely to be engaged in coaching student-teachers, mentors too will be expected to coach student-teachers from time to time and will almost certainly be involved in coaching teacher-mentors. It is also important that the coachees are provided with training in their role in the coaching relationship. A powerful way of achieving this is to plan training activities which involve both the mentors and the student-teachers working together.

Content
The coaching relationship
• The coaching process
• The role of the coach and the coachee
• Establishing, developing, maintaining a coaching relationship

Observation and feedback
• Observing and recording practice
• Active listening
• Reflection and analysis
• Target setting and action planning

Facilitation for coaching
• Monitoring progress
• Gathering evidence
• Identifying opportunities for developing the skills and competences of the student-teacher
• Modelling practice
• Team planning and team teaching
• Observing others’ practice

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Training activities and resources
What follows is a selective overview of the types of activity which could be used in supporting and developing the capabilities of the mentors for whom you have responsibility. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but may provide some ideas.

Scenarios
Scenario-based approaches provide opportunities for mentors to reflect on their own experiences or devise strategies for dealing with situations which have so far been outside their own experience. For example, a scenario might focus on a student-teacher who is not making expected progress despite having been set clear targets.

Scenarios can be presented through thumbnail descriptions of situations, through audio recordings of say a feedback session, through transcripts of a target-setting session, through video recordings of actual or staged sessions or through role play.

Summary cards
An extension of the above could be to supply the participants with a series of cards which attempt to summarise the key issues arising from the scenario. The cards should be of varying relevance, with some being highly significant and others being irrelevant. The participants sort the cards according to significance. For example, cards could be provided showing the Standards. The participants are asked to identify which of the Standards is most applicable to the situation.

Perspectives/spectacles analysis
An interesting variation on the above is for participants to try and see the issues arising from a scenario or an incident from another’s perspective – for example the student-teacher’s, the children’s, the head of department’s, the university tutor’s, the professional mentor’s, an OFSTED inspector’s, etc.. For those wishing to take this further, participants could be asked to view a situation from the perspective of an educationist such as Vygotsky, Bandura, Bruner, Schön or Moon. 

Modelling and role play
Similar to scenarios, a group of participants is asked to work through a situation (eg giving feedback following a particularly difficult lesson) and the other participants are asked to act as observers, recording examples of, for example, active listening, effective questioning or negotiated target setting.

Sorting or classifying activities
Participants are provided with cards or post-its of concepts, statements, descriptions or outlines of events and asked to sort them into order of priority, seriousness, relevance or difficulty. Alternatively, the cards could be sorted into categories either defined by the organiser or on the basis of an emergent classification system. For example, a series of tasks could be sorted by participants according to who they consider should take responsibility for their completion.

A variation of the above is to ask the participants to create their own cards or post-its of, say, issues which are concerning them, and sort these into priority order or group them into clusters.

Concept mapping
Participants brainstorm their understanding of an aspect of mentoring and coaching (eg giving feedback) and, using post-it notes, link the ideas together in the form of a concept-map. This provides the trainer with a useful overview of the participants’ current state of knowledge and understanding and allows participants to share their knowledge with the rest of the group.

SWOT/GAP analysis
Participants are asked to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to partnership arrangements within their own schools and/or across the partnership. Whilst this might prove to be uncomfortable for you as the organiser, the next stage will be for the participants to generate ways forward to make enhancements. This process sometimes reveals that the issues require some sharing of responsibility.

Generating solutions
Groups of participants are presented with problems which might arise as part of their role as mentor, coach, tutor or student-teacher. They must then generate as many solutions (or responses) as they can within an allotted time. They should be encouraged to consider a full range of solutions, including those which are not feasible as sometimes these can lead to novel solutions.

Buzz Groups
Small groups of participants are asked to discuss a particular issue and then feed back to the group as a whole their thoughts. The issues could be common to all groups, related issues or diverse issues. For example, a real issue might be the communication of information across the partnership. The buzz groups could be used to suggest ways in which communication could be improved; one group focusing on documentation, another group on web-based resources and a third group on communication through individuals such as the student-teachers and link tutors.

Moderation activities and events
Participants bring evidence of student-teachers’ planning, reflections, action-planning to a group session to compare their assessments.

Paired observations
An effective way of developing practice is to arrange paired observations of student-teachers’ practice. The participants make independent records of their observations and compare notes subsequently, noting similarities and differences in their practices and outcomes. Paired observation sessions can be staged in university-based training sessions through the use of video.

Co-coaching
Mentors and coaches work together on developing an aspect of their practice which is of mutual concern. The participants agree beforehand the objectives and strategies for enhancing their practice and then monitor each other (eg through observation of a feedback session with a student-teacher) to develop aspects of their practice. It has been shown that both observer and observed benefit greatly from such experiences.

Learning logs and diaries
Just as student-teachers are expected to complete learning logs of their progress, mentors could also keep logs of their experiences, particularly events or incidents which are particularly significant. These could be shared on a one-to-one basis with professional mentors, university tutors or link tutors for reflection or analysis or could be used as the basis for a group-based session (suitably anonymised).

Peer tutoring / peer explaining
Prior to a training session, participants could be asked to explore a particular aspect of their role and present a summary of their findings to the group. For example, one participant might be asked to find out about the GROW model of coaching whilst another is asked to study Egan’s ‘skilled helper’ approach. The group could then discuss the relevance of these models for their own practice.

Swapshop
Each participant is asked to describe an aspect of their practice in working as a mentor which they feel is particularly effective. These are collated and discussed. To make this feel less intimidating, this could be done in small groups to later be shared with the whole cohort.

The Quality Assurance of School-based Provision


Two sections of the ICT Tutors website deal with aspects of quality assurance within the university based components ITT programmes (Quality Assurance and Delivering High Quality Training), this section is about quality assurance of your school-based provision.

The OFSTED framework for the inspection of Initial Teacher Training is a useful starting point when evaluating the quality of your school-based provision. - http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Forms-and-guidance/Browse-all-by/Other/General/Framework-fo
r-the-inspection-of-initial-teacher-education-2008-11

Similarly, you need and your mentors need to be very familiar with the OFSTED Grade Criteria to ensure that all judgements of your student-teachers’ performance accords with those of the inspectors.

A key aspect of the inspection is a judgement on the overall effectiveness of the provision. OFSTED are principally concerned with the extent to which the provision is successful in securing high-quality outcomes for all trainees. To make this judgement they take account of a series of factors.

Whether available resources are used effectively and efficiently
how well the available resources are deployed to secure the best possible outcomes for trainees
how well the provider explains and justifies the allocation of resources in terms of the outcomes for trainees
This will include the way in which the funding which is provided for training by the TDA is deployed within the university and across the partnership schools. The expectation is that the moneys which are provided to schools for ITT trainees is used to, for example, facilitate paired observations, meetings with key members of staff, non-contact time for attendance at mentor training sessions. Part of your QA role will therefore be to check on how schools are utilising the funds which the university devolves to them. This is clearly a sensitive area but something into which OFSTED will enquire.

A further issue which forms part of an OFSTED inspection is the extent to which the provision across the partnership is of consistently high quality. Factors to be considered include:
the extent to which all trainers contribute to the training programme and the accurate assessments of trainees to secure the best possible outcomes for individuals and groups of trainees, as evidenced by:
how well all those involved in training understand the rationale for the training programme
the quality of placements and mentoring support for trainees
the involvement of all partners in reviewing, planning and delivering the training programme
the extent to which all training partners have high expectations for training and of trainees
the effectiveness of the professional development of all trainers in securing and sustaining high-quality training and consistent and reliable assessments of trainees
the accuracy of final assessments
the views of trainees.
Clearly, this provides a clear agenda for you in organising your mentor training sessions, ensuring school-based colleagues are actively involved in monitoring, developing, contributing to and being kept up to date with changes to the programme.

Another key aspect is the reliability, accuracy and consistency of assessments of trainees’ practice. Ensuring that mentors new to the partnership are provided with adequate training and ongoing support (e.g. through paired observations and moderation events with the professional mentor and/or university tutor) is another key element of quality assurance.

There will be an expectation that you will keep accurate records of not only each trainee’s progress, but also the stage of training and experience, consistency of support and assessments and the feedback from trainees for each mentor in the partnership.

Similarly, you will be expected to have regularly and continuously gathered the views and evaluation data from mentors and trainees, analysed them for patterns and anomalies and put into effect action plans and strategies for addressing any issues which have arisen.

Another key element of the inspection will be a judgement on the extent to which the provision promotes equality of opportunity, values diversity and eliminates harassment and unlawful discrimination. Inspectors will seek to determine:
the views of trainees
how well the partnership ensures that all trainees receive their entitlement to high-quality training to secure the best possible outcomes
how well the partnership promotes equality of access and opportunity, eliminates any harassment and unlawful discrimination
how well the partnership creates a harmonious and inclusive environment for learning through:
the quality of support for the personal well-being of individual and groups of trainees
how secure trainees feel in declaring a disability and/or personal circumstance and/or in reporting incidents of harassment and unlawful discrimination
how confident trainees are that any declaration will lead to adjustments and adaptations to training programmes so that equality of access is secured
There is an expectation that the university will have made clear to partnership schools its policies for race equality and discrimination and set in place procedures for trainees to report any issues which arise. Trainees will also be expected to be made aware of the school’s own policies and procedures safeguarding the wellbeing of the children they will be teaching.

Inspectors will ask the trainees about their knowledge and understanding of the policies and procedures and you will be expected to be able to outline how issues have or will be dealt with should they arise.

Inspectors will also evaluate how performance is reviewed in order to improve or to sustain high-quality outcomes. They will explore:
the extent to which self-evaluation by management:
covers all aspects of the provision (including the Requirements and legislation for equality and diversity)
is based on reliable evidence, including the views of trainees and other users such as schools and colleges
has correctly identified any variations in the quality of provision
is incisive, rigorous and accurate
includes the analysis of trainees’ progress and attainments over time
provides a secure basis to evaluate impact and plan for further improvements
how well the quality of recruitment and selection, training and assessment of trainees across the partnership is monitored and judged, through:
the analysis of data and other information about trainees’ progress and attainment, including that made by particular groups, and, where appropriate, trainees’ future career paths
the scrutiny of the impact of the policies on diversity, equal opportunities and race relations, and the elimination of harassment and unlawful discrimination
the quality of internal and external moderation of the assessment of trainees’ progress and attainment
the extent to which the provider takes account of a wide range of evidence, including the views of current trainees and training partners, former trainees and their employing institutions, and other stakeholders, to evaluate the quality of the training.
You will probably be asked to explain how you track the progress of trainees from interview through to the award of the qualification at the end of the course. You should also have available examples of how you have acted on concerns over the quality of school-based provision, indicating how these were identified and the strategies you had in place for dealing with them. You will need to keep evidence of your monitoring visits to schools, how you make judgements about the quality of provision in school and how you provide school-based mentors with feedback on the effectiveness of their support. As indicated above, how you and/or your professional mentors moderate the assessments of subject mentors will be scrutinised.

The inspectors will evaluate how you and your partnership anticipates change, and prepares for and responds to national and local initiatives. This will include:
the extent to which the leadership at all levels deals effectively with change, implements improvement and assesses impact, through:
the effectiveness of planning in anticipating and addressing changes in policy, and national/local initiatives
the extent to which workforce, partnership and resource planning and development are effective in preparing to meet the demands created by these changes
use of systematic and/or innovative and creative approaches: to dealing with change; longstanding and intractable problems; implementing improvement; and assessing impact.
You should make sure you can explain how you keep your school-based mentors up-to-date with developments in the ITT programme which reflect ongoing changes to the curriculum and current initiatives. 

Finally, the inspection will explore the extent to which you plan and take action for improvement. This will cover:
how well planning builds on clearly identified needs and priorities, establishes focused and measurable success criteria and allocates resources to achieve the best outcomes for trainees
the extent to which leadership at all levels has a record of securing improvement and/or sustaining high-quality outcomes for trainees, as evidenced by:
the effectiveness of the actions taken to ensure consistently high-quality training and outcomes across the partnership
the impact of the actions taken to deal with identified shortcomings in trainees’ progress and attainments
the effectiveness with which the necessary actions are communicated across the partnership.
You should therefore ensure you have evidence that you have analysed evaluations, assessment information and trends, not only within your own programme but also in comparison with the performance of similar providers and national benchmarks (eg the annual NQT survey). There should therefore be a clear link between performance data and developments in the programme to improve provision and/or to address any areas of concern. It will be expected that developments will have been made with the involvement of colleagues in school and that all those engaged in partnership will have been informed about the implications of changes.

Although the above sounds quite daunting, most of it is common sense. Just as you will keep clear and accurate records of the progress of each trainee, you should also ensure you have QA information about all schools and mentors. Mentor training (whether university-based, cluster-based or on a one-to-one basis) should provide opportunities to consult with and keep colleagues abreast of developments. It makes sense therefore, to log all contact with school-based mentors and ensure that rigorous systems are in place for gathering and analysing performance data.

Background Information on Mentoring and Coaching


What follows is an attempt to provide a flavour of the issues, themes, underpinning theories and rationales for mentoring and coaching. You will find that there is a wealth of information available via the internet as mentoring and coaching for improving leadership, management, corporate development, business acumen, sporting prowess and general life skills is big business. Some of this information and approaches are founded on pseudo-scientific principles, but because the focus of mentoring and coaching is on personal development, it also touches upon a wide range of topics ranging from the study of social interaction, through perception, to learning theories.

The issues presented here are an attempt to provide a background to the themes presented in the other sections of this resource and are intended to provide you with a springboard for further enquiry.

What is mentoring and coaching?
The CUREE National Framework for mentoring and coaching has been endorsed by the NCSL, the DfES, the TDA, the GTC, the QCA and the National Strategies. It provides a useful overview of the roles and skills required of mentors, specialist coaches and co-coaches, and forms the background to this resource. As has been shown however, it does have its limitations:
See – http://www.curee-paccts.com/mentoring-and-coaching

The National College for School Leadership (NCSL) provides a range of information and resources supporting mentoring and coaching for leadership within educational settings. Although not specifically related to ITT, there is also information on mentoring for personalisation. A useful overview of the differences between mentoring and coaching can be downloaded from - http://www.ncsl.org.uk/publications-index/publications-display.htm?id=21352

The Coaching and Mentoring Network provides a range of sources, including an extensive collection of articles on aspects of mentoring and coaching. Although not specific to teacher education, the information provided helps provide a background to key principles associated with mentoring and coaching . A useful article outlining the key differences between mentoring and coaching can be accessed through - http://www.coachingnetwork.org.uk/resourcecentre/WhatAreCoachingAndMentoring.htm

Refer to the What is Mentoring and Coaching section for more information
The benefits of mentoring and coaching for schools and teachers
When promoting the value for schools of engagement in mentoring ITT student-teachers, it is sometimes useful to be able to point to studies which identifies ongoing benefits.
Bullough (2005) suggests the key benefits of mentoring are: enhancing confidence, building capacity for overcoming difficulties, increasing morale and job satisfaction
Cain (2009) argues that the benefits for mentors in making use of research evidence are that it helps to inform practice; to improve understanding of mentoring using theoretical frameworks, to learn through vicarious experiences of mentoring and to discover ways of investigating one’s own practice
Hurd, Jones, McNamara &amp; Craig (2007) suggest that engagement by schools in ITT provide a series of benefits for enhancing their professional practice. Tier 1 benefits include: access to teaching resources and information on curriculum developments and new ideas. Tier 2 benefits include: enthused teachers becoming inspired and motivated to change their classroom practices. Tier 3 benefits include: value congruence between provider and school with training-active schools achieving significantly higher test results and higher Ofsted inspection grades.
McIntyre &amp; Hagger (1996) identify benefits for schools and teachers in terms of reducing isolation, increasing confidence/self-esteem and improving self-reflection and problem-solving.
Mentoring Roles, Skills, Strategies and Qualities
This resource has used the CUREE framework for mentoring and coaching as a basis, largely because it has been recognised and adopted by most of the organisations involved in teaching and teacher education. As has been indicated in the Skills section, it does have its limitations. The following annotated bibliography provides an overview of other sources on which you may wish to draw, particularly when developing training and development programmes which might lead to advanced qualifications or classroom-based research.
Abell et al. (1995) identify a series of roles which mentors of beginning teachers (ie NQTs) may adopt. These include: parent figure, support system, trouble shooter, scaffolder, guide, counsellor and role model
Buell (2004) Highlights four common approaches to mentoring; cloning, nurturing, friendship and apprenticeship
Burgess &amp; Shelton Mayes (2007) stress the importance of mentors supporting professional development through an apprenticeship approach. They suggest the role of the mentor includes identifying starting points for mentoring, mentoring for growth and assessing the mentee.
Feiman-Nemser &amp; Parker (1992) suggest there are three types of mentor: local guides, educational companions, agents of change – the latter being the most effective.
Fletcher (2004) sees the mentor and mentee working together in partnership with the mentor acting as a co-researcher with the mentee.
Furlong &amp; Maynard (1995) have probably had the greatest influence on the development of mentoring in teacher education. They suggest mentors act as models, a coach, mentors, critical friends and a co-enquirers. As a model they support the student’s observations and become involved in collaborative teaching focused on rules and routines. As a coach they engage in systematic observation and provide feedback the student’s ‘performance’. As a mentor they facilitate reflection –on –action. When acting as a critical friend they observe and re-examine the effectiveness of lesson planning and delivery and as a co-enquirer they teach and supervise in partnership with the student, negotiating the focus and working collaboratively on aspects of practice.
Hall et al (2008) point to issues of dual identity with teacher-mentors (ie teacher v mentor). They suggest that the mentor needs to be prepared to provide emotional as well as professional support. Mentors need to understand the implications of university assignment supervision and become involved in critical evaluation and reflection whilst also developing these skills in the student. Mentors also need to be prepared to become involved in team teaching and collaborative planning. The writers argue that an effective mentor possesses a range of attributes and personal qualities which include: relevant experience, the ability to offer constructive criticism, the means by which to arrange teaching opportunities and a willingness to model and demonstrate. The importance of role clarity is also emphasised as a key characteristic of success.
Hoad (2007) lists a series of qualities which effective mentors of ITT students possess. These include; developing mutual trust, being supportive, modelling teaching, providing induction into the school and classroom, sharing expert knowledge, building autonomy in the trainee, supporting growth of the trainee’s identity as a teacher, possessing interpersonal skills and having the ability to be critically reflective.
Kajs (2002) proposes a framework for supporting novice teachers which includes; knowledge of the stages of teacher development, an appreciation of adult learning principles, an appreciation of the role of professional development, skills in assessment, interpersonal skills, and relevant classroom knowledge and skills.
Kay and Hinds (2005) suggest that the general attributes needed for effective mentoring include; enthusiasm, commitment, willingness, approachability, an ability to open doors and relevant experience. They also suggest that the development of the following skills is beneficial; listening, motivating, influencing, fact finding, liaising, counselling and time management.
Marable &amp; Raimondi (2007) have explored what NQTs found to be the most valuable types of support during their first year of teaching and identify; observation, feedback, written materials, visibility and contact, ongoing support on an individual level, clear expectation of roles and responsibilities, problem resolution, ‘get together’ with peers, focus groups, networking time and classroom visits to other schools.
McNally &amp; Martin (1998) identify three types of mentor - Type A nurturer/supporter, ‘laissez-faire’ low challenge - Type B, high support, high challenge, reflective - Type C, authority figure, lacks engagement – with type B being seen as the most effective
Mullen and Lick (1999) suggest that mentoring is best when the two parties work in partnership, creating a synergy.
Rowley (1999) outlines the key characteristics of a ‘Good Mentor’. These include being committed, recognising the role of the beginning teacher, providing instructional support, being effective with interpersonal skills, modelling continuous learning, and communicating hope and optimism.
Saunders, Pettinger &amp; Tomlinson (1995) identify four types of mentor: ‘hands-off’, ‘progressively collaborative’, ‘professional friend’, ‘classical’ mentor’. They do not favour any particular type, suggesting each has its benefits and drawbacks.
The Scottish HMIE (2008) set-out a series of skills which are required for effective mentoring of ITT students which include; observing practice, asking questions, giving advice, giving feedback, instructing, listening to understand, making suggestions, offering guidance, paraphrasing, reflecting, summarising and telling. They also identify particular features of effective practice in mentoring and coaching which include; a learning conversation, reflection and sharing, agreed outcomes, focus on learning and teaching, mutual benefit and confidentiality.
Williams et al (1998) studied effective mentoring relationships in secondary schools, highlighting the following: supporting, actively teaching, guiding, providing information, offering practical strategies, feeding back on lessons, providing clear assessments of practice.
Stages of mentoring / coaching
The CUREE model does not indicate ways in which a mentoring / coaching relationship might develop over time. For those who are involved in PGCE programmes, where the mentoring relationship between a school-based mentor and student-teacher lasts for several weeks, it is likely that the relationship between mentor and mentee will evolve as they become more familiar with each other, and as the student teacher becomes more at home in the environment and more proficient in teaching. The following developmental models of mentoring relationships shed some light on how such a relationship might develop:
Boydell (1994) proposes five stages through which a mentee may pass: learning to implement; doing things well, learning to improve; doing things better and learning to integrate; doing better things
Brookes &amp; Sikes (1997) put forward a stepped process which commences initially with an apprenticeship approach with the mentor acting as the master craftsman taking most of the initiative but steadily moving into that of co-researchers.
Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus (1986) identify five states through which a mentee may pass: novice, advanced beginning, competent, proficient, expert
Egan (2002) focuses on the interpersonal relationships and proposes a three-stage ‘helping’ model with various sub-steps. Stage 1 – ‘What’s going on?’ which aims to help the ‘client’ clarify the key issues and identify the need for change; Stage 2 – ‘What solutions make sense for me?’ which is designed to help clients determine outcomes; Stage 3 – ‘What do I have to do to get what I need or want?’ which supports the client in developing strategies for achieving their goals.
Fletcher (2004) draws upon Kolb’s cycle of practice by proposing that mentoring goes through a series of cycles of planning, experimentation and review. With responsibility being shifted from mentor to mentee as the relationship develops.
Furlong, Hirst, Pocklington &amp; Miles (1988) suggest four levels of learning in student teachers: technical, practical, critical and emancipatory
Furlong &amp; Maynard (1995) propose five phases of development for beginning teachers, though they are not necessarily sequential as the student-teachers may move back and forth through them dependent on the circumstances: Early Idealism, Personal Survival, Dealing With Difficulties, Hitting A Plateau, Moving On (“acting like a teacher” and “thinking like a teacher)
Martin (1994) identifies three stages in the mentoring process: formal, cordial, friendship
Maynard &amp; Furlong (1993) propose three models of mentoring: the apprenticeship model, the competency model and the reflective practitioner
Pask &amp; Joy (2007) put forward six stages of what they deem to be mentoring-coaching: Context, Issues, Responsibility, Future, Deciding, Action. They suggest that mentoring-coaching is a unified process with mentor-coaches shifting from one role to the other (and back again) as the relationship develops.
Phillips-Jones (n.d.) suggests mentoring tends to follow the same pattern: starting with ‘mutual admiration’, moving on to the ‘development’ phase which ultimately leads to ‘disillusionment’, and then ‘parting’. However despite this, the outcome is considered to be ‘transformation’
Whitmore’s (2002) GROW model of coaching outlines the four stages of a coaching relationship as being the identification of the Goal (ie what does the client want to achieve?), specifying the Reality of the current situation, deciding what Options are available and finally choosing what Will be done to achieve the desired outcome(s).
The skills of mentoring and coaching
To augment or elaborate on your training and development sessions for mentoring and coaching skills, you may want to refer to some of the background literature and/or resources which relates to some of the theoretical underpinning. 

Developing relationships
Bokeno (2009) suggests that as mentoring and coaching are a form of learning relationship, it is important to match the relationship to the goals which should determine the type of learning conversation
Egan (2001) emphasises humanistic approaches and sees relationships as a ‘working alliance’ - a collaborative, forum for relearning but needing to be flexible. Values underpin the development of the relationship with a particular emphasis on respect (do no harm, be competent and committed, show you are ‘for the client, assume the client’s goodwill, don’t rush to judgement, keep the client’s agenda as the focus) and be empathetic (but not sympathetic)
Whitmore (2002) suggests that building ‘awareness’ and ‘responsibility’ is the essence of good coaching - &quot;gathering a clear perception of the relevant facts and information, and the ability to determine what is relevant&quot;, build self-reliance, self belief, self confidence, self responsibility, &quot;the awareness-raising function of the expert coach is indispensable”. A coach is not a problem solver, teacher, instructor or expert - he is a sounding board, facilitator, counsellor or awareness raiser.
Modelling practice
Cruess, Cruess &amp; Steinert (2008) offer a view of ‘role modelling’ from a nursing perspective and identify key competences needed for a role model: Clinical competence (ie knowledge and skills, communication with patients and staff, and sound clinical reasoning and decision making.) , Teaching skills (ie A student centred approach incorporating effective communication, feedback, and opportunities for reflection) and Personal qualities (ie compassion, honesty, and integrity, effective interpersonal relationships, enthusiasm for practice and teaching, and an uncompromising quest for excellence)
Murray &amp; Main (2005) identify aspects of mentoring which include: Befriending; Planning; Collaborating; Coaching; Reflecting. They put forward a proposed framework for role modelling in action which includes communication and assessment; planning, implementation and evaluation; and ‘reflection on the move’
Observation and Feedback
Edge (1993) offers a highly personal view which stresses the importance of listening, discussing alternatives, providing a feedback ‘sandwich’ (ie positive, identify issue, positive), and encouraging self-reflection.
Teachers TV (2008) http://www.teachers.tv/video/27078 - A fifteen minute video clip outlining key principles of giving feedback and setting targets with a student-teacher
University of Chester (2006) Post Lesson Discussion. http://teachermentor.chester.ac.uk/index.php?page_id=273482&amp;group=1 – a video extract of tutor providing feedback and setting targets for a primary student teacher following observation
Effective Questioning
Blair et al (2006) present the outcomes from an international project which suggests effective questioning includes: Open questions, Closed questions, Leading questions, Questions that follow the students’ interest, Clarifying questions, Challenging questions, Incisive questions, and Questions that check out commitment
Egan (2001) takes a counselling perspective and suggests; ask a limited number of questions which are open ended. Use questions to explore possibilities and which act as probes to clarify meaning and to uncover blind-spots.
Sinclair (n.d.) suggests questions which: support the coachee's learning need to be open, encourage looking beyond the immediate, invite a personal response, and promote commitment and action
Whitmore (2002) whose GROW model has become well established suggests effective questions: compel thinking, demand high resolution focus, should seek descriptive (v judgemental) answers, provide opportunities for feedback for coach. He argues that questions need to evoke factual answers rather than opinions, should be progressive focusing from broad to specific, and must follow the coachee's lead rather than the coach’s (hidden) agenda.
Zeus &amp; Skiffington (2002) argue that questioning is a core dialoguing skill. How, What, When, Where, Why (with caution) questions help clarify the situation and encourage descriptive responses. Clarifying, elaborating, challenging and confronting questions help with active listening. There should also be ‘Appreciative Questioning’ (to focus on strengths) and ‘Problem-Free questioning’ (to focus on aspects of practice which are successful) . The authors also place emphasis on the value of metaphors when dialoguing.
Target setting and action planning
Mindtools.com (n.d.) outline the background to SMART goal setting and stresses the need to take account of Clarity, Challenge, Commitment., Feedback and Task complexity.
Whitmore (2002) suggests the most effective feedback is subjective and descriptive – the worst is personal and judgemental. He argues that generating high quality relevant feedback, from within rather than from an expert, is essential for continuous improvement - Goals should be SMART (specific, measurable, agreed, realistic, time phased), PURE (positively stated, understood, Relevant, ethical) and CLEAR (challenging, legal, environmentally sound, appropriate, recorded)
Active listening
Robertson (2005) summarises ‘Active Listening Skills’ as: attentive body language: posture and gestures showing involvement and engagement, appropriate body movement, appropriate facial expressions, appropriate eye contact, conducted in a non-distracting environment. In addition, she lists: following skills (ie giving the speaker space to tell their story in their own way), asking interested ‘door openers’, using minimal verbal encouragers; and asking infrequent, timely and considered questions. She stresses the importance of attentive silences and reflecting skills (ie restating the feeling and/or content with understanding and acceptance), paraphrasing (check periodically that you’ve understood), reflecting back feelings and content, and summarising the major issues.
New Jersey Self-Help Group Clearinghouse (n.d.) http://www.medhelp.org/njgroups/WHAT%20IS%20ACTIVE%20LISTENING.pdf presents a useful summary sheet outlining the key principles of Active Listening.
Theoretical underpinning
Because mentoring and coaching touches upon a wide range of areas of learning, from interpersonal communication, through emotional intelligence to learning theories such as social constructivism, what follows is only a flavour of the background literature. With teaching moving to become a Masters’ level profession, there is likely to be an increasing need for mentors to refer and contribute to the growing fields of literature on mentoring, coaching and hence draw upon key sources.

General
Burgess &amp; Shelton Mayes (2007) paper describes the value of mentoring (for teaching assistants) in terms of their professional development through an apprenticeship approach
Cain (2009) outlines the benefits for mentors in using research to inform their work, identifying benefits of learning by reflecting and learning through apprenticeship. It provides a useful overview of these two perspectives which underpin mentoring and coaching
Online Journals and resource banks for mentoring and coaching
The International Journal of Evidence Based Coaching and Mentoring http://www.business.brookes.ac.uk/research/areas/coachingandmentoring/?err404=research/areas/coa
ching&amp;mentoring - free access to academic articles about mentoring and coaching
The Mentoring Leadership and Resource Network – source of online articles http://www.mentors.net/03articles.html
Resources for Teacher Leadership – mentoring and coaching - http://cse.edc.org/products/teacherleadership/mentoring.asp
Emotional Intelligence (EI)
Goleman (1998) provides what is probably the key text for defining EI. A summary outlining the key issues can be downloaded from Business Summaries in a Nutshell - http://www.irgworld.in/docs/Success/WorkingWithEmotionalIntelligence.pdf|
Locke (2005) suggests that EI is of limited value because 1. The definition of the concept is constantly changing. 2. Most definitions are so all-inclusive as to make the concept unintelligible. 3. One definition (e.g., reasoning with emotion) involves a contradiction. 4. There is no such thing as actual emotional intelligence, although intelligence can be applied to emotions as well as to other life domains. He suggests a more productive approach is to explore ‘introspective skills’.
Informal Learning
Colley, Hodkinson &amp; Malcolm (2003) provide a clear and detailed overview of the background and applications of information and formal learning
GLACIER (n.d.) outlines and explores Eurat’s (2004) typology of informal learning: Implicit, reactive and deliberative learning.
McNally et al (2004) details the key principles of informal learning and its application
Reflection and reflective practice
Hoffman-Kipp, Artiles &amp; Lopez-Torres (2003) provide a useful overview of the background to reflective practice in teaching, tracing its development to the present day
UKCLE (n.d.) presents a brief overview of Moon, Biggs, Kolb and Schon’s views on reflection and reflective practice.
PracticebasedLearning.org (2008) provide information and resources related to: Becoming a reflective practitioner, Assessment and reflection, Supervision relationship and reflective practice, Learning from significant events, Tools for reflection. Although aimed at health and social care practitioners, the resources and ideas have relevance for ITT
Smith (2001) presents a useful overview of the underpinning for Argyris’s work, including theories in action and single and double loop learning
Tomlinson (1995) provides an overview of the teaching Cycle (Plan/Reflect – Teach – Monitor outcome), developing professional knowledge, Reflective Coaching, Mentoring Assistance, Progressively collaborative teaching (PCT), effective facilitator
Constructivism
Cox (2003) argues for a constructivist approach which centres on the needs of the mentee
Hoover (1996)presents a brief but well detailed overview on the implications of constructivism on educational practice
Reusser (2001) proposes that dialogue through cognitive apprenticeship is central to the development of teachers’ understanding of their practices based on experience
Situated Cognition
Brill, Kim &amp; Galloway (2001) presents a clear overview of cognitive apprenticeship and its relationship with situated cognition and communities of practice – includes useful resources including video and flash animation
Edwards (1998) suggest that the context determines the style of learning. He sees learning as knowledge to be acquired and then deployed v situated cognition
Lave &amp; Wenger (1991) suggest knowledge is conceived as socially situated and constructed within communities of practice
Action Learning / Action Reflection Learning
Marquardt (1999) identifies six components of action learning: 1. a problem or challenge of importance to the group; 2. a group of four to eight members, ideally from diverse backgrounds and/or parts of the organization; 3. a process that emphasizes questions and reflection; 4. the power to take action on strategies developed; 5. a commitment to learning at the individual, team and organizational levels; and 6. an action learning coach who focuses on capturing the learning and improving the skills of the group.
Revans (1982) was the originator of active learning – this seminal work outlines the key principles
Rimanoczy (2007) describes the elements of Action Reflection Learning (ARL) as - Ownership: taking ownership for one’s learning, Sequenced learning, Exchange of learnings, Just-in-time learning (just-in-time intervention), Learning and personality styles, Appreciative approach, Linking: connecting the concept with other contexts, Coaching one-on-one, Safe environments, Balance task/learning, Learning coach, Holistic involvement of the individual, Questioning, Feedback, Five-level system, Guided reflection, Unfamiliar environments
Learning conversations and dialogue
Atherton (2005) presents a very accessible outline of conversational learning theory
Remington Smith (2007) argues that student-teachers would benefit from training in their role in mentoring and coaching dialogues

This template builds nicer-looking [[w:Common fraction|common fractions]]. It takes one, two or three parameters: the optional integer (may be signed), the optional numerator and the required denominator; in this order.
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fraction|1|2|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: {{fraction|1|2|3}} (integer, numerator and denominator)
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fraction|2|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: {{fraction|2|3}} (numerator and denominator)
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fraction|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: {{fraction|3}} (denominator only)
This template differs from {{tl|frac}} in that it tries to use precomposed glyphs and otherwise just inserts a proper fraction slash and possibly a thin space, but does not superscript the numerator and subscript the denominator.

Examples:

{{fraction|2}} {{fraction|3}} {{fraction|2|3}} {{fraction|4}} {{fraction|2|4}} {{fraction|3|4}} {{fraction|5}} {{fraction|2|5}} {{fraction|3|5}} {{fraction|4|5}}{{fraction|6}} {{fraction|5|6}}  {{fraction|7}} {{fraction|2|7}} {{fraction|3|7}} {{fraction|4|7}} {{fraction|5|7}} {{fraction|6|7}} {{fraction|8}} {{fraction|2|8}} {{fraction|3|8}} {{fraction|4|8}} {{fraction|5|8}} {{fraction|6|8}} {{fraction|7|8}} {{fraction|16}} {{fraction|3|16}} {{fraction|5|16}} {{fraction|7|16}} {{fraction|9|16}} {{fraction|11|16}} {{fraction|13|16}} {{fraction|15|16}} {{fraction|5|32}} {{fraction|27|32}}

{{fraction|m|s}} {{fraction|km|h}} {{fraction|kg&amp;middot;m|s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{fraction|s}} {{fraction|Mbit|s}}

To allow numerical sorting of a column containing fractions, use {{tl|sortfrac}} instead. It is a combination of {{tl|frac}} and {{tl|sort}}.

== Notes ==
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;frasl;&lt;/code&gt; may be used to print out the fraction glyph &quot; &amp;frasl; &quot;

== See also ==

* {{tl|frac}} ({{frac|1|2}}) displays common fractions using a [[w:fraction slash|fraction slash]]
* {{tl|sfrac}} ({{sfrac|1|2}}) displays common fractions using a [[w:vinculum|vinculum]]
* {{tl|Dec to frac}}

{{Intricate template}}

This template converts decimal fractions to vulgar fractions.  It takes two parameters:
*fraction to be converted;
*resulting vulgar fraction's denominator

If the decimal fraction includes an integer part, it is retained in the output.  If the resulting vulgar fraction can be resolved in lower terms than specified denominator, it is resolved, but due to algorithm limitation fractions with relatively large numerators/denominators may be left unresolved.

==Examples==
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dec to frac|3.6742|16}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; {{dec to frac|3.6742|16}}
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dec to frac|0.375|16}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; {{dec to frac|0.375|16}}

Sometimes it is impossible to convert a decimal to a vulgar fraction with requested denominator, in which cases the output is simply an input rounded up:
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dec to frac|3.99|8}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; {{dec to frac|3.99|8}}
...or down:
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dec to frac|3.1|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; {{dec to frac|3.1|2}}

When that is unacceptable, increase the denominator:
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dec to frac|3.99|100}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; {{dec to frac|3.99|100}}
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dec to frac|3.1|10}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; {{dec to frac|3.1|10}}

{{Intricate template}}

This template calculates the '''[[w:greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]]''' (gcd) of two parameters. It returns the value of gcd.  Zero is returned when calculation is too complex (this implementation only allows for ten iterations of the [[w:Euclidean algorithm|Euclidean algorithm]]).

==Examples==
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{gcd|16|6}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; {{gcd|16|6}}
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{gcd|544|119}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; {{gcd|544|119}}
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{gcd|2089|3571}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; {{gcd|2089|3571}} (algorithm iteration limit reached)

This template rounds to a fraction.  It takes two parameters.
#the number to be rounded (any real number)
#the denominator to be rounded to (positive integer)
Fractions are expressed in the simplest terms.

The template calls {{tl|gcd}} and {{tl|rndfrac/out}}.

*{{xpsoc|rndfrac|0.1234|8}}
*{{xpsoc|rndfrac|12.65|6}}
*{{xpsoc|rndfrac|-9.123|20}}

== Code ==
Main template {{tl|rndfrac}}
&lt;source lang=html5&gt;

 | {{#ifexpr: {{{1}}} * {{{2}}} round 0 &lt; 0
    |−
   }}{{formatnum: {{rndfrac/{{{out|out}}} 
                   | {{#expr: floor( (abs {{{1}}} * {{{2}}} round 0 ) / {{{2}}} ) }} 
                   | {{#expr: (abs {{{1}}} * {{{2}}} round 0 ) mod {{{2}}} }}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is for manually adjusting sorting order in sortable tables by specified sortkeys.

;Usage:
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;sort | 1 = {{{sort value}}} | 2 = {{{displayed value}}} }}&lt;/code&gt; → {{sort | 1 = {{{sort value}}} | 2 = {{{displayed value}}} }}
The first parameter is the sortkey; the second parameter is the wikitext of what has to be displayed. By default, this is the sortkey with link brackets:
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;sort | 1 = {{{displayed value}}} }}&lt;/code&gt; → {{sort | 1 = {{{displayed value}}} }}
A table using this template should use it in all rows.

This template works by placing a hidden sortkey before the visible text. The hiding of the sortkey is achieved through [[Help:Cascading style sheets#Non-display|CSS]]: &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot; class=&quot;sortkey&quot;&gt;hidden text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The CSS class allows custom sort scripts to parse and get the sort key, and remove it from the DOM if needed (for some accessibility tools).

=====Example=====
&lt;pre&gt;
|{{sort|Brothers Karamazov|[[The Brothers Karamazov]]}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Note:''' You should always have the same number of characters in the sortkeys for a given table if you intend to sort them by numeric values (some other templates are formating the numeric sort key as needed). E.g., if the wikitable will be sorting the numbers 56 (foo), 94 (bar), and 103 (baz), then your templates within that wikitable should be:

&lt;pre&gt;{{sort|056|foo}}
{{sort|094|bar}}
{{sort|103|baz}}&lt;/pre&gt;

If you simply code as the second parameter an indicator that two items are equally ranked, e.g. &quot;4=&quot;, the template interpreter will treat this as an additional parameter (i.e. parameter 4, which it will then not use). You must explicitly code this as parameter 2:

&lt;pre&gt;{{sort|4|2=4=}}&lt;/pre&gt;

This template is a combination of {{tl|frac}} and {{tl|sort}}. It allows numerical sorting of a column containing fractions. 

== Examples ==
*{{xpd|sortfrac|78|2|3}}
*{{xpd|sortfrac|2|3}}
*{{xpd|sortfrac|3}}

For examples of tables using the template see [[DHL Delivery Man Award]].

== Code ==

&lt;source lang=html5&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;template-frac&quot;&gt;
{{#if:{{{3|}}}
   |{{sort
     |{{#expr: {{{1}}}+{{{2}}}/{{{3}}} }}
     |{{{1}}}&lt;sup&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/sub&gt;}}
   |{{#if:{{{2|}}}
     |{{sort
       |{{#expr: {{{1}}}/{{{2}}} }}
       |&lt;sup&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/sub&gt;}}
     |{{sort
       |{{#expr: 1/{{{1}}} }}
       |&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/sub&gt;}}
    }}
}}
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

These are templates used for &quot;if-then-else&quot; types of queries within Wikibooks code.

'''Be careful with them!'''  They are tricky to manipulate and shouldn't be edited recklessly.
When using those templates, you could add {{tlx|esoteric}} to the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' of your template. &lt;!--This isn't necessary for the new '''#if:''' etc. [[m:Parser functions|parser functions]] or the simple [[w:Template talk:ifdef|ifdef]] + [[w:Template talk:ifndef|ifndef]].--&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

The [[m:help:expansion demo templates|expansion demo templates]] (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&amp;prefix=xpd&amp;namespace=10]) show, for documentation:
*some wikitext
*its rendering
*a link to ExpandTemplates applied to the wikitext; thus it shows:
**The expanded wikitext.
**The rendering of this expanded wikitext

{{tiw|xpd}} selects one of the following four templates based on the number of unnamed parameters
*{{tiw|xpd0}} - simplified version of {{tim|xpdoc}}
*{{tiw|xpd1}} - simplified version of {{tim|xpdopec}}
*{{tiw|xpd2}} - simplified version of {{tim|xpdopepec}}
*{{tiw|xpd3}} - simplified version of {{tim|xpdopepepec}}

==Examples==
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd|CURRENTDAY}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives:

{{xpd|CURRENTDAY}}

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd|#expr:2+2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives:

{{xpd|#expr:2+2}}

For more examples see the separate templates.

==Separator parameter==

The default separator is &quot;gives&quot;. With &lt;tt&gt;gives=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{!}}{{!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to get &quot;||&quot; for use in a table, the same separator is used before the ExpandTemplates link.

Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!wikitext!!result!!ExpandTemplates
|-
|{{xpd|CURRENTDAY|gives={{!}}{{!}}}}
|-
|{{xpd|#expr:2+2|gives={{!}}{{!}}}}
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

gives

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!wikitext!!result!!ExpandTemplates
|-
|{{xpd|CURRENTDAY|gives={{!}}{{!}}}}
|-
|{{xpd|#expr:2+2|gives={{!}}{{!}}}}
|}

==Quotes==
The quotation marks are needed to see spaces and newlines at the start and end of the result. In other expand demo templates they are also needed to see spaces and newlines at the start and end of the wikitext, and to get a result independent of whether it starts on a line due to parameter {{{gives}}}.

==Limitations==
This Template:Xpd is a simplified version of some [[m:help:expansion demo templates|expansion demo templates]]. If necessary use the proper extended version.

===Named parameters and parameter values with equals signs===
Named parameters are not supported. Neither are equals signs in parameter values of the template or parser function demonstrated. 

Examples:
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd|1x| p{{=}}q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{xpd|1x| p{{=}}q }} - wrong result due to the template call in the parameter; is corrected by substitution and putting nowiki tags in the lefthand side (see below), giving {&amp;#123;&lt;code&gt;1x&lt;b&gt;&amp;#124;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; p{{=}}q&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&amp;#125;} gives {{1x| p{{=}}q }} [{{fullurl:special:ExpandTemplates|input=%7B%7B{{urlencode:1x{{!}} p{{=}}q } }}%7D}}].
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd|1x|2= p=q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{xpd|1x|2= p=q }} - wrong result because the lefthand side would be expanded interpreting p as named parameter, while the righthand side shows the result if the unnamed parameter of 1x has the given value; use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpdopec|1x|1|3= p=q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; giving {{xpdopec|1x|1|3= p=q }} or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpdnp|1x|1n=1|1v= p=q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; giving {{xpdnp|1x|1n=1|1v= p=q }} (spaces and newlines are trimmed).
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd|t np|q=s}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives: {{xpd|t np|q=s}} (&quot;q=s&quot; is ignored); instead, use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpdopec|t np|q|s}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; giving {{xpdopec|t np|q|s}} or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpdnp|t np|1n=q|1v=s}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; giving {{xpdnp|t np|1n=q|1v=s}}.

Even in the case of a parser function called with a parameter containing an equals sign the template for named parameters should be used:
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd|#if:x|p=q}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives: {{xpd|#if:x|p=q}} (&quot;p=q&quot; is ignored); instead, use  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpdnp|#if:x|1n=p|1v=q}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; giving {{xpdnp|#if:x|1n=p|1v=q}}.

===Rendering of left side===
If no value for parameter p is given, the left-hand side, before &quot;gives&quot;, does not show the literal wikitext of the parameters of the template or parser function demonstrated, but the rendering. This affects e.g. sequences of more than two spaces, and single newlines. Also link code is shown as a link. Furthermore, any templates and parser functions in the parameters are expanded; {{tim|xpdn}} covers the simpler of such cases.

Examples:
----
&lt;pre&gt;
{{xpd|1x|[[Help:L{{tc}}k]]}}

{{xpd|t1|p
q}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
----

gives:

----
{{xpd|1x|[[Help:L{{tc}}k]]}}

{{xpd|t1|p
q}}
----

With substitution of xpd1 etc. (see below) and putting nowiki tags around the list of parameters the left hand side is corrected.

Also the input text of ExpandTemplates in the supplied link is the result of expanding the parameters.

==Spaces and newlines==
If parameters start or end with a space or newline, these are preserved. Even if the left-hand side, as mentioned, does not show the raw wikitext of the parameters but the rendering, the right-hand side gives the correct result.

==Substitution==
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:xpd|substnp=subst:|tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives the wikitext &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd0|tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:xpd|substnp=subst:|t1|p}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives the wikitext &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd1|t1|p}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:xpd|substnp=subst:|t2|p|q}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives the wikitext &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd2|t2|p|q}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:xpd|substnp=subst:|concat|p|q|r}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives the wikitext &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xpd3|concat|p|q|r}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Note that except in the case of long and complicated parameters, adding the number of parameters after &quot;xpd&quot; is easier than adding &quot;subst:&quot; and &quot;|substnp=subst:&quot;.

With substitution of xpd1 etc. and putting nowiki tags around the list of parameters the left hand side is given literally without conversions, see also above.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

With this template the [[w:Help:parser function|parser functions]] of the [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|ParserFunctions]] collection with names starting with &quot;#if&quot; can be used in a way such that they do not [[m:Help:Newlines_and_spaces#Stripping_on_expansion|strip spaces and newlines]] from the &quot;then&quot; and &quot;else&quot; part. Spaces still do not affect the outcome of the condition. Parameter 1 selects the if-type as &quot;eq&quot;, &quot;expr&quot;, &quot;exists&quot; or &quot;error&quot; (for #iferror), or empty &quot;||&quot; for a simple if-there (for #if). The template can be repeatedly nested 6 or 7 levels, one inside the other, because the outer-most is completed before running either the then/else inner levels.

This template can be substituted, when the expression or comparison will not change. Functionally, a lead-space character is stored, internally, as a simple blank character. Note, in many cases a null nowiki tag (&quot;&amp;lt;nowiki/&gt;&quot;) could be used, without [[Template:If]], to allow a lead-space (such as &quot;&amp;lt;nowiki/&gt;&amp;nbsp;xx&quot;) anywhere, but the internal storage puts a 43-character marker for &quot;&amp;lt;nowiki/&gt;&quot; in string length. However, there is no extra expansion depth for a nowiki-tag, such as in trailing space, &quot;zz&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;nowiki/&gt;&quot;.

==Usage==
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{if||x| p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot;{{if||x| p | q }}&quot;. Notice the ''pair'' of vertical bars surrounding the empty first parameter.

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{if|expr|2&lt;3| p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot; p &quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{if|eq| u |u| p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot;{{if|eq| u |u| p | q }}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{if|exist| Help:Link | p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot;{{if|exist| Help:Link | p | q }}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{if|error|{{#expr:x}}| p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot;{{if|error|{{#expr:x}}| p | q }}&quot;

Compare:
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if:x| p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot;{{#if:x| p | q }}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifexpr:2&lt;3| p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot;{{#ifexpr:2&lt;3| p | q }}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifeq: u |u| p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot;{{#ifeq: u |u| p | q }}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifexist: Help:Link | p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot;{{#ifexist: Help:Link | p | q }}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#iferror:{{#expr:x}}| p | q }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives &quot;{{#iferror:{{#expr:x}}| p | q }}&quot;
The text of either the then-clause or else-clause is only processed and expanded when triggered. Hence, any templates in use are only expanded once the then-clause or else-clause is matched, otherwise they are skipped as merely paired braces, &quot;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;&quot; with &quot;}}&quot;.

'''Indentation:''' If indenting the markup, care must be taken to avoid extra newlines when indenting &quot;}}&quot; on the next line. An extra bar pipe &quot;|&quot; can be added after the else-clause to complete that text, and allow &quot;}}&quot; to then be placed anywhere without adding a newline into the else-clause. For example:
:::* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{if|{{{1|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; |then found parameter 1|else no parameter 1| &amp;larr; ''extra'' &quot;|&quot; ''ends else-clause''&lt;br&gt;}}
When the else-clause is indented to the next line, a newline (CR/LF) is added:
:::* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{if|{{{1|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; |then found parameter 1 &amp;larr; ''extra newline here''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; |else noparameter 1|&lt;br&gt;}}
To indent the else-clause, split an [[HTML]]-form comment, as &quot;&amp;lt;!--&quot; with next line as &quot;--&amp;gt;|else...&quot;. Unless each then-clause and else-clause is carefully tested, to watch for extra newlines, then the results are likely to cause broken lines, with extra line breaks for each newline. For that reason, a global edit with simple search-and-replace of &quot;&lt;code&gt;{#if:&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to &quot;&lt;code&gt;{if||&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is likely to leave newline problems, wherever the original markup was wrapped to indent either the else-clause or &quot;}}&quot; of each if-structure. Indenting the then-clause is not a problem.

==Performance considerations==
Because [[Template:If]] must prepare the parameters for &lt;code&gt;#if, #ifeq, #ifexpr,&lt;/code&gt; (etc.) there is a slight overhead when using it. It has been timed to run at speeds of 290 instances per second, so 29 uses would take only 0.1&amp;nbsp;s, a tenth of a second to run, to make 29 comparisons. Each nested use adds 5 levels to the template expansion depth, so 7 nested if-templates would use 35 levels (5*7) of the 41-level limit.

'''Using P-if syntax:''' A similar if-structure can be coded without '''Template:If''', by using the {P1} and {P2} templates in a &quot;P-if&quot; structure. [[Template:P1]] always returns parameter 1, and P2 returns the 2nd. So, a comparison of 4 versus 3 can be coded using P-if syntax form:
:: Example of &lt;code&gt;#ifexpr&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;{{P{{#ifexpr: 4 &gt; 3|1|2}}| then 4 greater| else 4 lower}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: Result for &lt;code&gt;#ifexpr&lt;/code&gt;: &amp;nbsp; &quot;{{P{{#ifexpr: 4 &gt; 3|1|2}}| then 4 greater| else 4 lower}}&quot; &amp;larr; ''the comparison invoked'' {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{P1}}.
The expansion depth of a P-if is only 4 levels deep, but nesting of the then-clause or else-clause might be more confusing than using nested levels of Template:if.

:: Example of &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;{{P{{#if:{{{2|x}}}|1|2}}| then {2} set| else {2} empty}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: Result for &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;: &quot;{{P{{#if:{{{2|}}}|1|2}}| then {2} set| else {2} empty}}&quot; &amp;larr; ''the comparison invoked'' {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{P2}}.

*[[m:Template:If]]
*[[Template:Ifnotempty]] - for simplicity and to reduce the limitations due to the expansion depth limit, this is a separate template corresponding to #if only.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

With this template [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|#if]] can be used in a way such that it does not [[m:Help:Newlines_and_spaces#Stripping_on_expansion|strip spaces and newlines]] from the &quot;then&quot; and &quot;else&quot; part. For evaluating the condition spaces and newlines are stripped like with ParserFunctions.

This template can be substituted.

==Usage==
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ifnotempty| x | A | B }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives &quot;{{ifnotempty| x | A | B }}&quot;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ifnotempty|x| A | B }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives &quot;{{ifnotempty|x| A | B }}&quot;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ifnotempty| | A | B }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives &quot;{{ifnotempty| | A | B }}&quot;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ifnotempty|| A | B }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives &quot;{{ifnotempty|| A | B }}&quot;
Compare:
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if:x| A | B }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives &quot;{{#if:x| A | B }}&quot;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if:| A | B }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives &quot;{{#if:| A | B }}&quot;

==Internal technical details==
For evaluating the condition (determining non-emptiness of the first parameter) the template uses parser function #if, producing 1 if the condition is true, and 2 otherwise. The template with name equal to &quot;P&quot; followed by the index value produced (hence [[Template:P1]] or [[Template:P2]]), is called with as parameters A and B. This produces either A or B, without trimming.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An important idea that can be directly derived from the Ideal Gas Law is known as Charles's Law. Charles's Law describes a relationship between temperature and volume of an ideal gas when other factors are held constant. It says that temperature and volume are directly proportional to each other &lt;math&gt; P V = N k_B T &lt;/math&gt;. That means as one increases, the other also increases.

A simple experiment can be done to illustrate Charles's Law. Take a balloon, fill it with air and tie it. Next, subject the balloon to different temperatures and measure the circumference. By assuming that the balloon is spherical, we can easily calculate the volume and determine how volume is dependent on temperature.
:&lt;math&gt; V = 4 \pi r^3 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C = \pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r = \sqrt{\frac{C}{\pi}} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V = 4 \pi \Bigg(\sqrt{\frac{C}{\pi}}\Bigg)^3 &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Balloon-temperature change.png|thumb|Balloon-temperature change]]

You can see below the circumferences and subsequent volumes that we obtained and calculated of our balloon at different temperatures.

A graph illustrating how the balloons volume is directly proportional to temperature is shown below.

&lt;br&gt;
There was one more temperature that was tested, but not formally recorded. When the balloon was submersed in liquid nitrogen (a temperature of about 77 K), it seemed to have completely deflated. What really happened was that the temperature was so low that the volume decreased dramatically. When the balloon heated back up, the volume again increased back to its prior size.

== Read and discuss the story of the wise man and the foolish man in Matthew 7:24-27.==

{{Bible verse|book=Matthew|chapter=7|verse=24-27|version=NIV|text=“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”}}

== Find and read at least 3 more verses that talk about sand.==

{{Bible verse|book=Genesis|chapter=32|verse=12|version=NIV|text=&quot;But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’”}}

{{Bible verse|book=Genesis|chapter=41|verse=49|version=NIV|text=&quot;Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.”}}

{{Bible verse|book=2 Samuel|chapter=17|verse=11|version=NIV|text=“So I advise you: Let all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba—as numerous as the sand on the seashore—be gathered to you, with you yourself leading them into battle.”}}

== Role play the story about the wise man and foolish man.==

Encourage children to cooperate with each other.

== Sing a Bible song about sand.==

&lt;big&gt;'''The Wise Man Built His House'''&lt;/big&gt;


The wise man built his house upon the rock

The wise man built his house upon the rock

The wise man built his house upon the rock

And the rain came tumbling down


Oh, the rain came down

And the floods came up

The rain came down

And the floods came up

The rain came down

And the floods came up

And the wise man's house stood firm.


The foolish man built his house upon the sand

The foolish man built his house upon the sand

The foolish man built his house upon the sand

And the rain came tumbling down


Oh, the rain came down

And the floods came up

The rain came down

And the floods came up

The rain came down

And the floods came up

And the foolish man's house went &quot;splat!&quot; [clap hands once]


So, build your house on the Lord Jesus Christ

Build your house on the Lord Jesus Christ

Build your house on the Lord Jesus Christ

And the blessings will come down


Oh, the blessings come down

As your prayers go up

The blessings come down

As your prayers go up

The blessings come down

As your prayer go up

So build your house on the Lord Jesus Christ.

== Name at least 5 everyday uses for sand.==

Sand blasting, sand castles, making glass, hour glass, egg timers, gravel on roads, sandbox, concrete, mortar, sand paper, etc.

== Make your own colored sand.==

'''What You Need:'''
* Food coloring (we had a box of neon colors, too)
* Baking pans
* Oven set to 200 degrees
* Water
* Spoon or stirring stick
* a Sifter of  some sort(ours was some leftover tulle rubber band to a container)

'''Directions:'''

Step 1: Sift Sand to get out any big rocks or unwanted debris. We made our own sifter by fastening some tulle over the top of a container with a rubber band and then slowly pouring sand on top while lightly shaking/bouncing the “sifter”. The kids enjoyed this part!

Step 2: Separate sand into baking dishes. Add a little water. Aim for a damp consistency but not soaking wet where extra water is visible. If you happen to add too much water, no worries. It will just take you a little longer in the drying process.

Step 3: Add food coloring to get desired color and mix the sand up well to distribute the color.

Step 4: Place pans in oven (set to 200 degrees) for 5 – 10 minutes. Pull the sand out when it is barely wet and let it air dry over night. If the sand is completely dried in the oven, the color tends to fade and is not as vibrant when pulled out barely wet. Once the sand is cool, I place it in a storage bag and leave it open on the back of the counter until it is dry (usually a few hours). If you happen to dry it too much or do not get the color you want, you can always add more water and color and do it again! You cannot mess this up!

== Create at least 2 sand art projects.==

&lt;big&gt;'''Sand art bottles'''&lt;/big&gt;

Items You Will Need

:Transparent bottle
:Cap or cork
:Heavy paper or funnel
:Stapler or tape (optional)
:Colored sand
:Teaspoon
:Hot glue gun


Step 1 Remove any labels from your bottle and wash it with soapy water. Rinse the bottle and allow it to dry completely.

Step 2 Create a funnel by rolling a sheet of heavy paper into a cone shape,holding it in place with a few staples or tape. Make sure the pointed end of your funnel fits into the neck of the bottle and that the opening at the bottom is no wider than 1/8 inch.

Step 3 Hold the paper funnel inside the neck of the bottle with one hand, and use a teaspoon to add the first color of sand a little at a time. Gently jiggle the funnel if the sand gets clogged in it. Start with less sand and add more a teaspoon at a time, if you wish.

Step 4 Examine the first layer and decide whether you want the colored-sand stripes to be flat and horizontal or diagonal. If you want diagonal strips, hold the bottle at an angle and tap it so that all the sand rests in one corner. Hold the bottle at this angle and add the second layer of sand, directing the point of the funnel into the empty corner.

Step 5 Continue adding layers of sand in different colors, taking care not to move the bottle around too much or too quickly, as this will cause the colors to mix together and destroy the layered look. Use the point of the funnel to direct each layer of sand into position. Stop when the bottle is full of layers of colored sand.

Step 6 Apply hot glue to the inside of the bottle neck and insert a cork, or apply glue around the outside of the neck and screw on its cap. Do not shake the bottle or the layers will be destroyed, and you will have a bottle of mixed multicolored sand.


&lt;big&gt;'''Picture frames'''&lt;/big&gt;

Here's what you need:

:sandpaper (we used both 60 grit and 100 grit with slightly different results, both cool.  The coarser grit just had more defined grains of sand on the finished piece)
:crayons
:paper ( I used white paper hoping to get that pointillism copy, but newspaper would probably work fine too if you just want your sandpaper piece)
:iron and press cloth (old rag or thin cloth to use when ironing)

Here's what to do:

* Cut your sandpaper to the size you want your finished piece to be.  We planned on making popsicle stick frames for our artwork, so our pieces were about 5.5&quot; squares.
* Using crayons, color your picture on the sandpaper.  You'll want to press pretty hard to get a nice layer of color.  You'll also want to have your picture cover the entire piece of sandpaper, so make sure you color the background too.
* Next, put your sandpaper with the picture face up, put your paper on top of the picture and your press cloth on top of that.  Using a warm iron, iron over the picture for about 15 seconds.  (If you lift up your cloth and see the melted wax on the paper, it's ready.)
* Carefully lift up the paper to reveal your picture.   You can see how ours did make a copy, but it just wasn't quite what we were hoping for and was a little blotchy in spots.
* However, if you look at your sandpaper, you'll see that the crayon wax has melted onto the grains of sand in the sandpaper, making it look like you glued on lots of different colors of sand.  The picture doesn't quite pick it up, but some of the crayons were sparkly, so it had the effect of glitter in the finished piece.
* Of course, every piece of art looks better in a popsicle stick frame, so we painted some popsicle sticks to match our new masterpieces.
* Glue your Sandpaper Art into your new frame ( I used hot glue because it worked better than the Elmers on the sandpaper) and your project is complete.

# Pre-glued pictures
# Make a sand castle
# Clothespin butterfly

== Game: Carry the rock relay ==

'''Game Requires:''' 

* 2 rocks that can be carried easily by hand 
* 2 team members at turn around point 
 
'''Instructions:''' 

Divide the children into 2 equal teams. Form two lines. The child runs to the team member at the turn around point and back carrying the rock. Then he hands his rock to the next child who runs with it. The team that finishes first will sit down and wait for the other team.

==Need help?==
Hi. I noticed that you did a lot of work here on your Talk page. I'm not sure how much experience you have editing wikis, but on this project, your &quot;User talk&quot; page is where people (like me) leave messages for you. Conversely, you can leave me a message on my [[User talk:Willscrlt|talk page]]. Don't worry. I didn't delete anything. I just moved all of the stuff that was here over to your [[User:Plantphys|User page]]. That's where people usually do the kind of editing you did.

I also flagged a template that you had created, {{tl|Template:BookCat:Feedstock}}, for deletion. It did not seem to do anything useful, and it probably was just a test or experiment that you were playing around with.

Please let me know if you need any help getting used to Wikibooks. I have included several helpful links in the Welcome message above. Have a great day! &lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 10:11, 9 September 2013 (UTC)</text>

'''{&amp;#123;{{FULLPAGENAME}}&amp;#125;}''' is version 3.1 of [[{{ns:User}}:Willscrlt|Will's]] user signature template, which works across all Wikimedia Foundation wikis.

This template is dynamic and adapts itself to various conditions. On the [[{{#ifeq: {{SERVERNAME}} |en.wikipedia.org|| w:en: }}User:Willscrlt|English Wikipedia]] (my home wiki), only the local talk page link is displayed. On [[m:User:Willscrlt|Meta]] and [[{{#ifeq: {{SERVERNAME}} |commons.wikimedia.org|| commons: }}User:Willscrlt|Commons]], the local talk page and the en.wiki and en.books talk pages are displayed along with either the Commons or Meta talk page (the non-local one). On all other wikis, the local talk page link is moved to the last half of my name (&quot;scrlt&quot;), and explicit links to en.wiki, en.books, Meta, and Commons are displayed (since I check for messages more frequently there). On non-English sites, the entire signature is wrapped in an English-language &amp;lt;span&gt; wrapper. On Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and other right-to-left script sites, the direction of my signature is set to left-to-right to avoid problems with punctuation and order. (If someone wants to help me actually translate the entire thing into a local language version, I'd be open to the suggestion!).

This template probably should ''always'' be [[w:en:WP:SUBST|substituted]] rather than transcluded (except in demonstrations). I have tried to keep the total size of my signature as small as possible while still accomplishing my goal of giving people an easy way to contact me. My default signature automatically substitutes the template by signing my messages like this:
&lt;code style=&quot;clear:left; display:block; padding-left:18pt;&quot;&gt;{&amp;#123;subst:{{ns:User}}:Willscrlt/meta/Sign&amp;#125;}&lt;/code&gt;

If you find my signature or this template to be annoying or against some policy on a particular wiki, please leave me feedback on either the [[{{#ifeq: {{SERVERNAME}} |en.wikipedia.org|| w:en: }}User talk:Willscrlt|English Wikipedia]] or the [[m:User talk|Meta Wikipedia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Serbian language can be hard to master for foreigners, because words tend to have different forms in different contexts, then some words can sound similar to other non related words. Serbian has, like most Slavic languages, noun cases, and verbs tend to inflect quite liberally.
Good news is that Serbian uses both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, exception among European languages. Variation of Latin alphabet that Serbian uses is shared with two other languages, Croatian and Bosniak.

''*Diacritics here are used only for easier pronunciation, they are normally not used when writing Serbian''
== Nominative case of nouns ==
Serbian language has three grammatical genders (Masculine, Feminine and Neuter) and two grammatical numbers (Singular and Plural), in the past there was a third number, ''Dvojina'' used only for exactly two objects, but it is not used in modern Serbian.
==== Jednina/Singular ====
Masculine nouns in nominative usually do not have fixed ending. Student, Profesor, Radnik are all masculine nouns.

Feminine nouns have several endings -ica (Radnica), -ka (Profesorka), -kinja (Studentkinja), -a (Plaža)....

Neuter nouns usually end with -o (Vino) or -e (Dete).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Muški rod (Masculine)
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Ženski rod (Feminine)
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Srednji rod (Neuter)
|- 
| Student || Student + kinja = Studenkinja || Víno
|-
| Radnik || Radnik + ica = Radnica* || Dete
|}
''* '''K''' in '''Radnik''' is lost in feminine form '''Radnica'''''
==== Množina/Plural ====
When masculine nouns are in plural usually have suffix -i (Profesori) or -ovi (Gradovi)

Feminine nouns in plural loose -a and add -e onto ending

Neuter nouns when in plural replace -o and -e with -a onto end.
Some nouns insert -en between word itself and ending (Ramena). Some nouns also have irregular plural, in that case -a suffix isn't applied (Uho (ear)-Uši; Oko (eye)-Oči)</text>

== What does Tabernacle mean?==

According to the Hebrew Bible, a Tabernacle was the portable dwelling place for the divine presence from the time of the Exodus from Egypt through the conquering of the land of Canaan. Built to specifications revealed by God to Moses at Mount Sinai, it accompanied the Israelites on their wanderings in the wilderness and their conquest of the Promised Land. The First Temple in Jerusalem superseded it as the dwelling-place of God.

==List the three main areas of the Tabernacle.==

* The Outer Court
* The Holy Place
* The Most Holy Place

== Find and read John 14:6, John 10:9 and Matthew 7:13-14. Using the Bible verses that you read, discuss what a gate symbolizes? ==

The gate is a representation of Christ.

== Discuss and identify the Tabernacle and all of its parts. ==

a. Brazen Alter - The brazen altar, bronze altar, or altar of sacrifice was situated right inside the courtyard upon entering the gate to the tabernacle. The Hebrew root for altar means “to slay” or “slaughter.” The Latin word alta means “high.” An altar is a “high place for sacrifice/slaughter.” The altar stood raised on a mound of earth, higher than its surrounding furniture. This is a projection of Christ, our sacrifice, lifted up on the cross, His altar, which stood on a hill called Golgotha. The altar was made of wood from the acacia tree and overlaid with bronze, measuring 7.5 feet on all four sides and 4.5 feet deep. Four horns projected from the top four corners and a bronze grating was inside to hold the animal. The altar was the place for burning animal sacrifices. It showed the Israelites that the first step for sinful man to approach a holy God was to be cleansed by the blood of an innocent creature. For a sin offering, a person had to bring an animal — a male one without blemish or defect from the flock or herd — to the priest at the tabernacle gate.

b. Tabernacle Sacrifices - Although the blood of the sacrifices covered over the sins of the Israelites, they had to perform the sacrifices year after year, for they were not freed permanently of a guilty conscience. However, Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, came as the ultimate and last sacrifice for mankind when He offered up His life. As Isaiah prophesied, the Christ would be like a lamb that is led to slaughter and pierced for our transgressions. His blood was sprinkled and poured out at the cross for us. 

c. Laver (Basin)- The laver, or basin, was a large bowl filled with water located halfway between the brazen altar and the Holy Place. Although God did not give specific measurements for the Laver, it was to be made entirely of bronze. The priests were to wash their hands and their feet in it before entering the Holy Place. 
The laver was located in a convenient place for washing and stood as a reminder that people need cleansing before approaching God. The priests atoned for their sins through a sacrifice at the brazen altar, but they cleansed themselves at the laver before serving in the Holy Place, so that they would be pure and not die before a holy God. The application for believers today is that we are forgiven through Christ’s work on the cross, but we are washed through His Word. We need to be washed daily in His Word to cleanse ourselves, so that we can serve and minister before Him.

d. Menorah (Lamp stand)- After washing their hands and feet at the laver, the priests could enter the Holy Place, which was the first room in the tent of the tabernacle. There were three pieces of furniture in the Holy Place: the menorah, the table of show-bread and the golden altar of incense. The menorah, also called the “golden lampstand” or “candlestick,” stood at the left side of the Holy Place. It was hammered out of one piece of pure gold. Like for the laver, there were no specific instructions about the size of the menorah, but the fact that it was fashioned out of one piece of pure gold would have limited its size. The lampstand had a central branch from which three branches extended from each side, forming a total of seven branches. Seven lamps holding olive oil and wicks stood on top of the branches. Each branch looked like that of an almond tree, containing buds, blossoms and flowers. The priests were instructed to keep the lamps burning continuously. Jesus is represented by the main branch of the lampstand, and we as believers are represented by the six branches that extend from original branch. 

e. Table of Showbread - The table of showbread was a small table made of acacia wood and overlaid with pure gold. It measured 3 feet by 1.5 feet and was 2 feet, 3 inches high. It stood on the right side of the Holy Place across from the lampstand and held 12 loaves of bread, representing the 12 tribes of Israel. The priests baked the bread with fine flour and it remained on the table before the Lord for a week; every Sabbath day the priests would remove it and eat it in the Holy Place, then put fresh bread on the table. Only priests could eat the bread, and it could only be eaten in the Holy Place, because it was holy. “Showbread” also was called “bread of the presence” because it was to be always in the Lord’s presence. The table and the bread were a picture of God’s willingness to fellowship and communion (literally speaking, sharing something in common) with man. It was like an invitation to share a meal, an extension of friendship. Eating together often is an act of fellowship. God was willing for man to enter into His presence to fellowship with Him, and this invitation was always open. Jesus exemplified this when He ate with tax collectors, prostitutes and the sinners of Jewish society. But this was more than just a gesture of friendship on earth. Jesus came to call sinners to Him, make them right with God, so that they could enjoy everlasting fellowship with God.

f. Golden Altar of Incense - The golden altar of incense, which is not to be confused with the brazen altar, sat in front of the curtain that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. This altar was smaller than the brazen altar. It was a square with each side measuring 1.5 feet and was 3 feet high. It was made of acacia wood and overlaid with pure gold. Four horns protruded from the four corners of the altar. God commanded the priests to burn incense on the golden altar every morning and evening, the same time that the daily burnt offerings were made. The incense was to be left burning continually throughout the day and night as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. It was made of an equal part of four precious spices and was considered holy. God commanded the Israelites not to use the same formula outside the tabernacle to make perfume for their own consumption; otherwise, they were to be cut off from their people (Exodus 30:34-38). The incense was a symbol of the prayers and intercession of the people going up to God as a sweet fragrance. God wanted His dwelling to be a place where people could approach Him and pray to Him.

g. Holy of Holies &amp; the Veil - Within the Holy Place of the tabernacle, there was an inner room called the Holy of Holies, or the Most Holy Place. Judging from its name, we can see that it was a most sacred room, a place no ordinary person could enter. It was God’s special dwelling place in the midst of His people. During the Israelites’ wanderings in the wilderness, God appeared as a pillar of cloud or fire in and above the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies was a perfect cube — its length, width and height were all equal to 15 feet. A thick curtain separated the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place. This curtain, known as the “veil,” was made of fine linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn. There were figures of cherubim (angels) embroidered onto it. Cherubim, spirits who serve God, were in the presence of God to demonstrate His almighty power and majesty. They also guarded the throne of God. These cherubim were also on the innermost layer of covering of the tent. If one looked upward, they would see the cherubim figures. The word “veil” in Hebrew means a screen, divider or separator that hides. What was this curtain hiding? Essentially, it was shielding a holy God from sinful man. Whoever entered into the Holy of Holies was entering the very presence of God. In fact, anyone except the high priest who entered the Holy of Holies would die. Even the high priest, God’s chosen mediator with His people, could only pass through the veil and enter this sacred dwelling once a year, on a prescribed day called the Day of Atonement. The picture of the veil was that of a barrier between man and God, showing man that the holiness of God could not be trifled with. God’s eyes are too pure to look on evil and He can tolerate no sin (Habakkuk 1:13). The veil was a barrier to make sure that man could not carelessly and irreverently enter into God’s awesome presence. Even as the high priest entered the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement, he had to make some meticulous preparations: He had to wash himself, put on special clothing, bring burning incense to let the smoke cover his eyes from a direct view of God, and bring blood with him to make atonement for sins.

Ark of the Covenant &amp; the Articles - Within the Holy of Holies, shielded from the eye of the common man, was one piece of furniture comprising two parts: the Ark of the Covenant and the atonement cover (or “mercy seat”) on top of it. The ark was a chest made of acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold inside and out. It was 3 feet, 9 inches long and 2 feet, 3 inches wide and high. God commanded Moses to put in the ark three items: a golden pot of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written. We will discuss these three objects in further detail below. The atonement cover was the lid for the ark. On top of it stood two cherubim (angels) at the two ends, facing each other. The cherubim, symbols of God’s divine presence and power, were facing downward toward the ark with outstretched wings that covered the atonement cover. The whole structure was beaten out of one piece of pure gold. The atonement cover was God’s dwelling place in the tabernacle. It was His throne, flanked by angels.

== Sing a Sanctuary song.==

== Play one of the following games:==

a. Tabernacle memory.

b. Fruit basket upset using Tabernacle part names.

c. Make cards of the furniture; mix the cards up and as they draw a card, put it in the right place on the diagram.

d. Each Adventurer draws out of a hat a card with the name of a furniture/part of the tabernacle on it, and then stands in the correct place in the room.

e. Other game.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is used to show that templates have been converted to [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]. It can be placed on the template's /doc page or on its talk page. It automatically adds the template to [[:Category:Lua-based templates]].

== Usage ==

; Basic usage
{{tlx|lua|''module name''}}

; All parameters
{{tlx|lua|''module name''|''note''|4=category=''custom category''|5=nocat=''true''}}

== Examples ==

* {{tlx|lua}}
{{lua|nocat=true}}

* {{tlx|lua|Module:Collapsible list}}
{{lua|Module:Collapsible list|nocat=true}}

* {{tlx|lua|Module:Collapsible list|You can use this script as an example to help you get started.}}
{{lua|Module:Collapsible list|You can use this script as an example to help you get started.|nocat=true}}

== Categorization ==
This template adds pages to [[:Category:Lua-based templates]] if the page is in the template namespace, and it is not on any of the subpages /doc, /sandbox, /sandbox2 or /testcases. You can specify a different category with the {{para|category}} parameter, e.g. {{para|category|Lua String-based templates}}. To suppress categorisation, use {{para|nocat|true}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The HTML mark up produced by this template includes an [[w:HCard|hCard microformat]], which makes the place-name and location [[w:Parsing|parsable]] by computers, either acting automatically to catalogue article across Wikibooks, or via a browser tool operated by a person, to (for example) add the subject to an address book. Within the hCard is a [[w:Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]], which additionally makes the [[w:Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] (latitude &amp; longitude) parsable, so that they can be, say, looked up on a map, or downloaded to a [[w:Global Positioning System|GPS]] unit. For more information about the use of [[w:Mmicroformat|Microformats]] on Wikipedia and Wikibooks, please see [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Microformats|the microformat project]].

=== Sub-templates ===

If the place or venue has an &quot;established&quot;, &quot;founded&quot;, &quot;opened&quot; or similar date, use {{tl|Start date}} ([[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Microformats/dates|unless the date is before 1583 CE]]).

If it has a URL, use {{Tl|URL}}.

'''Please do not remove instances of these sub-templates.'''

=== Classes ===

hCard uses HTML classes including:
{{Flatlist/microformat|
*adr
*agent
*category
*county-name
*extended-address
*fn
*label
*locality
*nickname
*note
*org
*region
*street-address
*uid
*url
*vcard
}}

Geo is produced by calling {{tl|coord}}, and uses HTML classes:

{{Flatlist/microformat|
*geo
*latitude
*longitude
}}

'''Please do not rename or remove these classes; nor collapse nested elements which use them.'''

=== Precision ===

When giving coordinates, '''please use an [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Geographical coordinates#Precision|appropriate level of precision]]'''. Do '''not''' use {{TL|Coord}}'s {{Para|name}} parameter.{{#ifeq:{{SUBPAGENAME}}|doc||
[[Category:Templates with coordinates fields|{{PAGENAME}}]]

&lt;!---PLEASE ADD METADATA (categories, interwikis) TO THE &lt;includeonly&gt; SECTION AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE---&gt;

This template should be used to produce an [[w:WP:Infobox|Infobox]] for human settlements (cities, towns, villages, communities) as well as other administrative districts, counties, provinces, etcetera - in fact, any subdivision below the level of a country, for which {{tl|Infobox country}} should be used.  Parameters are described in the table below. For questions see the [[w:Template talk:Infobox settlement|talk page]].

== Usage ==
*'''Important''': Please enter all numeric values in a raw, unformatted fashion.  References are to be included in their respective section footnotes field.  Numeric values that are not &quot;raw&quot; may create an &quot;Expression error&quot;. Raw values will be automatically formatted by the template.  If you find a raw value is not formatted in your usage of the template, please post a notice on the discussion page for this template.
* An expression error may also occur when any coordinate parameter has a value, but one or more coordinate parameters are blank or invalid.

Basic blank template, ready to cut and paste. See the next section for a copy of the template with all parameters and comments.  See the table below that for a full description of each parameter.

{{tl|iszero}} returns the passed value if it evaluates as non-zero. If it is zero, by default the template returns nothing, or it can return any other value you specify. Blank inputs are treated as zeros by default, but that can be overridden.

{{tip|Non-numeric text generally will evaluate as non-zero, so you may want to pass the input value through {{tl|isnumeric}} first (see examples 12 and 14) and treat non-numeric text as a blank.}}

== Usage ==
Recognizes the following parameters
# The value to check; required
# &lt;code&gt;blank=&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; To have blank values ''not'' be treated as zero, set this to any non-zero value you want returned; optional
# &lt;code&gt;whenzero=&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Set to the value you want returned if the input value evaluates to zero; optional (defaults to blank)
# &lt;code&gt;whenblank=&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Set to the value you want returned if the input value is blank; optional (defaults to blank)

== Examples ==
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero}}
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero|0}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero|0}}
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero|3}}
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero|0|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero|0|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero||whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero||whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero||whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero|blank=1|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero||blank=1|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero||blank=1|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero||blank=1|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero|0|blank=1|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero|0|blank=1|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{iszero|3|blank=1|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{iszero|3|blank=1|whenzero=Zero|whenblank=Blank}}

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; How to bypass the communication diaphragms? &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

The problem of finding an alternative way of speaking of international cooperation work was is not what we should say (we just needed to say the truth); not even how to say it (there is only one way to say the truth, to say it out!).   The problem was how to bypass the communication filter that want to tell the public only what they think it should be told to the public.   Who would take the risk of going outside the usually accepted communication stereotypes?  Who would take the risk of offending the sense of pride built over deeply entrenched prejudices? 

Politicians are too weak and too dependent to media in their effort to raise consensus to get involved in any sort of public education effort.  They need to avail of the few windows that media offers them to quickly raise emotions in their favor in predetermined target groups; and they will do it by appealing to the stereotyped prejudices of that target group; surely they cannot be taken on board of any effort aimed at changing that!.

Commercial media? In fact they are dependent to advertisement.   So any kind of commercial programme is as good as it is able to collect audience in front of the screen ….  Then the real message is given by the real sponsor: the advertiser.  You get your project in the palimpsest only as far as they think advertisers will like it.  And the advertisers are those who live and grow in nourishing stereotypes.   Would they shift their approach from seduction to education?   Why should they do that?   
And who would like to advertise for goods and services  in the midst of documentary that talks about the [poverty generated by unfair consumption patterns? 

I think that if we want to say the truth we have to bypass the filters of the media gate keepers. 
We need to find a new way of communicating. We have to propose a different kind of communication. Not a communication that transmits  prefabricated notions, but one where  communication counterparts participate and contribute to its creation. A communication breaks the solitude and isolation of people, enables &quot;participation&quot; and builds a sense of &quot;community&quot;. May be that communion is short and does not have tangible consequences on the persons lives: it may be just a flash. But still would be a flash of understanding, that leaves the persons a bit more joyful. May be the communication partners will never meet again; but still they are left with their humanity a bit (or a lot) enriched.

This is not the kind of experience that we normally have reading posters or listening to airport loudspeakers!  Nor when reading most newspapers and TV programmes (which generally are more elaborated versions of the same kind of top-down relationship from the &quot;communicator&quot; to the &quot;public&quot;). It is the  kind of experience that we sometimes have reading a poem, accepting hospitality when you travel, joining a prayer, etc. It is an experience of communion. That is the kind of experience I would like to live in the platform we are creating now.

Now the objection is: if we create this knowledge sharing platform on the web, how can we earn from it? How can we get back the money we are spending? How can we sustain ourselves?  We need to think at a distribution system which will raise some economic resources. What will it be?

Well . true. But let’s think later how will sell the fish. Now we still have to catch it. Let's first concentrate on the production. Then, if we have done a good product, we will think at how to sell it. To produce what we have in mind will be easy. And will not be cheap.  We will think later how to sell. Now let's catch the stories, and our story, in the video camera. We need to concentrate all our energy in that. Then ... we will see.

looks like a blatant advertisement.  Is this intended by the people behind this Wikibook?
This revision was made Revision as of 00:18, 30 July 2013, nearly six weeks ago, so I decided to seek a second opinion rather than just removing as advertisements(/vandalism).

      <text xml:space="preserve">We all are very familiar with the name of our planet &quot;The Earth&quot; where we all live but this is not the enough information about it. We must know everything about the earth. No doubt life exists on the earth but there are many harmful and useful aspects on you can say there are many friends and foes of this Earth.As the title of this book shows that either Ozone is protective or destructive layer so I have tried my best to give all the information through this book. Ozone is the region of the upper atmosphere, between about 15 and 30 kilometers (10 and 20 miles) in attitude, containing a relatively high concentration of ozone that absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation in a wavelength range on screened by other atmosphere components. Also called ozonosphere. Ozone layer is also called the &quot;Earth's sunscreen&quot;. Region in the upper atmosphere, about 6-30 mi (10-50 km) high, with significant concentrations of ozone formed by the effect of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation on oxygen and also present in trace quantities elsewhere in earth's atmosphere. Ozone strongly absorbs solar UV radiation, causing atmosphere temperature to climb to about 30oF (0oC) at the top of the layer and preventing much of this radiation from reaching earth's surface, where it would injure many living things. Chlorofluorocarbons, Or CFCs and some other air pollutants that diffuse into the ozone layer destroy ozone. In the mid-1980s, scientists discovered that a &quot;hole&quot; an area where the ozone is up to 50% thinner than normal develops periodically in the ozone layer above Antarctica. This severe regional depletion, explained as a natural seasonal depletion, appears to have been exacerbated by the effects of CFCs and may have led to an increase in skin cancer caused by UV exposure. Restrictions on the manufacture and use of CFSs and other Ozone-destroying pollutants were imposed in 1978. Ozone layer or ozonosphere, region of the stratosphere containing relatively high concentrations of Ozone, located at attitudes of 12-30 mi (19-48 km) above the earth's surface. Ozone in the Ozone layer is formed by the action of solar ultraviolet light on oxygen. This book is a comprehensive treatment of all these matters relating to the &quot;Ozone&quot; and is suitable for undergraduate as well as postgraduate students of environmental botany, ecology, environmental sciences, life sciences, agriculture, forestry, zoology and botany. Chapter of &quot;Ozone Hole&quot; is also described in this book. Ozone depletion, Ozone layer and Ozone creation is described in detail. Effects of Ozone on plants are described fully. All information about repairing the ozone hole is described in this book. The book will be helpful for the undergraduates and postgraduates of Botany, Environmental Botany, Environmental Sciences, Life Sciences, Ecology and for those working in related fields.</text>

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meter appeared in the early 1960s when the country was a British protectorate.
* Meter stamps issued during the protectorate period are inscribed “SWAZILAND”. In 1968 the country achieved independence, and meter inscriptions were changed to “KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND”.

* The stamps are grouped according to period of issue and inscription:
:: A - Issued under period of British protectorate, inscribed “SWAZILAND”
:: B - Issued since independence, inscribed “KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND”

'''NOTE''': Both the B11 and B12 stamp dies appear to have been mounted incorrectly in their respective machines so that the country name appears at the sides rather than at the bottom where it was most likely intended to be. Stamps from Francotyp-Postalia &quot;EFS3000&quot; machines probably exist with country inscription at bottom, but they have not been seen by or reported to us.

It appears at first glance that this Wikibook is dedicated only to the original Tomato/TomatoUSB project, but it became defunct years ago and thriving community versions took over. It'd be helpful for potential editors if someone experienced with this project would add info to the main page indicating whether info/pages on established current versions would be appreciated or removed.

In November of 2010, the local [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_planning_organization Metropolitan Planning Organization] (MPO), the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Council Metropolitan Council] adopted the long range 2030 Transportation Policy Plan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/Transportation/Planning/2030-Transportation-Policy-Plan.aspx | publisher=Metropolitan Council| accessdate=2013-09-14| year=2013| title=2030 Transportation Policy Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Ramsey County Minnesota Incorporated and Unincorporated areas St. Paul Highlighted.svg|thumbnail|right|Location of St. Paul within Ramsey County and the State of Minnesota.]]

There are many agencies partnering with the Met Council to reach the goals outlined by the TPP. These agencies work across city and county lines, as well as within jurisdictions. These agencies are currently working on several projects that include different modes of transportation, in various locations, with varying levels of funding. The two strategies under discussion in the city of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul,_Minnesota St. Paul]  that this report will focus on are are two technologies that are often designed to serve the same market niche: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit Arterial Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetcar streetcar]. St. Paul is the second most populous city in Minnesota and shares common transportation challenges with the rest of the metro area. The population in  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_County,_Minnesota Ramsey County] is projected to grow &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.demography.state.mn.us/PopulationPyramids2015-2040/Projecxtions2012Paper.pdf | publisher=Minnesota State Demographic Center| accessdate=2013-09-18| year=2013| title= Minnesota Population Projections}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as the transit dependent populations of youth and seniors. As total population grows in and around St. Paul, traffic congestion on already poorly functioning corridors is likely to worsen. 

Transit investment also has the power to spur economic development &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/Transportation/Projects/Current-Projects/Central-Corridor/News-Display-Page/More-than-$1-2-billion-in-development-occurring-al.aspx | publisher=Metropolitan Council | accessdate=2013-09-18| year=2013| title=MORE THAN $1.2 BILLION IN DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING ALONG CENTRAL CORRIDOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in St. Paul, this is evidenced by the soon-to-open [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Corridor_(Minnesota) Central Corridor Light Rail]. The city of St. Paul hopes additional sound investments in transit will offer these same benefits.

This report provides a brief history of transit in St. Paul as well as an overview of current projects investigating aBRT and streetcar in St. Paul. Following this, a comparison of the two modes will be made to provide the reader with the advantages and disadvantages of each. Finally, a brief discussion of the potential West 7th Street corridor aBRT or streetcar implementation will be mentioned.

= Annotated List of Actors =

'''City of St Paul'''

Possible transitways are to be implemented within the city boundaries, where businesses and residents will be affected. Because city taxes are collected from these property owners, the city has an obligation to do what is in the public interest. In addition, increased property values from transitway implementation likely mean higher tax revenue for the city. The planning department must juggle the interests of property owners, renters, and businesses to ensure the best possible outcome. 

'''Metropolitan Council (Metro Transit)'''

The Metropolitan Council is responsible for transit planning and operation in the St. Paul and greater Twin Cities area. Adoption of major transitways into the long range transportation plan must first be approved by the Metropolitan Council.

'''MnDOT'''

The Minnesota Department of Transportation maintains many of the large arterial roads that are under investigation for development of aBRT or streetcar. For example, Snelling Avenue is also known as Minnesota State Highway 51, and West Seventh Street is also known as MInnesota Highway 5. Implementation on these corridors will take coordination with the state. 

'''Ramsey County'''

Ramsey County owns and maintains several large roads in St. Paul. For example, Selby Avenue (under investigation for streetcar use) is a county road. Coordination with county public works and the regional railroad authority must take place as the project progresses. 

'''Affected business owners'''

The construction and operation of a major transitway can have profound affects on businesses along and nearby the route. Because of construction, businesses along lines may lose revenue due to interruptions of normal traffic flow that small businesses may come to depend on. Similarly, If the business depends on foot traffic, the invasiveness and duration of construction could limit access.  Following construction, unless the street is widened to accommodate equal amounts of parking that was present pre-project, businesses could lose valuable storefront parking spaces. 

Conversely, some businesses, if they are able to keep their heads above water throughout construction, may see increased revenues as more people are exposed to the area through transit use. 

'''Affected Residents'''

Potential affects on residents include noise and air pollution from construction, as well as increased street level foot traffic in and around their neighborhood. In addition, the implementation of a transitway has been known to increase property values, forcing residents who are unable to afford these increases out of their neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6229.2007.00186.x/abstract;jsessionid=6E6181464F7CF3BB8658795FFB9DD4C3.d03t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+for+approximately+4+hours+between+09%3A00+EDT+and+14%3A00+EDT+on+Saturday%2C+28+September+2013+as+we+make+upgrades+to+improve+our+services+to+you.+There+will+also+be+some+delays+to+online+publishing+between+25+to+28+September+2013.+We+apologize+for+the+inconvenience+and+appreciate+your+patience.+Thank+you+for+using+Wiley+Online+Library%21&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= | publisher= Real Estate Economics| accessdate=2013-09-19| year=2013| title=2030 Gentrification Trends in New Transit-Oriented Communities: Evidence from 14 Cities That Expanded and Built Rail Transit Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in foot traffic also might lead to a more vibrant, welcoming neighborhood. 

'''Car drivers'''

Car drivers who frequently use a potential transit corridor will likely have to deal with detours and congestion during construction, as well as fewer lanes in which to travel once operation begins. 

'''Transit users'''

What will be the time savings from these potential transitway implementations? Higher quality transit might also mean fare increases for minimal time savings, depending on the length of trip users are accustomed to taking. Transit network connectivity is an important feature of quality service, and should be optimized to increase convenience for riders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0308106022000019017#.UjynmOCCIf8 | publisher=Transportation Planning and Technology | accessdate=2013-09-18| year=2013| title=Intermodal Transit System Coordination}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Funding sources''' 

Transit projects often come with a large price tag, as will be discussed below. All levels of governments often contribute to some extent. Past transit projects in the Twin Cities have received funding from several different sources. Depeding on the cost of the project, federal and state funding may be available. At the regional level, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_Transit_Improvement_Board Counties Transit Improvement Board], formed in 2008 contributes funding to major transit infrastructure projects in the Twin Cities.  Finally, Ramsey County and the City of St. Paul will be responsible for a contribution.

== Transit History in St. Paul ==

Mass transit in St. Paul began decades before the first electrified streetcar went on line. Horse-drawn carriages were able to haul several people through the St. Paul streets comfortably, but this technology also relied on the health of horses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.trolleyride.org/History/Narrative/TC_Transit.html | publisher=Minnesota Streetcar Museum| accessdate=2013-09-16| year=2013| title=A Brief History of Twin Cities Transit}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and required several animals to service just one line throughout the day. St. Paul then borrowed the idea for  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_cable_car_system cable cars] from San Francisco, however, this technology soon fell to the early streetcar models, which were comparatively cheaper to build and maintain. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lowry Thomas Lowry], an Illinoisan-born lawyer who arrived in Minnesota in the 1860s only to change professions to real-estate, was an early influence on streetcars in St. Paul and Minneapolis. After merging the Minneapolis Street Railway and the St. Paul Railway Company to become  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_City_Rapid_Transit Twin City Rapid Transit Company] in 1875, Lowry pushed for a greater network of transit, and for this network to be driven by electricity. 

[[File:1897 Poor's Twin City Rapid Transit Company.jpg|thumbnail|right|A map of the streetcar system in the Twin Cities in 1897.]]

In the first three decades of the 20th century, electric streetcars were the most popular form of motorized transportation in St. Paul. At the height of streetcar use, the company operated 900 self-built streetcars on 523 miles of track in and around the Twin Cities.  However, with the refinement of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine internal combustion engine] came the rise of the automobile and bus, and the inevitable decline of the streetcar. After World War II came the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbanization suburbanization] of the Twin Cities, and streetcars could no longer compete with the automobile to reach distant residential areas. With increased affluence, more families were buying cars and demanding roadways to accommodate their purchases &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lh1MBj0eaTUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | publisher=UNiversity of Minnesota Press| ISBN: 1452912955, 9781452912950| title= Twin Cities by Trolley: The Streetcar Era in Minneapolis and St. Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to the competition between streetcars and automobiles, a series of leadership changes and publicized controversies led to the last new stretch of track laid in 1947. In 1954, three years after initial discussions with  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors General Motors], then Twin City Rapid Transit Company president [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ossanna Fred Ossanna] discontinued service of streetcars, and buses purchased from GM began service along many of the same routes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lh1MBj0eaTUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | publisher=UNiversity of Minnesota Press| ISBN: 1452912955, 9781452912950| title= Twin Cities by Trolley: The Streetcar Era in Minneapolis and St. Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Since the decommissioning of streetcar in St. Paul (and the Twin Cities), heavily traveled tracks have been paved over and pulled up, leaving a relic expanse of transportation lying underneath the streets. However, with a collective push for reinvestment in transportation modes besides automobile, St. Paul has begun to consider options for improvements to the existing network of bus routes. Included in these considerations are Arterial Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and a reinvented, modern version of past streetcar systems.

== Current Status ==
In the Transportation Policy Plan (TPP) adopted by the Metropolitan Council in 2010, a goal was set to double transit ridership by 2030 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://metrotransit.org/Data/Sites/1/media/pdfs/atcs/ATCS%20Final%20Report.pdf | publisher=Metro Transit| accessdate=2013-09-16| year=2013| title=Arterial Transitway Corridors Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This target could be achieved through a growth and maintenance of bus ridership, as well as the implementation of new rail and rapid bus systems. Two major projects studying streetcar and BRT in St. Paul are underway to examine how these two systems might help achieve the goal set forth by the 2010 TPP.

'''Arterial BRT Studies in St. Paul'''

Arterial Bus Rapid Transit opportunities for the city of St. Paul were presented in the 2012 Arterial Transitway Corridor Study completed by Metro Transit. This study examined some of the Twin Cities most heavily traveled transit corridors. The goal of the study was to develop a facility and service plan to enhance efficiency, speed, reliability, customer experience, and transit market competitiveness on 11 high-demand urban transitway corridors. Of these 11 corridors, five are located in St. Paul. These include Robert Street, West Seventh Street, East Seventh Street, Snelling Avenue, and part of Lake Street. This study recommended near-term aBRT implementation on Snelling Avenue and West Seventh Street. Currently, the Snelling Avenue study is undergoing preliminary engineering, where a request for proposal has been issued for station design. The Snelling Avenue route is scheduled to open in 2015, the West 7th route in 2016, and a goal has been set to open an additional line each subsequent year.

'''Streetcar Studies in St. Paul'''

Through the 2007 Minneapolis Streetcar Feasibility Study, St. Paul has undertaken an examination of local opportunities for streetcar. Currently, the St. Paul Streetcar Feasibility Study is scheduled to conclude at the end of 2013. This study is currently in the second of three phases. The January 2013 Phase 1 filtered a long list of potential streetcar corridors into a shorter one. Phase 2, which was concluded in August of 2013, further examined the recommendations from Phase 1. Phase 2 narrowed the list of potential lines to seven: Rice Street, Payne Avenue, East 7th Street, Robert Street, West 7th Street, Grand Avenue, and Selby-Snelling Avenue. From these seven, Phase 3 will determine the most effective streetcar lines and segments to pursue through outreach and further data-driven analysis completed by consulting groups. From these Phase 3 recommendations, a single line will be identified for initial implementation. Pre-Project Development (formerly known as an Alternatives Analysis under SAFETEA-LU) will likely begin to identify environmental impacts, and a locally preferred alternative (LPA) will be selected.

== Possibility of Both BRT and Streetcar ==

It is possible that the two technologies described in this article will both be pursued for implementation. The West 7th corridor, more widely known as the Riverview corridor, is under investigation by both Metro Transit for aBRT use and the St. Paul Streetcar Feasibility Study.  Arterial BRT may serve a longer distance trip between the St. Paul Union Depot and the Mall of America, whereas streetcar may compliment this service with shorter trips along a route with more stops. In addition, the Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority is examining this corridor for more robust systems, including Light Rail Transit (LRT) and dedicated BRT. The coordination and cooperation of different agencies will determine which system is to be deployed.

= Justification for Transit Improvements in St. Paul =

Currently many streets in Saint Paul are reaching capacity loads along their lengths or at choke-points. A portion of Snelling Avenue which has both aBRT and streetcar considerations (aBRT will be running by 2015), carries over 40,000 vehicles daily. Another street being considered for both these modes is West Seventh, or Old Fort Road, carries nearly 20,000 vehicles near downtown Saint Paul daily. This traffic can cause long delays for motor vehicles and current transit (buses) alike. &lt;ref&gt;Transportation, url=http://www.stpaul.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/11885, posted Feb 2010, accessed September 15th 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Paul has also taken steps to increase density in the city, and is forseen to be successful in these efforts as, in the Metropolitan Council's 2040 predictions Saint Paul will grow by 54,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;Twin Cities On Track For Increased Population Density, Twin Cities Business, Jake Anderson, url=http://tcbmag.com/News/Recent-News/2013/September/New-Forecast-Shows-Increased-Population-Density-In, posted September 17th 2013, accessed September 18th 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This as well as growing suburban commuters will put more strain on Saint Paul's street grid if the current infrastructure remains largely unchanged. To accommodate the growing need for transportation, an expansion of transit must take place. As many of these routes involve heavy boardings at transfer points already (84 at University, 54 at Sibley Plaza), an easier way to speed up service would be to have off-board payment, fare collection, level boarding and multiple door boarding, things that both these plans provide.

= Streetcar vs. BRT: Generic Arguments =
Excluding factors specific to St. Paul, there are a number of generic consideration when weighing the costs and benefits of streetcar and arterial BRT.  This section summarizes the literature related to those generic arguments. 

== Capital and Operating Cost ==
The absolute costs of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetcar streetcar] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit arterial BRT] can vary dramatically according to the context.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Union_Streetcar South Lake Union Streetcar] in Seattle cost $52 million to construct &lt;ref&gt;Reconnecting America. The Seattle Case Study: The South Lake Union Streetcar. Retrieved September 16, 2013, from http://www.reconnectingamerica.org/assets/Uploads/090305streetcarbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; while a &quot;starter&quot; streetcar line proposed for Minneapolis along Nicollet Avenue is estimated to cost $182 million &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Detailed Evaluation of Alternatives: Nicollet-Central Transit Alternatives.&quot; Produced by URS for the City of Minneapolis, August 2013. Accessed September 16,2013. http://www.minneapolismn.gov/nicollet-central/&lt;/ref&gt;.  Similar cost variations can be found for BRT.  In an effort to facilitate a useful comparison, we have provided the cost estimates from an alternative analysis where both arterial BRT and streetcar were considered.  Thus, the context specific costs will be constant across modes.

The table below provides cost information for the Nicollet/Central corridor in Minneapolis &lt;ref&gt;Levinson, David. &quot;Do Streetcars Promote Economic Development?&quot; streets.mn, August 26, 2013.

The data was summarized from the Nicollet Alternatives Anaysis and Metro Transit's Arterial BRT study.  It is importat to note that there were differences in assumptions and service quality between the two analyses, which impact the ultimate ridership counts and thus the per rider values provide below &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Detailed Evaluation of Alternatives: Nicollet-Central Transit Alternatives.&quot; Page 15.

In terms of capital costs, construction is expected to cost anywhere from $58.6 to $71.8 M/mile in 2013 dollars.  For the sake of comparison, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Union_Streetcar South Lake Union Streetcar], which was completed in 2007, cost $43 M/mile to construct.

== Ridership ==
There are many considerations when evaluating the potential ridership variations between streetcars and arterial BRT.  However, there are two that weigh most heavily on the subject and neither of them are easily resolved.  The first is &quot;rail bias.&quot;  This effectively means that, all else equal, people are more likely to ride a rail-type transit option than a bus.  Of course, the actual level of this bias vary's from region to region and some might argue that other factors are at play.  For example, it may also vary according to the relative quality of the rail and bus transit.  In the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul Twin Cities] this rail bias was observed after the construction of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiawatha_Line Blue Line].  Specifically, local study of the phenomena found that &quot;in some cases travelers will see up to a 25 minute weighted travel time savings over a comparable bus trip.&quot;  It is important to remember that this bias occurs between [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Rail_Transit LRT] and regular bus.  We are interested in the potential ridership difference between streetcars and arterial BRT.  Does the same bias apply in this case?  The service designs for LRT and regular bus are substantially dissimilar.  The service designs and infrastructure features for arterial BRT are more likely to reflect that of the streetcar design than the prior case. In the Nicollet-Central alternatives analysis produced by URS, they assumed as similar but reduced bias in favor of streetcar &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Detailed Evaluation of Alternatives: Nicollet-Central Transit Alternatives.&quot; Page 15. Produced by URS for the City of Minneapolis, August 2013. Accessed September 16,2013. http://www.minneapolismn.gov/nicollet-central/&lt;/ref&gt;. The product of this assumption is reflected in the ridership values provided above.  Broader research on the preferences between rail and bus is less conclusive than the biases stated above.  One frequently cited paper by Moshe ben-Akiva and Takayuki Morikawa found that the preference for rail dissolves when service characteristics like the trip fare and travel times are comparable across mode&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Akiva, Moshe, Takayuki Morikawa. 2002. &quot;Comparing ridership attraction of rail and bus.&quot; Transport Policy, 9(2): 107-116.&lt;/ref&gt;.  More research on the subject is warranted but this paper suggests that claims of rail bias ought to be re-framed in terms of service quality instead of mode.

The second factor to consider when evaluating ridership is the capacity of that mode to accommodate future growth(assuming future growth is a reasonable expectation).  Buses tend to have more seats, but streetcars tend to have more overall capacity when standing rooms is considered.  The URS report reference above also found that streetcars are better able to accommodate future growth [http://www.minneapolismn.gov/nicollet-central/ (page 19)]. It is important to recognize that there are those who would argue that the capacity advantage of streetcar over bus or BRT is nonexistent &lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Randal. June 14, 2014. The Great Streetcar Conspiracy. Policy Analysis, No. 699. Accessed September 17, 2013. http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA699.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Economic Development ==
The economic development benefits of BRT and Streetcar are often praised by advocates and politicians.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Cleveland_Regional_Transit_Authority Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority] claims that Cleveland's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HealthLine HealthLine] has leveraged more than $4.3 billion in economic development benefits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rtahealthline.com/healthline-what-is.asp | publisher=Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority| accessdate=2013-09-14| year=2013| title=RTA HealthLine}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In a bid by Oakland to open a streetcar system, they have highlighted claims that the streetcars constructed in Seattle and Portland produced $2.4 billion and $3.5 billion in economic development, respectively&lt;ref&gt;The Oakland Streetcar Plan. Accessed on September 17, 2012. http://www.oaklandstreetcarplan.com/1/post/2010/10/streetcars-and-economic-development1.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  Academic literature on the economic development benefits of streetcar is scant and remains far from conclusive&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council. TCRP Synthesis 86.

Accessed on September 17, 2013. http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_syn_86.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  Peer reviewed research on the subject remains even more elusive.  Research on the economic development associated with BRT is more plentiful and has been helpfully summarize by Dr. David Levinson on his blog the [http://transportationist.org/2013/09/11/does-brt-have-economic-development-effects/ Transportationist].

In order to assess the economic development potential for arterial BRT or streetcar, it is first necessary to understand the dimensions of a proposed transit improvement.  These dimensions of service design include speed, convenience, frequency, infrastructure components, etc.  They can vary broadly from project to project and each of these factors may facilitate or diminish the economic development potential of a project.  A useful measure of these characteristics has been produced by the Institute for Transportation &amp; Development Policy (ITDP)&lt;ref&gt;The BRT Statndard 2013. Institute for Transportation &amp; Development Policy. Accessed September 17, 2013. http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_syn_86.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;.  As was noted in the ridership section above, research suggests these characteristics impact ridership levels regardless of the mode (bus or rail).  It is quite feasible that the same is true for economic development.  Research from the ITDP (scheduled to be released on Sept. 2th, 2013) finds that a well designed BRT system may have more economic development potential than an equivalent streetcar system from an investment vs. return perspective&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Jeff. Bus Rapid Transit Spurs Development Better Than Light Rail Or Streetcars: Study. Forbes. Published September 15th, 2013.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/09/15/bus-rapid-transit-spurs-development-better-than-light-rail-and-streetcars/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comfort ==
Comfort is a very important factor when people are choosing their transport means. &lt;ref name=&quot;H1&quot;&gt;Parsons Brinckerhoff: BUS RAPID TRANSIT: IT’S NOT JUST FOR BIG CITIES ANYMORE. Oct 17, 2012. http://bloomington.in.gov/media/media/application/pdf/12987.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

Unlike traditional bus stops, arterial BRT and streetcar both have uniquely designed stations, which can provide weather protection, shelter and a waiting facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;H1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Features such as security cameras, and periodic security officers offer an important sense of security to passengers, which also helps with the sense of confort.  What’s more, there are real-time information booths or information screens informing passengers when the next vehicle will arrive. Of course, these additional design features are tied to higher design and construction costs. &lt;br /&gt;

One of the big reasons why many Americans don’t like buses is that they don't provide the smooth ride expected by rail transit. In many cases, they simply are not comfortable&lt;ref name=&quot;H2&quot;&gt;BeyondDC: Why streetcars are often better than buses. May 25, 2010. http://beyonddc.com/log/?p=1733&lt;/ref&gt;. Although arterial BRT is smoother than traditional buses, the comfort provided does not match that of streetcars. &lt;br /&gt;

Both streetcar and aBRT stations offer off-board fare collection, which increases comfort, especially in cold winter months.

== Convenience ==
Capacity depends on the size of cars and frequency. Larger size increases capacity, but it may result in higher daily cost and maintenance fees. BRT is usually considered as high-capacity and frequency is decided by traffic demand. The streetcar in Portland runs approximately every 14 minutes on the NS Line and 18 minutes on the CL Line on weekdays between 9:30am and 5pm. Before 9:30am and after 5:00pm the trains run every 15-21 minutes on the NS Line and every 20-22 minutes on the CL Line&lt;ref name=&quot;H5&quot;&gt;Portland Streetcar Inc: Streetcar Schedule.Retrieved Sept 16, 2013. http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/3&lt;/ref&gt;. While BRT in Cape Town runs every 10-20 minutes between 5.45AM and 10PM&lt;ref name=&quot;H6&quot;&gt;Joe Peach: Five Cities with Bus Rapid Transit Systems.Jan 30, 2012. http://thisbigcity.net/five-cities-with-bus-rapid-transit-systems&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

A high running speed not only minimizes total number of cars needed in the fleet, but also shortens travel time. Typical speeds of BRT systems range from 17 to 30 miles per hour (27 to 48 km/h) and Arterial BRT projects in mixed flow traffic or designated lanes operate between 12 and 17 miles 
per hour)&lt;ref name=&quot;H7&quot;&gt;National BRT Institute: Characteristics of Bus Rapid Transit for Decision-Making.Aug 2004. http://www.nbrti.org/docs/pdf/Characteristics_BRT_Decision-Making.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

Comparing with BRT, streetcar is much slower. The Portland Streetcar's scheduled speed, within downtown and NW Portland, is around 6.5 miles per hour&lt;ref name=&quot;H8&quot;&gt;Wikipedia: Portland Streetcar.Retrieved Sept 16, 2013. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Streetcar&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

The distance of stops/stations can greatly impact speed. BRT often has long station distance because it needs to maintain its speed and therefore cannot frequently stop. Ashland BRT in Chicago stops every 0.5 miles (totally line length 16 miles)&lt;ref name=&quot;H9&quot;&gt;Chicago Transit Authority: Ashland Bus Rapid Transit. Retrieved Sept 16, 2013. http://www.transitchicago.com/ashlandbrt&lt;/ref&gt;. As streetcar, the average distance between two stations of NS line in Portland is 0.08 mile (totally line length 3.9 miles). Overall BRT is more capable for long distance transport while streetcar for short distance.

== Safety ==
Usually BRT enjoys its exclusive lane and signal priority on street, thereby ensuring some level of safety. However, arterial BRT will not always have the right-of-way and will likely be required to share roads with other vehicles. To develop better infrastructure for hosting the 2016 Olympics, Rio launched an ambitious transportation plan of BRT lanes. However, after just three months of operation of BRT, Rio reported at least four pedestrian accidents causing death, and five vehicle collisions&lt;ref name=&quot;H3&quot;&gt;Mary Carroll: BRT Accidents Causing Concern in Rio. Sept 4, 2012. http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-real-estate/brt-accidents-causing-concern-in-rio/&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

Streetcar shares lanes with automobile traffic as well. In this case, streetcar is no different from arterial BRT. However, streetcar is relatively safer because it is also slower. Street grade rail may also present issues for cars. It may create unsafe environment when drivers naturally avoid tracks. Cyclists need to pay special attention when they are riding because the tire may pump into the flangeway if they cross at a shallow angle. &lt;ref name=&quot;H4&quot;&gt;Portland Streetcar Inc: When I Ride - Safety Video. Published on Sept 20, 2012. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIRQaNdeS1s/&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

== Energy ==
Arterial BRT is gasoline or gasoline/electricity-hybrid-powered, whereas most streetcar systems use electricity only. Although point pollution does not exist from streetcar systems, electricity generation used for streetcar power must be considered when weighing energy use. 
&lt;br /&gt;

As we can see from the table on the right&lt;ref name=&quot;H10&quot;&gt;M.J. Bradley &amp; Associates: Comparison of Energy Use &amp; CO2 Emissions From Different Transportation Modes. Published on May, 2007. http://www.buses.org/files/ComparativeEnergy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, trolley bus(streetcar) on average moves 104.4 Pass-mi/Gal while transit bus moves 32.5 Pass-mi/Gal. Depending on the vehicle used in the BRT system, it is likely that streetcar uses less energy. From the next six columns we could also infer that streetcar uses less energy  per Pass-mi and emits less CO2, which is believed to be the main cause of global warming.

= West 7th Street Case Study =

Along West 7th Street, both aBRT and streetcars are being considered. This line provides several good points for debating the topic of which style of transit should be implemented. The land use around where the streetcar is planned (to Randolph Avenue) to run is largely institutional and residential housing, often with a few blocks of high density and activity placed through out the corridor, but no continuity. The ideal for development along this corridor would be to make this density and developments more continuous and with more consistent density. However many of the riders on this line are simply travelling to or from outside this corridor. With a recent ride check (route 54, Sunday the 15th, evening) having 36 people ride into this segment of the corridor from the south, and 37 ride into the city from Bloomington. aBRT plans for this by continuing the line beyond Otto, through to the airport and Mall of America, while the streetcars plan for this by suggesting a light rail extension/hybrid system could be implemented beyond Otto Avenue, out to beyond the city. &lt;ref&gt;Saint Paul Feasiability Study, url=http://www.stpaul.gov/DocumentCenter/View/66490, accessed September 12, 2013 Pages 22, 25, 29, &lt;/ref&gt;

The aBRT for this corridor has been fully studied already and shows an improvement in travel time of 2 minutes over the length of the entire route for a 4% decrease in time (36 minutes to 34 minutes). This is one of the smallest improvements in actual travel time across the entire planned aRT network, with most other routes having a time savings of 10% or more, (exceptions include Lake St. where aBRT will only be 3 minutes faster than the 53) Partially this is due to the fact that one of the biggest advantages for aBRT over normal bus service, fewer stops, has already been implemented by the 54 (and 53), a limited stop route. Streetcar connections have not yet been fully evaluated for their speed, but is currently listed at ~12 mph, whereas current service is ~19 mph.

Lastly aBRT is being implemented along this route as the second aBRT for the cities, even due to the fact that it is the 3rd worst scoring line (out of 11) in a technical metric. And was shown to have one of the lowest user benefits associated with its implementation. This was done, in large part to Saint Paul not announcing it's study of steetcars until after the aBRT routes had been evaluated and the area around the line being fully developed. 

General costs for the lines are vastly different, here we will use cost per mile because aBRT and the streetcar have different terminal points. The streetcar line has a cost per mile of ~$60million per mile &lt;ref&gt;Saint Paul Feasiability Study, url=http://www.stpaul.gov/DocumentCenter/View/66490, accessed September 12, 2013 Page 96&lt;/ref&gt;, the aBRT is shown as ~$2.4million per mile.&lt;ref&gt;url=http://metrotransit.org/arterial-study, Published 2012, Accessed September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Induction cookers are energy successful cooking appliances as they employ utmost total of heat generated to cook the food. An very easily set up simple fact is that with regular cooking only about forty p.c of the created warmth contributes to cooking. On the other hand, more than eighty per cent of the warmth generates in an induction cooker is used for cooking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fissler Cookware and Wedgewood Tableware are among the the best cookware and tableware obtainable in the European sector. They are manufacturers of kitchenware and kitchen add-ons that, their made goods will make your kitchen search like a lovely section of fairyland. Manufactured with solid a long lasting metals and glass the kitchenware's are finely visualized and produced, retaining in head all the aspects of fantastic and bad that happens in any standard kitchen area. The products are made and designed, employing metals of fantastic longevity, not only that but also the casting and the coating that are finished on all these components can make them much more refine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enamel-coated Cast Iron Cookware: This cookware does not have a leaching trouble. If dealt with thoroughly, it can very last for a life span. Having said that, it is pricey as compared to many others and wants to be hand-washed routinely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beneath is a recipe for a classic Sunday roast, finish with roast beef, vegetables, and Yorkshire pudding. Initial you will need to have the adhering to Cookware and components.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The corporation does not deliver replacement elements now but you can get in touch with the business for tracing the closest retailer in your space who sells the alternate elements. If you decide on to obtain on line find only reputed shops which are recognized for a lot of many years. Go for the assessment from the shopper side and come across out if there is any rip-off concerned. You can order the spare sections of the product at really reasonable expense from the seller. Before deciding upon the supplier, constantly evaluate the rates of other dealers and look at if they are advertising solutions genuinely for long time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cookware needs to be long lasting, rugged, adaptable and trusted. Longevity and ruggedness implies that the cookware is good for genuine cooking chores and not just for display only. You need to be in a position to use it for extended periods of time with no the cookware staying disfigured or warped--a mix of stainless and copper are ordinarily the ones excelling on toughness and ruggedness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you a well being acutely aware person looking for nutritious cookware created from a hundred% Pure Clay? Do you want some thing that is non-toxic, natural and nutritious? You want healthful cookware built from pure clay that is absolutely free from additives, glazes, dyes, leads, talc, petalite (an ore of lithium) and a lot of other unsafe substances, which might endanger your overall health.

They permit you to cook dinner all-natural, balanced, nutritious and scrumptious foods in exquisite and stylish gourmand cookware, Clay pots should really be an crucial addition to your kitchens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Induction cooking on the Duxtop 8100MC is 83 percent economical, far more economical than a gasoline cooktop, and expenses fewer than $.fifteen for each hour to function, as opposed to $one.sixty two for each hour for gasoline. It operates on a standard 110/one hundred twenty volt outlet, normal in all homes. The fast heating would make all forms of cooking attainable: frying, sauting, stir-frying, warming, or anything else. An induction cooktop is an exceptional addition for any kitchen area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is more information regarding anodized aluminum cookware ([http://member.thinkfree.com/myoffice/show.se?f=b870bf800d270a915b081052bf8dbdb7 thinkfree.com]) stop by member.thinkfree.com/myoffice/show.se</text>

== [[Trainz]] user group ==

I've made various modest contributions to 13 wikimedia projects since 2004, including tens of thousands on the encyclopedia and am interested in helping the Trainz wikibook here. (I've yet to peruse it, but am getting started. I expect I'll find stale or version specific information along the way&amp;mdash;meaning it'll create an itch I'll want to scratch with a fix!) I'm way out of date on local practices though. Is there a projects user template indexing the group of editors that are involved. I seem to recognize your handle as a general Admin type user from way back.

Best regards, [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 22:26, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

:The editors that have been involved can be seen at [[Trainz/Authors]].  Checking [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Trainz]] for any changes and clicking on the 30 days link, I only see anonymous (IP) users having made changes.  It is likely that there is nobody currently active on the book.  You may be interested in [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikimedians]] for getting a feel for Wikibooks-specific processes and [[Help:Contents]] covers specific templates and structural components used here that you may not see elsewhere.  Thanks for stopping by and I hope to see you around! &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:53, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Hi, sorry for writing in English. I'm writing to ask you, as a bureaucrat of this wiki, to [//meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&amp;group=page-Single+User+Login+finalisation+announcement%2FPersonal+announcement&amp;filter=&amp;action=page translate and review the notification] that will be sent to all users, also on this wiki, who will be forced to change their user name on May 27 and will probably need your help with renames.
You may also want to help with the pages [[m:Rename practices]] and [[m:Global rename policy]].

== What Is Depression? ==
Depression is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses not only in Australia but also the world, with one in every five adolescents likely to experience a diagnosable depressive episode by the age of 18 &lt;ref&gt;Birmaher B, Ryan ND, Williamson DE, Brent DA, Kaufman J, Dahl RE, Perel J, Nelson B. Childhood and adolescent depression: a review of the past 10 years.Part I. J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 1996 Nov;35(11):1427-39.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The term ‘Depressed’ is used often in general conversation to describe feeling down after a particular unpleasant event, which is usually short lived and resolved rapidly. A depressive mood is not necessarily a mental illness; it is often a normative response to life events, or certain circumstances. Depression as a mental illness however, describes a much more prolonged and persistent negativity. It is often categorized as;
* A state of low mood 
* Aversion to activity that can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, feelings and sense of well-being,
* Constant or sustained depressive mood as a primary factor &lt;ref&gt;  Salmans, Sandra (1997). Depression: Questions You Have – Answers You Need. People's Medical Society.ISBN 978-1-882606-14-6. &lt;/ref&gt;.  
Depression is regularly seen in conjunction with other mood/mental disorders, in particular anxiety, and can trigger and/or is triggered by eating disorders, schizophrenia and stress &lt;ref&gt; Depression and Other Mental Illnesses. (n.d.). Cleveland Clinic. Retrieved September 12, 2013, from http://my.clevelandclinic.org/disorders/depression/hic_depression_and_other_mental_illnesses.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosing depression is a difficult task, as it does not involve a particular type of pathogen.Thus, a blood test or any similar sort of test cannot be undertaken. 
To determine if one is suffering depression a doctor will often run through a series of questions to determine things the patient may be going through or feeling including:
* major changes in weight
* irregular sleep (too much or too little)
* feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness
* problems with concentration or making decisions almost every day
* recurring thoughts of death or suicide
The culmination of the patients response, as well as factoring in certain circumstances such as patient history, physical signs and ruling out physical conditions; for example hypothyroidism, helps the doctor achieve a diagnosis. &lt;ref&gt; American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). &lt;/ref&gt;

== Successful Exercise Treatments ==
Several clinical studies have shown strong a strong relationship between prescription of exercise and reduced depressive symptoms amongst adolescents. &lt;ref&gt; Timbremont, B., &amp; Braet, C. (2004). Cognitive Vulnerability In Remitted Depressed Children And Adolescents. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 42(4), 423-437. &lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt; Ströhle, A. (2009). Physical Activity, Exercise, Depression And Anxiety Disorders. Journal of Neural Transmission, 116(6), 777-784. &lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt; Biddle, S. J., &amp; Asare, M. (2011). Physical Activity And Mental Health In Children And Adolescents: A Review Of Reviews. British Journal of Sports Medicine, 45(11), 886-895. &lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt; Rothon, C., Edwards, P., Bhui, K., Viner, R. M., Taylor, S., &amp; Stansfeld, S. A. (2010). Physical Activity And Depressive Symptoms In Adolescents: A Prospective Study. BMC Medicine, 8(1), 32. &lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt; Jerstad SJ, Boutelle KN, Ness KK, Stice E. Prospective reciprocal relations between physical activity and depression in female adolescents. J Consult Clin Psychol. 2010 Apr;78(2):268–272. &lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt; Demoor, M., Beem, A., Stubbe, J., Boomsma, D., &amp; Degeus, E. (2006). Regular Exercise, Anxiety, Depression And Personality: A Population-based Study. Preventive Medicine, 42(4), 273-279. &lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt; Nabkasorn, C. (2005). Effects Of Physical Exercise On Depression, Neuroendocrine Stress Hormones And Physiological Fitness In Adolescent Females With Depressive Symptoms. The European Journal of Public Health , 16(2), 179-184. &lt;/ref&gt; 
These studies all varied greatly, one tested only 49 female adolescent participants, whilst another had over 20 thousand participants. They also measured depressive symptoms in different ways, some with questionnaires, another with a scale from the Centre for Depression studies. Some were followed up two, or even six years later, whilst another wasn’t followed up longitudinally at all. Despite all the variances, each study came to the same conclusion. All the studies showed evidence to suggest a strong positive correlation between prescription of exercise and a decrease of depressive symptoms amongst adolescents. Two trials showed that 16 weeks of regular moderate exercise was just as effective as a prescription of anti-depressants.

==Benefits of Exercise as a Treatment ==
*Self esteem boost
*Increased social interaction via team sports
*Distracts from pessimistic thinking
*Improved sleep
*Increased energy
*Relatively side effect free
*Added physical benefits such as cardiovascular adaptation, prevention of numerous diseases, maintain healthy weight.

== Recommendations ==
Currently there is no true optimal recommendation, however there are still guidelines. &lt;ref&gt; Welch, L (2011) Fight depression with exercise Fawshaw Focus; 7:4 &lt;/ref&gt;

* Exercise does not need to be vigorous to help alleviate symptoms. &lt;sup&gt; 16 &lt;/sup&gt;
* Exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time, for a minimum of 30 minutes a day &lt;sup&gt; 16 &lt;/sup&gt;
* Moderate intensity on most days of the week, if not all, is most beneficial &lt;sup&gt; 16 &lt;/sup&gt;
* Live a more active lifestyle, e.g taking the stairs more often &lt;sup&gt; 15 &lt;/sup&gt;
* Choose a range of fun activities, as enjoyment and adherence are most important &lt;sup&gt; 15 &lt;/sup&gt;

==Limitations==
*Further longitudinal studies are required to ensure reliability over time
*Adherence is the biggest potential issue
*Unsure of optimal frequency, intensity, type and time &lt;sup&gt; 9 &lt;/sup&gt;

      <comment>/* Structural metadata */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Descriptive metadata==


==Structural metadata==
[[Image:Mediawiki database Schema.svg|thumb|The database schema used by ''Mediawiki'', the software that powers Wikibooks.  This schema is an example of ''structural metadata'', because it describes how this project's data are structured.]]
Certain communities, such as database administrators, are more concerned with another type of metadata: ''structural metadata''. This type of metadata documents how data is structured and stored.

For example, a store might keep a database that tracks how much money customers spend on groceries.  In this case, we would know that the customer's name would always be a string of characters, and that the amount of money they spend would always be a positive number.  Knowing this, we would be able to set up a database that stores the data more efficiently.  While creating the database, they might issue a command like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE purchases(
 purchase_id UNSIGNED INTEGER,
 customer_name VARCHAR(50),
 amount_spent UNSIGNED INTEGER,
 purchase_date TIMESTAMP,
 PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

This establishes a ''schema'' -- a set of constraints -- for our database table.  Here are some of the constraints:
* The &lt;code&gt;purchase_date&lt;/code&gt; must be in SQL's &lt;code&gt;timestamp&lt;/code&gt;. The database will throw an error if somebody tries to enter &lt;code&gt;Last Tuesday&lt;/code&gt; for a transaction's &lt;code&gt;purchase_date&lt;/code&gt;, but will accept &lt;code&gt;2020-02-14 09:22:15&lt;/code&gt;.
* Customers cannot spend a negative amount of money during a purchase, because the &lt;code&gt;amount_spent&lt;/code&gt; column only allows values with an &lt;code&gt;UNSIGNED INTEGER&lt;/code&gt; type, which must be positive.
* Customers with very long names may find their names shortened in the database, since the &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR(50)&lt;/code&gt; type only allows 50 characters of data in the &lt;code&gt;customer_name&lt;/code&gt; column.

After the database has seen some use, we might have the following in our table:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! purchase_id (UNSIGNED INTEGER)
! customer_name (VARCHAR(50))
! amount_spent (UNSIGNED INTEGER)
! purchase_date (TIMESTAMP)
|-
| 1
| Ashok Kumar
| 2784
| 2020-02-14 09:22:15
|-
| 2
| Hong Gil dong
| 3516

|-
| 4
| Israel Israeli
| 2495
| 2020-02-15 09:00:04
|}

By themselves, the values &lt;code&gt;499&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Hong Gil dong&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;2020-02-14 09:22:15&lt;/code&gt; are meaningless.  However, the structural metadata we entered allows us to define, interpret, maintain, and efficiently store the data in the table.

Confusingly, ''structural metadata'' has a second definition.  In the digital library community, the term ''structural metadata'' is frequently used to refer to a specific type of descriptive metadata, namely metadata that describes the physical and/or logical structure of a particular communication.  For example, if a digital library project had created digital images of all the pages in a book, structural metadata would document the order of the pages, and perhaps which page each chapter or section began with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=First Steps: Displays, Controls and Layouts=

Having looked at the basic concepts of event-driven programming, looked at a number of possible toolkits and considered how to start a &quot;blank file&quot; project, let us now turn to the building-blocks that we will use to construct graphical interfaces.

=Basic Widgets=

Let us consider some of the common basic widgets that we will be working with.
Most GUI libraries will provide us with a selection of basic GUI elements - which might be colloquially called &quot;widgets&quot;.
In many cases, we build our interfaces by taking an abstract widget, and then packing some of these basic widgets into it.

==The BasicWidget==

Typically, widgets will be part of an inheritance tree, which will often be rooted at a basic, blank &quot;widget&quot; class; I will call this class &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt;.
This &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt; will usually represent an abstract entity that can be added to another component, laid out and drawn, and will include useful members and functions to accomplish this.
Many of the concrete controls in our windowing toolkits will inherit from this basic empty widget, overriding some of its methods and members as appropriate.

Widgets will typically provide us a list of interesting 'properties' and 'events'.
In most cases, these properties and events are also inherited; the empty base widget will likely provide us with a few, which will then be inherited by every other widget.
For example, the &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt; might provide us with a &lt;code&gt;stylesheet&lt;/code&gt; property and &lt;code&gt;MouseEntered&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MouseLeft&lt;/code&gt; events.

Widgets will often have many more properties and events than we consider; most common GUI toolkits are designed to span a wide number of usage cases, and so their widgets will be very flexible.
In many cases, only a very few events and properties are of primary interest, and we will typically focus on those.

&lt;code&gt;BasicWidgets&lt;/code&gt; typically have the ability to contain other widgets as children; we will often create our interfaces by extending this &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt; and adding properties, events and child widgets as needed.
In this way, our interfaces can be viewed as 'trees', which will be rooted at some top-level widget that represents a window and will follow through other widgets that contain other widgets that contain other widgets, eventually ending at basic widgets like buttons and labels.

This arrangement suggests three families that we can group most specific widgets into: 'containers', 'controls' and 'displays'.
'Containers' are widgets whose primary purpose is to contain other widgets as children - and likely also to lay them visually on screen; 'controls' are widgets whose major purpose are to allow the user to issue commands to the software or to specify useful values; 'displays' are widgets whose primary purpose are to allow the software to communicate results back to the user.
The distinctions are not always clear-cut; some widgets might be both a control and a display, for example, or a control and a container.

Before we move on, it is worth noting that BasicWidgets have one other use.
Typically, they can be placed into other widgets and displayed, and they have no particular size constraints - in particular, no minimum and maximum sizes.
Therefore, we can use empty BasicWidgets as &quot;spacers&quot; in layouts, which we will consider below.

It is also worth noting that another way that we can create our own custom widgets is to inherit from &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt; and provide our own drawing logic, typically by overriding some provided &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; method.
However, this method of developing custom widgets is much less common (in part because it is more labor intensive) than simply packing a BasicWidget with useful controls that the toolkit provides for us.

==Two Basic Widgets: the  Button and the Label==

Perhaps the minimal display widget - and perhaps the simplest useful widget baring the BasicWidget - is the Label.
Labels are simple widgets that display a given text-string wherever they are placed in our interface; they are primarily useful for (as their name implies) labeling some other component of the interface.
The label has no interesting events and only a single interesting property, the text-string that it contains.

Labels are not particularly interesting on their own; the user cannot interact with them (other than perhaps to select and copy their text), and we typically will not be acting on them after we create them to display information to the user.
Of more interest is the Button; much as the Label is our simplest 'display' widget, the Button is perhaps our simplest possible 'control' widget.
Like the Label, Buttons will generally have a single interesting property, the text string that they display; however, unlike Labels, Buttons provide us with an interesting event - the &lt;code&gt;on_click&lt;/code&gt; event.
When the user clicks the Button, the Button will emit the &lt;code&gt;on_click&lt;/code&gt; event.
More technically, the system will detect that the mouse button was depressed and released in the area on the screen that the Button occupies, and will call every event handler registered to the Button's &lt;code&gt;on_click&lt;/code&gt; event; we usually do not concern ourselves with these details, and simply say that &quot;the Button emits the &lt;code&gt;on_click&lt;/code&gt; signal.&quot;

We will typically use Buttons to allow the user to request that we perform some action - obvious examples are the ubiquitous &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons that can be found throughout most programs of any complexity, which allow the user to tell the program when they are ready to have the system perform some task or wish for the system to not perform some task.
It is worth noting that we usually do not place the code that performs a given task in the callback that we will connect to a Button; rather, the actual callback in the Button will change some internal state in our interface and then arrange to have the task begun later, likely in another thread.

=Layouts=

Having touched on two widgets of interest, a minimal control and a minimal display, the motivated reader will be tempted to begin building basic interfaces.
However, we will need some other tools to build a usable interface.
Simply placing widgets into an entity tree is not enough information for the system to build our interface; it will tell the system what controls are present, but it will not tell the system how those controls should be displayed - in particular, the system won't know 'where' on screen to place the controls, or, if they can be different sizes, how 'large' they should be.
To provide this information, we turn to 'layouts'.

==Positioning and Sizing==

Widgets will typically provide 'minimum', 'maximum' and 'preferred' sizes; these sizes can depend on what the widget's intended purpose is, and what its current contents are.
For example, a Button's minimum, maximum and preferred size might all be the same, and they might be determined entirely by the text content of the button (and perhaps the current 'style sheet' in use in the application); meanwhile, an empty BasicWidget might not have any maximum size, but its minimum and preferred sizes might be determined by the widgets it contains.
These properties can vary both 'vertically' and 'horizontally' - a widget might have a specified maximum 'height' that it can occupy, but it might be capable of being any 'length'.

Widgets may also have different &quot;willingness&quot; to grow vertically or horizontally.
For example, it might be the case that we have two widgets laid out in a row, and neither of them might specify a maximum length: in this case, how should we allocate the vertical space of the widget?
While some toolkits might use some combination of the different sizes and some implicit rules, other toolkits provide us with 'weights'.
Weights represent how much &quot;slack space&quot; should be given to the components in the case that a layout has more space available than all widget's minimum or preferred sizes.
In some toolkits, weights are (implicit or explicit) properties of the 'widgets' while in others they are properties of the 'layouts'; the distinction is not terribly important, as they tend to perform the same role.

&lt;!-- I should probably define &quot;sizing policy&quot; and &quot;size request&quot; in here --&gt;

&lt;!--
==The Role of a Layout==

The layout is responsible for positioning and sizing the child-widgets of a given container widget.
When a widget is drawn, the Layout will check the 'size policy' of every child widget that it is responsible for.
Since some of those child widgets can themselves be containers, this process can be 'recursive': in order for a container widget to know its size policy, it must compute its layout; computing its layout will require the size policies of each of that containers children; this will require each child to compute its size policy; if any of those children are themselves containers, they will need to compute 'their' child policies; and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Useful Controls: Selection Widgets=

We will now consider a family of useful controls, the 'selection widgets'.
Many of these widgets inherit from the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; widget, and so will inherit also the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;'s properties and events.

==The CheckBox Widget==

==The RadioButton Widget==

===Button Groups===

==The ComboBox==

The ComboBox is similar to a Button, except that, when clicked, it will display a drop-down list of entries; the user can then select from among these entries.
The ComboBox is useful for displaying a list of entities from which we want the user to make a single selection.
It has the additional advantage over the RadioButton that it is very 'compact', and that its layout is predictable; it is therefore useful for the situation where our list of choices is either very large or unpredictable - that is, we cannot know what it will be before-hand.

ComboBoxes have two interesting properties, the list of 'possible' selections and the 'currently'-selected item.
They provide us with a single interesting event, the &lt;code&gt;on_select&lt;/code&gt; event, which is emitted when a selection is made from the pull-down menu.
This event is somewhat different from the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;on_click&lt;/code&gt; event.
&lt;code&gt;on_click&lt;/code&gt; is emitted whenever the user clicks the Button, which is essentially their only way of interacting with the Button; &lt;code&gt;ComboBoxes&lt;/code&gt; typically support 'cancelling' the interaction, perhaps by hitting the Escape key after clicking the button; this might result in an &lt;code&gt;on_click&lt;/code&gt; event being issued without a corresponding &lt;code&gt;on_select&lt;/code&gt; event.

Since we usually care about when the user makes a 'selection' and what they have selected and not whether or not the &lt;code&gt;ComboBox&lt;/code&gt; was clicked, we will usually connect to the &lt;code&gt;on_select&lt;/code&gt; event and not the &lt;code&gt;on_click&lt;/code&gt; event, or the other events that the &lt;code&gt;ComboBox&lt;/code&gt; might emit.
In point of fact, since we often do not care about the selection displayed in the &lt;code&gt;ComboBox&lt;/code&gt; until we wish to use it, we often will not connect to a signal on the ComboBox at all, but rather will fetch the current selection from the &lt;code&gt;ComboBox&lt;/code&gt; at some later point (for example after the user has clicked an &quot;OK&quot; &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; and some processing is being performed).

Frequently, &lt;code&gt;ComboBoxes&lt;/code&gt; will also have two other useful properties, 'editability' and 'read-only status'.

===Object Models===

&lt;code&gt;ComboBoxes&lt;/code&gt; can be very flexible, powerful widgets; they can often display much more than simple text labels.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An elephant can die from a broken heart

It turns out that elephants are highly emotional animals. They form close-knit relationships with one another and mourn the loss of loved ones. At times, if a fellow elephant dies, the others in the herd will gather around and pay their respects as if at a funeral.
If a baby elephant loses its mother, it will grieve. The elephant will often become withdrawn and emaciated. Other members of the herd will gather around and nurse the orphan back to life. Elephants can form deep attachments with humans too.
In one case, an elephant handler raised a baby elephant. She had to go away for a brief time to attend her daughter’s wedding. When she returned, she found that the baby elephant had died of a broken heart at her absence.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Nazi Germany's Defeat on the Eastern Front, 1941-1945}}


This is a guide to the fighting on the Eastern Front during World War II. It goes through the events leading to the conquest of Berlin by Soviet forces in April-May 1945.

==Contents==

=== Introduction: Pseudo-Reality and the Führerprinzip  ===

“Hitler is Germany and Germany is Hitler. What he does in necessary. Whatever he does is necessary. Whatever he does is successful. Clearly the Führer has divine blessing.” -- Rudolf Hess &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/fuehrer_principle.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union on September 22, 1941 he had three main goals: (1) Seizure of territory for the use of Germans; (2) The murder of the Jews; and (3) The destruction of Communism. The three goals were essentially separate. Hitler's seized territory in 1939 from Poland and Czechoslovakia, neither of which were ruled by Communists. He killed Jews all over Europe regardless of whether those Jews lived in a Communist country or were Communists themselves. He starved and mistreated even anti-Communist Ukrainians, alienating them to the detriment of his other war aims. A study of his writings and speeches, beginning with his book Mein Kampf (written in the mid-1920s) shows that he intended to conquer the USSR and destroy the Jews irrespective of his stated antipathy to Communism.

Hitler claimed he was creating a &quot;1000-Year Reich&quot; but it only lasted twelve years. On April 30, 1945, not even four years after his invasion of the USSR, he shot himself in his bunker in Berlin in order to avoid capture by advancing Soviet troops. His surviving troops in Berlin surrendered two days later, and all of what remained of Nazi Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945. When we today study World War Two we know how it ends. We know that the vast majority of Germans had abandoned their former alliegiance to Nazism within a few generations after 1945. Today National Socialism aka Nazism, the ideology which once held sway not only in Germany and Austria but among sympathizers among much of Europe from Finland to Italy, can hardly be said to exist.

t is easy to forget the astonishing extent to which Germans themselves, even late in the war, actually believed that they could defeat the combined forces of the US, Britain and the USSR. How it was that the citizens of Germany and Austria, two advanced nations, came to believe such nonsense naturally preoccupies us. It is worth noting that it was Hitler who declared war on the USA, not the other way around, a disastrous decision by the Nazis that brought the industrial might of the United States fully into the war against Nazi Germany.  It was surely one of history's most significant examples of hubris. 

Much of HItler's success in motivating the German population to continue an impossible two-front war against the entire English-speaking world ''and'' the Soviet Union was a result of Hitler's one unquestionable triumph: his popularization of an infallible image of himself and of the state he largely created.

In the decades since his death, the world has largely come to realize the remarkable falsity of the Fuehrerprinzip, the claim by the Nazi leadership that all power flowed from Hitler and that his decisions were infallible. There are still die-hard apologists for Hitler's wartime decision-making skills, and not only in Germany, but they are pretty much placed in the same category as Holocaust-deniers.

A complete history of HItler's propagandistic triumphs, and their slow unraveling, is outside the scope of this book. However, an understanding of it is necessary in order to comprehend the reality of the German people's devotion to Hitler and willingness to accept and believe in decisions that would otherwise appear insane. Hitler's great trick was to convince the world, even after the mass surrender of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad in early 1943, that its forces were the equal of those of the USSR and that it wasn't actually losing the war on the Eastern Front. At that task he succeeded brilliantly within the borders of Nazi Germany itself. In reality it was as a result of Hitler's own flawed decisions the war was lost almost two-and-a-half years before it ground to a halt in Berlin. The only question then was who would get to Berlin first, the US and the UK, or the USSR.

But among the senior Nazis themselves in 1945, the notion that the war was lost at such an early date was realized imperfectly if at all. Some ascribed the collapse of the Nazi state to Germany's defeat at the Battle of the Bulge in early 1945, or on the beaches of Normandy in 1944, or even the huge disparity between Allied and German military and industrial production during the year 1943. There was a vague realization of Nazi German failures on the ground in 1941 and 1942, but a rather imperfect understanding of the logistical and strategic aspects of those failings.

== Supportive manufacture of biologics ==

Last assistance with the actual supportive manufacture of certified biologics continues to be from the actual FDA, which provides businesses an overview of methods to talk about duties with the manufacturing procedure.

The United States Fda (FDA) seems this particular assistance is essential because the complicated technologies utilized in the actual manufacture of biologics offers resulted in the actual introduction associated with extremely specialized businesses.

:Supportive manufacture plans tend to be more and more appealing to these businesses because they aim to mix market abilities. Nevertheless, the actual business of those certification plans could be a time intensive procedure therefore the FDA offers released assistance to assist manufactures.

These types of supportive plans tend to be divided through the FDA in to brief provide, split manufacture, discussed manufacture as well as agreement manufacture.
Brief provide plans

Whenever supply materials are an issue the biologics manufacture might understand it through a good fake service when the item permit owner fulfills particular FDA circumstances.

These particular locations the duty around the permit owner to make sure that the merchandise produced from the actual fake service is going to be produced in complete conformity along with relevant rules.

Brief provide plans can be applied to some small group associated with supplies that just go through “specified restricted processing”.

=== Split manufacture plans ===

The actual FDA enables several businesses, because both versions is actually certified to fabricate a specific item, in order to work together upon it's manufacturing. Our recommendation is that the actual actions carried out each and every service tend to be comprehensive within the software.

Authorization from the software is determined by several elements such as the equivalence from the advanced items and also the capability to show this can stay steady throughout delivery.
Additional factors consist of recordkeeping as well as marking, using the FDA needing which: “The title, deal with, as well as permit quantity of every taking part certified manufacture should show up on
the actual bundle tag.”

=== Discussed manufacture plans ===

The actual assistance identifies discussed manufacture because: “an agreement by which several manufactures tend to be certified as well as accountable for particular facets of the actual manufacture of an item but none of them is actually certified for those facets of the actual manufacture of the merchandise.”

:A good example of this really is if a person manufacture accounts for medium difficulty and the other for that last item. The actual FDA’s assistance particulars exactly what manufacture procedures need individual licensure as well as that, “even although vital that you the actual wholesomeness as well as ethics from the last product”, perform not really.

Additional substantial assistance is offered upon coping with biologics permit programs (BLAs), naming and also the required every manufacture.

=== Agreement manufacture plans ===

A simple distinction between discussed as well as agreement plans is the fact that within the second option situation amenities don't require extra permit.

This particular locations particular various duties around the permit owner and also the agreement manufacture, that are layed out within the FDA’s assistance record.

The entire assistance are available right [http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/FDA-1999-D-0128-gdl.pdf here]</text>

== Background ==
Cholesterol and triglycerides are widely grouped together as Lipids or fats and are an important component to the normal functioning of the body. When blood lipid (fats) concentrations become either too high or too low, this condition is described as '''Dyslipidaemia''' &lt;ref&gt;G.H Williams, William F. Young, 2013, The Endocrine Health Society, Hormones Health Network, viewed 20/09/2013, http://www.hormone.org/diseases-and-conditions/heart-health-and-metabolism/dyslipidemia&lt;/ref&gt;. The most common forms of Dyslipidaemia are high levels of Low density [http://heartuk.org.uk/files/uploads/documents/huk_fs_mfsA_cholesterollipoproteins.pdf Lipoprotein] (LDL) or “bad” cholesterol, Low levels of High density Lipoproteins (HDL) or “good” cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides&lt;ref&gt;Manrigue, C, Rosenzweig, J, Umpierrez, G, 2009, ‘Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, and Heart Protection’, The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, vol. 94, no. 10, viewed 20 September 2013, http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/94/1/0.2.full.pdf+html.&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the 2011-2012 Australian health survey, 63.2% of the Australian population over the age of 18 have some sort of lipid disorder, Furthermore it is estimated that 5.6 million Australian adults have unmanaged high blood cholesterol and of these adults only 1 in 10 are consciously aware of this fact&lt;ref&gt;Australian bureau of statistics, 2013, ‘Dyslipidaemia’ Australian Health Survey: Biomedical Results for Chronic Diseases, 2011-12, viewed 22 September 2013, &lt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/DB595DB607116672CA257BBB0012186D?opendocument&lt;/ref&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;Heart foundation, 2013, Internet, viewed 22 September 2013 &lt;http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/news-media/Media-Releases-2013/Pages/australians-high-cholesterol-survey.aspx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== Causes of Dyslipidaemia&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, A 2008, ‘Dyslipidaemia (Hyperlipidaemia)’, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders, Viewed 24 September 2013,&lt;http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/endocrine_and_metabolic_disorders/lipid_disorders/dyslipidemia.html#v990115&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Gilman, ‘Drug Therapy for Hypercholesterolemia and Dyslipidemia’, Brunton, L ‘The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics’,.. 12, viewed 24 September 2013, http://www.accessmedicine.com.ezproxy1.canberra.edu.au/content.aspx?aID=16683537&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Dyslipidaemia is a condition that is caused by many different factors. In developed countries the most prevalent cause of Dyslipidaemia is the combination of sedentary lifestyle and excessive consumption of fatty foods. Genetic abnormalities (inherited), certain forms of medication and the presence of other diseases can also induce abnormal lipid concentrations in the blood, other lifestyle factors like obesity, smoking, and alcoholism are also common contributors.

'''The target Blood lipid concentrations for health are&lt;ref&gt;MedlinePlus, 2012, National institute of health, online, viewed 20/09/2013, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000403.htm &lt;/ref&gt;:'''
:*Triglycerides - Between 10-150 Mg/dL
:*Total cholesterol - Less than 200 Mg/dL
:*HDL - Between 40-60 Mg/dL
:*LDL - Between 10-150 Mg/dL
Blood lipid concentrations above or below these norms, if not managed can lead to developing serious health issues (diabetes, atherosclerosis, strokes, heart disease etc).

== Treatment/Intervention ==
There are two main methods of combating dyslipidaemia, one being '''exercise and lifestyle''', the other being the use of '''pharmaceutical drugs'''. The aim of these methods is to return the blood lipid concentration back to the recommended ranges. 
===  Pharmaceutical&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Gilman, ‘Drug Therapy for Hypercholesterolemia and Dyslipidemia’, Brunton, L ‘The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics’,.. 12, viewed 22 October 2013, http://www.accessmedicine.com.content.aspx?aID=16669469&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Drug intervention in combating dyslipidaemia provides patients with a proven and efficient method of lowering their blood lipid concentrations, drug therapy although expensive has been proven to lower blood LDL levels by about 30-40%. There are many different drugs on the market today for treating dyslipidaemia, below is a summary of the main classes of drugs currently in use:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Drug !! Function !! Adverse Effects 
|-
| '''Statins'''- (e.g atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin)   || Inhibit cholesterol production,thus ↓ blood LDL levels, ↓ triglycerides levels and also ↑ HDL activity  || [http://mdaustralia.org.au/files/2012/07/012_myopathies-2012.pdf Myopathy], insulin resistance,liver damage and digestive problems
|-
|'''Bile acids'''- (e.g cholestyramine and colestipol) || increase LDL uptake, thus ↓ blood LDL levels, adversely ↑ blood triglyceride levels  || Gastrointestinal irritation, constipation, Bloating and indigestion 
|-
| '''Nicotinic acid'''- (e.g Niacin) || Inhibit lipolysis, ↓ blood triglyceride levels, ↓ LDL levels and ↑ HDL levels  || [http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/h/hepatotoxicity/ Hepatotoxicity], flushing,skin rashes, indigestion, and rarer cases of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  
|-
| '''Fibric acid deriviatives'''- (e.g clofibrate, gemfibrozil and fenofibrate) ||  ↓ both blood triglyceride and LDL levels, also ↑ blood HDL levels (mechanism unclear) || Gastrointestinal irritation, rarer cases of rashes, fatigue, headaches, and muscle pain  
|-
| '''Ezetimibe'''- (e.g Zetia, Ezetol) || inhibit luminal uptake of cholesterol, ↓ LDL concentrations in the blood, ↓ blood triglycerride levels || allergic reactions (rare), skeletal abnormalities (with high doses)
|}
The drugs above are usually combined to greater affect, caution need to be taken when administrating these drugs to '''children, pregnant and (or) nursing mothers'''.

===  Exercise/Lifestyle &lt;ref&gt;K. Varady, P. Jones, 2005, ‘Combination diet and exercise interventions for the treatment of dyslipidemia: an effective preliminary strategy to lower cholesterol levels?’, vol. 185, no. 8, 1829-1885xx-xx, viewed 22/10/13, The journal of nutrition.&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Exercise in combination with lifestyle and diet intervention is considered the primary method of combating dyslipidaemia, for many individuals this approach has proven to be safer and much more effective in lowering blood cholesterol concentrations. Exercise and lifestyle modification target the following:
* Lowering total body fat (↓ triglyceride levels).
* Increase LDL utilization by muscles (↓ LDL levels).
* Increase HDL (good cholesterol) activity and decrease consumption of fats, sugars and syrups.
Exercise offers many positive benefits to lowering blood lipid concentrations, however it also poses many potential risks,in particularly for patients whose blood lipid concentrations are &gt; 250 (Mg/dL). In this case exercise may in fact be detrimental as it can induce potentially fatal conditions such as strokes or heart attacks.

== Recommendations/ further readings &lt;ref&gt;M. Carrington, S. Stewart, 2011, Australian cholesterol crossroads: an analysis of 199,331 GP patient records, CRE000484, Heart &amp; diabetes institute, viewed 22/10/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Lifestyle therapies that combine diet and exercise interventions are cheaper, safer and more effective in combating dyslipidaemia, for these reasons it is often the preferred method of intervention.

'''Diet'''- Aims is to reduce cholesterol levels, this can be done by:
* reducing consumption of animal fat, replace saturated fat with mono or poly saturated fat, reduce overall energy intake, increase the consumption of fruits, veges, plant Sterols and Stenols etc.
'''Exercise'''- Aims to burn excess triglyceride (loose weight), this is done by:
* A high amount of vigorous intensity (65%-80% of vo2 max) exercise on a regular basis (equivalent to 32km of jogging weekly), cutting out sedentary habits, method like walking to the shops, work, or school and general ↑ in physical activity&lt;ref&gt;Slentz CA, Duscha BD, Johnson JL, et al.

Arch Intern Med. 2004;164(1):31-39. doi:10.1001/archinte.164.1.31&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Dyslipidaemia patients should always consult a health care professional before commencing an exercise program'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Background ===

According to the World Health Organization and the Federation of Cardiology; myocarditis has been defined as an inflammatory disease of the heart muscle. &lt;ref name=&quot;Kindermann&quot;&gt;Kindermann, I., Barth, C., Mahfoud, F., Ukena, C., Lenski, M.,  Yilmaz, A., Klingel, K., Kandolf, R., Sechtem, U., Cooper, L. and Böhm, M. (2012). Update on myocarditis: Journal of American College of Cardiology Foundation, 59(9), 779-792.&lt;/ref&gt; Myocarditis can detrimentally affect those in good health; post mortal data has shown that myocarditis has been the cause of sudden death in young adults at rates as high as 12%&lt;ref name=&quot;Kindermann&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnani&quot;&gt;Magnani, J. and Dec, W.

Myocarditis: Current Trends in Diagnosis and Treatment: Circulation Journal of the American Heart Association. 113, 876-890.&lt;/ref&gt; and can also lead to permanent heart damage and dysfunction. 
{{BookCat}}

===Aetiology===

There have been numerous causes documented for the onset of myocarditis. There are three main causes and they have been categorised into the following:

*Viral- Accounts for about half of the cases of diagnosed myocarditis. Coxsackie virus being the most common, accounting for over  50% of the cases of viral myocarditis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;Martin, A., Webber, S., Fricker, J., Jaffle, R., Demmler, G., Kearney, D., Zhang, Y., Bodurtha, J., Gelb, B., Ni, J., Bricker, T. and Towbin, J. (1994). Acute Myocarditis. Rapid Diagnosis by PRC in Children: Circulation Journal of the American Heart Association. 90, 330-339.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Fungal- An increasing cause to myocarditis, the major fungal pathogen being Aspergillus fumigatus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calabrese&quot;&gt;Calabrese, F., Thiene, G. (2003) yocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy: microbiological and molecular biological aspects: Cardiovascular Research 60, 11–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Bacterial- Any form bacteria may cause myocarditis with the most common pathogens being meningococcus, streptococcus and Listeria&lt;ref name=&quot;Blauwt&quot;&gt;Blauwet, L., Cooper, L. (2010) Myocarditis: Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases. 52, 274-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes include pregnancy, toxins, drug reactions, autoimmune diseases, giant cell myocarditis and sarcoidosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blauwt&quot; /&gt;

===Signs and Symptoms===

Symptoms of acute myocarditis vary, and depend on the severity of the condition. In most cases, the signs and symptoms mimic those of heart failure or a heart attack; such as chest pain, nausea and arrhythmia of heart beats. As most cases present as a viral infection the immune system is suppressed and symptoms may present as a fever, cold/flu like symptoms, myalgia and headaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodruff&quot;&gt;Woodruff, J. (1980). Viral Myocarditis: American Journal of Pathology. 101(2), 428-465.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these common and varied signs and symptoms, myocarditis is often difficult to identify and is often misdiagnosed.

===Diagnosis===

Myocarditis is often difficult to identify and is often misdiagnosed given the broad range of symptoms and degree to which it affects each individual case. The following ways are used to diagnose myocarditis:&lt;ref name=&quot;Blauwt&quot; /&gt;

*Electrocardiogram- Identifies nonspecific T-wave changes.
*Chest X-ray- Identifies chamber dilatation and/or pericardial effusion.
*Laboratory- In most cases blood tests are performed and blood troponin levels are monitored.
*Echocardiography- Monitoring heart function and size.
*Cardiac MRI- Checking for 3 types of cardiac tissue injury; intracellular and interstitial edema, capillary leakage, and necrosis and fibrosis.
*Endomyocardial biopsy- Examination of the cardiac tissue for any signs of myocarditis.

===Treatment===

Treatment of myocarditis differs between cases, and depends on the severity of each condition. Depending on the type myocarditis diagnosed dictates which treatment options are issued, however treatment options for each case are very similar. There is a very strong emphasis on pharmacotherapy in the treatment of myocarditis, with beta-blockers, diuretics, anti-inflammatory, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin-II receptor blockers often prescribed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kindermann&quot; /&gt;  Withdrawal of physical activity and strenuous activities in the acute stage is also prescribed and once left ventricle function has improved a gradual increase of activity is recommended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schultheiss&quot;&gt;Schultheiss, HP., Kuhl, U. and Cooper, L. (2011). The management of myocarditis: European Heart Journal. 30, 2616–2625&lt;/ref&gt; Diet and other lifestyle factors that have shown to improve cardiac function is also recommended in not only treating myocarditis, but also preventing it.

===Physical Activity and Myocarditis===

During acute myocarditis, all aerobic exercise should be avoided as it has been shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blauwt&quot; /&gt; Athletes that show evidence of myocarditis are to be withdrawn from competition and training for 6 months, and they may commence training again when all ventricle function has returned to normal and when they show no signs of arrhythmia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kindermann&quot; /&gt; Numerous studies have shown exercise to have various effects on the immune system and the body’s ability to defend itself against viruses. Exercise at moderate intensities is encouraged as it is thought to release certain stress hormones which play a role in immune-enhancing and anti-inflammatory effects which assist the immune cells in fighting viral infections.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, S.A.,  Pence, B.D. and Woods, J.A. (2009). Exercise and Respiratory Tract Viral Infections: Exerc Sport Sci Rev. 4, 157-164&lt;/ref&gt; However exercise at high intensities is not so beneficial. The effect of Coxsackie virus has been shown to be enhanced by strenuous exercise; with research showing that exercise increases the risk of mortality by 45% with those infected with Coxsackie virus.&lt;ref&gt;9.	Tomasi, T., Trudeau, F., Czerwinski, D. and Erredge S. 1981. Immune parameters in athletes before and after strenuous exercise: Journal of Clinical Immunology. 2, 173-178.&lt;/ref&gt; With this evidence shown, exercise at moderate intensity is highly recommended once the heart muscle has recovered as it will assist in further preventing infection causing myocarditis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Periodic_table.svg|thumb|450px|Periodic Table of the Elements]]&lt;big&gt;'''Inorganic chemistry'''&lt;/big&gt; is the study of the synthesis, reactions, structures and properties of compounds of the elements.  This subject is usually taught after students are introduced to organic chemistry, which concerns the synthesis and reactions of compounds of carbon (typically containing C-H bonds).  Inorganic chemistry encompasses the compounds - both molecular and extended solids - of everything else in the [http://www.webelements.com periodic table], and overlaps with organic chemistry in the area of organometallic chemistry, in which metals are bonded to carbon-contaning ligands and molecules.  Inorganic chemistry is fundamental to many practical technologies including catalysis and materials (structural, electronic, magnetic,...), energy conversion and storage, and electronics.  Inorganic compounds are also found in biological systems where they are essential to life processes.


This textbook (in its initial form) is intended for use in a first semester course in inorganic chemistry, covering the basic concepts in structure, bonding, and properties that underlie the field.  The objective of this book is for students to understand how to use valence bond theory, crystal field theory, and molecular orbital theory to describe bonding in inorganic compounds, learn periodic trends in redox and acid-base equilibria, and learn the structures of solid elements and simple compounds. Building on this knowledge we will develop a conceptual framework for understanding the stability and the electronic, magnetic, electrochemical, and mechanical properties of inorganic solids. We will also connect the chemistry of inorganic materials to some of their current and emerging applications, especially in the realm of nanoscale chemistry. By the end of the book the diligent student should know many of the elements in the periodic table as good friends, and the others at least as nodding acquaintances.  

We hope to add second-semester topics, including group theory, spectroscopy, organometallic chemistry, and bioinorganic chemistry, in future editions of this book.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Boyle's Law states that the volume and pressure are inversely proportional. This means that as the volume of gas in a container decreases, the pressure increases. To test Boyle's Law a syringe was attached to a pressure meter and weights were added to the plunger to show the relationship between the volume and pressure inside the syringe. Below is a table of values showing the results of the experiment. In the table to work done is calculated based on the difiniton of work, W=mgΔx, and work derived from the ideal gas law, &lt;math&gt;W=Nk_{b}Tln(\frac{V_i}{V_f})&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mass (kg)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;W=mgΔx&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Pressure (Pa)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Volume (&lt;math&gt;m^{3}&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;W=Nk_{b}Tln(\frac{V_i}{V_f})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Distance (m)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.0209*10^{5}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;5.0000*10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.3000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0265&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.2280*10^{5}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;4.0000*10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.1139&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0090&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.8000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0706&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.6130*10^{5}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;3.0000*10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.1468&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0180&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.5000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.1323&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;2.2387*10^{5}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;2.0000*10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.2070&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0270&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Below is a graph showing the relationship between the pressure and volume inside the syringe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Summary =
The Gateway Corridor Commission was established in 2009 and proposed an initiative to address the transit issue between west-central Wisconsin and the downtown areas of St. Paul and Minneapolis Minnesota. The commission is composed of local elected officials and community leaders who are working with residents, businesses and travelers to provide new transit options. The proposed [http://www.thegatewaycorridor.com/documents/GC-website-map.pdf route] of a bus rapid transit ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit BRT]) or light rail transit ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_rail LRT]) system briefly show what the eastern metro and west Wisconsin could see in the near future.  The goals associated with this project are increased mobility, provide a cost effective, economically viable transit option, support economic development, protect the natural environment feature of the corridor, preserve and protect individual community quality of life and improve safety&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives Analysis Report, (2013), ES-4.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Definition'''

Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a flexible, rubber-tired rapid transit mode that combines stations, vehicles, services, running way, and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) elements into an integrated system with a strong positive image and identity. BRT applications are designed to be appropriate to the market they serve and their physical surroundings and can be incrementally implemented in a variety of environments. In brief, BRT is a permanently integrated system of facilities, services, and amenities that collectively improve the speed, reliability, and identity of bus transit. In many respects, BRT is rubber-tired light rail transit (LRT), but with greater operating flexibility and potentially lower capital and operating costs&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Herbert S. (2002) Bus Rapid Transit: An Overview. Journal of Public Transportation, 5, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''History'''

BRT, as an idea has existed since the 1930s, and has been proposed for numerous settings throughout the U.S. and the world&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Herbert S. (2002) Bus Rapid Transit: An Overview. Journal of Public Transportation, 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the U.S. the first BRT system was proposed for Chicago in 1937. The plan recommended adapting existing rail rapid transit systems for use as an express bus operation with downtown distribution points&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Herbert S. (2002) Bus Rapid Transit: An Overview. Journal of Public Transportation, 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;. Several plans followed, including Washington D.C., St. Louis, Missouri, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Herbert S. (2002) Bus Rapid Transit: An Overview. Journal of Public Transportation, 5, 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;. Recently, BRT has expanded rapidly. In 2005 between 50 and 75 communities across the nation had a BRT project in development stages or deployed. In fact, nearly every transit project seeking federal funding includes a BRT alternative&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Robert A. (Ed.) (2012) Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology. 1812&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Definition &amp; History'''

The emergence of light rail transit was based on objectives including reducing car use, congestion and negative environmental externality. At the same time, based on transit-oriented urban planning theory and practice, most of light rail systems are expected to stimulate development along LRT corridors &lt;ref&gt;Hensher, David A., and April J. Reyes. &quot;Trip chaining as a barrier to the propensity to use public transport.&quot; Transportation 27.4 (2000): 341-361.&lt;/ref&gt;. The term of “Light Rail Transit” was used in early 1970 in the United States, but it wasn't formally defined by Transit Research Board until 1989. According to Urban Public Transportation Glossary: “A metropolitan electric railway system characterized by its ability to operate single cars or short trains along exclusive rights-of-way at ground level, on aerial structures, in subways, or occasionally, in streets and to board and discharge passengers at track or car floor level.” The modern light rail transit network integrates transit priority traffic signals and a connection of more than one light rail vehicle which generally run in a dedicated rail lane alongside auto lanes or bike lanes. In 1978, the first LRT in North America was built in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In 1981, San Diego adopted LRT as an American LRT pioneer. Some scholars contend light rail transit was introduced to previously all-bus cities to approach the same service provided by rapid transit at an affordable cost. Some famous LRT practices include those in Portland, Oregon; Calgary, Alberta; San Francisco, California; Houston, Texas and Charlotte, North Carolina. Many Scholars agree that light rail transit system is central backbone of integrating regional transit network. However, some someone argues that although light rail transit was viewed as a solution to great expense of heavy rail, there was no successful practice of LRT on the criteria like reducing car use, which raised doubts of variability of LRT.

'''Bases of Comparison'''

As referred above, the early emergence of LRT was driven by objectives including reducing cars, road congestion and environmental externality. In order to satisfy these objectives, in this case study, comparative analysis of LRT and BRT will be conducted based off criterions including: Cost of alternatives, effectiveness of attractive (patronage from car users) and impact on land-use and stimulation of environmental protection.

== Annotated List of Actors ==

* '''United States Department of Transportation''': If the Gateway Corridor project is approved, the US-DOT will match all local funding for the project. This funding is contingent on the Gateway Corridor meeting all of the US-DOT regulatory requirements. 

* '''Federal Transit Authority''': The Gateway Corridor project must meet the FTA's requirements in order to get approval. This involves creating a DEIS and conducting a study that examines the effects of the project on at-risk populations. 

* '''Minnesota Department of Transportation''': The primary managing body for the section of the corridor operating in Minnesota, working in close conjunction with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.

* '''Wisconsin Department of Transportation''': The primary managing body for the Wisconsin section of the corridor, working in conjunction with the Minnesota Department of Transportation.

* '''Metropolitan Council''': The Twin-Cities regional planning and management body that has a say in almost any public transportation project being planned in the Twin-Cities metropolitan area.

* '''Cities of St. Paul, Maplewood, Woodbury, Lake Elmo, Afton, Oakdale, Lakeland, and West Lake Township''': The Gateway Corridor, regardless of what mode is chosen, will likely start at Union Depot in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota and will be located, at some point, in all of the aforementioned cities. These cities will have a certain level of authority and regulatory say-so in regards to the project. Many of these these already have pre-existing retail and commercial centers that, if developed further, could bring in more tax revenue for these cities. Any further TOD in these municipalities could also bring an increase in population and larger tax revenues.

* '''Ramsey &amp; Washington Counties''': Have some jurisdiction based on the GCP being within its borders. Could benefit from TOD.

* '''Major business and commercial centers''': 3M, Metro State University, Union Depot, Sunray shopping center. All of these businesses could benefit from an adjacent transit line. In the case of large employers such as 3M and Metro State a larger pool of talent could be attracted because of its increased accessibility. In the case of retail centers, they could see further development and an increased level of economic activity.

* '''Nearby Residents''': Depending on the person's perspective and situation the corridor could be viewed as a positive or a negative presence.

== Timeline of Major Events==
* '''August 2010''': The Gateway Corridor Commission initiates a transit alternatives analysis (AA) to examine the corridor following I-94 from Minneapolis to western Wisconsin. The purpose of this study was to determine the best mode of transport (BRT, LRT, or commuter rail) and the estimated ridership, environmental impacts, costs, routes, and stops.

* '''Fall 2011''': The GCC approves 8 transit alternatives based on recommendations from the technical and Policy Advisory Committees. The first two of these being required by the FTA:

#  No Build
#  Transportation Systems Management
#  BRT from Minneapolis to Hudson, WI via I-94 and Hudson Rd
#  BRT from Minneapolis to Hudson, WI via E. 7th St, White Bear Ave, and Hudson Rd
#  LRT from St. Paul to Hudson, WI via I-94 and Hudson Rd
#  LRT from St. Paul to Hudson, WI via E. 7th St, White Bear Ave, and Hudson Rd
#  Commuter rail from Minneapolis to Eau Claire, WI
#  BRT managed lane from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Wisconsin

* '''March 2012''': Commuter rail alternative is dismissed

* '''October 2012''': Ranking of alternatives after optimizing chosen routes. This involved making alterations to the chosen alternatives in consideration of property damage, ridership, and economic development opportunities. Alternatives 3 and 5 are chosen to be carried forward for further evaluation. 

* '''January 2013''': AA is completed and approved by GCC 

* '''May 2013''': research for Draft Environmental Impact Statement begins

* '''Late 2013''': Select final alternative for Gateway Corridor

* '''2013-2014''': Continue environmental impact assessment based on the chosen preferred alternative

'''Alternatives'''

Some alternatives, like bus-based transit ways for bus rapid transit are always used to be compared to light rail. The flexibility of bus-based way was viewed advantage compared to permanence of light rail. It is more convenient for bus-based ways to convert right of way back to cars or trucks. Common features of LRT in the United States include:
* Infrastructure/running way: LRT has dedicated running way and reserved right of way operation on ballasted or embedded track.  Articulated reversible LRV is around 90 ft in length
* Vehicles: Low-floor vehicles with multiple doors and doorway floors at the same level as station platforms
* Intelligent Transportation System: Traffic signal priority and other traffic management techniques to minimize delay and service unpredictability
* Service/operating plans: Overhead lines supply electricity to the vast majority of light rail systems

''The following table compares the capital costs for selected BRT and LRT projects.''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Project Type !! # of Facilities !! Cost Range(Capital Cost/mile [USD]) !! Avg. Capital Cost/mile [USD]
|-
| Busways || 9 || $7.0 mil - $55 mil || $13.5 mil
|-
| HOV Lanes || 8 || $1.8 mil - $37.6 mil || $9.0 mil
|-
| Arterial Streets || 3 || $200,000 - $9.6 mil || $680,000
|-
| Light Rail || 18 || $12.4 mil - $118.8 mil || $34.8 mil
|}

* Based on the second criterion: attractive patronage, there are some empirical comparisons of existing USA BRT and LRT. The Liverpool-Parramatta Transitway (LPT) has indicated that the bus systems are more capable to deliver higher levels of frequency with lower incidence of transfers compared to LRT, since LRT needs to use feeder bus to connect trips. And mode choice research implicates that transfers can result high level of dissatisfaction. But satisfaction is the main factor contributed to mode choice utility.

'''Transit Oriented Development in the Gateway Corridor'''

The Gateway Corridor overlays Interstate 94 and U.S. Highway 12 from the St. Croix River Bridge to Saint Paul. The Gateway Corridor is the only corridor in the Twin Cities metropolitan area that connects urban, suburban and rural communities across two states as seen in the [http://www.thegatewaycorridor.com/documents/GC-website-map.pdf figure]. There are following key concerns during LRT-TOD procedure:
:1. Potential ridership
:2. FTA’s cost-effectiveness index
:3. Environmental and sustainability
:4. Stakeholder Supporting Network

'''Urban Planning'''

The first wave of LRT systems was justified largely on conventional measures – ridership, efficiency, and energy savings. However, LRT as a rapid transit strategy in urban area can definitely influence urban growth, land use, intensification and revitalization significantly.  Cervero contends significant impacts and stimulated economic benefits only occur when a system is planned with policies and complementary land-use s strategies in place (Cervero 1984).  Lots of scholars focus on interaction between land-use and transits and define the development mode as transit-oriented development. The best practice includes LRT-TODs in Eastside Village, Plano, TX and in Central Park Commons, Denver. Thus, when analyze alternatives as transportation improvement, broader community and urban context should be considered besides ridership, efficiency and energy savings.

== BRT ==

'''Existing Systems'''

Nearly 160 BRT systems exist throughout the world. These systems serve nearly 30 million riders on a daily basis&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brtdata.org&lt;/ref&gt;. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransMilenio TransMilenio] system in Bogota, Colombia serves upwards of 198,163 during peak hours in September 2012&lt;ref&gt;Transmilenio Sa (2013) Transportation Company of the Third Millennium SA, City Hall Mayor of Bogota, Colombia. http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/WebSite/Contenido.aspx?ID=TransmilenioSA_TransmilenioEnCifras_EstadisticasGenerales. Accessed Sept. 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;. Several North American cities have developed BRT systems frequently recognized for their success and unique features&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Levinson, Herbert S., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;. These cities include Ottawa, Canada; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; Boston, Massachusetts; and Los Angeles, California. While the ridership of these systems do not compare to Bogota’s TransMilenio, the systems are nonetheless viable, and vital to each urban center’s transportation plans. This [http://thecityfix.com/files/2013/05/BRT-and-busway-systems-in-the-world.jpg figure]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brtdata.org/&lt;/ref&gt; provides a global view of the use of BRT and busway systems.

[[File:Bus Stops 3 curitiba brasil.jpg|thumbnail|Curitiba Bus Rapid Transit, showing unique tube-shaped stations and 28m bi-articulated buses.]]

However, the world’s first and possibly most famous example, of BRT is Curitiba, Brazil’s [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rede_Integrada_de_Transporte Rede Integrada de Transporte]. The city of Curitiba carefully integrated its BRT system into its development plan and adjacent development. The system is characterized by a dedicated, median running way with adjacent street services, off-vehicle far collection, bi-articulated buses, and unique tube shaped stations. The tube stations also provide an elevated, level surface for which boarding the buses is made easier.

== Components ==
A Bus Rapid Transit system has several components. Various packages of different vehicles, stations, services, and systems are available to match the needs of cities developing a BRT system. Each system component has various advantages, and disadvantages associated with its use. Thus careful consideration of the objectives and constraints of proposed systems is necessary prior to deployment.

'''Running ways'''
* These are ideally dedicated (bus only), paths for BRT vehicles to operate along, separated from other traffic. Combinations of dedicated, HOV, shoulder (curb) lanes, or tunnels can be used to integrate running ways into existing infrastructure, thereby minimizing costs&lt;ref&gt;Transit Cooperative Research Program (2007) TCRP Report 118: Bus Rapid Transit Practioner’s Guide, 1-2 [hereinafter, TCRP (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;. Grade separation is also possible with BRT systems&lt;ref&gt;Federal Transit Authority (2004) Characteristics of Bus Rapid Transit for Decision Making. 2-1 [hereinafter FTA (2004)].&lt;/ref&gt;. Running ways can also be guided, such that the bus is mechanically guided along a track, either on a rail-like system or using optical guidance.

'''Stations'''
* Stations are often considered the most important aspect of a BRT system as they impact “accessibility, reliability, comfort, safety, and security, as well as dwell times, and system image.”&lt;ref&gt;Federal Transit Authority (2004) Characteristics of Bus Rapid Transit for Decision Making. 2-1 [hereinafter FTA (2004)].&lt;/ref&gt; They can range from simple stops with well-lit shelters to complex facilities with extensive amenities and features (such as those found at many rail stations)&lt;ref&gt;TCRP (2007), 4-45&lt;/ref&gt;. Stations can be at curb level, or level with the vehicles floor. Safe pedestrian and auto access to the station is also a critical concern.

'''Vehicles'''
* Vehicle choice is rife with options. Either standard or specialized buses can be chosen; several manufacturers currently supply or are developing vehicles specifically designed for BRT applications&lt;ref&gt;Levinson (2002), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;. Other options include size, propulsion system, design, internal configuration, and be controlled electronically, manually, or mechanically&lt;ref&gt;FTA (2004), 2-1.&lt;/ref&gt;. Vehicles should provide sufficient capacity, to meet ridership demand, be easy to board and light from, meet and/or exceed environmental regulations, and have strong passenger appeal&lt;ref&gt;TCRP (2007), 4-60 to 4-61.&lt;/ref&gt;. Common choices include articulated or bi-articulated buses.

'''Fare Collection'''
* Fare collection systems can be electronic, mechanical, or manual. The crucial planning objective is for efficient, multiple door boarding, during peak-demand services. Fare collection must consider collection process (to reduce dwell time), fare media (i.e. cards or cash), and fare structure (flat or differentiated).

'''Service Plans'''
* BRT service needs to be frequent, direct, easy-to- understand, comfortable, reliable, operationally efficient, and above all, rapid. The flexibility of BRT elements and systems leads to significant flexibility in designing a service plan to respond to the customer base it will serve and the physical and environmental surroundings in which it will operate. Important considerations include route length, simple or complex route structures, the times of day the service is available, how frequently service occurs, and the distance between stations.

== Capital and Operating Cost ==
'''Total Costs'''
* A dedicated BRT system along the I-94 Gateway Corridor is estimated to cost a total of $420 million for 11.5 miles. A BRT system running along managed lanes for 14.4 miles is estimated to cost $590 million&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Council, Gateway Corridor Alternatives. http://thegatewaycorridor.com/documents/2012/Key_%20Differentiators.pdf Accessed September 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Component Costs'''
* '''Running Ways'''
:Little to no money is necessary if BRT vehicles use existing roads, and operate in the regular flow of traffic. The more exclusive the running way, the more expensive it becomes. Mixed flow lanes with queue jumping lanes for buses range from $0.1 to $0.29 million per mile plus the right of way acquisition costs. A more likely scenario for the Gateway corridor is either At-grade transitway, or fully grade-separated, exclusive transitways which range from $2.5 to $10.2 million per additional lane mile&lt;ref&gt;FTA (2004) 2-4 to 2-5.&lt;/ref&gt;. Signage and lateral guidance mechanism add substantial costs per mile and per vehicle.

* '''Stations'''
''The following table includes station types, amenities and costs.''&lt;ref&gt;FTA (2004) 2-15 to 2-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Station Type: !! '''Basic Stop''' !! '''Enhanced Stop''' !! '''Designated Station''' !! '''Intermodal Terminal/Transit Station'''
|-
| '''Amenities'''|| Minimal shelter || Shelter, benches and trash cans|| Toilets, ITS, shelter, retail/restaurants, and level boarding|| Level boarding full range of amenities, passenger information, and transfer to other modes 
|-
| '''Cost per station''' || $15,000-$20,000 || $25,000 to $30,000 || $150,000 to $2.5 million|| $5 to $20 million
|}
:Other important considerations for station which impact cost are platform heights and layouts, fare collection, passing capability, and pedestrian and vehicle access to the station.

* '''Vehicles'''
:A wide range of vehicles types, propulsion systems, and guidance mechanisms are available. Prices range from $300,000 for a conventional diesel bus, $500,000 for conventional articulated buses, up to $1.6 million for specialized, stylized, articulated BRT vehicles. Propulsion systems can add from about $40,000 for CNG, to over $400,000 for dual mode trolley buses&lt;ref&gt;FTA (2004) 2-27 to 2-32.&lt;/ref&gt;.

* '''Fare Collection'''
:Costs involved with fare collection range from low to moderate for on-board fare collection, to barrier enforced payment system (ticket vending machine and turnstyle) which cost between $50,000 to $95,000 per machine and must include hardware and software costs. Barrier Free (self service) systems, like those on the Hiawatha Blue line are cheaper ($30,000 to $60,000 per machine) but also require roving personnel to verify payment. Cash only systems range from $2,000 to $5,000, while “smart card” systems often cost more than $12,000 per validating machine and at least $10,000 per garage in software&lt;ref&gt;FTA (2004) 2-38 to 2-42.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Potential Benefits and Drawbacks ==
'''Economic Development'''
* Several scholars have concluded that BRT has a substantial and measurable impact on the economic situation of the areas in which it is built. For instance, the economic impact of the BRT system in Seoul, South Korea has been thoroughly studied. Land prices increased by roughly ten percent, while retail stores improved by 25 percent&lt;ref&gt;Cervero, Robert and Kang, Chang Deok (2011). Bus rapid transit impacts on land uses and land values in Seoul, Korea. Transportation Policy. 18, 102-116.&lt;/ref&gt;. Other studies reveal increases in residential and employment densities within certain distances of BRT stations&lt;ref&gt;Jin, Myung-Jin (2012). Redistributive effects of bus rapid transit (BRT) on development patterns and property values in Seoul, Korea. Transport Policy. 19, 85-92; Kang, Chang Deok (2010). The impact of Bus Rapid Transit on location choice of creative industries and employment density in Seoul, Korea. International Journal of Urban Studies. 14, 123-51.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Gateway Corridor Alternatives Analysis found BRT had the highest potential for positive economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Council, Gateway Corridor Alternatives Analysis. http://www.thegatewaycorridor.com/documents/2013/Gateway_Final_AA_Report.pdf. Accessed September 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ridership'''
* The Alternatives Analysis estimates that a BRT option would have an average daily ridership of 8,800-9,300, compared to a LRT ridership of 9,300. Nearly 150,000 vehicles enter St. Paul each day. A ridership of 8,800 might seem small, but reducing the number of vehicles by a proportional amount is a significant improvements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Collary 1.6, as stated (Any polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into linear and irreducible quadratic polynomials. That factorization is unique; any two factorizations have the same powers of the same factors.), is technically incorrect.  For one thing, it doesn't apply to polynomials of degree 0.  For another, a polynomial ABC, where A and B are linear polynomials and C is a constant, can be factored as either (AC)(B) or as (A)(BC).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Brief Background===
Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) or Syndrome X affects up to 1 in 3 Australians&lt;ref name=&quot;Janus&quot;/&gt;, being an interrelation of many distinct metabolic irregularities, especially the associated increase in Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Janus&quot;&gt;Janus, E. D., Laatikainen, T., Dunbar, J. A., Kilkkinen, A., Bunker, S. J., Philpot, B., Heistaro, S. (2007). Overweight, obesity and metabolic syndrome in rural southeastern Australia. Medical Journal of Australia, 187(3), 147.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are a number of interventions/treatments, with exercise interventions reducing prevalence and negative outcomes. 
==== Prevalence ====
Australian prevalence (hard to define due to it’s varying symptoms and definitions) is ~ 29-33% &lt;ref name=&quot;Janus&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Tanamas&quot;&gt;Tanamas, S., Magliano, D. J., Lynch, B., Sethi, P., Willenberg, L., Polkinghorne, K., Shaw, J. (2013). The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab 2012) Melbourne: Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute. &lt;/ref&gt;, however numerous sources show increases in the prevalence of the overweight and obese (64.1% of women, 74.1% of men&lt;ref name=&quot;Janus&quot;/&gt;)  and an increase in the diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes.  This translates directly into a high (increasing) prevalence of MetS, greater in men than women, steadily increasing from the age of 25, and progressively increasing as waist circumference increases &lt;ref name=&quot;Tanamas&quot;/&gt;.

==== Causes and Symptoms ====
The disease state is also known as Insulin Resistance Syndrome, Metabolic Syndrome X, or simply Syndrome X due to the interrelation of the many key physiological factors, which can be seen in the following table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}
==== Focus of Intervention/Treatment ====
The primary focus for the treatment/prevention of MetS is manipulation of lifestyle &lt;ref name=&quot;Agnostis&quot;&gt;Anagnostis, P., Athyros, V. G., Tziomalos, K., Karagiannis, A., &amp; Mikhailidis, D. P. (2009). The pathogenetic role of cortisol in the metabolic syndrome: a hypothesis. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, 94(8), 2692-2701. &lt;/ref&gt; (such as a change in diet, weight loss, quitting smoking, reduction in stress levels, pharmaceutical use and potentially surgery) and exercise levels; the primary concentration being treatment of obesity (due to the high correlation/direct relationship MetS has to central/visceral obesity) &lt;ref name=&quot;ACSM&quot;&gt;Brandon, J. B. (2013).  ACSM Factsheet: Lifestyle and Paediatric Metabolic Syndrome .http://www.acsm.org/docs/current-comments/metabolicsyndrometemp.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;, seconded by improvement of Insulin resistance.

=== Current Methods===
==== Exercise====
Up to 20% of Australians are classed as physically inactive, or insufficiently active (36%&lt;ref name=&quot;ABS&quot;&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2011). Sports and Physical Recreation: A Statistical Overview. (4156.0). Canberra, Australia: Australian Government. &lt;/ref&gt;) and low aerobic exercise capacity appears to be the strongest predictor of mortality from MetS &lt;ref name=&quot;Tjonna&quot;&gt;Tjønna, A. E., Lee, S. J., Rognmo, Ø., Stølen, T. O., Bye, A., Haram, P. M.,  Wisløff, U. (2008). Aerobic Interval Training Versus Continuous Moderate Exercise as a Treatment for the Metabolic Syndrome: A Pilot Study. In (pp. 346-354) doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.772822. Retrieved from http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/118/4/346.abstract &lt;/ref&gt;. Regular exercise leading to weight loss is key for positively altering insulin resistance, and glucose response &lt;ref name=&quot;Ross R&quot;&gt;Ross, R., Dagnone, D., Jones, P. J., Smith, H., Paddags, A., Hudson, R., &amp; Janssen, I. (2000). Reduction in obesity and related comorbid conditions after diet-induced weight loss or exercise-induced weight loss in men.

===== Aerobic Exercise =====
Aerobic exercise is optimal, due to its high correlation to a reduction in abdominal (or visceral) adiposity &lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;/&gt;, and as aerobic physiological adaptations are highly beneficial specifically:
&lt;div style=&quot;column-count:2;-moz-column-count:2;-webkit-column-count:2&quot;&gt;
* As an anti-inflammatory reducing metabolic stress&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleeson&quot;&gt;Gleeson, M., Bishop, N. C., Stensel, D. J., Lindley, M. R., Mastana, S. S., &amp; Nimmo, M. A. (2011). The anti-inflammatory effects of exercise: mechanisms and implications for the prevention and treatment of disease. Nature Reviews Immunology, 11(9), 607-615. &lt;/ref&gt;.
*↓ In inflammatory cytokines (CRP, TNF-α, Adhesion molecules etc) via reductions in visceral fat/initiation of anti-inflammatory environment &lt;ref name=&quot;Ross R&quot;/&gt;.
*↓ Blood pressure (as much as 11mmHg systolic, 9mmHg Diastolic &lt;ref name=&quot;ACSM&quot;/&gt;)
*↓ Cardiovascular disease risk. 
*↓ Blood Glucose levels
*↓ Psychosocial stress
*↓ Plasma triglycerides &lt;ref name=&quot;Goodpaster&quot;/&gt;
*↓ Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) &lt;ref name=&quot;Cornier&quot;/&gt;
*↑ Insulin sensitivity in muscle cells &lt;ref name=&quot;ACSM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;Lee, S., Bacha, F., Hannon, T., Kuk, J. L., Boesch, C., &amp; Arslanian, S. (2012). Effects of Aerobic Versus Resistance Exercise Without Caloric Restriction on Abdominal Fat, Intrahepatic Lipid, and Insulin Sensitivity in Obese Adolescent Boys: A Randomized, Controlled Trial. Diabetes, 61(11), 2787-2795. doi: 10.2337/db12-0214 Retrieved from http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/61/11/2787.abstract&lt;/ref&gt; 
*↑ High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (↓LDL)
*↑ Release of Adrenalin and Cortisol and ↓ in Pro-inflammatory monocytes &lt;ref name=&quot;Gleeson&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Type of aerobic activity varies, American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) &lt;ref name=&quot;ACSM&quot;/&gt; suggesting that sessions of continuous sub-maximal activity are best for controlling MetS, but other sources &lt;ref name=&quot;ACSM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornier&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Stensvold&quot;&gt;Stensvold, D., Tjønna, A. E., Skaug, E., Aspenes, S., Stølen, T., Wisløff, U., &amp; Slørdahl, S. A. (2010). Strength training versus aerobic interval training to modify risk factors of metabolic syndrome. Journal of Applied Physiology, 108(4), 804-810. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Escalante&quot;&gt;Escalante, Y., Saavedra, J. M., García-Hermoso, A., &amp; Domínguez, A. M. (2012). Improvement of the lipid profile with exercise in obese children: A systematic review. Preventive Medicine, 54(5), 293-301. doi: http://dx.doi.org.ezproxy1.canberra.edu.au/10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.02.006 &lt;/ref&gt; show that greater response is seen when a frequent change in intensity was introduced i.e. ''aerobic interval training''. 

===== Resistance Exercise =====
Abundant new evidence recommends resistance training should also be considered due to:
*Primarily it's impact on skeletal muscle (and it’s role in the metabolism of triglycerides and glucose) &lt;ref name=&quot;Strasser&quot;&gt;Strasser, B., Siebert, U., &amp; Schobersberger, W. (2010). Resistance training in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome. Sports Medicine, 40(5), 397-415. &lt;/ref&gt;
* general ↓ in fat mass,
*↓ in Systolic blood pressure,
*Improvement in glycaemic control,
*↑ Insulin sensitivity (same mechanism as aerobic exercise)&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornier&quot;/&gt;.
Resistance training has much less of an effect on total cholesterol levels, HDL, LDL, triglyceride levels, and Diastolic BP. Increases in muscular strength may be imperative in the conservation of lean body mass (particular in the elderly) increasing the general activity level &lt;ref name=&quot;Stensvold&quot;/&gt;, and adding variety to exercise programs (facilitating adherence)&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, M.A., Haskell, W.L., Ades, P. A., Amsterdam, E. A., Bittner, V., Franklin, B.A., Stewart, K. J. (2007). Resistance exercise in individuals with and without cardiovascular disease: 2007 update, a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Council on Clinical Cardiology and Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism. Circulation, 116(5), 572-584. &lt;/ref&gt;.

====Recommendations====
All programs should be tailored to individual needs and capabilities, based on age, fitness level, and any considerable risk factors; see the following [[#Precautions and Further Resources]].
Program for continued, consistent '''energy expenditure'''. Whilst weight loss/&lt;adiposity seems to be greater when observing aerobic capacity the positives of resistance training must be considered thus a combination may be best.
Select a mode of exercise that:
*Uses large muscles/muscle groups (vary between upper and lower body modalities).
*Varies between non-weight bearing and weight bearing activities
*Can be graded to overload the cardio-respiratory system. 

'''Frequency''': 2 or more days per week (1-2 sets of 8-12 reps, with an intensity  &gt;60% of an individuals 1RM with 8-10 exercises per session). Aerobic exercise above 180 min/week has a “dose-response” effect i.e. '''↑''' Frequency = '''↑''' Physiological response. &lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;/&gt; Resistance training is less dose-dependent and '''↑''' Frequency will not necessarily '''↑''' response &lt;ref name=&quot;Strasser&quot;/&gt;. Three sessions ≥60min/week with an intensity ≥75% maximum heart rate yields best results for aerobic exercise. &lt;ref name=&quot;Escalante&quot;/&gt;

Exercise should be predominantly aerobic based to maximise CV adaptations with additional resistance-training components for strength and functional capacity development. Ideally a combination of strength and aerobic, especially aerobic interspersed with regular increases to high intensity (interval training) for a minimum of 12 weeks.

=== Precautions and Further Resources===
Before engaging in any exercise or exercise prescription (especially &quot;at risk&quot; populations/individuals), it is recommended to get checked by a health professional, as well as undertaking specific Pre-Exercise screening tools (such as the ESSA Screening system).

Download: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxttICZ7G-o9bkF2SlNaYTNZNWM

==Dependencies==

# Windows OS (tested with Server 2008 R2, 64-bit, and Windows 7)
# Postgres (tested with 9.2.2, 64-bit)
# Postgres ODBC drivers (tested with 9.02.0100, both 32-bit and 64-bit installed)
# 7-zip
# Access Runtime (tested with 2010, 32-bit) or MS Office

==Package==

# oc_warehousing sql script (generates datasets for all studies)
# oc_access_processor database (in order to customise it, you need a copy of MS Office)
## Pre-packaged installer included in zip file, assuming you want to use it as-is.
# Batch script which restores a daily production backup into the target server, then executes the sql script and Access database.

==Features==

===Description===

The aims of this project include:

* Availability of all data in the OpenClinica database in SQL without needing to go through the ODM XML extract as an intermediate data source, or being limited by what it includes.
* Availability of all related code for customisation and bug fixing. The code that generates ODM XML is open source but the code for OpenClinica Enterprise Data Mart is not.

The provided SQL script and Access database process the data in an OpenClinica database into a set of study metadata tables, as well as a table per item group with the data pivoted such that variables are in their own column. 

===Output===

# A schema is created for each study.
# A role is created for each schema; the role has access to only that schema. These roles are intended to limit the scope of database connections in order to avoid mistakes, rather than as a security measure.
# A table is created for each item group.
# In each item group table, a column is created for each item in the item group. An accompanying column is created for the item if it uses response options. If the item uses multi-choice, this pair of columns is created for each response where there is value. 
# Additional tables are created with the following data:
## clinicaldata: a denormalised dataset which is transformed into item group data
## metadata: a denormalised dataset which is used for the item group table definitions
## subjects: distinct subjects (source: a)
## subject_event_crf_status: distinct subject/event/crf info (a)
## subject_event_crf_expected: subjects (a) and event crfs (b) cross joined
## subject_event_crf_join: expected (e) and status (d) left joined
## discrepancy_notes_parent: parent DNs on all entity types, age if not closed or n/a
## discrepancy_notes_all: all DNs on all entity types
## subject_groups: subject group assignments
## response_set_labels: code value / label pairs

===Changes since 2013-06-18===

====Warehousing Script====

Completed:

* fixed duplicates issue caused by &amp;gt;1 SDV status change (now takes most recent)
* added crf_section_label and renamed crf_section to crf_section_title
* replaced event_status logic to show just &lt;nowiki&gt;subject_event_status.name&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* replaced crf_status logic based on dates with logic from openclinica interface
* add analyze after each table, this speeds up creation of &lt;nowiki&gt;dm.cl&lt;/nowiki&gt;inicaldata
* add index to &lt;nowiki&gt;user_account.us&lt;/nowiki&gt;er_id
* add filters to clinicaldata so that no removed entities are included (subjects, crfs, etc)
* split cd_no_labels into two steps so that the site event definitions are retrieved correctly
* added handling for multi-valued fields - these get flattened with response value like item_oid_44
* added owner_id and update_id for subject, study event, event crf and item with user account name 
* added extra tables with information beyond that in metadata and clinicaldata

To do:

* Null value handling:  At the moment null codes in non-text are dropped when the data is transformed because it is the wrong type (OC Data Mart doesn't handle null codes either).

====Access database====

* added ability to fetch the list of studies in dm.clinicaldata and run the process for all
* added creation of objects in postgres and insert all data (if you want to pool the insert statements, be aware Access is limited to sending 64000 characters per statement, even on passthru queries)
* added control panel for setting odbc parameters
* added import and link table capability
* moved definition of row headers to one place so this can be changed more easily

To do:

* Suggestions welcome

==Installation Part 1==

# Install the Access Runtime on the server (if MS Office not installed already)
# Edit postgres configuration (both &lt;nowiki&gt;postgresql.co&lt;/nowiki&gt;nf and &lt;nowiki&gt;pg_hba.co&lt;/nowiki&gt;nf) to allow remote connections, e.g. allow local, all, or allow connections from IPs on your network, etc.
# Configure oc_access_processor
## Enter details of your postgres database.
## If you want to add to the standard columns in each item group dataset, modify the array in mod_populate_rowheaders. Make sure the dimensions in the public rowheaders variable are the same as the number of elements (default 13x2).
# Use Access to package oc_access_processor into an installable runtime file, and install it on the server. If the server has a copy of MS Office, just copy it to the server. 
## If packaging in Access 2010, you must add a registry key in order to avoid a bug in the packager which results in the runtime user being unable to permanently trust the database. This means that a privacy warning will be shown every time the database is opened, halting the process until the warning is manually acknowledged. Required registry key settings are:
### Root - &quot;Current User&quot;
### Key - &quot;Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access\Security\Trusted Locations\2013-09-20 oc access processor&quot;
#### Change the last part according to the application name
### Name - &quot;Path&quot;
### &lt;nowiki&gt;Value - &quot;[DATABASEDIR]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# Modify batch file to suit your file locations. It needs to restore the daily backup (preferably on a different server), run the warehousing script and open the Access database and run the ‘run_get_study_list’ macro. 
# Add scheduled task to run the batch script after the daily backup is run, e.g. 30 mins after.

A log is kept in oc_access_processor with the start, stop time for each study processed. It is created automatically the first time. Once the log has 150 or more entries, the oldest 25% are deleted.

==Installation Part 2==

Once set up, the study data will be refreshed every day and ready for use in other programs. 

In order to get other Access databases to connect to postgres and get a copy of the study data, do the following:

# Ensure that the postgres ODBC drivers are installed on each client machine.
# Import the following objects into the Access database(s):
## mod_make_locallinked_table_list module
## mod_make_locallinked_table module
## mod_process_text module
## mod_object_exists module
## mod_open_pg_odbc_conn module
## control_panel form (remove all the action buttons after import, or alternatively just import the import_link_tables macro to call make_locallinked_table_list and give it the study name in double quotes).
## oc_table_selection form (this should be hidden)
## odbc_connection table (this should be hidden)

The ‘import / link tables’ action opens a form that allows a user to select a list of tables from their study schema, and either create corresponding linked tables, or create local table copies of the remote tables. The table list is saved as a query definition (called oc_tables_to_copy). Both actions delete the existing definition with the same name so keep this in mind for any defined relationships.

==Known Issues==

===Naming Conventions===

Naming limitations beyond those imposed by OpenClinica are as follows. The function ‘process_text’ truncates strings to 45 characters, after removing any non-alphanumeric characters and replacing spaces with underscores.

# Study name is run through process_text, so each study name needs to be unique in the first 45 characters. OpenClinica allows 255 characters. The processed name is used for the role name and password created for each study.
# Item name is converted to lowercase, and truncated to 12 characters. OpenClinica allows 255 characters.
## It is assumed that item names are created with maximum 8 alphanumeric characters (underscores allowed) for CDISC / SAS compatibility. Not enforced, it has not been tested what happens when longer item names are used.
## The additional 4 characters are an allowance for multi-value fields. Their item names are modified to add the coded value after an underscore. E.g. item name ‘MYMULTI’ has a coded response 99 which means ‘something’; the item name becomes ‘mymulti_99’. Longer multi-value codes would need to be unique within the first 3 characters (this has not been tested). 
# Item description is run through process_text. OpenClinica allows 4000 characters.
# Item variable column names in the item group tables are composed of the processed item name and item description joined together. E.g. item name ‘MYITEM’ description ‘My first OpenClinica item which collects my favourite variable’ will get a column name of ‘myitem_my_first_openclinica_item_which_collects_my_f’, which highlights the virtue of short, meaningful item descriptions.

===Null Value Codes===

Processing of null value codes has not been added at this stage. If they are used, and the item is not a string, Access will throw a type mismatch error and not insert the value (e.g. failed to insert ‘NI’ into an integer field). At present the transform_insert_ig_data function resumes if a type mismatch errors occurs in the position where they are expected. 

A way to look up null codes would be to filter the clinicaldata table for CRFs where null codes are allowed, and filter the item value column for values containing any of those null codes.

To avoid this issue, add an item or response list option to capture why a value is missing instead of using the Null Value code feature, or add an explanation in an annotation discrepancy note. 

===Item Group Size===

Access cannot process tables or queries with more than 255 columns. Whether or not this is a problem depends on the number of items, how many of them are single-select and how many of them are multi-select. For example:

* This is OK: 13 rowheaders + 100 single-select items + 100 code label columns = 213 columns.
* This is OK: 13 rowheaders + 15 multi-value items with 6 response options each (results in up to 90 columns, depending on responses) + (up to) 90 code label columns = 193 columns.
* This is OK: 13 rowheaders + 10 date fields + 10 single-select items + 10 integer fields + 10 float fields + 5 multi-value items with 10 response options each (results in up to 50 columns, depending on responses) + (up to) 60 code label columns = 163 columns.

This issue was encountered during development; the easiest solution was to add update queries which serialised the item group items according to their item form order. These update queries have been commented out but are present and would be required in functions make_local_clinicaldata, make_local_metadata, make_local_item_metadata. 

==Future Improvements==

Some ideas for further improvements include:

===Text Export===

Write the data out to an SQL file or a set of CSVs for import to other RDBMS or programs. It is possible to write text files from Access using the Microsoft Scripting Runtime library, the main advantage being that both the DDL and DML statements could be included, like in the Enterprise Data Mart downloadable file. It may be simpler to use Postgres’ COPY function for CSV. Alternatively an ODBC connection could be set up.

===Rewrite for Linux Compatibility===

Re-write VBA code in a less reprehensible language that can be run on linux, like java or python. I have no immediate purpose for this other than personal satisfaction, so it might be a while.

The main hurdle is reproducing the Access crosstab/pivot function, which could be done at once with an enormous CASE…WHEN-style pivot. This can’t be done from Access because it can’t send SQL statements over 64000 characters long. Postgres has a much larger statement size limit. 

Another approach could be to insert the distinct rowheader data, and then add each column using a series of UPDATE statements – which would also avoid / relax the column limit issue, as the limit for Postgres is somewhere between 250 and 1600, depending on the data.

===Add Null Value Code Handling===

While I avoid null value codes, some users probably value the feature and would like the null type information to be as usable as the rest of the data. A possible implementation could be to add a column for the null code string for any column where it is present; however this could worsen the issue of Access’ 255 column-per-table limit.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{CPTExample|title=Key Stage 3 National Strategy Key Messages Foundation Subjects: Pedagogy and Practice}}
Good teaching fosters good learning. It stems from effective lesson design whatever the age of the learner, their level of ability, or the subject or skill being learned. Good teaching results when teachers:
* focus and structure their teaching so that pupils are clear about what is to be learned and how, and how it fits with what they know already;
* actively engage pupils in their learning so that they make their own meaning from it;
* develop systematically pupils’ learning skills so that their learning becomes increasingly independent;
* use assessment for learning to help pupils to reflect on what they already know, reinforce the learning being developed, and set targets for the future;
* have high expectations of the effort that pupils should make and what they can achieve; 
* make the learning motivating by well-paced teaching using stimulating activities matched to a range of learning styles;
* create an environment that promotes learning in a settled and purposeful atmosphere.

==Learning styles==
The work being undertaken through the Secondary Strategy, especially through the Foundation Subjects, has enabled serious discussion of learning style preferences and the role of the teacher in ensuring that no particular style is prejudiced by their method and style of delivery. Whilst many Year 7 pupils will have an emerging awareness of their own learning preferences the adults entering initial teacher training in ICT (and their school based mentors) are less likely to have undertaken such personal assessment and will need to be given particular guidance on this aspect. Many LEAs have set up online tests and reporting and there are other learning style assessment tools out there. You may wish to direct your trainees to:
* [http://www.vark-learn.com/english/index.asp http://www.vark-learn.com/english/index.asp]
* [http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html]

Although there is no specific publication for ICT the publication Teaching and Learning in Secondary Schools Unit 10 Learning Styles (DfES 0350/2003) provides a succinct overview with workshops linking to video case studies.

However, we need caution in adopting the 'learning styles' movement too uncritically. ''&quot;These so-called 'brain-based' ideas do not yet form a coherent theory - each guru has their own set of categories of styles - and the influence of the teaching strategies associated with them has not yet been researched reliably to my knowledge.&quot;'' (Kennewell) 

These ideas do have a fashionable status in schools (and are mentioned in the Secondary strategy), but it is important that all educators consider them as useful ideas to incorporate into teaching as part of a 'well-balanced diet' of approaches, which also include autonomy in learning, thinking skills and interactive teaching.

It's not the outcomes of the test/audits themselves but the realisation in the tutor (and pupil peers) that everyone doesn't learn like they do (getting the scales to fall from their eyes). It's all about other people's world view. As it says in the Talmud (or Anais Nin said ... depending on where you find the quotation) 'We don't see things as they are; we see things as we are' - and there are a whole set of ideas surrounding (trainee) teachers recognising that they are constrained by their own beliefs.

See Learning Styles - What They Can Offer for more detailed consideration of these issues. You can download it here:

==Pedagogy of ICT==

A second major issue is that of the Pedagogy of subject ICT – it must have one but there are few published items specifically dealing with this; the majority are looking at ICT to support other subjects. However Section 1 (pp 7-11) of [http://publications.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=25813 ICT and Pedagogy] (Cox et al, DFES/0793/2003) may help you in your thinking.

==Other issues==
Ofsted and other interested parties have indicated several other critical issues related to teaching and learning in the specific documentation on ICT inspections and in generic documents. For more on these go to Issues

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some teaching and learning issues of interest to teachers of ICT are highlighted below and links are given to where materials may be found to support and develop ideas and strategies to enhance your trainees' work in these aspects. In some cases we do not yet have any answers or the range of support and development resources is small because there has been little research in those areas. We welcome any suggestions for additions.

Issues identified by the National Strategy that currently relate to ICT departments in school are disseminated to schools via termly ICT Subject Leader Briefings - the documents to support these are eventually published on Teachernet and on the Secondary Strategy website. These materials are regularly presented to ITT institutions at the twice yearly Strategy update events that you are recommended to attend.

==Teaching methodology: distance, e-learning==

Support and development resources

There are a range of resources looking at this. Schools are expected to have a learning platform (Virtual Learning Environment - VLE) in place but as yet no clear description of the maturity of use stages has emerged. Many schools (and ITT establishments) may have not gone beyond using the repository function of these tools. The range of provison and the use of these tools to support learning might be worthy of a group investigation by a cohort of trainees on placement. These tools are seen by some as being a kingpin of the ability of a teacher to engage with and delliver the personalised learning agenda as defined by the Every Child Matters Agenda.

==Personalised Learning==

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This is what I mean by “Personalised Learning”. High expectation of every child, given practical form by high quality teaching based on a sound knowledge and understanding of each child’s needs. It is not individualised learning where pupils sit alone at a computer. Nor is it pupils left to their own devices – which too often reinforces low aspirations. It can only be developed school by school. It cannot be imposed from above.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; David Millband 8th January 2004 Speech to North of England Education Conference

Key messages for trainees:
:''Pupils should be encouraged to use their first language in lessons when:''

** the cognitive challenge is likely to be high: problem solving and critical
** thinking are difficult in a second language, even when the target language has been learnt for several years;
** they are still developing proficiency in English: this can be particularly supportive when pupils are trying out ideas in their first language before planning in English;
** oral rehearsal will help reflection: for example, when describing features of an effective presentation.
It may not be appropriate for pupils to use their first language when:
** pupils need to be encouraged to practise English to improve fluency;
** pupils are being encouraged to take risks in their spoken English in order to build confidence;
** pupils need to practise expressing themselves quickly in English, for examination preparation;
** pupils are learning technical or subject-specific language.

* ICT and Pedagogy (Section 1 p4, Cox et al, DFES/0793/2003) ''“Using ICT with pupils in pairs, groups or with a whole class, through, for example, the use of an interactive whiteboard, enables teachers to gather extensive feedback from pupils by listening to their explanations. From this, teachers are able to gain deeper insights into pupils’ understanding and progress. Pupils collaborating in pairs or teams using subject-specific ICT resources are able to challenge each other’s understanding and learn from such collaborations.”''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Key Stage 3 is defined as the education of pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 (aged 11 - 14 years) and is characterised as a number of subjects taught compulsorily and separately with no final, summative or accredited assessment. In England the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) specifies the content of the curriculum and the characteristics of the levels of attainment called the National Curriculum. The QCA has developed a curriculum big picture to reinforce the concept of curriculum as the entire planned learning experience of a young person and shows the range of subjects and the spectrum of activities. http://www.qca.org.uk/libraryAssets/media/Big_Picture_2008.pdf

The National Strategies website is the definitive source of authorised information regarding how the curriculum should be delivered from early years (aged 4) to 16. The 14-19 Strategy and Functional Skills are presented separately.

National Strategy The 
The ICT Strand

The Key Stage 3 Strategy for ICT Capability(2002) has been superseded by the ICT strand of the National Strategy which provides guidance and resources for teachers at 

http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/secondaryframeworks/ictframework

The original strategy materials included a Framework to support the planning, teaching and assessment of ICT and a number of sample teaching units (STU) for Years 7, 8 and 9, with detailed lesson plans that exemplified effective teaching of ICT capability. These remain a useful resource to exemplify long and medium term planning and the structure of lessons. The Framework introduced concepts of ICT capability, starters and plenaries, miniplenaries and yearly teaching objectives. 

The Secondary Strategy focuses on a number of generic areas which impact upon the teaching of ICT at Key Stage 3 including: behaviour, attendance, and social and emotional aspects of learning (SEAL); pedagogy (whole school approaches); assessment for learning; functional skills in literacy, numeracy and ICT and &quot;intervention&quot;.

Intervention is the concept of securing the learning of all pupils in mainstream lessons through tailored intervention support programmes and specialised, individualised provision that accelerate and maximise pupils' progress and to minimise performance gaps. Aspects of intervention include progression maps, study plus and the role of the teaching assistant. http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/secondary/intervention

The renewed ICT Framework builds on the original Framework published in 2002, and is designed to &quot;increase pupils' access to excellent teaching, and engaging, purposeful learning that will enable them to make good progress through Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4&quot;.

The Framework is structured:

to provide guidance on planning and teaching; 

to incorporate existing guidance on day-to-day and periodic assessment; 

to increase the emphasis on the key concepts, key processes and functional skills; 

to build on what pupils have learned in Key Stage 2; 

to ensure that ICT skills are integrated with knowledge and understanding in a range of contexts; and 

to support planning and to build on existing National Strategies resources.

It strongly reflects the four strands of the National Curriculum - finding information, developing ideas, communicating information and evaluating. It interprets those in terms of the knowledge, skills and understanding associated with each.

When &quot;finding information&quot; in Key Stage 3 pupils should understand that Information items come in different forms and from different sources. Keywords include: searching, selecting, search engines, Boolean searches, data sets, organising, investigating, purpose, scope, processing, retrieval

When &quot;developing ideas&quot; the pupils should understand that use of ICT can increase the efficiency of information processing and that processes can be speeded up using automation. Keywords include: models, modelling, representation, system, conditions, input, rules, outcomes, sequencing, instructions, control, plan, predict.

When &quot;communicating information&quot; pupils should understand that it is &quot;important to be selective and sensitive in what we present to a particular audience or community and engage in critical reflection on how others present fact and opinions or materials to publicise or entertain&quot;. Keywords include: fitness for purpose, communication, environment, audience expectations, needs, refining, presenting, text, images, sounds, formatting, risk management, security.

When &quot;evaluating&quot; pupils should be encouraged to make self-assessments of their work to develop their ability to provide and respond to critical feedback. Keywords include: user interface, efficiency, usefulness of a system, systematic testing, complex and rigorous success criteria, user feedback, balancing competing demands.

The structure of the Framework for secondary ICT also presents the curriculum as a two-dimensional grid of objectives arranged vertically by year group from Year 7 to Year 11, and horizontally in four strands of progression across the secondary age range.

The Framework also provides guidance on the value of planning schemes of work in ICT, how a curriculum map is formed, the role of learning objectives, unit plans and a teaching calendar.

Ofsted Perspective 
Key Stage 3 teaching of ICT


Issues raised by Ofsted in relation to teaching and learning in ICT include: 
* Teachers should ensure all planned work is completed
* Teachers should be more systematic at checking pupil understanding
* Teachers should ensure adequate feedback is given to ensure that pupils know what and how to improve ICT
* Plenaries should be long enough for teachers to summarise what has been learnt and to discuss what will be learnt in the next lesson
* Teachers need to make better use of manageable assessment opportunities, including pupil self assessment
For full details of the issues see the Ofsted publication: Ofsted (2003) The Key Stage 3 Strategy: Evaluation of the Second Year pp17-19 London, UK: Ofsted

More recently, the 2005 Ofsted report highlights, amongst other issues, these findings that could influence ITT ICT course planning:
Teachers need to give more consideration to the circumstances in which independent learning using ICT can flourish.
Assessment of ICT capability remains a weakness in one fifth of schools at Key Stage 3 and one eighth at Key Stage 4.
The use of assessment to respond to the needs of individual pupils remains very variable, especially at Key Stage 3 where it is unsatisfactory in almost one fifth of schools.
Ofsted (2005). Information and communication technology in secondary schools. The Annual Report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools 2004. [Online]. London, UK: Ofsted 

In their observations of lessons and discussions with teachers, trainees may find it helpful to focus on one or more of these issues in order to develop their own ideas about what constitutes effective practice.

The Annual Report of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools 2005/06 reports,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;in some subjects in secondary schools, the quality of provision is affected by high levels of staff turnover and difficulties in recruiting appropriately qualified staff; this is particularly the case in science,mathematics, information and communication technology (ICT) and design and technology, including food technology.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Annual Report of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills 2006/07 reports,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Secondary schools offer an increasing number of vocational courses to pupils aged 14 to 19 years, making the curriculum more relevant and motivating for many learners and encouraging them to attend and to learn. However, the curriculum for information and communication technology (ICT) in Key Stage 4 is not improving, and the development of ICT skills to support learning across the curriculum remains too dependent on the expertise of individual subject teachers. Schools in all phases are providing an increasing range of extra-curricular activities, which help to motivate and engage pupils.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The National Curriculum 
for Key Stage 3 ICT


This section contains an outline of the National Curriculum for England for ICT at key stage 3. It was first published by QCA in 2007 and came into force in schools from September 2008 for year 7. The claim is that the new National Curriculum will provide:
* Greater flexibility and coherence
* New focus on aims and skills
* Greater personalisation through assessment and qualifications
* Greater coherence through a common structure across all subjects
* Greater flexibility and coherence is achieved through tailoring learning to the learners’ needs by having less prescribed subject content. Pupils will still be taught essential subject knowledge but the new curriculum balances subject knowledge with the key concepts and processes that underlie the discipline of each subject.

The revised programmes of study for all subjects share a common format which includes:
an importance statement – why the subject matters.
key concepts – identifies the big ideas that underpin the subject
key processes – identifies the essential skills of the subject
range and content – outlines the breadth of subject matter
The curriculum is described in terms of knowledge, concepts and skills. A further section identifies opportunities to enhance and enrich learning, including making links to the wider curriculum such as enterprise, creativity, and cultural understanding and diversity.

What has changed and why is summarised in the document http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/uploads/overview_doc_tcm8-1839.pdf

The complete programme of study for ICT key stage 3 is available from http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/uploads/QCA-07-3336-p_ICT_KS3_tcm8-401.pdf.

The importance of information and communication technology is...

The increasing use of technology in all aspects of society makes confident, creative and productive use of ICT an essential skill for life. ICT capability encompasses not only the mastery of technical skills and techniques, but also the understanding to apply these skills purposefully, safely and responsibly in learning, everyday life and employment. ICT capability is fundamental to participation and engagement in modern society. 

ICT can be used to find, develop, analyse and present information, as well as to model situations and solve problems. ICT enables rapid access to ideas and experiences from a wide range of people, communities and cultures, and allows pupils to collaborate and exchange information on a wide scale. ICT acts as a powerful force for change in society and citizens should have an understanding of the social, ethical, legal and economic implications of its use, including how to use ICT safely and responsibly. Increased capability in the use of ICT supports initiative and independent learning, as pupils are able to make informed judgements about when and where to use ICT to enhance their learning and the quality of their work.

==Teaching and learning processes in Key Stage 3==

Putting the National Strategy into practice has caused schools to refocus attention on teaching and learning processes rather than the delivery of content. These approaches are closely associated with the theories linked to accelerated learning. Accelerated learning is an umbrella term for a series of practical approaches to learning which uses new knowledge about how the brain functions when learning. Accelerated learning takes the new knowledge about the way students learn and puts it into a manageable way of working in the classroom. It forms the cornerstone of the Learning Framework adopted within the Strategy and beyond.

An excellent introduction to current thinking on accelerated learning is contained in Learning: A Sense Maker’s Guide published by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL). Further information and purchase details are available in the resources section on the ATL website http://www.atl.org.uk

An important publication in the Pedagogy and Practice: Teaching and Learning in Secondary Schools series is the Using ICT to enhance learning (Unit 15) that describes practical strategies for teachers to use to enhance learning through the use of ICT. The techniques suggested are tried and tested; they draw both on academic research and the experience of practising teachers. An early Ofsted report identified the issues arising from the need to develop pupils’ ICT capability to enhance their learning. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The past five years have seen a slow but steady improvement in pupils’ achievements in ICT capability, the quality of teaching, and the leadership and management of ICT ... The complementary use of ICT across subjects, however, has been slow to develop and is uneven across schools and subjects ... The effective balance between the teaching of ICT skills, knowledge and understanding on the one hand and the application of these as part of learning across subjects on the other hand remains a difficult and elusive goal for the majority of schools.”&lt;/blockquote&gt; (Ofsted, 2004)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a open agenda for researching Computing as a subject and opportunities to make a difference at a pivotal stage in the development of our subject. In order to carry out research you need a research interest, a research strategy and to write for an audience. Each is considered in turn. A further section deals with supervising research students and encouraging others to write.

==Research interests==
You may well have a personal research agenda growing out of your work with trainee teachers, your observation of schools or your own recent practice as an Computing teacher. This may well lead you into action research inquiry based on problems you face in your practice. If you want to go further and ask what are the general issues faced in research of teaching of Computing the list is endless and several lines of inquiry have been suggested in these pages. A focus group of Computing researchers identified these questions as priorities, do you agree? 
* key stage 3: issues in implementing the strategy
* assessment and Computing: why is practice so poor and what can be done 
* the missing link: what is the connection between key stage 3 and qualification courses?
* the three part lesson: opportunity or straightjacket? 
* the place of metaphor in teaching Computing concepts
* what is subject knowledge in relation to Computing?
* is Computing an academic subject?
* why do pupils like Computing?

==Research strategies==

Research guides frequently distinguish between ‘positivist’ approaches and more naturalist or interpretivist approaches (Cohen and Mannion 1994). The former is rooted in an experimental approach which, put briefly, starts with a hypothesis, involves setting up experimental and control groups, designing pre and post testing and accumulating evidence to check whether a hypothesis is valid. The latter is more interested in interpretations which teachers and pupils put on teaching and learning and is more likely to explore the use of ICT in natural settings. For example, a positivist might ask does ICT have an impact on learning and design settings in which experiments in learning could take place. An interpretivist might be inclined to go into classrooms as they are and ask who thinks ICT has an impact on learning and why do they think that. 

Once you have decided in which tradition you feel more comfortable you might then think about theoretical perspectives such as grounded theory (eg one view is offered by Strauss and Corbin 1998); activity theory (Center for Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research, 2004) and action research (Carr and Kemmis 1986) or more quantitative / statistical approaches (eg Muijs 2004). There is though no need to see quantitative methods as the preserve of positivist / experimental approaches. 

===A research approach fit for purpose===
If you are in the position of being relatively new to educational research, but with a wealth of practitioner experience on which to draw, you may be well placed to carry out action research of your own. There is no single definition of action research but common to most commentators is an interest in reflecting on your practice and implementing and evaluating an innovation to address a problem or difficulty within your work. Some action research projects are strongly focused on you and your innovation (for example, does online conferencing effectively support student teachers on placement?). Some are much more focused on the constraints on practice and collective action in order to overcome these constraints. 

There is a huge literature on action research and very many web sites –for example, infed.org offers a guide created by a small group of educators at www.infed.org/research/b-actres.htm. You might find practitioner guides to carrying out research useful in carrying out your research, for example, the Scottish Centre Research in Education http://www.scre.ac.uk/ produces a set of classroom guides and there are a great many books including Barton and Bartlett (2005); Hopkins (2002); and Sagor (2005). Carrying out your own action research project will, of course, help you lead student teachers in carrying out their projects. However, it is one approach amongst many. You may prefer to work within a different tradition - a more observational standing back ethnographic approach or perhaps a more interventionist approach on a grander scale. 

===Projects and bids===
Educational research is time consuming and you may want to investigate collaborative approaches to research – many first time researchers are happy to attach themselves to larger projects being undertaken in their institution that are led by more established researchers. You might want to search for funding of your own, or more likely in a collaborative project of some kind. Funding will allow you to pay for research assistance and meet expenses such as transcribing tapes, travel, purchase of special equipment, attending conferences and so on. Your application may be proactive - the result of a great deal of reflection over time - or reactive there is a deadline for a new round of projects to which your institution wants you to respond. Some important sources of funding are:

* Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) (http://www.esrc.ac.uk/) 
* Foundations such as Leverhulme Trust (http://www.leverhulme.org.uk), Esmée Fairbairn Foundation (http://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/), The Nuffield Foundation (http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org), Gatsby Foundation (http://www.gatsby.org.uk) 
* Government or Government supported bodies such as DCSF, TDA, GTC, Becta. Note Becta has run a small grants scheme in the past which has supported scholarly practitioner research 
* Other educational bodies such as Specialist Schools Trust 
* EU funding 

Nearly all sources of funding imply stiff competition – you can improve your chances of getting funding by:
* paying close attention to what the funder will and will not cover 
* where possible getting formative feedback from the funder on how well your proposal fits with their brief
* getting peer feedback on your bid
* making your bid a collaborative one - here you are ideally placed to involve partner schools in your bid and produce an effective dissemination strategy.
Don’t underestimate the time involved in writing a bid and the time needed to carry out a successful project - you cannot leave it in the hands of research assistants. Remember that although you may have a well presented project proposal most bids are rejected by most organisations because of pressure on funds. Be persistent and learn from the feedback.

==Research writing==
This section looks at communicating your work to public audiences. It discusses reasons for writing; opportunities for writing; challenges in writing and the process of writing. It suggests entry points into writing for academic audiences.

===Why write?===
The best and most obvious reason is that there is something you want to communicate to your colleagues about teaching and learning with Computing. You went into teaching to make a difference and you can make a difference through your writing even if your audience is removed from you in place and time. However, you may have additional, more extrinsic, reasons for writing, for example, publication of work may help you get a permanent contract, a promotion, or help you get recognition from your colleagues. In many departments there is an expectation on you to publish as part of a contribution to the highly competitive Research Assessment Exercise. 

===Opportunity===
As discussed elsewhere in this research section, Computing is a new subject and possibilities abound for carrying out and reporting original research. This may arise out of your every day teaching and observation of classrooms; your awareness of new teaching methods; or reflections on some of the literature you are reading. This may in turn lead to an empirical study and / or desk-based research, such as a review of the literature. 

There are obvious constraints in carrying out and reporting on research. Higher education institutions put different priorities on research and give different levels of support and encouragement. However shortage of time affects everyone. Colleagues find different patterns for managing their time; some need extended periods for reflection others can manage regular short bursts of activity. 

A key challenge in writing for a public audience is overcoming a lack of confidence and taking the risk of opening your work to public scrutiny. In starting to write about Computing you are switching roles from being a reader or user of research to being a writer or producer of research. There might be a neat parallel between your doubts and uncertainties about writing and those that your trainee teachers feel about teaching. To meet the challenge you may want to think about phasing your entry as a writer, for example setting your sights first on a professional journal or a less formal publication such as the ITTE newsletter . When it comes to writing for an academic publication you might want to start by co-authoring a paper with a more experienced colleague who can explain the conventions and the process more clearly. Another approach is to write a much shorter article, as a research note, for an academic journal. 

===Writing processes===
Everyone has their own ideas about writing and the routines that work for them. Some people like to plan in a very detailed fashion, some like to structure their text as they go along, some prefer to read around a topic in great depth before writing, some go further into the literature once they have a better idea of the direction in which they are heading. 

There are some general steps to take which most of us find helpful. First, rehearse your ideas before you try to commit yourself to writing an academic paper, for example discuss your research with a critical friend - someone who is positive and supportive about your efforts but prepared to point out the areas to develop. Your critical friend need not be familiar with your particular research but they should know about carrying out and reporting on educational research in general. As part of the rehearsal phase, offer to present an informal seminar to your colleagues and if appropriate invite your students to comment.

Your next step may be to take your ideas to a conference, for example the ITTE research conference, usually held in Cambridge in January, or the ITTE annual conference, usually held in July (http://www.itte.org.uk/index.php?id=13). Do not wait until the research is polished. Your audience will be interested in having a few issues and dilemmas clearly spelt out – avoid long, detailed descriptions which will lose your listeners. Following feedback you will want to re draft your paper. Writing involves repeated revision as you come to see how you can express more clearly or realise other avenues on which to report. 

A particularly important step to take is to consider the particular journal in which to publish (see the journals listed on this site in the section refereed academic research). Read the aims of the journal very closely and spend some time looking at back issues, in particular search for papers on similar themes to your own. Most articles will follow a broadly similar format: abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion. Many first time writers and readers of academic research are struck by the importance given to literature review and extensive referencing. This can result in pedantry, particularly when a host of names are brought in to seek support for what seems obvious. However, referencing allows the reader to see where your work fits into a body of knowledge. This really is central; your audience is interested in the big picture and the implications of your work for the research field, not the immediate recommendations for practice in your institution. 

A second feature which strikes many new academics is the attention given to methodology and theoretical perspective. In contrast, books and papers aimed at practitioners rarely deal in detail with how the data was collected and methods of interpretation but this is a crucial part of academic writing. A third striking feature of academic articles is the conciseness of the writing, the author is often distilling findings from a much larger body of work. 

As you work and re work your paper for an academic journal you will eventually reach saturation point. You can certainly develop your paper further but in doing so you realise you stand to lose as much as you gain. Get feedback on your final draft, get it proof read and send it off. 

==Peer review==
You may as a writer on Computing be satisfied in publishing your work on your own web, or in practitioner journals or more ambitiously in a book aimed at teachers of Computing. However, there is a special status in many universities in publishing in academic journals as papers are seen as validated by peer review and contributing to a body of established thinking about your subject. Peer reviews are there to ensure rigour and reviewers are giving up their time as a contribution to the research community. Good advice is to step back from whatever preconceptions you have about the peer review process, and, whether accepted or rejected, reflect on the feedback and move on. 

The journal editor will decide on the basis of reviewer comments to accept, reject or ask you to amend your paper. Outright acceptance is very gratifying but relatively rare and leaves you nothing more to do but to wait for the proofs of your article and bask in your new status as an established contributor to the academic community. It is more usual that you will be asked to make minor or major amendments to your paper. If the amendments are significant there may be no guarantee of publication at the end. 

New authors sometimes feel they have to act on all the suggestions reviewers make for change. This is not the case. If you want to stick by your original position explain why you have done so to the editor. Inevitably your paper maybe rejected - many are and all academics have suffered rejection at some time. Rejection may leave you angry and suspicious of the process. Take time to reflect on the reasons for rejection. If you still have faith in your paper send it elsewhere - once having tailored it to fit the aims of another journal. Otherwise put the paper to one side; when you are ready you will return to the ideas contained in it and you may want to re work it some day. 

Embarking on academic research is an uncertain enterprise. Like most things you do, you will get better with time, that is providing you receive the right support. The profession needs writers - stick with it. 

==Writing guides==
There are several guides to writing up research. A very clear recent book is: 
* Wellington, J. (2004) Getting Published: a guide for lecturers and publishers Routledge, London. 

Good books on the process of academic writing include: 
* Becker, H. (1980) Writing for Social Scientists, Chicago, Chicago University Press  
* Woods, P. (1999) Successful Writing for Qualitative Research, Routledge, London. 

For more technical guides to writing try:
* Cuba, L. and Cooking, J. (1994) How to Write about the Social Sciences, Longman, London. 

There are in addition a large number of sites offering support for writing for publication.

==Supervision==

===Supervising research and being supervised yourself===

One aspect of your role as tutor in a higher education institution (HEI) is teaching and supervising higher degree research students. As with taking on the role of PGCE tutor in the first place this presents both opportunities and challenges. This section looks at supervising research students, particularly those at doctorate level, but much will be relevant to the supervision of students at Masters degree level. It covers:
* Supervision skills and benefits
* Difficulties in research supervision
* Student support opportunities
* Further reading
A further section looks at issues to consider in registering for a research degree and the process of being supervised yourself.

===Supervision skills and benefits===

Good advice is to start with a positive attitude to the process; supervision can be one of the most stimulating and enjoyable aspects of teaching in higher education. It gives you the opportunity to go into your subject in greater depth and perhaps to share aspects of your own research and to see the work you have carried out through the eyes of another. There is an altruistic satisfaction in helping another person get started on their research and achieve something with your critical support which they could not do otherwise. Supervision can add variety to your work, may form part of your job description and any enthusiasm you show for research supervision will usually be recognised by others. 

Before looking at the difficulties in research supervision remind yourself of the generic skills you bring: an ability to listen, experience in, and by now an almost instinctive feel for, the importance of planning, setting realistic manageable tasks, recording progress and balancing praise with constructive criticism. Your own experiences of academic study will also help you carry out your role.

===Difficulties in research supervision===

====Overcoming self-doubt====

As with any new role you take on you will experience a range of challenges and difficulties, for example:
* You feel you don’t have enough experience of the subject area
* You out feel out of your depth academically
* You lack experience of the specific approach your student wants to follow.
Sensible advice here is to take advantage of whatever training opportunities your institution and your department offers. Many departments will have mentoring arrangements or opportunities to co-supervise a student with a more experienced colleague. 

====Relevant expertise====
In working with students state clearly what support and help you can offer but be open about your lack of experience. You may be supervising a student even if you lack a doctorate or Masters degree of your own, your student will judge you on the support you offer them, not on your academic career. If you lack the background to address specific concerns then put your student in contact with colleagues who can advise or point them to relevant literature – this is standard practice in most departments. 

====Student attitudes and behaviour====
You may experience a range of further difficulties from aspects of your students’ attitudes and behaviour, eg.
* Your student seems unaware of what is expected of a dissertation
* Your student has specific language difficulties
* Your student seems to have poor writing skills
* Your student has writer’s block
* Your student expects too much of you and wants you to do it for them
* Your student does not seem to want your help or input at all
Good generic advice is to set out your expectations clearly, for example, how often you will meet for supervision, at what times, how long you can spend on reading and commenting on drafts and the level of detail you are prepared to go into. Make a record of what is discussed at each meeting and encourage your student to set a target for the next meeting. If you have worries over your student’s progress try to understand the difficulties and set realistic goals to overcome them. For example, the 
student who is overwhelmed by carrying out a literature survey might find it easier to get started by carrying out a critique of a single paper. 

====Refining research targets====
Many students start with over ambitious targets for their research (eg the influence of ICT on teaching and learning) and can be encouraged to focus down (eg a case study of adoption of ICT in a single department). Here the discipline of writing out a research proposal complete with timetable for each phase of the research and carrying out a pilot study can be very helpful. 

====Expectations at higher degree level====
Students may have a very incomplete idea of what is expected at doctorate or masters level; refer them to departmental guidelines. Try to exemplify key statements and encourage students to read dissertations others have done. However, avoid making predictions concerning how your students will be marked – at Masters level grades need to be moderated by an exam board and a doctoral candidate faces examination by an internal and external examiner. You are not in a position to predict with certainty the decisions made by these colleagues. 

===Student support opportunities===

====Student training and support====
Make sure your student is taking advantage both of optional and compulsory research training courses offered by the department or faculty. Take advantage of wider support systems in your university, for example, ICT services for courses and guides to say SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) or qualitative data analysis software, language support departments particularly valuable for students with English as a foreign language and whatever generic study skills courses offered by graduate studies department or the students union. 

===Community of researchers===
A key support for you and your student is the community of researchers in your institution. You will be helped considerably if there is a team of Computing researchers in your department sharing ideas and communicating within an informal and formal seminar programme. There might be a wider programme of support and events open to researchers in the department as a whole. If you and your student feel quite isolated in your interests within the department you can compensate to some extent by organising events with another institution and carrying out informal exchange with colleagues. 

====Research conferences and organisations====
No matter the strengths and weaknesses of your department you will want to encourage research students to attend conferences, such as ITTE’s research and conference events. More generally, British Educational Research Association (BERA) offers conferences and support for new researchers in education. A good focus for many students is to present a paper – you can help by offering to present a joint paper first time around. 

===Being a student researcher yourself===

If you do not have a research degree yourself, and you want to carry out your own research into teaching and learning with ICT, you will probably benefit from registering for a taught Masters course leading to supervised doctorate research. 

In registering for a Masters programme key considerations to weigh up will probably be:
* distance you need to travel to attend the institution (though if you are comfortable with a distance learning approach, albeit with some face to face events, this may be less of an issue);
* the reputation of the programme (for example, do you know colleagues who have followed the programme in the past who could pass on their experiences?);
* and appropriateness for your needs (for example, a local HEI might provide very good general programmes but offer very little on teaching and learning ICT).
Before making a final decision contact course coordinators directly and discuss your needs and interests with them. Of course, cost is another key consideration and if you are based in an HEI you will almost automatically decide to register for a course in your own institution as long as you are not being charged fees.

In registering for doctorate supervision (the first step here is generally being registered for an MPhil) you will face a similar set of considerations: distance you need to travel to attend the institution; the reputation both of taught research methods courses and your proposed supervisor; and appropriateness for research into ICT. In many cases research students often choose an institution before choosing a supervisor and there are clearly good reasons for doing so. However you might want to be more selective and approach a colleague whose work you know, this will be easier if you can make face to face contact, for example at an ITTE or other conference event, or perhaps have taken part in debates on discussion forums together. 

There have been past plans to prepare a registry of interests within the ICT research community, look out for future developments here. Academic background is of course an important but only one factor in choosing your supervisor. You can access academic knowledge through journals and conferences, your priority is for an approachable 'critical friend' providing you with reliable support and encouragement. Discuss your needs and interest thoroughly with your proposed supervisor and work on a detailed research proposal before registering. This proposal will not only help you narrow down your research question but communicate your background and interests to your supervisor. 

It is easy to see being supervised as the mirror image of the advice for supervising discussed earlier. Set out the ground rules: when are you going to meet; for how long; what feedback do you expect.? Make your own record of meetings and set achievable targets at the end of each meeting. Write as you go along and spend time looking at other theses. Try to understand the conventions – you do not need to follow these conventions blindly but you do need to know what they are and to explain why you are not following some. Take advantage of wider support in the institution, attend seminars and suggest to your supervisor that you might co-present work at conferences when appropriate. Good luck!

===Further reading===

To look further at the issues raised in this brief introduction go to:
* Delamont, S., Atkinson, P. and Parry, O. (1997) Supervising the PhD, Open University Press, Buckingham. (This is particularly helpful in raising some of the difficulties you may encounter and in reviewing the examination process).

There are several guides to carrying out doctorate research including:
* Phillips, E. and Pugh, D. (2004) How to get a PhD, Open University Press, Buckingham.

A well used research guide is:
* Bell, J. (1987) Doing Your Research Project: A Guide for First-time Researchers in Education and Social Science, Open University Press, Buckingham, particularly as a guide for work at Masters level.

If you find these guides a little too formulaic then look at:
* Salmon, P. (1992) Achieving a PhD, Trentham Books, Stoke on Trent. (This highlights that research emerges from a personal commitment.)

==Supporting an M level assignment at PGCE==

If you have a whole class you are supporting in an M level assignment offer them a clear structure and provide guidance in a booklet form or online. For example, many courses will set action research projects (though in practice this may stop at reconnaissance of opportunities and some very limited innovations) or mini curriculum investigations. Explain the stages you want students to go through; set deadlines for each stage; suggest word lengths for each stage. Let them know you are flexible (assuming you are of course) but giving them a framework often makes it easier for the student rather than more restrictive. 

You may well want to restrict the number of topics and to provide back up readings of web references for them. The key for the student is turning a general interest into a set of questions to investigate and a strategy for doing this. For example, here are two topics with questions and sub questions which students have identified and a broad strategy suggested for addressing them.

''Topic: interactive white boards (IWB)''&lt;br/&gt;
Question: How can they be used more effectively?&lt;br/&gt;
Sub questions: what is more effective; how are they used already; how do children respond to them&lt;br/&gt;
Strategy: survey of literature and practice in school

''Topic: creativity''&lt;br/&gt;
Question: How can I be more creative in my teaching?&lt;br/&gt;
Sub questions: What is creativity; what models of creativity might I try to develop; how do pupils respond to more creative approaches &lt;br/&gt;
Strategy: action research 

Both these examples could become more manageable investigations if they were narrowed down further, for example 'How can I be more creative in my teaching of 6th form students?' or 'How can they be used more effectively with my Y7 class?'.

No matter what the style of assignment it will need to include something about the literature which we turn to on Supervising:the literature.

author: Michael Hammond

==Supervising: the literature==

There is a vast amount of literature on teaching and learning – much more than students probably ever thought – but much less on teaching Computing as a subject. They will need to use literature creatively. For example, some of the literature may be about teaching a different subject but is still relevant – though the student researcher should tell us why it is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;this study is about science teaching, however, the points they make about practical experiments relate to my experiences of teaching ICT because ICT is a similarly practical subject….&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other literature is general. For example, there is a great deal about interactive white boards (IWB) but very little about using the IWB in teaching ICT. It is fine for ICT students to use this literature, but look to see if they are missing something about the context in which we teach ICT. Again, some of the literature may relate to primary schools, some to higher education. They may want to draw on this work, for example Higher Education has probably been in the forefront of developing VLEs as lecturers often deal with very large classes (200 students or more) and many students who cannot physically attend campus. They will need to assess the relevance of these accounts to supporting smaller classes of pupils learning ICT in secondary schools. 

There are different types of literature which carry a different status. For example, academic journals and professional resources, and what we often call ‘grey literature’, such as online reports on particular projects. They should be able to identify where the sources they use belong and to reflect on the authorship of articles – do authors have a special position which means they are likely to stress the benefits more than the drawbacks of a particular approach? 

Writing about what literature tells us is an art. Your students’ job is to describe briefly what the author has said, to indicate what kind of study was carried out and comment on what was said. For example, here one student summarises a comment from an article she had read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Glover and Miller (2004) in a study of science and MFL teachers, identify three stages in the use of IWB (or IAWs as they called them at the time): the first to support everyday classroom teaching; the second to stimulate interactivity with the class; the third is to use the IWB to present the lesson in new ways. &quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This student has summarised a longer point quite succinctly and provided a comment on it. As the student reads more articles they may want to organise their review around themes. For example, this student introduces her review of VLEs and highlights that she will write about opportunities, difficulties and conclusions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In this first section I will report on what has been said about the advantages of VLEs and the opportunities they offer both teachers and students. These cover issues such as storage, interaction and assessment. In the second section I will look at the difficulties teachers and students have with VLEs and these cover technical access and preferred styles of teaching and learning. Finally, I will summarise the two sections and argue that VLEs seem to have a limited but important potential for ICT departments.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In reviewing articles students may want to quote key phrases or particularly striking ideas. They should use quotes selectively and not leave them to stand alone, in other words: Quote - Explain – Critique. This student gives the quote, explains its importance and offers a view of her own:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Loveless (2007, p 1) argues 'creativity can be regarded as not only a quality found in exceptional individuals, but also as an essential life skill through which people can develop their potential to use their imagination to express themselves, and make original and valued choices in their lives.' 
This shows that creativity is a much wider concept than making or performing art. A difficulty, however, is that creativity has become so wide a concept that it could cover almost any context in which learners are engaged in learning.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As students carry out reading, they should look for similarity and difference between what different writers have said. Key phrases for bringing together themes in the research are:

* A consistent theme of the papers is that …
* An often reported difficulty is …
* Those arguing against (VLEs) often suggest that …
* Implications for classroom use of (VLEs) seem to be…
* The case for (formative assessment) clearly rests on…

Students might also report on the extent of literature and some of the difficulties encountered in getting hold of articles. For example, this student discussed problems in the literature on VLEs: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;As the use of VLEs in school, and their use in the teaching of ICT in particular, is a relatively new field there has not been a lot of literature to access. There does not seem a great deal of consistency in the findings and much of the work has been carried out by enthusiasts and we must be cautious in accepting the findings.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition to literature your assignment will often ask the student teacher to carry out some data collection.

==Supervising: collecting data==

===Collecting empirical data: Interviews, survey and questionnaire===

Many assignments give students opportunities to find out what is happening in their school(s). This gives an opportunity to contrast what the literature is saying with what teachers and pupils are saying about a topic. This is really important; the literature is often general or talking about contexts with which students are not familiar. No-one knows your student’s school, classes, pupils as well as your student and the teachers who teach there. 

Collecting data may involve questionnaire survey, interviews, observations, all of which are covered in research methods books. The key here is to keep the investigation small scale – the study does not need to be representative of the school but should show awareness of, and explain sampling strategies. In many cases talking to all ICT teachers in a school is quite feasible and the focus for the investigation might be the department or, more narrowly, teaching at a particular key stage. Students should make sure all references to school, teachers and pupils are anonymised in their reporting and to keep anything told to them confidential. In their reporting the student will need to say how they collected the data – a chat rather than formal interview is fine but say it, then what they did with their data. In this example a student teacher is looking at creativity in ‘Blackberry’ school:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;“While working in Blackberry school I spoke with three teachers in my department, one with a lot of experience of working in the school and two who were relatively new to teaching. I carried half hour semi structured interviews with each about creativity in ICT lessons. I asked what they they thought creativity meant; how it was best developed and the difficulties they had experience in developing creativity. I made notes of each interview and looked for consistency and contrast within these notes.

Regarding the first, each teacher put a different meaning onto creativity. One associated it very much with being practical and being ‘arty’. He felt “most of the creativity gets done in Drama and Art”. The other two teachers referred to an in-service event they had attended and saw it as much more about pupils making choices in their learning. They contrasted creative approaches with rote learning. They were worried about the lack of creativity in some classes. One said “the coursework should be creative but very often it is jumping through hoops, we need to look at that”. I could see that there was a difference in teachers’ understanding of creativity and I need to explore this further…. “&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the same way if they have spoken to pupils tell us who they spoke to? Where did they speak to them? What did they find out? Respect confidentiality and do not engage in discussions of individual teachers. This student carried out a discussion on assessment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I set up a short focus group with five pupils from my class. They were Y8 s (three boys and two girls) and represented a range of ability. I asked them what they saw as the value of assessment in ICT, what types of assessment they found useful, what worries they had about assessment; and what suggestions they had for me to develop assessment practice with them. This was a half hour open ended discussion. I made notes about the meeting and looked for consistency and contrast in these opinions. There was a much greater consensus between pupils, given this was a focus group rather than a set of individual interviews. On the first, they felt that the value of assessment was that it should let you know ‘how well you are doing’. However in practice they felt …”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If students are carrying out observations make sure they have thought about a ‘protocol' to record their observations (e.g. at a minimum three columns time, teacher activity, pupil activity) and have a clear question in mind before they start. 

===Summarising what they have found out===

Different students have done this in different ways. Some have made a contrast between different sources of information as they have gone along, some have tended to do this at the end. Some find a table format very useful. For example, a student might create a table in which to summarise findings from the literature and from the teachers and pupils to whom they had spoken. This would make opportunities for triangulation and comparison of different sources more explicit.

==Supervising: writing==

===Writing: Do’s and Do not’s===

In no particular order here are some do’s and do not’s in use in one partnership

* Do write in full, do not use contractions. Write it is not rather than it isn’t; it cannot rather than it can’t, I will rather than I’ll; do not rather than don’t.  
* Do reference properly. You are an information specialist and understand how consistent referencing of material is important including full referencing for web resources. You should ensure your referencing and bibliography follow the Harvard Referencing style. For examples go to the library page at: 
* www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/main/help/guidespublications/bib_cit/ 
* Do reflect on what you quote, explain why the point the author is making is important for you, but be prepared to critique it.  
* Do use your introduction to clearly outline what the problem is you are addressing and stick to it. Do not begin by talking about IWBs and end up talking about assessment. 
* Do organise your text into paragraphs (group of sentences with a common theme, think about a minimum of 4 sentences to a paragraph.) Be consistent, break each paragraph with a double line break. Do not put lots of text together without a paragraph or be inconsistent with your breaking. 
* Do look at the model assignments from last year; identify what makes them Masters Level. 
* Do write in the first person where this fits naturally. For example, “this study is going to look at pupil behaviour in a Year 9 Computing lesson. I am interested in behaviour in Year 9 as I have observed so far that this is the year group that is most challenging of authority and teacher instructions.” Do not use convoluted constructions such as “in the opinion of the researcher…” 
* Do get someone to proof read your work and ask them to check your apostrophes, punctuation, spelling and typos. You cannot proof read your own work properly. Do not hand your assignment in before someone has done this for you. Check your use of it’s (it is), its (possessive); students (they); a student’s (his / her); students’ (their). 
* Do read through your text for meaning. Use short sentences where you can and keep it simple. Avoid clumsy or redundant phrases. For example, this is long winded and clumsy: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Open ended questioning within a class environment would allow the teacher to find out and collect evidence for what pupils know and understand about a topic and, more than this, allows for pupils’ misconceptions to be made clear to everyone and to be highlighted by the teacher asking the questions. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The same idea is expressed more clearly as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Open ended questioning allows the teacher to find out what pupils know. Moreover it can give insight into pupils’ misconceptions.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* Do attend any special writing sessions, do not underestimate what is involved 
* Do be creative in your use of literature, do not ignore literature if it is not specifically about ICT. 
* Do ‘buddy up’ with someone on the course, read each other’s work and offer feedback, do not keep your writing to yourself. 
* Do put it in your own words (unless you are quoting), do not copy from an article and not acknowledge it. Do not think plagiarism will go unnoticed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section looks at the contribution of research to the teaching of ICT as a subject. There are at least three reasons why you might want to look at, and review, research: 

* intellectual curiosity: 
A critical review of the literature will enable you to understand what lies behind your trainee teachers attempts to learn to teach ICT and consider this in the light of general principles of teaching and learning. Further, by considering the research on ICT as a subject in its own right you, and your trainee teachers, will understand much better the reasons behind the evolution of the subject and the critical questions which teaching the subject seeks to address. 

* signposting implications for the classroom: 
Accessing the knowledge base will give ideas on what has been carried out in the past, what is worth trying now and what are likely outcomes for teaching. For example, we all know that young people use ICT outside of school, but the extent of this use might not be known and the implications might not be clear without reviewing and accessing relevant research. A knowledge base cannot tell us how to develop our teaching but it can signpost opportunities and difficulties. 

* accessing models of carrying out research: 
A key role of initial teacher education is to encourage trainee teachers to carry out their own research and draw their own implications for their teaching. Accessing past research will provide them with models for doing this. It will also provide you with models for your own research. ICT is a new subject and has only been offered as a PGCE specialism since 1997. There is a huge amount written about ICT in general but very little on teaching ICT as a subject. There is huge wider literature on which to draw and an enviable opportunity for you to set the research agenda for ICT as a subject. 

The following page looks at accessing different types of research.

==Accessing different types of research==

Commentators have classified research in different ways. We have taken three main categories though in practice there is, and perhaps should be, considerable overlap between each.

==Refereed academic research==
Generally undertaken by academics, this research appears in academic journals or conference proceedings. It is aimed at the academic community and only published after extensive peer review. Its focus is often on more general and long term issues. It seeks to review past literature so as the work it describes can be placed within a research tradition. Six international journals, particularly influential in the UK research community, are: 
* British Journal of Educational Technology
* Computers and Education
* Education and Information Technologies
* Journal of Computer Assisted Learning
* Journal of Technology, Pedagogy and Education, formerly JITTE
* Learning, Media &amp; Technology (incorporating Education, Communication &amp; Information).
You can easily access information about these journals via the WWW, however you will probably find your library has a gateway for electronic access to some, if not all the journals, which gives you full text access to articles. An underused resource for tracking academic outputs related to ICT is the ESRC Social Sciences Repository (http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre). Given the wide range of research which ESRC supports it is unsurprisingly not straight forward to locate particular work and you may be best just searching by education. 

==Professional studies research== 
Generally undertaken by academics or practitioner researchers, professional studies research often appears in edited volumes (e.g. Kennewell et al 2003; Kennewell et al 2007) or in professional journals and more magazine style journals . Such research is generally aimed at addressing more immediate issues faced by the profession but will often try to draw out general principles for teaching and may make fairly extensive reference to other work. However, it is less concerned with detailed discussion of research methodology or research traditions. 

==Commissioned Research==
Many private or public bodies will commission evaluation studies in order to receive feedback on immediate questions. This research is aimed at particular audiences and, while drawing on wider research, will often make less reference to past literature or engage in detailed discussion of research methodologies.

''The British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (Becta)'' (http://www.becta.org.uk) was the UK Government's lead agency for ICT in education and its web site carried a wide range of resources for teachers. Becta also sponsored and carries out its own research for a wide range of audiences. For example, it produced a digest of research for professionals ‘What the Research Says’; large scale empirical studies (e.g. the Impact 2 work reported in Harrison, Comber, Fisher et al 2002a; Somekh, Lewin, Mavers et al 2002b), literature reviews (e.g.Cox, Abbott, Webb et al 2004) and evaluation of smaller scale initiatives and projects (e.g. Priest, Coe, Evershed et al 2004). It also hosted a discussion forum for research matters. 

An area of their web site was dedicated to publicising research they have supported or sponsored (http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh). Via Becta you may arrive at the Test Bed project site, this was supported by Becta but has a site of its own http://www.evaluation.icttestbed.org.uk. The project focused on ICT implementation in three areas of social disadvantage. The 28 ICT Test Bed Schools and departments in three colleges had access to high levels of ICT hardware and appropriate software, as well as support from the project. Project summaries are included on the site. 

''Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED)'' (http://www.ofsted.gov.uk) is another resource of research into ICT mostly aimed at policy makers and the profession at large. It publishes reviews into the teaching of ICT and the impact of government ICT initiatives. 

''Futurelab'' (http://www.futurelab.org.uk) is a not-for-profit organisation working with partners to generate new ideas about teaching with computers and carrying out its own research and support for teachers. Again it publishes reports and has commissioned some influential literature reviews.

      <text xml:space="preserve">E-safety is a developing and significant issue in education at this time. Combined with the developing use of internet-based technology in school, the increased use of social networking by pupils out of school and the apparent increase in welfare related incidents such as bullying and grooming, it is important that all trainees are aware of the issues.

The most significant recent publication is Safer Children in a Digital World: the report of the Byron Review. The Byron Review (under the Chairmanship of Dr. Tanya Byron) is an independent review informs children, adults and policy makers how the internet and video games might affect young people. An extremely useful summary of the Byron review has been made by John Pearson on the TTRB website.

The Byron Report makes direct reference to the TDA's responsibility to make materials available for ITE tutors and mentors and specifically stating the need to assess trainees' e-safety skills against the Professional Standards.

The response of the TDA has been to promote a number of resources: TDA e-safety

The most significant resource for guiding the introduction of e-safety to trainee teachers is Know IT All for trainee teachers The pack contains: an introductory presentation; a copy of the Jenny's Story DVD; a range of resources and references to support in-school activity and written assignments. The package was distributed to all HEIs by the TDA in 2008.

What is Cyberbullying?

Let's Fight It Together 

&quot;There is a concern that e-safety activities and guidance always seem to focus on raising awareness of the potential harm to young people that can arise through the internet and strategies for dealing with it, but gives little attention to the harm that users - children and adults, can do to themselves or others through irresponsible use of technology. 

&quot;It seems to me that tutors perhaps also have a role in reminding trainees of their need to be responsible users. What seems great fun when out with friends might not look so good to pupils and their parents or prospective or current employers when it is on YouTube for all to see!&quot; Margaret Danby, project manager, ICT Subject Resource Network.

Tutors should also be aware that trainees should be advised not to reproduce images of their pupils and pupils' work that might identify the pupils or make the pupils more vulnerable to bullying.

With many routes to QTS having associated Masters level (NQF level 5) accreditation associated with them, it is important that trainees have guidance in obtaining references. It is also important they can cite and then reference those resources, authoritative documents, reports of research and academic work in an appropriate and consistent format. These documents represent the current thinking in the area of e-safety. 

Safeguarding children in a digital world. This excellent publication provides an overview of e-safety issues and is a good starting point to look at the research evidence and links to government policy including Every Child Matters. It also makes useful suggestions for policy and practice, as does the publication E-safety, revised, (DTI, 2005) UK Children Go Online. This report covers the key findings of 9 -19 year olds use of the internet and whilst some of the findings concern the digital divide, many are pertinent to the safety of young people. It contains some worrying statistics on pornography and inappropriate communication (ESRC, 2005). For further details on how the internet is being used see E-safety: the experience in English educational establishments, a report by Charlotte Barrow and Gary Heywood-Everett on an audit of e-safety practices (Becta, 2005).

Signposts to safety (Becta, 2004), makes some very practical suggestions and links to the National Curriculum not only for teaching within discrete ICT lessons but also PSHCE. In addition, Becta offer a number of helpful guides such as Safeguarding children online. To keep abreast of these helpful guides visit the e-safety area of the Becta website.

Available from the Association of Teachers and Lecturers is a useful guide Your safety net: exploring the issues of safe learning on the Internet which strikes a balance in its advice between e-safety issues and allowing children to be confident users (ATL, 2002). The guide is free to members and membership is free to trainee teachers.

      <comment>/* Generalized linear model */ Added a bit about GLMS.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the most commonly studied systems in neuroscience is the stimulus-response system. In this framework, a system is provided with an input, called a [[wikipedia:stimulus_(physiology)|stimulus]], and the resulting response of the system is measured. Some typical examples of stimuli are visual scenes, auditory recordings, or [[wikipedia:electric current|electric current]] (if a neural system is being stimulated directly); typical examples of responses include changes in [[wikipedia:behavior|behavior]], [[wikipedia:membrane potential|membrane potential]] or [[wikipedia:Neural coding#time-dependent firing rate|firing rate]] (if a cell [or group of cells] is being recorded from directly). The general goal is to find a [[wikipedia:function_(mathematics)|function]] that accurately describes the relation between stimulus and response.

==Single-neuron systems==
In the single neuron system one attempts to characterize how an [[wikipedia:Electric current|electric current]] input to a single [[wikipedia:Neuron|neuron]] determines the [[wikipedia:Probability|probability]] that the cell will fire an [[wikipedia:Action potential|action potential]], or spike. A single input consists of a time-dependent current, and a single output consists of a sequence of spikes at various times. By examining the relation between spike times and the preceding stimuli, one can attempt to identify stimulus features that drive the cell towards action potential generation. The neuron in question can either be real or simulated.

===Spike-triggered average===
One method for relating input current to spike probability is to characterize the average stimulus over a certain window of duration &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; preceding each spike. The collection of all stimuli that lead to spike generation is called the spike-triggered ensemble, and the [[wikipedia:Mean|mean]] of the spike-triggered ensemble is called the [[wikipedia:Spike-triggered average|spike-triggered average]]&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, et al. Spike-triggered neural characterization. Journal of Vision (2006) 6:4(13)&lt;/ref&gt;. If one considers the spike-triggered ensemble to represent a [[wikipedia:Probability distribution|probability distribution]] over important stimuli, then the spike-triggered average is an estimate of the first [[wikipedia:Moment_(mathematics)|moment]] of that distribution. Intuitively, the shape of the spike-triggered average supposedly corresponds with the shape of the primary feature for which the neuron is selective.

Having obtained the spike-triggered average, one can then perform a [[wikipedia:Dimensionality_reduction|dimensionality reduction]] on the stimulus space in order to describe every possible stimulus by the amount it overlaps with the spike-triggered average. If an arbitrary stimulus is described by a vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s} = (I_{t-n}, I_{t-n + 1}, ..., I_{t-1}, I_{t})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_{t-i}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric current at the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; th time step before the spike, then this dimensionality reduction represents a mapping &lt;math&gt;F: \boldsymbol{s} \rightarrow s_0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s = \boldsymbol{s} \cdot \boldsymbol{s}_0 / f_s&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the [[wikipedia:scalar|scalar]]-valued [[wikipedia:Projection_(mathematics)|projection]] of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}&lt;/math&gt; onto the spike-triggered average &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}_0&lt;/math&gt;, normalized by the [[wikipedia:Sampling_rate|sampling frequency]] &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt;. We can write the probability of a spike occurring in response to a stimulus, &lt;math&gt;P(spike|s_0)&lt;/math&gt; using [[wikipedia:Bayes'_theorem|Bayes' law]]:

&lt;math&gt;
P(spike|s_0) = \frac{P(s_0|spike)P(spike)}{P(s_0)} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side of this equation can be easily calculated from the data, as &lt;math&gt;P(s_o|spike)&lt;/math&gt; is spike-triggered ensemble projected onto &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(s_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the entire stimulus ensemble projected onto &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P(spike)&lt;/math&gt; is the average firing rate across all stimuli. Thus, to calculate spike probability for a given stimulus, one first filters the stimulus with the spike-triggered average, and then passes the filtered stimulus through a nonlinearity &lt;math&gt;P(spike|s)&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the final probability. This is an example of the [[wikipedia:Linear-nonlinear-Poisson_cascade_model|linear-nonlinear-poisson]] (LNP) model for action potential generation in a neuron.

===Spike-triggered covariance===
It is often the case that the spike-triggered average provides an insufficient characterization of the response properties of the neuron &lt;ref&gt;Slee, S. J., et al. Two-Dimensional Time Coding in the Auditory Brainstem. The Journal of Neuroscience (2005). 25(43):9978–9988&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, consider a neuron that responds both to large increases and large decreases in current. If a [[wikipedia:White noise|white noise]] stimulus is presented to the neuron, the spike-triggered ensemble will consist of an approximately even mixture of stimuli with large increases in current and stimuli with large decreases in current. The spike-triggered average, however, will consist of a single current trace in which little change is present (because the increases and decreases cancel each other out in the averaging process), thus failing to capture the relevant stimulus features that drive the neuron. However, if one examines the second [[wikipedia:Moment (mathematics)|moment]] of the spike-triggered ensemble, called the [[wikipedia:Spike-triggered covariance|spike-triggered covariance]], one can often recover the characteristics of the features important to the neuron. Spike-triggered covariance analysis is related to [[wikipedia:Principal component analysis|principal component analysis]] (PCA) in that it captures the directions in [[wikipedia:Vector space|stimulus space]] with the highest [[wikipedia:Variance|variance]]. 

The reasoning behind spike-triggered covariance analysis is more intuitive in two dimensions. Thus, consider a [[wikipedia:Sine|sinusoidal]] electric current stimulus in which the only parameters that vary are the frequency and amplitude of the stimulus. Each spike-triggered stimulus in the spike-triggered ensemble can then be represented by a point in the plane, with one axis corresponding to frequency and the other to amplitude. The spike-triggered ensemble is represented by the collection of these points, each of whose corresponding stimulus caused the neuron to [[wikipedia:Action potential|spike]]. Loosely speaking, spike-triggered covariance analysis compares the shape of the spike-triggered ensemble with the shape of the entire stimulus ensemble (as represented in the plane). Thus, by looking not just at the average spike-triggering stimulus, but at the shape of the entire ensemble, spike-triggered covariance analysis can more accurately capture the dynamical properties of stimuli relevant to the neuron.

Mathematically, spike-triggered covariance analysis finds the directions &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}_1, \boldsymbol{s}_2, ..., \boldsymbol{s}_m&lt;/math&gt; in stimulus space corresponding to the directions of highest [[wikipedia:variance|variance]] in the spike-triggered ensemble. &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}_1, \boldsymbol{s}_2, ..., \boldsymbol{s}_m&lt;/math&gt; are determined by finding the [[wikipedia:eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of the difference between the spike-triggered [[wikipedia:covariance matrix|covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and the prior covariance matrix (that is, the covariance matrix of the entire stimulus ensemble) &lt;math&gt;C^{prior}&lt;/math&gt;. The eigenvector of &lt;math&gt;C - C^{prior}&lt;/math&gt; with the largest eigenvalue is the direction that explains the highest amount of variance, the eigenvector with the second largest eigenvalue is the direction that explains the second highest amount of variance, and so on. Arbitrarily many directions can be used to describe the stimulus space, but typically there will be a point at which adding more stimulus directions contributes only a negligible increase in the predictive capability of the model.

Determining spike probability using covariance analysis proceeds in a manner quite similar to using the spike-triggered average, except that more dimensions are used in the stimulus description. Thus, one first computes &lt;math&gt;s_1 = \boldsymbol{s} \cdot \boldsymbol{s}_1/f_s, s_2 = \boldsymbol{s} \cdot \boldsymbol{s}_2/f_s&lt;/math&gt;, and so forth. Doing this for all stimuli in the spike-triggered ensemble and in the entire stimulus ensemble result in the distributions &lt;math&gt;P(s_1,s_2,...,s_m|spike)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(s_1,s_2,...,s_m)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Combining these together with [[wikipedia:Bayes'_theorem|Bayes' law]] yields

&lt;math&gt;
P(spike|s_1,s_2,...,s_m) = \frac{P(s_1,s_2,...,s_m|spike)P(spike)}{P(s_1,s_2,...,s_m)} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, when using spike-triggered covariance analysis, one takes advantage of more stimulus features than the spike-triggered average, therefore allowing a richer description of the properties of stimuli likely to yield a spike.

===Generalized linear model===

Whereas the linear filters (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}_0, \boldsymbol{s}_1, ... &lt;/math&gt;) for the LNP model of spike-generation are computed in a deterministic way when using spike-triggered averages and spike-triggered covariances, in the [[wikipedia:Generalized_linear_model|generalized linear model]] (GLM), these filters are determined under a probabilistic framework. Specifically, the filters are chosen via [[wikipedia:Maximum_likelihood|maximum likelihood]], that is, the filters are chosen that maximize the probability of the observed dataset. Importantly, in the GLM framework, the likelihood function is [[wikipedia:Logarithmically_convex_function|log-convex]], and so a global maximum can be attained, even in a high-dimensional filter space &lt;ref&gt;Liam Paninski. Maximum likelihood estimation of cascade point-process neural encoding models. Network: Comput. Neural Syst. 15 (2004) 243–262&lt;/ref&gt;. The firing rate of a neuron in response to a stimulus under the GLM model is given by

&lt;math&gt;
\lambda(t) = exp(\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{s} + \boldsymbol{h} \cdot \boldsymbol{y} + \sum_i \boldsymbol{I}_i \cdot \boldsymbol{y}_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{k}&lt;/math&gt; is a stimulus filter, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{h}&lt;/math&gt; is a filter for the cell's spike history, and &lt;math&gt;\{\boldsymbol{I}_i\}&lt;/math&gt; are the spike-history filters for other relevant cells. Thus, the GLM provides a natural framework for incorporating not only stimulus, but also spike-history dependence of several interacting cells in a network &lt;ref&gt;Pillow, et al. Spatio-temporal correlations and visual signalling in a complete neuronal population. Nature Letters (2008) 454(21):995-999&lt;/ref&gt;.

Cycles is a wonderful renderer, capable of some exquisite lighting effects. However, sooner or later, you will encounter the problem of '''fireflies''', which are isolated bright pixels scattered over various parts of the image. Unlike simple ''noise'' (which can be reduced by increasing the number of render samples, or alternatively by simple filtering), fireflies are caused by numerical instabilities in the rendering computation, because after all computers can only calculate the formulas to a finite precision. They seem an inevitable consequence of trying to use realistic physics formulas to create our renders.

But are they so inevitable? In fact there are various tricks and tweaks we can use to keep them out of our renders. There are pros and cons to each technique (in terms of the amount of work involved and unwanted side-effects), so it is up to you to decide which to use and when.

Fireflies tend not to afflict the simplest renders. This means that it takes work to come up with a tutorial example sufficiently complex to exhibit them. If you already have one of your own renders which is being plagued with fireflies, and you came here hoping to find a fix, then great—you can skip ahead to the part with the fixes. Otherwise, please have some patience while we construct an example.

{{Clear}}

== Making An Example ==
This example arose out of a real model I was trying to construct: a house with [[w:Louver|louvred]] windows made out of frosted glass. Some interaction involving light coming in through the panes of one window, bouncing around the diffuse walls of the room and out another window, together with the combination of shaders making up the glass material, led to the appearance of the fireflies. This example will cut the situation to the bare minimum I could come up with to exhibit the problem, namely a pair of adjoining rooms with two windows.

[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesExample1.png|thumb|Loop cut to demarcate rooms (view from underside)]]
Start a new Blender document. Switch the renderer to Cycles. Select the default cube, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into Edit mode. Scale the cube out horizontally a bit so the room is not so narrow and tall. Switch to face-select mode. Select the bottom face and {{B3D:N2P/Do|DEL}}ete it. I found that the room needed a ceiling to show the fireflies, but not a floor, so why not get rid of it?

Give your cube a Solidify modifier, so the walls have a nonzero thickness. The exact thickness doesn’t matter.

[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesExample2.png|thumb|Wall filled in between rooms.]]
Next, make a single loop cut {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|RKEY}} around the sides of the shape to define the boundary between the front and rear rooms. Then press {B3D:N2P/Do|FKEY}}, and the vertices of the new loop should be joined to form a new face which is the wall between the rooms.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesExample3.png|thumb|Windows and doorway cut into walls.]]
Now we need to make holes for the windows, and for a doorway between the rooms. Still in face-select mode, select the front face (the one you see in {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}} view), and {{B3D:N2P/Do|IKEY}}nset it a little way. If you inset it too far, you may find the height gets too small, so after the initial insetting, select just the middle face and scale it horizontally {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY|XKEY}} to make a reasonable-looking window.

Do the same with the wall on the right side of the front room, and also on the wall between the rooms. A ''real'' doorway would extend to the floor, but our simple hole in the wall is sufficient for this exercise.

{{Clear}}

=== Add The Windows ===
[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesExample4.png|thumb|Front window with louvres.]]
Add a new horizontal plane. Shrink it along the Y-axis to 20% of its length along the X-axis. Add a couple of array modifiers: one along the Z-axis with a constant offset of something like 0.2 and a count of about a half a dozen, and another along the X-axis with a constant offset around 2.2 and a count of 4. Position your resulting array of louvres within the hole for the front window.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesExample5.png|thumb|Recipe for fireflies]]

Before going any further, we mustn’t forget to make the windows out of frosted glass. Assign a new material to your window object. Bring up the Node Editor, and set up a material for the window glass as at right. Set the roughness on the Glossy BSDF to zero, but note the small, but nonzero Roughness setting on the Refraction BSDF: I deliberately tuned this to maximize the production of fireflies. A zero setting will make them go away, but that defeats the point of this exercise, doesn’t it?

(The room walls can be left at the default diffuse material assigned by Blender.)

After setting up your window material, duplicate your louvres object and rotate and position the copy within the hole for the side window. Leave the hole between the rooms empty (it ''is'' supposed to be a ''doorway'', after all).

{{Clear}}

=== Completing The Recipe ===
As the final part of our recipe for fireflies, change the type of the Lamp object to Sun, and change its angle to close to horizontal so it will shine in through the side window. Give it a strength of 3. Position the camera to look directly into the front window. Also increase the number of render samples to 100; that should be sufficient to keep down the noise.

So, in summary, we have sunlight coming in low through louvres in a side window in the front room, bouncing around between front and back rooms, and exiting through louvres in the front window, the louvres all being made of lightly-frosted glass.

If all goes well, hitting {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render should produce an image like at right.

{{Clear}}

== Fixing The Problem 1: Renderer Tweaks ==
[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesRenderSettings.png|thumb|Relevant renderer settings]]

OK, now that we can create the problem, how do we solve it?

Probably the first things to try are one or two renderer settings. Look for the Sampling and Light Paths panels in the Render [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]] context, as at right. In the Sampling panel, look for the “Clamp” field. If nonzero, this imposes a maximum value on the light-intensity calculations at each pixel. Normally 1.0 corresponds to full white, but some points can be brighter than this. Try changing the default 0 value to, say, 3, and rerender.

In our simple example, this should be enough to fix the fireflies. However, I have come across a case or two where this reduced the intensity of some bright indirect lighting, leading to a more subdued appearance for the overall render.

So let’s try the next thing. Set the Clamp back to 0, and this time look in the Light Paths panel, for the “No Caustics” checkbox. [[w:Caustic_%28optics%29|Caustics]] can be an important part of realistic lighting effects, but if your scene doesn’t need them, disabling them can help get rid of fireflies, and perhaps speed up the render as well. However, the tooltip for this checkbox warns that the result can be a darker image.

In our simple case, checking this box ''does'' work.

The third renderer setting to try is the field just below the No Caustics checkbox, labelled “Filter Glossy”. This applies deliberate blurring to certain kinds of light bounces, sacrificing a bit of lighting accuracy for the sake of avoiding fireflies. And again, in our case, this option works: setting it to a value of, say, 1, does indeed fix the fireflies.

But, at some point, you may find that none of these three techniques will work for you: they may make no difference to the render, or may cause unacceptable loss of quality in places. After all, being settings that apply to the render as a whole, they can be something of a blunt instrument.

So for our next fix, we will need to resort to the compositor.

== Fixing The Problem 2: The Despeckle Filter ==
The approach to fixing the fireflies problem is to apply some kind of processing to the rendered image. If you are familiar with image-editing programs like Gimp or Photoshop, you will have come across the ''despeckle filter'', whose job is precisely to smooth out random dots that don’t fit in with the rest of the image. In principle you could use an image-editing program to touch up your renders (and some people producing professional-quality renders do), but what happens if you are rendering an animation? Imagine having to fix up hundreds or thousands of frames by hand!

Blender, too, has a bunch of image-processing operations available in its compositor, including a Despeckle filter. And the nice thing is, these operations can be applied automatically after rendering each frame.

[[File:Blender268CyclesDefaultCompositingNodes.png|thumb]]
Open up a Node Editor [[File:Blender269NodeEditorIcon.png]] window in your Blender document (you can reuse the Timeline [[File:Blender269TimelineIcon.png]] window at the bottom of the default window layout, just make it a bit taller). Look for the icons [[File:Blender268NodeEditorTypeIcons.png]] indicating what type of nodes to edit: click on the one showing little layers or sheets, representing the compositor (in the middle in Blender 2.68, on the left in earler Blender versions). Immediately you should see a “Use Nodes” checkbox appear to the right of these icons: check that to enable node-based compositing. You should get a default node setup like at right.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesCompositingSimpleDespeckle.png|thumb]]
Move the two existing nodes a bit further apart, to make way for a new one in-between. Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}} to bring up the Add menu, and look in the “Filter” submenu for the “Despeckle” entry. Move the new Despeckle node into the gap you previously cleared, and if you position it right, it should automatically connect itself into the chain like this.

{{Clear}}

'''To see the effect of your changes''', switch the 3D view window to an Image Editor window. Make sure the image being shown is the “Render Result”. Next to the menu for selecting the image slot (which should be showing “Slot 1”), there is a menu for selecting which layer of the image to show: [[File:Blender268ImageEditorLayerMenu.png]]. “RenderLayer” is the raw output from the renderer, while “Composite” is the result after going through the compositor. By switching between these two, you should see that the default Despeckle filter settings have removed some of the fireflies, but not all. I found if I reduced the “Threshold” filter parameter from its default 0.5 to something like 0.1, then all the fireflies did indeed disappear.

=== What The Despeckle Filter Does ===
The despeckle filter is designed specifically to get rid of isolated anomalous pixels. This is unlike blur filters, which average a bunch of pixels together, and can spread the firefly across a larger area instead of removing it.

But what do those “Threshold” and “Neighbor” parameters actually mean? The following explanation was put together from studying the Blender source code, mainly &lt;TT&gt;{{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|/source/blender/compositor/operations/COM_DespeckleOperation.cpp}}&lt;/TT&gt;.

The target pixel being processed is compared with its eight neighbours. However, these neighbours are not treated equally: each one is given a ''weight'' that governs its relative importance to the computation. The horizontal and vertical neighbours each have a weight of 1, while the diagonal neighbours are each given a lower weight of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; (approximately 0.7). This reflects the fact that they are slightly further away along the diagonals, therefore they have correspondingly less influence on the outcome.

For each neighbour pixel, the “Threshold” input parameter is compared against the difference between each of the neighbour’s R, G and B components (normalized to 0 being black and 1 being maximum intensity) and those of the target pixel; if any of the corresponding pairs of components have a difference exceeding the threshold, then the neighbour pixel value is accumulated onto an average (weighted by neighbour weights) that the code calls &lt;TT&gt;color_mid_ok&lt;/TT&gt;—the presumed “correct” value of the target pixel, if you like. All neighbour pixels, whether within or outside the threshold, are accumulated onto another (also weighted) average called &lt;TT&gt;color_mid&lt;/TT&gt;. The value &lt;TT&gt;w&lt;/TT&gt; is the total weight of all neighbours that contributed to &lt;TT&gt;color_mid_ok&lt;/TT&gt;.

Then the value of &lt;TT&gt;w&lt;/TT&gt; is divided by the total weights of all neighbouring pixels (4 × 1 + 4 × &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;), to produce a fraction in the range [0.0 .. 1.0], and the resulting fraction compared to the “Neighbor” input parameter. Also the difference between the components of &lt;TT&gt;color_mid&lt;/TT&gt; (the average of all the neighbours) and those of the original target pixel are compared to the “Threshold”. If either comparison returns less than or equal, then the pixel is considered not to need correction. But if ''both'' comparisons are greater, then the target pixel is adjusted from its initial value towards the &lt;TT&gt;color_mid_ok&lt;/TT&gt; average, according to the “Fac” input socket value. If “Fac” is 1.0 (the default), then the pixel is completely replaced with &lt;TT&gt;color_mid_ok&lt;/TT&gt;; otherwise it becomes the corresponding blend of this and its original value.

“Fac” can be used to fine-tune the effect of the Despeckle. For example, if this was fed from an inverted edge-detection (“Kirsch”) filter, then it can be used to reduce the effect along sharp edges, which are otherwise likely to confuse the filter.

By learning how to “work smart” together, we hope we can leave the world in a better state than it was when we arrived.

Indeed, humans have learned from each other forever.  But for a long time — until the advent of the Web and widespread access to digital media — schools have had an effective monopoly on the business of learning.  Now, with access to open educational resources and free or inexpensive communication platforms, groups of people can learn together outside as well as inside formal institutions. All of this prompted us to reconsider the meaning of [[w:en:peer learning|''peer learning'']] .

The Peeragogy Handbook isn’t a normal book, it is an example of the kind of work that’s only just possible now.  It is an evolving guide, and it tells a collaboratively written story: it’s one that you can help write.  Using this book, you will develop new norms for the groups you work with, whether online, offline or both.  Every section includes exercises and research methods that you can apply to build and sustain strong and exciting collaborations.  When you read the book, you will get to know the authors, and you will see how we have applied these ideas: in classrooms, in research, in business, and more.

You’ll meet Julian, who put the ideas to work as one of the directors of a housing association; Roland, a professional journalist and change-maker; Charlie, a language teacher and writer who works with experimental media for fun and profit; and Charlotte, an indie publisher who wants to get better at what she does by helping others learn how to do it well too — as well as many other contributors from around the world.

The book focuses on techniques for building a strong group, organizing a learning space, doing cooperative work, and conducting effective peer assessment.  These major sections are complemented by a catalog of design patterns, and notes on relevant technologies.  The book is first and foremost a practical guide.  It will change the way you think about getting things done.  The following brief section is a guide to using the handbook itself; after that, we provide  a succinct overview of the contents of the book which will help you begin thinking like a peeragogue.  As you work through the chapters that follow, you will master these techniques.  Once again, future editions can include your voice, so don’t hesitate to get in touch with comments or questions.

==Some definitions==

==Introduction to Differential Equations==

How does the quantity of drug in the body vary with time? How long does it take a cup of coffee take to cool? After how many days will the moon take the same shape again? These question all have on thing in common. They have a quantity that is continuously changing. We see change in most things in life. Some changes are permanent; like the temperature of coffee. Some have repeating patterns, like the cycle of the moon.

You have already studied a lot of mathematics to describe these changes, but never really put that into real life applications. You will know from previously studies calculus that the rate of change of a quantity is called a derivative. If an equation contains a derivative, it is a differential equation.

The simplest form of a differential equation is to show the rate of change of one variable with respect to another like:

*1.&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = x + y&lt;/math&gt;, 
*2.&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.02P&lt;/math&gt;

These are 2 very basic examples of differential equations. You will learn how to solve them in later sections.

A solution to a differential equation gives a relationship between the variables, which doesn't involve a derivative. The solutions to the differential equations above are given by:

*1.&lt;math&gt;y=-x-1+Ce^x&lt;/math&gt;
*2.&lt;math&gt;P=Ae^{0.02t}&lt;/math&gt; 
(where C and A are constants of integration)

Differential equations begin to get more complicated where higher derivatives are involved  (&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt;), or if they included more variables.

==Modelling==
In order to solve any problem successfully, you need to develop a mathematical model that describes the situation adequately. In this module you will learn how to solve problems which can be solved using differential equations.

With some problems you can go straight into the mathematics. This is usually the case where you have already have some models that you can apply to the situation. These usually include; but are not limited to newtons laws of motion, and many kinematics problems (stuff in mechanics 1, basically.)Because of this your solution to a problem will depend on assumptions and simplifications you made; like ignoring air resistance, or assuming constant mass, ect. This can sometimes give significant errors in your solution. Colecting data can help see if your model is off or not.

Some problems will need their own model devolped, however. This means you will need to do some experiments to find a corrolation between the results you get. This will help with understanding the problem better, and help you formulate a mathematical model.

===Example===
You have been asked to find out how much of an antidepressant is left in the body after a given time of taking the pill. How would you do this? Well the process of removing a drug from the body varies with the drug. The kidney plays the most important rule, doing something called renal clearance.The rate of this can be measured by taking urine samples.

Lets make some assumptions about the problem:
*Once the pill has been taking, it is instantly absorbed into the body
*The drug is removed from the bloodstream via renal clearance.
*The rate of renal clearance is proportional to the quantity of the drug in the body

We can now formulate a model. Let 't' be time in hours, and 'q' be the amount of drug in the body (in mg). this means that:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt} \propto q &lt;/math&gt;

we replace the proportional sign:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt} = -kq &lt;/math&gt; where k is a postive constant of proportionality, and the negitive sign is there because the ammount of drug is decreasing.

We will show later that the solution to the differential equation is:

&lt;math&gt;q=Ae^{-kt}&lt;/math&gt;, Where A is a constant of integration. Although we have not shown this solution is true, we can check that is is a solution by differentiating it.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt} = A(-ke^{-kt}) = -kAe^{-kt} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; q=Ae^{-kt} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dq}{dt}=-kq &lt;/math&gt;, so therefore we have shown that it is a solution

Now we need to find values for A and k,for this we will need some experimental results:

*In the morning a man takes 40mg of the antidepressant
*Every hour, approximately 5% of it is gone

We now let t=0, and q=40

&lt;math&gt; 40=Ae^{0}=A &lt;/math&gt;

in this case our constant of integration, A, is 40. So therefore:

&lt;math&gt; q=40e^{-kt} &lt;/math&gt;

Now lets find k. We know that every hour the amount of drug decreases by 5% every hour, so when t=1, q=(0.75)*40=38

&lt;math&gt; 38=40e^{-k} &lt;/math&gt;

Dividing each side by 40, and taking logs of each side gives that:

&lt;math&gt; k=-ln(\frac{38}{40})= 0.0513 &lt;/math&gt;

This gives that:

&lt;math&gt; q=40e^{-0.0513k} &lt;/math&gt;

==key points==
*A differential equation is an equation involving a derivative
*The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative
*Differential equations are used to model situations which involve rates of change
*The solution to a differential equation gives a relationship between the variables themselves, not the derivatives
*The general solution of a first order differential equation satisfies the differential equations and has a constant of integration in its solution
*The particular solution of a differential equation is one in which additional information has been used to calculate the constant of integration
*The general solution may be represented by a family of curves and the particular solution is one of that family
*To verify that a function is a particular solution you must check that it satisfy's the differential equation and initial conditions</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Origins – Role of Christ Church in the New Republic and the new Commonwealth of Kentucky '''

It is impossible to separate the history of Christ Church Cathedral from the origins of the United States or of the creation of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The origins of CCC are born within the international context of a New Republic and the two Great Awakenings; of Kentucky’s separatist tendencies to join the international cosmopolitanism of Spain and France; of Republican Motherhood, Empress-waist gowns, liberty hats and concert music; of the American Jockey Club’s blood-horse and the economic and political power of the Fayette County’s Court Days; we can find CCC’s powerful contributions to the Lexington Democratic Society, slavery and Kentucky’s first 2 constitutions with strong statements of Democratic-Republican ideals and Maryland/Virginia’s freedom of religion; in the systematic emphasis on building up a strong, sophisticated infrastructure that would draw in an educated, wealthy immigrant and good for internationally-oriented businesses. 
 
The origins of CCC can be separated into 4 phases: 
# Formation of the “Episcopal Society” and the Transylvania Seminary - 1770s-99 
# The “American Episcopal Society” – 1800-War of 1812 
# The change to weekly church services under Rev. Ward – 1813-1820 
# The creation of the Diocese by Rev. Chapman – 1820-30s (watershed for Lexington)

The establishment of churches in Kentucky progressed with European settlement in Kentucky – which took place more rapidly in the last quarter of the 18th century. During this period Catholic, Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian groups became firmly established. In spite of the Proclamation signed by the English King George III forbidding colonists to move beyond the Appalachian highlands, scouts continued to go west into this former contested area with rich trading with Native Americans, French and Spanish. Long-hunters coming from the backcountry of the Carolinas, Pennsylvania and Virginia came back with tales of the rich bounty of the Ohio Valley area. Surveyors came into what is now Kentucky sent by entrepreneurial land companies, and the Transylvania Land Co., organized in 1773 by Judge Richard Henderson of North Carolina, signed a treaty with the Cherokee Indians on March 17, 1775.  Meanwhile the Virginian colonial power refused to recognize this treaty. James Harrod organized a fort on the Wilderness Road (near Harrodsburg) in June 1774, and by 1776 Harrodstown became the seat for Virginia’s new county. But Kentucky’s early historians most love the story of the Quaker Rebecca Boone’s husband Daniel Boone, his work for the Transylvania Land Company and his founding of Boonesborough.  With Boone came a Virginia Anglican, William Russell, brother-in-law to Patrick Henry, Governor of Virginia. He was a justice of Fincastle County, Virginia. Russell aided in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, and later became a US Continental Army Brigadier General. Judge Richard Henderson, also Anglican and head of the Transylvania Company, called together delegates from the then 4 Kentucky settlements to meet together at Boone’s fort near the Kentucky River. After the political sessions were completed, on Sunday May 28, 1775, the 1st public service of worship by whites in KY is led by John Lyth, a Church of England clergyman using the Book of Common Prayer beneath a great elm tree, come to be known as the “Church Tree” and to shelter 100 people or more - for 1st Sunday after Ascension Day (his sister is Letitia, wife of Col. Robert Breckinridge – Lyth left his entire estate in Virginia to Letitia’s daughter, Betty who later came as a reluctant migrant to Kentucky). 

The Church of England, however, during the American Revolution was unpopular and linked to Toryism. Similarly, the Virginia and Carolina Methodists suffered from John Wesley’s Toryism and anti-slavery sentiments. By the mid 1780s, however, Methodism had found its footing in Kentucky and Bishop Francis Asbury ordered a Kentucky Circuit be added to the structure of “local preachers” and Methodist societies already in place. The first Methodist church of Lexington was organized in 1789 and constructed a log cabin at the southwest corner of Short and Dewees streets. Old and recent memories of persecution by the established Church of England were fresh in the new American consciousness – Baptists, in particular. Public financial support of churches withered because of the New Republic’s principles emphasizing separation of church and state. 
After the American version of Anglicanism is created, the political leaders of Kentucky who once were Anglican, became determined to re-establish their church formally. The Diocese of Maryland tried to send out Rev. William Duke to Kentucky in 1789 to form a church, but he fell ill somewhere near Harper’s Ferry in Virginia and turned back.

In 1792 Kentucky was the first state in the new country to be organized west of the Allegheny Mounties and the first state in the new nation to expressly protect the institution of slavery. David Rice was educated at the College of New Jersey at Princeton before undertaking further studies under John Todd, who had spent a great deal of time working among slaves. Rice would eventually follow in Todd’s footsteps, working among slaves as an ordained Presbyterian minister in Virginia for over twenty years. After being forced out of Virginia in 1783, Rice came to Kentucky – over 300 Kentuckians had signed a subscription list to show their readiness for creating a formal Presbyterian infrastructure recognized by the Hanover Presbytery in Virginia. Rice is credited with organizing three of the first Presbyterian congregations in Kentucky and was involved in the organizing of the Transylvania Presbytery by 1786, the Synod of Kentucky, and the Transylvania Seminary (first starting as a grammar school in his home in 1787). This Princeton graduate was elected as chairman of the board to handle the endowment coming from the 12,000 acres that Virginia’s legislature had deeded to Kentucky.  A strong opponent of slavery, joined n the efforts of the Kentucky Abolition Society, writing under the pseudonym “Philanthropos.” In 1792 published his pamphlet “Slavery Inconsistent with Justice and Good Policy” – failing soon thereafter as a delegate to the Kentucky constitutional convention, to insert an article leading to the emancipation of slaves included in the state's first constitution. The first church in Lexington was the Mt. Zion Presbyterian Church in 1784 in a log cabin located at the southeastern corner of Walnut and Short streets. In 1792 they split over a difference in the translation of the Psalms of David, and the First Presbyterian church on the southeastern corner of Mill and Short was built (the other congregation disbanded in 1830). Meanwhile the Market Street Presbyterian church was dedicated July 30, 1815, with the young Rev. James McChord (later to become the Second Presbyterian church on East Main Street).

The first separate church for Blacks in Kentucky was organized in the early 1780s by Peter Duerett, a slave who migrated to Kentucky with the Rev. Joseph Craig, brother of Rev. Lewis Craig who brought “The Traveling Church” of Separate Baptists from Spotsylvania through the Cumberland Gap in the winter of 1781. By the fall of 1782 Craig established the South Elkhorn Baptist Church, and Duerett (“Old Captain”) and his wife created a Baptist church for Black converts at the “Head of Boone’s Creek” (off Todd’s Road near Clark County). They subsequently hired out the time of himself and wife from his owner and moved to Lexington, bought a cabin from John Maxwell and started what was then called the First African Church. The congregation, led by free blacks and slaves, bought its first property in 1815 (a cotton factory on High Street, next to the present Asbury Methodist Church) under the names of freedmen Rolla Blue, Wm. Gist, Solomon Walker and James Pullock.  The next year started a church school. By the time of Duerett’s death in 1823 at the age of 90, the church had an estimated membership of 300. 
By 1789 Lexington’s white Baptists built their first church on West Main street, on the ground now occupied by the First Baptist church. The second Baptist church to be erected in Lexington was completed in October, 1819, and stood on Mill Street opposite Gratz Park.

Meanwhile the Catholics in this area were seen as possible spies for the Spanish, French or their Native American allies. Father Stephen T. Badin, a refugee of the French Revolution’s Reign of Terror, came to Lexington in January 1794 - using a log cabin built in 1794 at the northeast corner of Patterson street extended (Baptist Alley) and Main street - and served the few Catholic families until he returned to France in 1821. A German Lutheran church and school was erected in 1795, and destroyed by fire in 1815. Some of the Lutheran graveyard remains in the rear of the First Methodist Church, 214 West High Street.

== The Episcopal Society and the Transylvania Seminary ==
The Protestant Episcopal Church organized in 1789 as part of New Republic’s autonomy from Britain, but Baptists, Presbyterians and Methodists already firmly ensconced in the Upper South and along the eastern coast. Most notable Lexingtonians identified themselves as Episcopalians and Democratic-Republicans. A few Anglican ministers were in Bardstown and Lexington but did not establish a parish formally. Fayette County “Episcopal Society” met together in early 1790s and held services on the farm of Captain David Shely, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, probably in a small log building out Russell Cave Pike about 4 miles out from the center of Lexington. John Bradford started the state’s first newspaper, the Kentucky Gazette, in 1787- serving as the official site for all political matters in the state - and helped organize Lexington’s first library in 1798. Bradford was elected as the Transylvania University’s first chairman and helped transform it into Kentucky’s first state university. These were Lexington’s “established order” that formed the core of Transylvania’s early board as well as the establishment of the Episcopal Church in Lexington. Lawyers and doctors, extraordinarily wealthy men such as Robert Wickliffe, William Morton, George Nicholas and William Russell formed the core of Transylvania, the Freemasons and the Democratic Society as well as the Episcopal church while their wives and daughters attended lectures at the school and organized social assemblies downtown, church gatherings and musical extravaganzas. 

The overwhelming majority of settlers in Kentucky and Tennessee were Germans and Scotch-Irish from Pennsylvania and North Carolina backcountries coming in with strong democratic political ideas, radicalized by the evangelical revivalism of the Great Awakening. The Democratic committees of correspondence kept up a running debate in the Gazette about the type of constitution that Kentucky should have - and the Bourbon county democrats were the most radical, reinforced by the activism in the antislavery campaigns of the county and the religious ferment culminating in the Cane Ridge revival of 1800. After the Ohio country was opened up with the battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, many antislavery farmers from Kentucky fled north for better chances of owning their own land. By 1795, over 85% of the families in the Green river valley were landless. Nearly every owner of the famed Bluegrass territory had political connections either in Virginia or in Congress. The political and legal education of men like John Brown, George Nicholas and John Breckinridge coming out of the College of William and Mary into Kentucky in the 1790s created a perfect combination of religious and political fervor. Their civic boosterism, elite landowning and pro-slavery sentiments earned these families political influence and assured them an elevated place in Lexington’s social hierarchy.  

This elitism inherent within the Jeffersonian Republicanism and its love affair with France seemed to be in direct contradiction to the promise of egalitarianism of frontier Presbyterianism and what later comes to be the rise of the Democratic Party by the early 19th century. But Kentucky was built on a kind of hybrid politics – wealthy proprietors who wheel and deal at a national level and code-shift to a local culture demanding a public forum of interaction in a folksy, Everyman style.  It formed the core of what Southern historians now call Jeffersonian Nationalism.

With the waning Presbyterian influence at the seminary, Reverend David Rice and others broke with Transylvania and established Kentucky Academy in 1794. The academy was located in Pisgah, Woodford County where it remained until 1799. $4,000 was subscribed in Kentucky, and $10,000 subscribed in the East, towards its endowment, of which President George Washington and Vice-President John Adams contributed $100 each, and Aaron Burr $50. Dr. George Gordon, of London, England, secured a small valuable library and ‘philosophical apparatus', or laboratory equipment, for the new school.

With Rice’s second defeat in the Kentucky Constitutional conventions, the more egalitarian-leaning Presbyterians returned to join with the “liberal” thinking Transylvania Seminary to form Transylvania University. Schools of medicine and law were immediately established at the new university. Transylvania experienced rapid growth and earned a national reputation during the presidency of Horace Holley (1818-1925) – the envy of the Virginians.  Governor Jefferson began exploring how to build their state’s university to as to stop the brain drain from Virginia.  Mary Austin Holley’s poetry entertained General Lafayette and their daughter attended a prestigious school with a liberal arts curriculum and music. By that time the Lexington Democratic Society and its Scott county branch were disbanded and the new federalist-leaning “American System” of Henry Clay had begun.

Christ Church Cathedral in Lexington was the first organized Episcopal church in Kentucky with a clergyman to minister to them. Reverend James Moore had come to Kentucky in 1791 as a Washington College graduate and the new husband of the Presbyterian Margaret Todd – the daughter of the Rev. John Todd who donated his library to Lexington. His aspirations to be a Presbyterian minister were short-lived. He was invited to become president of Kentucky Academy with the high visibility from elite Virginians seeking to keep Kentucky as an ally. But when he broke with the Presbyterians, he then became the director of Transylvania Seminary. Eventually, he and Margaret built - about 3 miles from Lexington on Georgetown Pike - the beautiful home “Vaucluse” (later known as Malvern Hill) with its square, high ceilinged parlor for his flute concerts. The room was covered with special material to enhance the acoustics and was flanked by two chambers, opening onto a recessed portico ideal for evening soirees. A member of the new Kentucky elite, they held at least 12 slaves (several of whom had probably come with him as part of his wife’s dower out of Virginia), and James fathered at least six white children. Following up on conversations with the prestigious families of the Episcopal Society, Moore was ordained as an Episcopal priest by Bishop Madison in 1794 in Virginia. 

Reverend Moore recruited more members to the Episcopal Society and by 1796 held bi-weekly services in frame house on corner of Market and Middle (now Church) Streets – the present site of Christ Church. On 22 December 1798 the rift between the more Virginia- and federal-oriented Episcopalians and the more strictly Calvinist Presbyterians ended when a large group of men gathered together to vote for a union of Transylvania Seminary and the Kentucky Academy.  They agreed that the new combined institution would take effect from after the 1st day of June 1799 - creating Transylvania University .  Meanwhile, slaveowners fearing the influence of abolitionist preachers like the Presbyterian David Rice or the Kentucky Academy’s strict Presbyterian seminarians and made sure that in the Second Constitutional Convention in 1799 that the new Kentucky Constitution prohibited a minister from becoming a legislator. Ebenezer Brooks, writing in the Gazette under the pseudonym of “Corn Planter” (July 17, 1788) had many years earlier already explained the position of many of Lexington’s residents: “The faithful preacher will have neither leisure nor inclination to concern in politicks (sic), and he who is of an opposite character is not to be trusted.”  It’s important to remember that of the state’s 221,000 residents in 1800 only about 10,000 belonged to an established denomination.

== American Episcopal Church ==
By 1803 a brick church replaced the clapboard frame house at Church and Market.  This happened only after a lawsuit between the builder Maddox Fisher and the “American Episcopal Church” (represented in name by Walter Warfield, David Sheley, Robert Todd, William Morton, James Bullock and Rev James Moore).  Fisher complained that the church leaders had originally made the deal for bricks to be laid at a Main Street site (owned by Robert Todd), close to his brickyard.  However, the church leaders had become convinced that their congregation feared the regular overflowing of the Town Branch would threaten the new building and its planned interior, so they chose instead to build on the corner already occupied by the frame house. Moore was greatly respected as “learned, liberal, amiable and pious” (romanticized later in the century by James Lane Allen who described Moore in his novel Flute and Violin as: “humanly speaking, almost a perfect man”). 
Moore resigned as president of Transylvania in 1804 to focus on building up his church by recruiting more Episcopalians – and he (and his wife in the magnificent Valcuse parlor) was very successful.  By August 25, 1808, 26 men agreed to subscribe to pews, pay for their erection and to rent them annually.  The prices were determined by a committee that was to serve as stewards for the funds necessary for paying the salary of the minister.  Not all the subscribers were baptized in the church nor did they necessarily attend services. In July the first vestry chosen: John Wyatt, John Johnson, William Macbean, John Jordan, William Morton, David Shely, Walter Warfield. A lottery was started with a drawing at the elegant and popular William Satterwhite’s tavern to finish the church and pay for an organ. The first organist was John C. Wenzel, a music store owner, member of the Kentucky Music Society and concert pianist. Some of the most wonderful musicians came to Christ Church, including Wilhelm Iucho, Abby Hammond, all of whom served as organist for them. By 1810 Lexington has several millionaires: Episcopalians and Presbyterians (one of whom was a woman who helps to found the McChord Presbyterian Church and underwrite the transportation and education of Alfred Russell, a Lexington slave who became an Episcopalian missionary in Africa and Liberia’s 10th president.

== 2nd Phase – organized church with weekly meetings ==
Lexington’s contribution to the Second War in American Independence was extraordinary – Clay rode a wave of patriotism in his boast that Kentuckians alone could conquer Canada. Both Virginian presidents, Madison and Monroe, supported Kentucky prices for their exports (hemp, slaves, horses) with federal marshals and restrictive international tariffs. Kentucky’s first city is a hub for banks, law courts, stage coach lines, post roads and railroads. It was the first urban center in Kentucky to have street lights, police, hog regulations, paved sewers and sidewalks.

On November 5, 1813, Lexington Episcopal Church formally invited Rev. John Ward as rector (after meeting him in the fall before) from Connecticut (ministered in RI, NJ,PA) – services now every 11 AM and 3 PM on Sundays. Ward lived in a house belonging to John D. Clifford and a study in one of the four garden houses. Officially aligned itself with the national organization in April 29 1814 when the parish agreed to the Constitution of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the USA and elected John D. Clifford a delegate to the general convention in Philadelphia in May though he was not seated as a regular member since Kentucky had no bishop or regular state convention. Rev. Ward increased the size of the vestry from 7 to 12, adding Thomas Bodley, John Bradford, William West, James Prentiss and Robert Wickliffe – Bernard Gaines, senior warden and John D. Clifford, junior warden. He razed the original brick building, held services at the Transylvania auditorium next door until the new building was up. The new brick church, stuccoed to imitate stone and was built to accommodate 800 people, was finished within Ward’s first year in Lexington. That winter of the 82 pews offered to the public on December 26th, 51 sold -- “far better than anticipated.”  Pews on the ground floor brought in $50-$100, and the vestry hoped to raise $8K to cover part of the contract cost of the building as well as an additional $2K to remunerate the overruns by the builders, Shryock and Gaugh. By February 1815 the roof was fixed – before that many would not “venture to enter the doors”. In fact, said Ward in a letter to a friend back east, there were two Sundays when he could not conduct services due to the poor condition of the church.  The grand new church bell had arrived by then and the organ was soon to be set up. The original deed of sale in 1804 by Wm. Morton and R. Warfield from Mrs. Barton now handed over to trustees of Lexington church. Ward wrote in April 3, 1815, to his friend Kemper in Pennsylvania: “My being here keeps my people from having itching ears. I am in no danger from any of those popular preachers who can talk from head to foot… I go on in my own way, setting forth plain truths in a plain manner and I am certainly willing to depend for success upon the great Head of the Church.” 

Ward started a Bible society with the new deacon Rev. Jacob Morgan Douglas appointed by the Missionary Society of Pennsylvania from Pittsburgh. However, there was some office politics starting up: Ward feared Douglas was too close to the Presbyterians and Baptists, making him unpopular with his own Episcopalians as he made trips to Georgetown, Paris, Frankfort, Cincinnati and Nashville. Ward wrote on Oct. 25, 1816, to his senior warden Clifford visiting in Philadelphia asking him to show the letter to Kemper:  “Our church would be destroyed by what Mr. Douglas calls his close preaching, but what we call a system of pretended inspired Calvinism, the sectarian doctrine of regeneration and grace, with a full admixture of endless perdition.” 
Douglass writes also to Kemper but never mentions breach with Ward.  However, he notes that some in the congregation were at odds with Ward himself.  Douglass opines that they “have been so spoilt by the licentiousness of the old Maryland and Virginia clergymen that I have to apply the wormwood and the gall. As for understanding the articles, the rubrics, or the liturgy, this is out of the question.” This may simply have been a personality clash but it also shows the early emphasis on keeping the ecstatic practices of frontier evangelism out of the Episcopal Church.  Ward also employed several other traveling ministers on commission of the Episcopal Missionary Society, including John Churchill Rudd of New Jersey and Joseph Jackson of Maryland. Jackson wrote to Kemp on Dec. 2, 1817, that he heard “a considerable part of Handel’s Messiah, performed by a society of persons belonging to the [Lexington] church, several of whom were, previous to Mr. Ward’s settling in Lexington, profane and heedless of religion in all respects.”

== 3rd Phase – Organizing the Diocese of Kentucky, 1820 (depression) -1830s  ==
The Panic of 1819 and Kentucky’s wildcat banks led to a terrible depression in 1820 and Lexington’s elite was embroiled in a social and political debate over the New and Old Courts. Parades, fairs and new architectural trends blossom along with experiments in new stock (Wickliffe’s cattalo and Warfield’s Lexington). During the rise of Tennessee’s “Long Knife” Andrew Jackson and the fall of Lexington’s beloved Aaron Burr, Lexington’s streets were torn up like those in Revolutionary France in a “Brick-Bat War” over the new political parties forming. Meanwhile the Rev. George Thomas Chapman of Massachusetts became the rector of “Christ Church”- its official name as of 1827. Rev. Chapman oversaw the organizing convention for a new diocese, held in Christ Church on July 8, 1829, with delegates from three parishes (the number required by rules of General Convention): Christ Church, Lexington; Christ Church, Louisville (organized in 1822); and, Trinity Church, Danville (founded by Chapman just two months before the convention). A constitution was adopted and the committee named to report a set of canons at the next convention. On July 25, 1829, Rt. Rev. John Stark Ravenscroft of North Carolina, the first Episcopalian bishop to come to Kentucky, arrived in Lexington and preached at Christ Church on Sunday, July 25, confirming 71 people that day. On Tuesday he confirmed 20 more. In August 1829 Christ Church sent its first deputy to a national General Convention in Philadelphia: Dr. John Esten Cooke (a professor at Transylvania Medical School). The Rt. Rev. Thomas Church Brownell of Connecticut was sent to inspect southern and western states, arrived in Lexington on December 3rd of that year and consecrated Christ Church. 

== 4th Phase: Organizing the Diocese ==
This important, official beginning of the Church concludes what could be seen as the 4th phase of the Origins of Christ Church. The next decade, the 1830s is a watershed in Lexington history – the legislature finally incorporates it as a city in 1831 and its first mayor, Charlton Hunt, is committed to internal improvements in the style of Henry Clay. The failure of the Maysville Road in a political feud between Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay together with the 1833 cholera epidemic stunted the city’s growth as a center of business and industry.  The 1833 Kentucky law prohibiting the open buying/selling of slaves shifted Kentucky’s elite slaveowning families into a shadow market while the East coast began to blossom under a new market economy demanding freedom from tariffs and federal intervention. Lexington’s millionaires and elite order including the Episcopalians must adapt – and they do. Kentucky is the first to build a lunatic asylum in the West (an act of institutional benevolence of the time, the second in the nation), the Orphanage and Female Benevolent Society builds a new role for white women and the state begins to invest in public education with moral implications for building a better informed citizenry. By 1838 Kentucky was the first in the new nation to offer school suffrage for female heads of household. Christ Church is situated physically in an important spot in Lexington and ready for the next historical era: Antebellum Kentucky.

4 PHASES IN ORIGINS OF CHRIST CHURCH:
# Book of Common Prayer at “church tree” in 1775 to KY’s first city, 1796 Christ Church founded; Rev. James Moore presides at “frame house” on corner of Market &amp; Church Street;
# 1803 brick church constructed; first vestry (July 2, 1809); 
# 1814 new building stuccoed to look like stone and in 1815 the first bell hung in belfry; Rev Ward leaves to start a school; 
# Rev. Chapman organizes diocese; consecration Dec 3, 1829; 3rd Street cemetery purchased 1832; Theological Seminary 1834-40s

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ankylosing Spondylitis and Exercise ==
=== Background ===

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an chronic, rheumatic disease part of a group of diseases known as spondyloarthropathier (SpA).&lt;ref name=a4&gt;Keat A. Ankylosing Spondylitis. Spondyloarthropathies. 2010;38(4):185-189&lt;/ref&gt;  Ankylosing spondylitis is a result of inflammation in the spine affecting the synovial tissue, ligament insertions and inverterbral discs&lt;ref name=a4/&gt; affecting the spine as well as the hips, knees and shoulders.&lt;ref name=a6&gt;Ince G, Sarpel T, Durgun B, Erdogan S. Effects of a multimodal exercise program for people with ankylosing spondylitis. Phys Ther. 2006; 86:924-935. &lt;/ref&gt; Inflammation of these areas causes trunk stiffness and pain. Additional calcification to these structures leads to mobility loss throughout the spine&lt;ref name=a4/&gt; and over time can progress to spinal deformity and loss of flexibility.&lt;ref name=a2&gt;Viitanen J, Suni J. Management principles of physiotherapy in ankylosing spondylitis - which treatments are effective? Physiotherapy. 1995; 81(6):322-329&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symptoms/Diagnosis ===
[[File:Ankylosing process.jpg|thumb|alt=Puzzle globe|Ankylosing process]]

Symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis can begin as early in the late teens, affecting males at a rate of 3:1 compared to females.&lt;ref name=a4/&gt; Males tend to have the spine affected to greater severity, where females have greater peripheral involvement.&lt;ref name=a3&gt;Calin A. Ankylosing spondylitis. Spondyloarthropathies. 2006; 34(10): 396-400&lt;/ref&gt; AS is characterised by:
*Lower back or buttocks pain, radiating between sides &lt;ref name=a4/&gt;
*Persistent symptoms for &gt;3months &lt;ref name=a3/&gt;
*Reduction of stiffness with exercises
*Stiffness in morning or with inactivity

Progression: As the inflammation continues new bone builds around the affected area causing increased fusing of the vertebrae&lt;ref name=SAA&gt;Spondylitis Association of America (US). Ankylosing Spondylitis[Internet]. Sherman Oaks (CA): Spondylitis Association of America; 2013 [cited 2013 Oct 12]. Available from:http://www.spondylitis.org/about/as.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis is regarded as having the above symptoms. Other diagnostic tools that can be used include:&lt;ref name=a3/&gt;
*Radiology – to grade severity of AS
*Laboratory tests – it is thought that the HLA-B27 gene influences AS

=== Treatment/Management ===
There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis, however treatment is designed to:&lt;ref name=a3/&gt; 
* delay the progression of the disease
* relieve pain
* minimise inflammation
* maintain function
* improve quality of life
Methods of management of AS include:&lt;ref name=a4/&gt;&lt;ref name=a3/&gt;
* education and counselling
* physiotherapy and chiropractic - to correct deformity and minimise spinal joint restriction &lt;ref name=a6/&gt; &lt;ref name=a7&gt;Rutherford SM, Nicolson CF, Crowther ER. Symptomatic improvement in function and disease activity in patient with ankylosing spondylitis utilizing a course of chiropractic therapy: a prospective case study.J Can Chiropr Assoc. 2005; 49(2):81-91&lt;/ref&gt;
* pharmaceutical - non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid drugs (DMARDs)
* exercise and stretching 

==== Exercise and Stretching as management of ankylosing spondylitis ====
Exercise preserves mobility and prevents further deterioration in those with AS. Exercise programs should include a variety of the following types of exercises: &lt;ref name=a6/&gt;&lt;ref name=a10&gt;Nolte K, van Rensburg CJ. The role of exercise in the rehabilitation of ankylosing spondylitis. Int SportMed J. 2001;2(4):1-12&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
! Exercise Type !! Frequency !! Benefits !! Examples
|-
| Breathing Exercises || as appropriate ||

|-
| Hydrotherapy || as directed by a professional ||
*decrease pain intensity
*mobilize and strengthens joints
|| breaststroke strokes aid in posture and breathing due to stoke motion opening up chest
|}

Home exercise programs should be designed to fit into daily routines and not all exercises need to be completed in one session.&lt;ref name=a10/&gt; It is recommended that you complete exercise when feels appropriate, e.g. if morning stiffness of hips occurs, stretch hips in the morning.

=== Recommendation ===
*Those with severe AS complications should have an exercise tolerance test conducted before starting a fitness program&lt;ref name=a10/&gt;
*Exercise at least 30 minutes per day &lt;ref name=a1&gt;Falkenbach A. Disability motivates patients with ankylosing spondylitis for more frequent physical exercise. Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2003; 84:382-383&lt;/ref&gt;
*Complete back extension exercises minimum 5 days per week&lt;ref name=a10/&gt;&lt;ref name=a1/&gt;
*Exercising in the water decreases the load on the body, so AS patients can exercise longer and more vigorously&lt;ref name=a10/&gt;

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.68}}

You [[../Cycles Fireflies|previously read]] about techniques for controlling fireflies in renders done with Blender Cycles, and how, when all else fails and tweaking renderer parameters doesn’t help, it is time to roll out the Despeckle filter. Sometimes a despeckle applied across the entire image may be too blunt, leading to unwanted effects in parts of the image where there are no fireflies.

But never fear. There are yet more options in Blender’s compositor that we have yet to explore, to give us even finer control over the application of despeckling, and hopefully avoid the final, desperate measure of hand-retouching (shock! horror!) individual blemishes in an image-editing program.

The basic principle is, fireflies are caused by specific interactions of types of materials and lighting, hence they will only occur in particular parts of the image. By separating out the problematic materials/lighting cases, we can selectively apply the filter just to them, minimizing side-effects on parts of the image that look just fine.

We will present a way to do the separation.

== Finer Despeckling: Separate Lighting Passes ==
=== Separating The Lighting Passes ===
The Cycles renderer has the capability to separate out different kinds of light paths into separate ''passes'' for individual processing. Consider the diagram on the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Render/Cycles/Passes Blender wiki], showing how the direct lighting, indirect lighting and colour calculations are broken down by diffuse, glossy and transmission light paths, before being combined together with emission and environment lighting. We can split out all these passes, and use compositor nodes to recreate the standard combination as described there. But we can also intersperse our own processing onto particular passes, leaving the others untouched.

[[File:Blender268RenderLayersContextDefault.png|thumb|upright]]
To tell Blender that we want to extract the light passes, go to the Render Layers [[File:Blender267RenderLayersContextButton.png]] context in the Properties [[File:Blender269PropertiesIcon.png]] window, and look for the Passes panel. Notice the four groups of 3 buttons each for “Direct”, “Indirect” and “Color” grouped under “Diffuse”, “Glossy”, “Transmission” and “Subsurface”? (Depending on your Blender version, the “Subsurface” group might not be present.) Click all these buttons, and also check the “Emission” and “Environment” boxes just below.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesDefaultCompositingNodesPlusLightingPasses.png|thumb]]
Now if you go back to the compositor window, you should see that the RenderLayers node has sprouted a whole lot of extra output terminals, one for each of the buttons/checkboxes you clicked.

Next, we want to recombine these to mimic the behaviour that Blender provides by default. If you go back to that Blender Wiki diagram above, you will see that, for each shader type (diffuse, glossy etc), the direct and indirect light passes are added together, and the sum is then multiplied by the colour calculation. The result from all the passes is then added together.

[[File:Blender268CyclesLightPassesRecreationNaive.png|thumb|How '''not''' to do it: notice the repeating patterns?]]
The Blender compositor has standard node types for adding and multiplying colours. Armed with this information, you might immediately set to work putting together an intricate node setup to implement the formula depicted in that diagram, perhaps ending up with something like at right.

Show this to a seasoned computer programmer, and they will perform the gesture known as a “[[w:facepalm|facepalm]]”. Yes, technically this will work, but it is quite complicated-looking and error-prone. Supposing you get a connection wrong: how would you find it? How would you debug your node program?

For, make no mistake, '''nodes are a programming language'''. Putting together a node setup is very much like writing a computer program. One of the important principles is '''don’t repeat yourself'''. That is, if you find yourself doing the same sequence of steps more than once, it makes sense to spell it out once, and then next time just tell the computer to do the same thing again.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|In programming, '''laziness is a virtue'''. Programmers spend a lot of their time thinking up ways to avoid work, by getting the computer to do it.}}

{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender268CyclesLightPassesRecreationPart1.png|thumb]]
So let us see how a programmer would approach this same problem. To start with, consider the most basic operation, which is: add the direct and indirect components, and multiply by the colour. So create a pair of Mix nodes, one to do the Add and the other to do the Multiply, and wire them appropriately. Turn them into a group {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|GKEY}}, and add group inputs and outputs as in the diagram.

To change the names of the inputs and outputs, you can select them in the list that appears in the Properties shelf {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}} in the Node Editor window, then type a new name in the appropriate field just below the list.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesLightPassesRecreationPart2.png|thumb]]
Having done all the wiring, {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} out of the group, so you can give it a name. Here I call it “Pass Combine”. See how naming the inputs and outputs helps make it clearer what the node is for? And if you want to see the details, just {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into the node for more. This technique is called ''abstraction'', where you start by seeing only the overview, but you can progressively peel back the layers to see more and more detail, but only where you want to. This is an important technique for dealing with complexity, which is what programmers do every day.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesLightPassesRecreationPart3.png|thumb]]
We will need four instances of this group, plus another bunch of Mix nodes to add them all together. We are adding 6 quantities, so we will need 5 Mix nodes. Again, I make a group to combine all these adders, just to make things neater.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesLightPassesRecreationPart4.png|thumb]]
I call the resulting group “Add6”. Blender only provides nodes to add two quantities at a time, yet here we have made our own custom node that can take 6 inputs at once. Neat, huh?

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesLightPassesRecreationPart5.png|thumb]]
So now we combine our building blocks into a new building block that computes the combination of all the passes, and looks like this.

Note the ordering of the group inputs, to ensure a nice and neat arrangement when we connect this node up below. You can rearrange the inputs by selecting one from the list in the Properties Shelf {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}} and using the up- and down-arrow buttons next to the list to change its position.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesLightPassesRecreationPart6.png|thumb]]
And then when we connect that building block into all the RenderLayers outputs, our complete node setup now looks like this.

Compare this with the original simple-minded recreation of the pass-combining algorithm: which would you rather be presented with when you open a Blender document?

{{Clear}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Groups within groups:''' When you have one node group within another, you may become confused over the behaviour of the {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} key: will it exit the current group, or take you into an inner one? If you select an inner group, it will go into that, of course. But if you’re trying to get out, ''click on a node that isn’t a group''. You always have two of these, the Group Input and Group Output nodes, handily marked out by their yellow title bars. So click on one of those before pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}, and that takes you out of the group.}}

=== Fixing The Fireflies ===
Anyway, now that we have separated the lighting passes, such that we can recombine them to produce the original image anyway, how do we actually go about fixing the fireflies?

[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesPassesFixup1.png|thumb|Diffuse-indirect pass produces fireflies]]
First we have to isolate which passes are producing the fireflies. Click the “Backdrop” checkbox in the header of the compositor Node Editor window. Now, {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|SHIFT|LMB}} on the RenderLayers node, and you should see a new Viewer node automatically appear and connect itself to the first output terminal on that node. At the same time, the background of the window changes to show the image produced by that output terminal. The first terminal should be showing the complete image, including the fireflies.

Keep pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|SHIFT|LMB}}, and the Viewer node will connect to each output terminal in turn. Some may be all black or all white, but don’t worry, just keep going. When you come to the Diffuse Indirect output, you should see something like at right, mostly dark, but with noticeable fireflies. Make a note and keep going; I also found that the Glossy Indirect output was another source of problems in this case.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesPassesFixup2.png|thumb]]
So we need to insert a Despeckle node between the Diffuse Indirect output from the RenderLayer node, and the corresponding Diffuse Indirect input on our Combine All node. But instead of just making a simple Despeckle node, let’s make a custom node group. Why? Because we’ll need it in two places. So rather than having to set it up twice, just do the setup once, and insert two instances. That way, we can adjust the despeckle settings in just one place, and have it automatically take effect wherever there is an instance. Also, maybe we want to try other filters in combination with or instead of Despeckle; again, we would only need to make the change in one place, and it would automatically affect all instances.

“Don’t repeat yourself”, remember?

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesPassesFixup3.png|thumb]]
So here we are, with a couple of instances of our custom “Fix Fireflies” node group inserted in the most troublesome light paths.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268CyclesFirefliesExample7.png|thumb|Fireflies gone!]]
And here is the resulting render.

{{Clear}}

== Conclusion ==
Fireflies can be troublesome, particularly because there is no 100%-foolproof way of getting rid of them. After all, if there were, why not just build it in as an automatic part of every render? This pair of pages has presented a range of techniques for dealing with them, from simple to complex. Of course it makes sense to try the simple ones first, and only if they’re not good enough, is it worth expending effort on something more complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Entropy of an Ideal Gas ==
When releasing heat a reaction is said to be exothermic, with enthalpy, &lt;math&gt;\Delta H &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. If a reaction absorbs heat from its surroundings, the reaction is said to be endothermic with enthalpy, &lt;math&gt;\Delta H &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Many endothermic reactions get energy by rearranging themselves into more entropic final states. Entropy in its most basic definition is the the amount of disorder a system contains. Entropy always increases; a reaction will not proceed if the entropy of the system and/or the environment does not increase. 

When considering the entropy of an ideal gas, one can consider how the gas molecules can be arranged in a volume. Let’s take, for example, a sphere. The volume of the sphere divided into its smallest division of the sphere gives a number of subdivisions equal to Ω&lt;sub&gt;vol&lt;/sub&gt;. The entropy of an ideal gas involves its multiplicity (represented by the symbol Ω). The multiplicity of a gas is defined as how many microstates exist for each macrostate. A microstate is a specific configuration for a system, whereas the macrostate describes the probability of actually finding a system  in a certain microstate. The multiplicity of a sphere is  &lt;math&gt; \Omega_{ vol} = \frac{V}{\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z} &lt;/math&gt;. To derive the total multiplicity for an ideal gas in a sphere, we will consider the multiplicity pertaining to the volume (how many places a particle can occupy) and and the multiplicity of the momentum (how many speeds that particle can have). To do this, we will use the Heisenburg Uncertainty Principle. The Heisenburg Uncertainty Principle tells us what the smallest way you can break up momentum. The formula is defined as &lt;math&gt; x*ph &lt;/math&gt; where ''h'' is Planck’s constant and &lt;math&gt;\Delta p &lt;/math&gt; is momentum. The Heisenburg Uncertainty Principle states that particles cannot get too close or else they will form waves; particles shouldn’t react or they will exhibit quantum mechanical properties. This essentially means that the gas cannot be too dense. The kinetic energy of a particle is equal to  &lt;math&gt; U = \frac{1}{2} mv^{2} &lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt; U = \frac{p^{2}} {2m} &lt;/math&gt;. Considering three dimensions, then kinetic energy would look something like &lt;math&gt; U = \frac{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}{2m} &lt;/math&gt; which represents a vector in three dimensional space. The multiplicity of the sphere in relation to momentum would appear as: &lt;math&gt; p = \frac{V_{p}}{\Delta p_{x}\Delta p_{y}\Delta p_{z}} &lt;/math&gt;. The total multiplicity of the ideal gas would then be the number of ways the gas can be arranged spatially multiplied by the number of ways the momenta can be divided among the gas particles. Or, more succinctly, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_{total} = \Omega_{p} * \Omega_{V} &lt;/math&gt;. By substitution, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_{total} = \frac{V * V_{p}}{\Delta x \Delta p_{x} * \Delta y \Delta p_{y} * \Delta z \Delta p_{z}} &lt;/math&gt;. We consider both v and p because each particle can have a different position and a different momentum. This equation in simplified form appears as: &lt;math&gt; \Omega = \frac{V*V_{p}}{h^{3}} &lt;/math&gt;. 

The formula for entropy is &lt;math&gt; S = K_{B}*ln(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt;. For an ideal gas, the ''Sackur-Tetrode Equation'' is applied where &lt;math&gt;S = N*k_{B} ln(\frac{V}{N} (\frac{4\pi mU}{3Nh^{2}})^{\frac{3}{2}}) + \frac{5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. When considering an ideas gas going from a smaller volume to a larger, this is what the entropy would look like after going through the derivations: &lt;math&gt;S = Nk_{B}ln\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. For an isothermal reaction, &lt;math&gt;U = Q+W&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;W=NK_{b}Tln\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. Referring back to the previous formula, where &lt;math&gt;U = \frac{f}{2}Nk_{b}\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;. Kinetic energy is also the sum of work and heat. Thus, for an isothermal process &lt;math&gt;\Delta U = W + Q = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so then &lt;math&gt;Q = -W&lt;/math&gt;. If we remember that a property of natural logs is the ability to flip the argument within parentheses so that the negative of the argument is true, then we have: &lt;math&gt;Q = Nk_{B}Tln\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}} = \Delta ST&lt;/math&gt;. The resulting general formula is &lt;math&gt;\Delta S = \frac{Q}{T}&lt;/math&gt;. ''But Remember!'' This is only true for an isothermal process.

What happens when temperature is not held constant? By the definition of heat capacity, &lt;math&gt;Q = mC_{V}\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\Delta S = \frac{Q}{T}&lt;/math&gt; , then it follows that &lt;math&gt;dS = \int \frac{mC_{V}}{T}dT&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===

Take 1 g of water at 293 K and another 1 g of water at 323 K and mix them together. In thermal equilibrium, the 2 g of water are at temperature 308 K. What are the entropy changes involved?

Begin with &lt;math&gt;dS = mC_{V}\int \frac{dT}{T}&lt;/math&gt;. For the cooler system, &lt;math&gt;dS_{cooler} = (1g)(1\frac{cal}{g*K})*ln\frac{308}{293} = 0.0499 \frac{cal}{K}&lt;/math&gt;.
For the warmer system, &lt;math&gt;dS_{warmer} = (1g)(1\frac{cal}{g*K})*ln\frac{308}{323} = -0.0476 \frac{cal}{K}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, to determine how the total entropy of the system behaves, add the entropy from the cooler and the warmer system together: &lt;math&gt;dS_{total} = dS_{cooler} + dS_{warmer} = 0.0499 - 0.0476 = 0.0023 \frac{cal}{K} = 0.00944 \frac{J}{K}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Two State Systems==

Two state systems are systems that can only exist in one of two states at a time. Examples of this are monomers that can be linked into polymers either in a straight line or with a 180° turn, the spin up or spin down state of electrons, or a coin flip. Let’s consider the coin flip situation for a moment. The following chart displays the relationship between the number of coins flipped, the macrostates, the probability, the microstates, and the multiplicity. The macrostate is the total number of heads (or tails) that turn up for a given system. The micro state is any particular order that can occur to give a particular macrostate. The probability is the reciprocal of the product of the number of states that can exist for each particle (or coin) and the total number of particles (coins). The multiplicity is the summation of the number of microstates for a given macrostate. This will make more sense when looking at the table below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
|-
! # Coins !! Macrostate (# heads &amp; # tails) !! Probability of Microstate!! Microstates !! &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; = Multiplicity
|-
| 0 || 0H 0T || 1 || 0H 0T || 1
|-
| 1 || 1H 0T &lt;br&gt; 0H 1T || ½  &lt;br&gt; ½  || HT &lt;br&gt; TH || 1 &lt;br&gt; 1
|-
| 2 || 2H 0T &lt;br&gt; 1H 1T &lt;br&gt; 0H 2T || ½ x ½ &lt;br&gt; ½ x ½ &lt;br&gt; ½ x ½ || HH&lt;br&gt;HT, TH&lt;br&gt;TT || 1&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;1
|-
| 3 || 3H &lt;br&gt; 2H 1T &lt;br&gt; 1H 2T &lt;br&gt; 3T ||  ½ x ½ x ½  &lt;br&gt; ½ x ½ x ½  &lt;br&gt; ½ x ½ x ½  &lt;br&gt; ½ x ½ x ½ ||  H,H,H &lt;br&gt; H,H,T  H,T,H  T,H,H &lt;br&gt; T,T,H  T,H,T  H,T,T &lt;br&gt; T,T,T || 1 &lt;br&gt; 3 &lt;br&gt; 3 &lt;br&gt; 1
|}

You might be able to see a pattern forming in the Ω column. It is beginning to follow Pascal’s Triangle
               1
             1   1
           1   2   1
         1   3   3   1
       1   4   6   4   1
    1   5   10   10   5   1

etc.

The total probability for each macrostate is then the probability of the microstate multiplied by the multiplicity. This means that for the situation where there are two coins being flipped, the probability is actually as follows: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
|-
! # Coins !! Probability
|-
| 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 1/2
|-
| 2 || 1/4
|-
| 3 || 1/8
|}

We will start moving to more general systems now. Say you have N  coins. How many ways can you get n heads? You can use a choose function to determine the number, n.

&lt;math&gt; {n \choose N} = \Omega &lt;/math&gt;

N choose n function

&lt;math&gt;\Omega = {n \choose N} =  \frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;S = k_B ln(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;

By doing this we convert a number from one that multiplies to one that adds just like we know that entropy is additive. For a mole of coin flips using this you will be able to see basically a single spike at 0.5 * 10^23 for the number of times heads occurs.

== The Einstein Ideal Solid ==

Einstein came up with a simple way to model &quot;ideal solids&quot;. Imagine that particles in a solid are connected together via springs. If the springs are compressed or expanded, then the energy that is stored in the springs is like a simple harmonic oscillator: &lt;math&gt;U = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Imagine that the particles are arranged in a cubic lattice. Then, the total energy for three dimensions is &lt;math&gt;U = kinetic energy + potential energy&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;U = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2} + \frac{1}{2}ky^{2} + \frac{1}{2}kz^{2} +  \frac{1}{2}mv_{x}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}mv_{y}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}mv_{z}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. By the Equipartition Principle, &lt;math&gt;U = \frac{f}{2}Nl_{B}T = \frac{6}{2}Nk_{B}T = 3Nk_{B}T&lt;/math&gt;. From Quantum Mechanics (just take this one on faith) &lt;math&gt;U = (n + 1)hf&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is ''Planck's constant'' and &lt;math&gt; f \approx 10^{13} Hz&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n \in R&lt;/math&gt;; essentially, the units of energy that can be used are not continuous but quantized. 

[[File:Einsteins ideal solid.png|thumb|Einsteins ideal solid]]

Now, let's look at the multiplicity of the Einstein solid. How many atoms are in the solid? ''N''. How many units of energy does the solid have? ''n''. How many ways can I arrange the energy? &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;! The multiplicity tells us how many different ways the energy can be shared among the different particles! However, calculating the multiplicity of this system is much more difficult than 2-state microstate systems. Instead of having only 2 different states (heads and tails), there are now any number ''n'' of states (or amounts of energy) for each particle (or coin). 

=== Example ===

Let's look at a system of 3 particles with a total energy packets ''n'' 3.

Example: N = 3

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
|-
! N !! atom 1 !! atom 2 !! atom 3 !! &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 0 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 1 || 0  &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 0 || 1 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 0 || 3
|-
| 2 || 0 &lt;br&gt; 1  &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 2 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 0 || 1  &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 2 &lt;br&gt; 0 || 1 &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 2 || 6
|-
| 3 || 3 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 2 &lt;br&gt; 2 &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt;1  || 0 &lt;br&gt; 3 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 2 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 2 &lt;br&gt; 1 || 0 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 3 &lt;br&gt;0 &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 0 &lt;br&gt; 2 &lt;br&gt; 2 &lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt; 1 || 10
|}
 
As you can see, these calculations are much more involved and complex than the 2-state system of coin flips. There is, however, a formula that can be used to calculate the multiplicity that is very similar to the Binomial Theorem: the ''Multinomial Theorem'': &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{(N + n - 1)!}{n! * (N - 1)!}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, this formula is the generalization of the Binomial Theorem for any ''n'' number of states for each particle. 

=== Example ===

Let's look at the case where we have 10 particles (N = 10) with 4 units of energy (n = 4). From the Multinomial Theorem, we can calculate the multiplicity by &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{(10 + 4 - 1)!}{(4!)(10 - 1)!} = \frac{13!}{(4!)(9!)} = 715&lt;/math&gt;.

How many ways can we give the first atom (a_{1}) have 0 units of energy . How the rest of the energy is divided up doesn't matter. Then, we have an N = 9 (9 atoms left over) and an n = 4 (and 4 units of energy to split among themselves). So &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{a_{1} = 0} = \frac{(9 + 4 - 1)!}{(4!)(9 - 1)! } = \frac{12!}{(4!)(8!) } = 495&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, let the first atom have 1 unit of energy. Then,  &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{a_{1} = 1} = \frac{(9 + 3 - 1)!}{(4!)(9 - 1)! } = \frac{11!}{(3!)(8!) } = 165&lt;/math&gt;.

A similar argument can show that  &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{a_{1} = 2} = 45&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{a_{1} = 3} = 9&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{a_{1} = 4} = 1&lt;/math&gt;. If we plot the multiplicity versus the number of energy packets that the first atom has, then we can see a graph that represents the ''Boltzmann Distribution'' of the system. A Boltzman Distribution says that when a system has energy, the energy gets passed around and you are most likely to measure an atom with an energy of 0 in this particular system. This is because the energy is constantly passed so most of the time an atom has no energy.

[[File:10 atoms sharing 4 units of energy.png|thumb|Dispersion of energy]]

Let's now find the probability of each state
&lt;math&gt;P_{a_{1} = 0} = \frac{\Omega_{a_{1} = 0}}{\Omega_{total}} = \frac{495}{715}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_{a_{1} = 1} = \frac{\Omega_{a_{1} = 1}}{\Omega_{total}} = \frac{165}{715}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_{a_{1} = 2} = \frac{\Omega_{a_{1} = 2}}{\Omega_{total}} = \frac{45}{715}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_{a_{1} = 3} = \frac{\Omega_{a_{1} = 3}}{\Omega_{total}} = \frac{9}{715}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_{a_{1} = 4} = \frac{\Omega_{a_{1} = 4}}{\Omega_{total}} = \frac{1}{715}&lt;/math&gt;

As a sanity check, the sum of the probabilities should equal 1, and it does. 

Let's calculate the ''Average energy'' of each particle. You may think of this as a simple calculation: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4 units of energy}{10 atoms} = 0.4&lt;/math&gt;. However, let's look at the average energy from a more statistical approach. If we take the probabilities calculated above and multiply each by the energy that the first atom has and add all of these together &lt;math&gt;P_{a_{1} = 0} * 0 + P_{a_{1} = 1} * 1 + P_{a_{1} = 2} * 2 + P_{a_{1} = 3} * 3 + P_{a_{1} = 4} * 4 = 0.4&lt;/math&gt;! This gives us the same answer as the previous calculation.

Thus, the Average energy may be 0.4 but the probabilistic energy is actually zero! this means that if you ever randomly choose a particle and measure its energy, it's most likely going to have an energy of zero. However, if you somehow add up all of the energies together and divide by the total number of particles, then this would yield an average energy of 0.4.

== A 2-Body System ==

Imagine having 2 solids (A and B) that are right next to each other and can freely exchange energy. Both A and B have the same number of particles: 10. A is hotter with 4 units of energy and B is cooler with only 2 units of energy.

[[File:Example.png|thumb|Caption text]]

Intuition tells us that A will cool and B will heat up to 3 units of energy each. But why does that work? Well, entropy will show us the answer. The next table shows what the multiplicity looks like with a certain number ''n'' of energy packets in A. To find the total multiplicity, we must multiply the multiplicities from A and B together.

As you can see, the highest multiplicity is when the energy packets are evenly divided between A and B. Thus, we're most likely to see both groups sharing energy equally.

Now, let's look at another 2-body system where the number of particles are not equal. This one may have a less intuitive answer than the previous. Let A have 10 particles with 4 packets of energy and B have 6 particles with 4

{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot; style = &quot;text-align: center;&quot;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;n_{A}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\Omega_A&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(n_{A})&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\Omega_B&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(8 - n_{B})&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\Omega_{A} * \Omega_{B})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || 1287 || 1287
|-
| 1 || 10 || 792 || 7920
|-
| 2 || 55 || 462 || 25410
|-
| 3 || 220 || 252 || 55440
|-
| 4 || 715 || 126 || 90090
|-
| 5 || 2002 || 56 || '''112112'''
|-
| 6 || 5005 || 21 || 105105
|-
| 7 || 4440 || 6 || 68640
|-
| 8 || 24310 ||  1 || 24310
|}

So, the one we'll most likely observe is the state where A has 5 packets of energy and B has 3.

== Energy, Entropy, and Temperature ==

Recall from the '''Equipartition Theorem''' that &lt;math&gt;U = \frac{f}{2} Nk_{B}T&lt;/math&gt; and let ''f'' = 6.  So &lt;math&gt;U = 3Nk_{B}T&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;3k_{B}&lt;/math&gt; are constant. Then, &lt;math&gt;T \propto \frac{U}{N}&lt;/math&gt;. In the previous example, &lt;math&gt;U = n_{A/B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T = N_{A/B}&lt;/math&gt;. So initially, 

&lt;math&gt;T_{A} \propto \frac{n_{A}}{N_{A}} = \frac{4}{10} = 0.4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_{B} \propto \frac{n_{B}}{N_{B}} = \frac{4}{6} = 0.67&lt;/math&gt;

And the final conditions are

&lt;math&gt;T_{A} \propto \frac{n_{A}}{N_{A}} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_{B} \propto \frac{n_{B}}{N_{B}} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

In the final conditions, the temperatures are equal! Thus, the system is at equilibrium not only when the entropy has maximized but also when the temperatures are equal. Now knowing &lt;math&gt;S = k_{B}ln(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, let's determine &lt;math&gt;\frac{S}{k_{B}} = ln(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;. From this relationship:

{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot; style = &quot;text-align: center;&quot;
! &lt;math&gt;\frac{S_{A}}{k_{B}}&lt;/math&gt; !!  &lt;math&gt;\frac{S_{B}}{k_{B}}&lt;/math&gt; !!  &lt;math&gt;\frac{S_{Total}}{k_{B}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0 || 7.16 || 7.16
|-
| 2.3 || 6.67 || 8.97
|-
| 4.01 || 6.14 || 10.15
|-
| 5.39 || 5.53 || 10.93
|-
| 6.57 || 4.84 || 11.41
|-
| 7.60 || 4.02 || 11.62
|-
| 8.52 || 3.04 || 11.50
|-
| 9.34 ||1.79 || 11.14
|-
| 10.1 || 0 || 10.1
|}

Now, let's plot these entropy values versus the energy packets in a, &lt;math&gt;n_A&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Example.png|thumb|Caption text]]

The slope of the entropy from A and the slope of the entropy from B are equal and opposite exactly when entropy is at its maximum. Or written more succinctly, &lt;math&gt; \frac{dS_A}{dU_A} = - \frac{dS_B}{dU_A}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the total change in entropy when energy changes a little is &lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dU_A} = \frac{dS_A}{dU_A} + \frac{dS_B}{dU_A}&lt;/math&gt;, then this implies that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dU_A} = 0&lt;/math&gt; at equilibrium.

Is it true that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dU_A} = T&lt;/math&gt;? No. If you do some dimensional analysis, you find that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dU_A} &lt;/math&gt; has units &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Joules}&lt;/math&gt; so actually &lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dU_A} = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;dU = TdS&lt;/math&gt; when ''N'' and ''V'' are held constant (i.e. no work is done on the system).

=====What is osteoporosis?=====
Osteoporosis affects millions of people worldwide, and is characterised by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and a consequent
increase in risk of bone fracture&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation. (2003). Diet, Nutrition And The Prevention of Chronic Diseases. WHO Technical Report Series, 1-149. Retrieved from http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_916.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, and can be considered as the pathological advancement of osteopenia&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, M., Selig, S., &amp; Hemphill, D. (2011). Clinical Exercise: a case-based approach. Chatswood: Elsevier Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;. Osteoporosis is a difficult condition to diagnose, since it remains asymptomatic until skeletal fragility is well advanced&lt;ref&gt;Kumur, V., Abbas, A. K., Fausto, N., &amp; Aster, J. C. (2010). Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease (8 ed.) pg.1216. Philadelphia, USA: Saunders Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;, though dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most commonly employed technique for bone mass determinations world-wide&lt;ref name=gilsanz&gt;Gilsanz, V. (1998). Bone density in children: a review of the available techniques and indications. European Journal of Radiology(26), 177-182.&lt;/ref&gt;. Using DXA scan data and statistical analysis (T-scores), the [http://www.who.int/en/ World Health Organization] has developed a diagnostic threshold for low bone mineral conditions&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation. (2003). Prevention and Management of Osteoporosis. Retrieved October 12, 2013, from WHO Technical Report Series: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_921.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The T-score value indicates the number of standard deviations that an individuals DXA results are away from the young adult reference mean for their particular reference group. Common analysis sites are the hip, spine and forearm. 
* T-score of 1 to -1; Normal bone mass
* T-score of -1 to -2.5; Low bone mass (osteopenia)
* T-score of -2.5 or more; Osteoporosis
* T-score of -2.5 or more with fragility fracture; Severe (established) osteoporosis

=====Risk Factors for Osteoporosis=====

The [http://www.iofbonehealth.org/ International Osteoporosis Foundation] has grouped osteoporosis risk factors into two categories; fixed &amp; modifiable&lt;ref&gt;International Osteoporosis Foundation. (2013). Who's at risk? Retrieved October 4, 2013, from International Osteoporosis Foundation: http://www.iofbonehealth.org/whos-risk&lt;/ref&gt;. Having one, or several, of these risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing osteoporosis.

=====Prevalence in Australia=====
In 2007/08, it was estimated that osteoporosis affected 3.4% (692,000) of all Australians&lt;ref name=ABS&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2011, July 29). Arthritis and Osteoporosis in Australia: A Snapshot, 2007-08. Retrieved September 5, 2013, from Australian Bureau of Statistics: http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4843.0.55.001main+features32007-08&lt;/ref&gt;. This estimate has more than doubled since 1995 in Australia, from 1.5% to 3.1% of the total population&lt;ref name=ABS/&gt;.
According to [http://www.osteoporosis.org.au/ Osteoporosis Australia], over 1 million people in Australia suffer from osteoporosis at present.&lt;ref&gt;Osteoporosis Australia. (2013). Risk factors for Osteoporosis. Retrieved September 3, 2013, from http://www.osteoporosis.org.au/about/about-osteoporosis/risk-factors/&lt;/ref&gt;, and this number appears to be increasing with an aging population. 
In 2004/05, the total direct health expenditure for osteoporosis in Australia was $304 million&lt;ref name=AIHW&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. (2011). A snapshot of osteoporosis in Australia 2011. Canberra: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.&lt;/ref&gt;. Of this amount, $215 million was spent on  pharmaceutical medicines, despite osteoporosis being a largely preventable disease&lt;ref name=AIHW/&gt;.

==High-Impact Exercise and Osteoporosis==

=====What is High-Impact Exercise?=====

High impact exercise (HIE) is any action that applies a high or intense ground reaction force to the body. Types of HIEs may include jumping (and variations of), plyometrics, skipping, running and drop jumping. HIE is essentially any exercise that applies a high, rapid loading rate to a bone.

=====High-Impact Exercise and it's effect on Osteoporosis=====

HIE utilises Wolff's Law of bone remodeling to cause positive adaptations in bone tissue. Wolff's Law states that a will bone grow and remodel in response to the demands and stresses placed on it&lt;ref&gt;Marieb, E. N., &amp; Hoehn, K. (2010). Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology (8 ed.). San Francisco: Pearson Benjamin Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, the high loading rate of HIE places stress on a specific bone, causing it to remodel and strengthen in response.
HIE has been proven to increase bone mass at the femoral neck following HIE protocols&lt;ref&gt;Allison, S. J., Folland, J. P., Rennie, W. J., Summers, G. D., &amp; Brooke-Wavell, K. (2013). High-impact exercise increased femoral neck bone mineral density in older men: A randomised unilateral intervention. Bone(53), 321-328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, C. A., &amp; Brooke-Wavell, K. (2010). Optimum frequency of exercise for bone health: Randomised controlled trial of a high-impact unilateral intervention. Bone(46), 1043-1049.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinomen, A., Mäntynen, J., Kannus, P., Uusi-Rasi, K., Nikander, R., Kontulainen, S., &amp; Sievänen, H. (2012). Effects of High-Impact Training and Detraining on Femoral Neck Structure in Premenopausal Women: A Hip Structural Analysis of an 18-Month Randomized Controlled Exercise Intervention with 3.5 Year Follow-Up . Physiotherapy Canada, 64(1), 98-105.&lt;/ref&gt;. Odd-impact exercises, those with random loading directions, have caused similar positive bone adaptations, but are mechanically less-demanding on the body than HIE&lt;ref name=odd&gt;Nikander, R., Kannus, P., Dastidar, P., Hannula, M., Harrison, L., Cervinka, T., Narra, N.G., Aktour, R., Arola, T., Eskola, H., Soimakallio, S., Heinonen, A., Hyttinen, J. &amp; Sievana, H. (2009). Targeted exercises against hip fragility. Osteoporosis International(20), 1321-1328.&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, using HIE with odd-impacts and random loading directions may be best for improving bone strength, and slowing osteoporosis.

=====Limitations of High-Impact Exercise on Osteoporosis=====
Using HIE for bone adaptations may not be practical for some bones (eg. ribs). The benefits may be restricted to those bones that are readily loaded with high forces. These high loads may increase a persons susceptibility to fracture during impacts however, and therefore may not be practical for use in conditions with weak bones, or those susceptible to falls.

==Recommendations for High-Impact Exercise and Osteoporosis==
* HIE should not be used in populations with a fracture history. The high loads placed on bones during HIE may cause a fracture.
* Those with poor balance and coordination should not use HIE as it may increase the likelihood of a fall. 
* HIE should be used to maximise peak bone mass during childhood and adolescence. 
* HIE with odd-impacts are best for bone remodeling&lt;ref name=odd/&gt;. Odd-impact activities include basketball, netball, plyometrics, dancing and gymnastics.  
* Other exercise types that involve high impact loads may be more beneficial as they include other benefits, such as muscle growth (resistance) and cardiovascular health (aerobic).
* Prevention is the best method for reducing the likelihood of osteoporosis, and this can be done by minimising the effect of modifiable risk factors.

== no-link images? ==

I see you've added &quot;link=&quot; to a bunch of images, so one can't get info about the image by clicking on it.  I have a vague recollection, from long ago, of a discussion about this on Wikibooks, but I'm honestly unsure how the matter was left.  Myself, I've always liked being able to conjure up the info about an image by clicking on it; and arguably the availability of that info is important as it's the way to find out about the copyright and licensing on the image.

Your thoughts?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:06, 19 October 2013 (UTC)

:If you think it's inappropriate, just undo it. However, I do think it makes the Wikijunior main page cleaner. For example, if a child is looking at Wikijunior and they click on the image, they might be confused on how to get back to where they are because the image links to Wikimedia instead of Wikibooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background to Osteoporosis ==
Osteoporosis is a disease of the musculoskeletal system characterized by a low bone mineral density which leads to fragility of the bone structure&lt;ref name=chan&gt;Chan, KM. Anderson, M. Lau, E. 2003, ‘Exercise interventions: defusing the worlds osteoporosis time bomb’, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, vol. 81, pp. 827-830&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Viera/&gt;. The people most commonly effected by osteoporosis are women and the elderly, this puts post menopausal women at a significant risk&lt;ref name=kanis&gt;Kanis, JA. Melton, LJ. Christiansen, C. Johnston, CC. Khaltaev, N. 1994, ‘The Diagnosis of Osteoporosis’, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, vol. 9, no. 8, pp. 1137-1141&lt;/ref&gt;. As we age it is possible for our bone mineral density to decrease by as much as 1%-2% per year&lt;ref name=liu&gt;Liu, P. Brummel-smith, K. Ilich, J. 2011, ‘Aerobic exercise and Whole-Body Vibration in Offsetting Bone Loss in Older Adults’, Journal of Aging Research, pp.1-9&lt;/ref&gt;. Because bone density is reduced in osteoporosis sufferers they are at a greater risk of suffering fractures than those who have healthy bones&lt;ref name=kanis/&gt;. It is common for osteoporosis to only be diagnosed after a fracture occurs, by which time the disease is usually reasonably advanced and further fractures are likely&lt;ref name=pearson&gt;Pearson, JA. Burkhart, E. Pifalo, BW. Palaggo-Toy, T. Krohn, K. 2005, ‘A Lifestyle Modification Intervention for the Treatment of Osteoporosis’, American Journal of Health Promotion, vol. 20, no. 1, pp. 28-33&lt;/ref&gt;. As the populations of countries age and the elderly make up a greater proportion of them the costs of osteoporosis is expected to increase&lt;ref name=pearson/&gt;. The rate of osteoporotic fractures has already increased fourfold since 1990&lt;ref name=chan/&gt;.

== Diagnosis of Osteoporosis ==
Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry(DEXA) is the gold standard test for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) and is the one that's most commonly used&lt;ref name=chan/&gt;. A bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young healthy adult would generally diagnose someone as suffering from osteoporosis, the presence of a fracture would imply severe osteoporosis&lt;ref name=kanis/&gt;. Osteoporosis is very closely linked with fractures and the prevalence of people with a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below a normal score is very similar to the prevalence of people who suffer from hip fractures&lt;ref name=kanis/&gt;. It can be difficult to diagnose because bone mineral density can be analyzed at various locations in the body and different results can be found at different locations. The most common places to do a bone mineral density scan are the femoral head, lumbar spine and the wrist as they are places where fractures are most likely to occur&lt;ref name=chan/&gt; .

|}

== Significance ==
The reason osteoporosis has become a significant issue is the negative effects that it can have on an individual, and the way that this can influence that persons quality of life. These negative effects can be either physical or psychological. The main physical effect osteoporosis has is the reduction of bone mineral density that occurs and the increased likelihood of  fractures. These fractures can then impact someone not only physically but also psychologically as a fear of suffering further fractures can result in anxiety and depression&lt;ref name=pearson/&gt;.

== Treatment ==
The main treatment used to reduce fractures are lifestyle changes, such as exercise, and use of medication. 

=== Medication ===
Biophosphonates are the most common type of medication used to treat osteoporosis and they work by reducing the amount of bone tissue that is reabsorbed from the bone&lt;ref name=Viera&gt;Viera, HP. Leite, IA. Sampaio, TMA. Anjos de Paula, J. Andrade, A. Abreu, L. Valenti, V. Goulart, F. Adami, F. 2012, ‘Biophosphonates adherence for treatment of osteoporosis’, International Archives of Medicine, vol. 6, no.1, pp. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt;. When used correctly, biophosphonates can reduce the incidence of certain fractures by up to 50% but like many long term treatments the compliance with the treatment can be as low as 50% of patients&lt;ref name=Viera/&gt;. This low adherence rate means that solely
using medication may not be the best treatment.

=== The Role of Exercise ===
By increasing the load placed on the bones through exercise the bone mineral density can be maintained or even increase over time, as opposed the normal decrease that comes as  a result of aging. Resistance exercise has been shown to have the greatest impact on improving bone health because it creates the greatest loading on the bones, although aerobic exercise still has an important role to play in bone health&lt;ref name=gomez&gt;Gomez-Cabello, A. Ara, I. Gonzalez-Agueri, A. Casajus, JA. Vicente-Rodriguez, G. 2012, ‘Effects of Training on Bone Mass in Older Adults’, Sports Medicine, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 301-325&lt;/ref&gt;. 
When using aerobic exercise as a treatment for osteoporosis the type and intensity of the exercise is very important, both for its intended effects on bone mineral density, and when thinking about injury prevention. Resistance exercise stimulates bones by increasing the weight they must hold, aerobic exercise must be weight bearing as well if it's to provide a similar stimulatory effect on bone growth&lt;ref name=Karakiriou&gt;Karakiriou, S. Duoda, H. Smilios, I. Volaklis, K. Tokmakidis, S. 2012, ‘Effects of vibration and exercise training on bone mineral density and muscular strength in post-menopausal women’, European Journal of Sport Science, vol. 12, no.1, pp.81-88&lt;/ref&gt;. Exercises such as swimming and cycling will not improve bone mass because they aren't weight bearing. More vigorous, high intensity exercise will be more effective at improving bone mineral density because of the greater stress placed on the bones&lt;ref name=liu/&gt;. Aerobic exercise can have many benefits other than just an increase in bone mineral density such as improving other aspects of a patients health like aerobic capacity, muscular strength and a reduction in body fat &lt;ref name=Karakiriou/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, A. Winters-Stone, K. Gallucci, B. 2007, ‘Exercise Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Women with Breast Cancer Receiving Adjuvant Chemotherapy’, Oncology Nursing Forum, vol. 34, no. 3, pp. 627-633&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Aerobic Exercise Recommendations ===
It is recommended that patients exercise for sessions of 30 - 60 minutes at least 3 times per week&lt;ref name=liu/&gt;. The exercises need to be weight bearing, or of a reasonable intensity to provide enough stress on the bones to stimulate growth. In osteoporotic patients care must be taken when prescribing an exercise regime as their bones are more fragile and prone to fractures. High impact exercises such as plyometrics or exercises that carry a risk of falls should be avoided&lt;ref&gt;Mishra, N. Mishra, V. 2011, ‘Exercise beyond menopause: Dos and Don’ts’, Journal of Mid-life Health, vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 52-56&lt;/ref&gt;.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 1:  Review of Chemical Bonding'''&lt;/big&gt;==
[[File:Phosphorus-pentoxide-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|Ball-and-stick representation of chemical bonding in the molecules P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.]]Molecules (and extended solids) are built from atoms that form chemical bonds.  Theories of bonding seek to explain why molecules and solids form, what their structures are, why some are more stable than others, and how they react.  As we will learn in Chapter 2, quantum mechanics gives us the most realistic picture of chemical bonding via molecular orbital (MO) theory.  However, the MO description of bonding is conceptually difficult and mathematically intensive.  This chapter will review less rigorous (but still useful) models such as Lewis dot structures and valence shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory.  When combined with a qualitative quantum mechanical description of bonding through the concepts of orbital hybridization and resonance, these simple models can help us understand a great deal about the structures, stabilities, and reactions of inorganic molecules.

The theory of chemical bonding has a long history, dating back to ancient Greece and the atomists [[w:Democritus|Democritus]], [[w:Leucippus|Leucippus]], and the [[w:Epicureanism|Epicureans]].  They postulated the existence of immutable atoms moving through the void, and envisioned the physical properties of materials as arising from the kinds and shapes of atoms.  In his epic poem ''[[w:de_rerum_natura|De rerum natura]]'' (On the Nature of Things), the Roman poet [[w:Lucretius|Lucretius]] (c. 99 BC – c. 50 BC), drawing on his Epicurean beliefs, describes some atoms and chemical bonding in the following way:

''What seems to us the hardened and condensed''&lt;br&gt;
''Must be of atoms among themselves more hooked,''&lt;br&gt;
''Be held compacted deep within, as 'twere''&lt;br&gt;
''By branch-like atoms -- of which sort the chief''&lt;br&gt;
''Are diamond stones, despisers of all blows''&lt;br&gt;
''And stalwart flint and strength of solid iron''&lt;br&gt;
''And brazen bars, which, budging hard in locks,''&lt;br&gt;
''Do grate and scream.  But what are liquid, formed''&lt;br&gt;
''Of fluid body, they indeed must be''&lt;br&gt;
''Of elements more smooth and round -- because''&lt;br&gt;
''Their globules severally will not cohere.''

Lucretius' [http://courses.chem.psu.edu/chem310/lucretius.pdf poem] is enjoyable reading and contains some remarkable insights into the microscopic world, given the tools available at the time.  Modern analytical methods show that he was off base with his ideas about hooks and spheres, however.  We will revisit the nature of chemical bonding in the substances Lucretius mentions (diamond, silicates, iron, brass, and water) in the context of modern chemical theories to understand why they have the special properties they do.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;1.1 Valence bond theory: Lewis dot structures, the octet rule, formal charge, resonance, and the isoelectronic principle==
[[File:electron dot.svg|250px|thumb|right|Fig. 1.1.1.  Examples of Lewis dot diagrams showing chemical bonds between carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and non-bonding electron pairs.]]
'''Atoms and Molecules'''&lt;br&gt;
[[w:Atomism|Atomism]], because it was dismissed by [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]], enjoyed a long sleep in scientific discourse until it was reconsidered by  [[w:Galileo_Galilei|Galileo]], [[w:René_Descartes|Decartes]], and [[w:Pierre_Gassendi|Gassendi]] in the 1600's.  [[w:John_Dalton|Dalton]] postulated the modern atomic theory in 1808 based on his observation that elements such as hydrogen and oxygen combined in specific ratios (the Law of Definite Proportions), but the atomic theory remained contentious throughout most of the 19th century.  [[w:JJ_Thompson|Thompson]], [[w:Ernest_Rutherford|Rutherford]], [[w:Nils_Bohr|Bohr]], and others around the turn of the 20th century established that matter was indeed composed of atoms that contained heavy nuclei and light electrons, and that atoms could exist in excited states that could be interpreted as excitations of their electrons to different energy levels.  However the atomic theory did not provide a ready explanation for the bonded states of atoms in molecules.

In 1916, still more than a decade before modern quantum theory would adequately describe the shapes of [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]], [[w:Gilbert_N._Lewis|Lewis]] proposed the octet theory based on the empirically observed rules of valence, i.e., the combining ratios of atoms in molecules.&lt;ref&gt;G. N. Lewis, &quot;The atom and the molecule,&quot; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1916, 38, 762-785&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory, in hindsight, can be rationalized for s- and p-block elements by observing that main-group atoms can use their four valence orbitals (s, p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;) to accomodate up to eight electrons, some or all of which may be shared with other atoms. In Lewis' model, the valence electrons of an atom were situated at the corners of a cube, and the cubes could share edges or faces to complete their octets.  Lewis developed a shorthand notation for these structures based on dots that represented the valence electrons, as illustrated in Fig. 1.1.1. A pair of electrons shared between atoms constitutes a chemical bond, and can also be represented as a line joining the atoms.  Four electrons shared between atoms, represented by two lines, is a double bond, and so forth.  Any pairs of electrons not involved in bonding form &quot;lone pairs&quot; that belong to one atom only and are thus not involved in bonding.

The Lewis picture is powerful in its simplicity.  It can be readily used to rationalize or predict the combining ratios of atoms, to sort plausible and unlikely structures for molecules (including large ones), and to rationalize the acid-base properties of many molecules.  It is important to remember that the model is built on a shaky, pre-quantum mechanical description of atoms and so with it, we will make mistakes.  Nevertheless it is useful to see how far we can go with the Lewis model.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Constructing the octet valence bond picture for a molecule:'''&lt;br /&gt;
We can construct an octet picture for any molecule using the N-V method.&lt;br /&gt;

Number of electrons ''needed'' to make separate octets around all atoms = '''N'''&lt;br /&gt;

(N = 8 for non-H atoms, N=2 for H)&lt;br /&gt;

Number of ''valence'' electrons = '''V'''  (add up using group numbers; don't forget to add or subtract for charges on ions)&lt;br /&gt;

Number of ''shared'' electrons = '''S''' = N-V, number of bonds = S/2&lt;br /&gt;

Fill in lone pairs everywhere else to complete octets&lt;br /&gt;

Example:  nitrate anion, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

N = 4 atoms x 8 electrons = 32&lt;br /&gt;
V = 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 24  	(N + O + O + O + charge)&lt;br /&gt;
S = 32-24 = 8 shared electrons = '''4 bonds'''&lt;br /&gt;

The number of lone pairs is obtained by difference: (V-S)/2 = (24-8)/2 = 8&lt;br /&gt;

Now draw the molecule, starting with the four bonds and adding eight lone pairs to complete the octets:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:nitrate Lewis dot structure.jpg|80px|left]]			
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Count the shared and unshared electrons around each atom in the nitrate ion and you will see that all atoms are '''octet''' and that the total number of valence electrons (V) is 24.  If you do the N-V calculation according to the rules above, you should always get an octet structure.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The '''formal charge''' distribution is assigned by dividing the shared (bonding) electrons equally between atoms.  Thus, the singly bonded O atoms each possess 7 electrons, and because O is in group 6, their formal charge is -1.  The doubly bonded O has a formal charge of zero.  The N atom has a formal charge of +1 because it &quot;owns&quot; 4 valence electrons and is in group 5.  

Note that the '''formal charge''' is '''not''' the same thing as the '''oxidation number''' (or '''oxidation state''').  In the nitrate ion, the oxidation state of nitrogen is +5 and the oxidation state of oxygen is -2.  The formal charge is typically closer to the &quot;real&quot; charge on the atom (as measured, e.g., by [[w:X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy|X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]]).  Oxidation states are a useful bookkeeping device for keeping track of oxidation-reduction reactions, as we will discuss in Chapter 4.  Like oxidation states, the formal charges on the atoms in a molecule or ion must ''add up to its overall charge''. 

We can similarly draw the Lewis structure for ammonia as shown below:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:ammonia Lewis structure.jpg|180px|left]]			
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we divide the shared electrons equally between the atoms, we see that the N atom has five electrons and each H atom has one. These are the same as their group numbers, and thus, all the formal charges in the ammonia molecule are zero.

Octet structures of the Lewis acid-base adduct NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the hydronium ion H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the sulfate anion SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; are shown below.  In this case (and in many Lewis structures we will draw), we leave off the implied lone pairs around the peripheral atoms.  Try calculating the number of bonds in each of these molecules using the N-V method, and fill in the lone pairs that are not explicitly drawn in.
[[File:octet structures.jpg|370px|left]]			
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In cases where more than one valence bond structure is possible, we can use formal charges to decide which structures should be more or less stable.  The rules are:&lt;br /&gt;

*The formal charges on atoms are minimized in stable structures, zero being the best case.
*Negative formal charges should be placed on the most electronegative atom(s).
*Positive formal charges should be placed on the least electronegative atom(s).
*It is unfavorable to place like charges (++ or --) on neighboring atoms in a molecule.
&lt;br /&gt;

Examples of these rules are shown below for alternative structures of BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ONF.  

[[File:BF3 resonance structures.jpg|200px|left]]

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; case, the structure on the left is non-octet, because there are only six electrons (three bonds) in the valence shell of B.  Such structures are said to be ''electron deficient.''  An octet structure (right) can be drawn, but it places a positive formal charge on F, the most electronegative atom in the molecule.  Thus, neither structure is completely &quot;happy,&quot; but the formal charge rules tell us that the electron-deficient structure on the left is more stable.  The electron deficiency of BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; makes it a powerful Lewis acid.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:ONF resonance structures.jpg|225px|left]]


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the case of ONF, the structure on the left is unfavorable for two reasons.  First, it places a positive formal charge on F, the most electronegative atom.  Second, there is another possible structure (right) that has zero formal charge, which is preferable to one with non-zero charge.  This means that the structure on the right, with a double bond between N and O, is more reasonable.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Resonance structures'''&lt;br&gt;  
The ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule has two equivalent octet structures, shown below:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:ozone resonance structures.jpg|225px|left]]

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In both cases, the Lewis dot diagram suggests that there are three kinds of oxygen atoms in the molecule, with +1, 0, and -1 formal charges.  These structures also suggest that ozone should have one single and one double bond.  Experimentally (by electron diffraction), however, we find that the molecule is symmetric, with both O-O bond lengths the same. The real (instantaneous) structure is the average of the two forms, as shown below.  In the classical Lewis picture of the molecule, we can rationalize resonance by observing that electrons, being thousands of times lighter than the nuclei of atoms, move very fast on the timescale of molecular vibrations.  Thus, in the time it takes for the oxygen atoms to adjust their positions, the electrons can move back and forth many times.  In the quantum mechanical MO picture (Chapter 2), we will see that resonance involves electrons that are fully delocalized over the atoms in the molecule. We represent resonance structures with a double-headed arrow to signify that the only difference between the Lewis structures is the distribution of electrons.

In the instantaneous structure of ozone, the formal (-) charge is shared between the two terminal oxygen atoms and therefore each one has a formal charge of -1/2.  The O-O bonds are the average of a single and a double bond, i.e., each O-O bond order is 1.5.
[[File:ozone avg structure.jpg|150px|left]]

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Similarly, the nitrate anion has three resonance structures, and experimentally we find that all the N-O bonds in the ion are the same.  In this case, in the averaged structure, each O atom has a formal charge of -2/3 and the N-O bond order is 4/3 (=1.33...).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Nitrate ion resonance structures.png|300px|left]] = [[File:nitrate avg structure.jpg|100px]]
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Inequivalent resonance structures'''&lt;br&gt;
The rules of resonance also apply to inequivalent structures, which in general will have different energies from each other.  In this case the structure of the molecule represents a weighted average of the low energy structures.  A good example is the cyanate ion, OCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  We can write three inequivalent octet structures for the molecule:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:cyanate resonance structures.jpg|350px|left]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first two are reasonable resonance structures, although we suspect the one on the left is the best because it puts the negative formal charge on the most electronegative atom.  The last one is clearly a bad resonance structure, because the formal charges are high and there is a positive charge on the oxygen atom.  The real structure is thus a weighted average of the first two.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''No-bond resonance'''&lt;br&gt;
An interesting and useful kind of inequivalent resonance structure is one in which there is a bond order of ''zero'' between two of the atoms.  This concept of '''no-bond resonance''' is important in understanding the bonding in many halogen- and hydrogen-containing compounds. The idea is illustrated below for the generic molecule X-Y-Z, where Z might be an electronegative halogen atom such as F.  By moving the bonding electrons from the Y-Z bond onto the Z atom, and moving a lone pair from X into the X-Y bond, we generate the resonance structure shown on the right in which all atoms remain octet, but there is no bond between Y and Z.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:no bond resonance.jpg|300px|left]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to recognize in this example that the no-bond form is only one resonance structure, and therefore the Z atom is still bound to Y.  If the two resonance structures in this example have the same energy, we would expect the X-Y bond order to be 1.5 and the Y-Z bond order to be 0.5.  Therefore the Y-Z bond should be longer than it is in a compound where the bond order is one, and it should be relatively easy to break the Y-Z bond.

Some molecular examples of no-bond resonance are shown below.  In the molecule ONF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the N-F bond is unusually long relative to the N-F bond in NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, in which the bond order is 1.  This can be explained by the no-bond resonance forms shown on the right.  Similarly, in the Lewis acid-base adduct formed by combining BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with CO, we can explain the long B-H bonds using no-bond resonance forms that place a partial positive charge on the H atoms.
&lt;br /&gt;

No-bond resonance is often used to provide an octet bonding picture for so-called '''[[w:Hypervalent_molecule|hypervalent compounds]]''', which are compounds that appear to have more than 8 valence electrons in the bonding shell of the central atom.  For example, we can consider two different valence bond structures for the triiodide ion, I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, which is formed by reaction of I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in water:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In this structure, the central iodine atom has 10 electrons in its valence shell, in violation of the octet rule.  Raman spectra of the triiodide ion show that the I-I bond is weaker than the I-I single bond in I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, suggesting that this picture is not an accurate description of the bonding.  A better representation of I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; can be obtained with no-bond resonance structures, as shown below.  We will see that this picture is consistent with the MO description of I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; in Chapter 2:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

We can draw a similar picture for the XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, which has the same number of valence electrons as I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  This picture is consistent with XPS data, which show a partial negative charge on the F atoms, as well as vibrational spectra, which show that the Xe-F bond is weaker in XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than it is in the singly-bonded cation Xe-F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;

Other well known examples of hypervalent compounds are PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, P(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as oxyacids such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  The hypervalent structure is often drawn for these molecules, with the explanation that d-orbitals on the central atom contribute to the bonding in dsp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids for 5- and 6-coordinate molecules, respectively.  However, realistic molecular orbital calculations show that the phosphorus and sulfur 3d orbitals are too high in energy to contribute significantly to bonding in PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. For these molecules, we can use no-bond resonance to make reasonable octet structures that predict polar bonds between the central atom and F.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


In other cases, such as P(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, the octet structure is unreasonable because it suggests a polar bond between P and C, with a partial negative charge on C.  Further, in the case of oxyacids such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, X-ray crystallographic data establish that the S-O and Cl-O bonds are shorter for the oxygen atoms not bonded to hydrogen, which is more consistent with the hypervalent picture:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[File:octet&amp;hypervalent H2SO4.jpg|200px|left]][[File:Sulfuric-acid-2D-dimensions.svg|130px]]
&lt;br&gt;
The question of whether hypervalency and the octet rule are really useful descriptions of the bonding in these compounds has been considered in a number of computational studies, which have used increasingly accurate quantum mechanical calculations to determine the number of electrons associated with the central atom.  In a 2002 study, Gillespie and Silvi&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Gillespie and B. Silvi, &quot;The octet rule and hypervalence: two misunderstood concepts,&quot; Coord. Chem. Rev. 233-234, 53-62 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; found that the population of the valence shell is greater than eight for compounds with electropositive ligands, such as P(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and less than eight for compounds such as PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  They concluded that these valence electron shell populations depend primarily on the coordination numbers and electronegativities of the central atoms and their ligands, and that there is no fundamental difference between the bonding in hypervalent and non-hypervalent (Lewis octet) molecules.  This reminds us that the octet rule is not a law of nature, but rather an empirical rule that is useful within certain limits.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''The isoelectronic principle'''&lt;br /&gt;
In calculating the octet structures of molecules using the N-V method, we needed to know only the number of atoms and the number of electrons, not the identities of the atoms themselves.  This means that we will get the same answer (and the same set of octet and resonance structures) for ''any'' molecule or ion that contains (a) the same number of non-hydrogen atoms, and (b) the same total number of valence electrons.  Such molecules are said to be ''isoelectronic.''  This is a powerful conclusion because, once we have determined the electronic structure of one molecule, we can write down the same solution for ''all other molecules'' that are isoelectronic.  For example, we noted above that I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which both have 22 valence electrons, have the same valence bond structure.  We can further expect that isoelectronic molecules will have the same shapes and, very often, similar physical properties.  

The molecules and ions shown below on the left all contain three non-hydrogen atoms and 16 valence electrons.  All of them are linear molecules with two double bonds.  The molecules and ions on the right all contain four non-hydrogen atoms and 24 valence electrons.  All of them are trigonal planar molecules.  While BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a member of this isoelectronic series, we do not write it in the resonance form that contains a B=F double bond, because that would put a positive formal charge on F.

Similarly we can show that CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, HF, F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; are all isoelectronic with one non-H atom and eight valence electrons.  In the next section we will see that this gives rise to nearly identical electronic shapes for these molecules.


'''Isoelectronic solids.'''  The isoelectronic principle works not just for molecules but for extended solids as well.  One technologically important set of isoelectronic solids are the p-block semiconductors.  The group 14 element Si is the most widely used semiconductor for electronics, but, as we will discuss later, it is not a good light emitter.  Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are used in lasers, high efficiency lighting, and display technologies, are made from compounds that are isoelectronic with Si and Ge, especially GaAs, GaP, AlAs, and GaN (all contain four valence electrons per atom).  CdTe and CuIn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (CIGS) are promising solar cell materials that also have the same number of valence electrons per atom.  Like Si and Ge, these compounds have tetrahedrally bonded structures in the solid state and absorb light across most of the solar spectrum, as we will discuss in more detail in Chapters 8 and 10.


The isoelectronic principle is also a powerful tool in materials research, because it provides guidance about where to look for new materials with similar and perhaps improved properties.  For example, the discovery that 8.5% efficient thin layer solar cells could be made with the compound CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Chung, B. Lee,  J. He,	R. P. H. Chang	 and M. G. Kanatzidis, All-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells with high efficiency, Nature 485, 486-489 (2012). doi:10.1038/nature11067&lt;/ref&gt; stimulated the exploration of many isoelectronic ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds with the same perovskite crystal structure. Very recently solar cells in this family based on CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; have been reported with efficiencies as high as 14-15%.&lt;ref&gt;S.D.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;1.2 The shapes of molecules (VSEPR theory) and orbital hybridization ==
[[Image:Water molecule dimensions.svg|thumb|200px|Fig. 1.2.1. Geometry of the [[w:water (molecule)|water molecule]]]]
The [[w:VSEPR_theory|Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory]] is a simple and useful way to predict and rationalize the shapes of molecules.  The theory is based on the idea of minimizing the electrostatic repulsion between electron pairs, as first proposed by Sidgwick and Powell in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;N. V. Sidgwick and H. M. Powell, Proc. Roy. Soc. A176, 153 (1940),&lt;/ref&gt; then generalized by Gillespie and Nyholm in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Gillespie and R. S. Nyholm, Quart. Rev. Chem. Soc., 11, 339 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; and then broadly applied over the intervening 50+ years.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Gillespie, &quot;Fifty years of the VSEPR model,&quot; Coord. Chem. Rev. 252, 1315-1327 (2008). DOI: 10.1016/j.ccr.2007.07.007&lt;/ref&gt;

To use the VSEPR model, one begins with the Lewis dot picture to determine the number of lone pairs and bonding domains around a central atom.  Because VSEPR considers all bonding domains equally (i.e., a single bond, a double bond, and a half bond all count as one electron domain), one can use either an octet or hypervalent structure, provided that the number of lone pairs (which should be the same in both) is calculated correctly.  For example, in either the hypervalent or octet structure of the I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion above, there are three lone pairs on the central I atom and two bonding domains.  We then follow these steps to obtain the '''electronic geometry''':
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*Determine the number of lone pairs on the central atom in the molecule, and add the number of bonded atoms (a.k.a. bonding domains)
*This number (the ''steric number'') defines the electronic shape of the molecule by minimizing repulsion.  For example a steric number of three gives a trigonal planar electronic shape.
*The angles between electron domains are determined primarily by the electronic geometry (e.g., 109.5° for a steric number of 4, which implies that the electronic shape is a tetrahedron)
*These angles are adjusted by the hierarchy of repulsions:  (lone pair - lone pair) &gt; (lone pair - bond) &gt; (bond - bond)
&lt;br /&gt;

The '''molecular geometry''' is deduced from the electronic geometry by considering the lone pairs to be present but invisible.  The most commonly used methods to determine molecular structure - [[w:X-ray_diffraction|X-ray diffraction]], [[w:Neutron_diffraction|neutron diffraction]], and [[w:Electron_diffraction|electron diffraction]] - have a hard time seeing lone pairs, but they can accurately determine the lengths of bonds between atoms and the bond angles.

The table below gives examples of electronic and molecular shapes for steric numbers between 2 and 9.  We are most often concerned with molecules that have steric numbers between 2 and 6.

&lt;br /&gt;
From the Table, we see that some of the molecules shown as examples have bond angles that depart from the ideal electronic geometry.  For example, the H-N-H bond angle in ammonia is 107°, and the H-O-H angle in water is 104.5°.  We can rationalize this in terms of the last rule above.  The lone pair in ammonia repels the electrons in the N-H bonds more than they repel each other.  This lone pair repulsion exerts even more steric influence in the case of water, where there are two lone pairs.  Similarly, the axial F-S-F angle in the &quot;bent-T&quot; molecule SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a few degrees less than 180° because of repulsion by the lone pair in the molecule.

For some molecules in the Table, we note that there is more than one possible shape that would satisfy the VSEPR rules.  For example, the XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has a steric number of five and a trigonal bipyramidal geometry.  There are three possible stereoisomers:  one in which the F atoms occupy axial sites, resulting in linear molecule, one in which the F atoms occupy one equatorial and one axial site (resulting in a 90° bond angle), and one in which the F atoms are both on equatorial sites, with a F-Xe-F bond angle of 120°.

[[File:XeF2 geometry.jpg|130px|left]]
The observed geometry of XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is linear, which can be rationalized by considering the orbitals that are used to make bonds (or lone pairs) in the axial and equatorial positions.  There are four available orbitals, s, p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;.  If we choose the z-axis as the axial direction, we can see that the p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals lie in the equatorial plane.  We assume that the spherical s orbital is shared equally by the five electron domains in the molecule, the two axial bonds share the p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, and the three equatorial bonds share the p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals.  We can then calculate the bond orders to axial and equatorial F atoms as follows:
&lt;br /&gt;

axial:  1/5 s + 1/2 p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.7 bond (formal charge = -0.3)&lt;br /&gt;
equatorial: 1/5 s + 1/3 p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/3 p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.867 bond (formal charge = -0.133)
&lt;br /&gt;

Because fluorine is more electronegative than a lone pair, it prefers the axial site where it will have more negative formal charge.  In general, by this reasoning, lone pairs and electropositive ligands such as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; will always prefer the equatorial sites in the trigonal bipyramidal geometry.  Electronegative ligands such as F will always go to the axial sites.

In the case of the BrF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; anion, which is isoelectronic with XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the Table, the electronic geometry is octahedral and there are two possible isomers in which the two lone pairs are ''cis'' or ''trans'' to each other.  In this case, lone pair - lone pair repulsion dominates and we obtain the ''trans'' arrangement of lone pairs, giving a square planar molecular geometry.

'''Orbital hybridization'''
&lt;br /&gt;
The observation of molecules in the various electronic shapes shown above is, at first blush, in conflict with our picture of [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]].  For an atom such as oxygen, we know that the 2s orbital is spherical, and that the 2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, 2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals are dumbell-shaped and point along the Cartesian axes (Fig. 1.2.2).  The water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms bound to oxygen not at a 90° angle, but at an angle of 104.5°.  Given the relative orientations of the [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]], how do we arrive at angles between electron domains of 104.5°, 120°, and so on?&lt;br&gt;

The [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]] ψ represent solutions to the [[w:Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave equation]], which for hydrogen-like (one-electron) atoms can be written as:&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E \psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2\psi - \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}\psi &lt;/math&gt;

where '''Z''' is the nuclear charge, ''e'' is the electron charge, and '''r''' is the position of the electron. The radial potential term on the right side of the equation is due to the [[w:Coulomb's law|Coulomb interaction]], in which ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[w:electric constant|electric constant]] (permittivity of free space) and 
[[File:Neon orbitals rotated.jpg|thumb|100px|Fig. 1.2.2. The shapes of the first five [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]]: 1s, 2s, 2p&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, 2p&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2p&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;. The colors denote the sign of the wave function.]]

is the 2-body [[w:reduced mass|reduced mass]] of the [[w:Nucleus (atomic structure)|nucleus]] of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and the electron of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.  To a good approximation, µ ≈ ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

Without going into too much detail about the Schrödinger equation, we can point out some of its most important properties:&lt;br&gt;

*The Schrödinger equation is a '''differential equation''', in which the [[w:Laplacian|Laplacian operator]] ∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; takes the second derivative (with respect to three spatial coordinates) of the wavefunction ψ.
*The solutions to the Schrödinger equation are a set of '''energies''' E (which are scalar quantities) and '''wavefunctions''' (a.k.a. '''[[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]]''') ψ, which are functions of the spatial coordinates x,y,z.  You will sometimes see the energies referred to as [[w:Eigenvalue|''eigenvalues'']] and the orbitals as [[w:eigenfunction|''eigenfunctions'']], because mathematically the Schrödinger equation is an eigenfunction-eigenvalue equation.  Although ψ is a function of the coordinates, E is not.  So an electron in a 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital has the same total energy E (= PE + KE) no matter where it is.
*These E values and their associated wavefunctions ψ are catalogued according to their '''[[w:Quantum_number|quantum numbers]]''' ''n,'' ''l,'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;.''  That is, there are many solutions to the differential equation, and each solution (ψ(xyz) and E) has a unique set of quantum numbers.  Some sets of orbitals are '''degenerate''', meaning that they have the same energy (e.g., 2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, 2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;).
*The solutions ψ(xyz) to the Schrödinger equation (e.g., the 1s, 2s, 2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, 2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals) represent '''probability amplitudes''' for finding the electron at a particular point (x,y,z) in space.  A probability amplitude can have either '''+ or - sign'''.  We typically represent the different signs by shading or by + and - signs on the two lobes of a 2p orbital.  
*The square of the probability amplitude, ψ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is always a positive number and represents the '''probability''' of finding the electron at a point x,y,z in space.  Because the total probability of finding the electron somewhere is 1, the wavefunction must be '''normalized''' so that the integral of ψ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; over the spatial coordinates (from -∞ to +∞) is 1.
*The solutions to the Schrödinger equation are '''orthogonal''', meaning that the product of any two (integrated over all space) is zero.  For example the product of the 2s and 2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, integrated over the spatial coordinates from -∞ to +∞, is zero.
&lt;br&gt;
Orbital hybridization involves making ''linear combinations'' of the [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]] that are solutions to the Schrödinger equation.  Mathematically, this is justified by recognizing that the Schrödinger equation is a ''linear'' differential equation.  As such, any sum of solutions to the Schrödinger equation is also a valid solution.  However, we still impose the constraint that our hybrid orbitals must be '''orthogonal''' and '''normalized'''.
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Rules for orbital hybridization:'''

* Add and subtract [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]] to get hybrid orbitals.
* We get the same numer of orbitals out as we put in.
* The energy of a hybrid orbital is the weighted average of the [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]] that make it up.
* The coefficients are determined by the constraints that the hybrid orbitals must be orthogonal and normalized.


For sp hybridization, as in the BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, we make two linear combinations of the 2s and 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals (assigning z as the axis of the Be-F bond):

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(2s) + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(2p_z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(2s) - \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(2p_z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Here we have simply added and subtracted the 2s and 2pz orbitals; we leave it as an exercise for the interested student to show that both orbitals are normalized (i.e., ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1) and orthogonal (ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0).

What this means physically is explained in Fig. 1.2.3.  By combining the 2s and 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals we have created two new orbitals with large lobes (high electron probability) pointing along the z-axis.  These two orbitals are degenerate and have an energy that is halfway between the energy of the 2s and 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals.
[[File:sp hybridization.jpg|thumb|500px|center|Fig. 1.2.3. Linear combinations of the 2s and 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]] make two 2sp&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; hybrids.  The 2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and 2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals are unchanged.]]
For an isolated Be atom, which has two valence electrons, the lowest energy state would have two electrons spin-paired in the 2s orbital.  However, these electrons would not be available for bonding.  By '''promoting''' these electrons to the degenerate 2sp&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid orbitals, they become unpaired and are prepared for bonding to the F atoms in BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This will occur if the '''bonding energy''' (in the promoted state) exceeds the promotion energy.  The '''overall bonding energy''', i.e., the energy released by combining a Be atom in its ground state with two F atoms, is the difference between the bonding and promotion energies.

We can similarly construct sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids (e.g., for the BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule or the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; anion) from one 2s and two 2p [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]].  Taking the plane of the molecule as the xy plane, we obtain three hybrid orbitals at 120° to each other.  The three hybrids are:
[[File:sp2hybrids.jpg|200px|right]]&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt 3}(2s) + \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 3}(2p_x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt 3}(2s) - \frac{1}{\sqrt 6}(2p_x) + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(2p_y)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 = \frac{1}{\sqrt 3}(2s) - \frac{1}{\sqrt 6}(2p_x) - \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(2p_y)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

These orbitals are again degenerate and their energy is the weighted average of the energies of the 2s, 2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]].

Finally, to make a sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid, as in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, etc., we combine all four [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]] to make four degenerate hybrids:
[[File:Ch4 hybridization.svg|130px|right]]&lt;br /&gt;
 [[File:Ch4-structure.png|130px|right]]&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 = \frac{1}{2}(2s + 2p_x + 2p_y + 2p_z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 = \frac{1}{2}(2s - 2p_x - 2p_y + 2p_z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 = \frac{1}{2}(2s + 2p_x - 2p_y - 2p_z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_4 = \frac{1}{2}(2s - 2p_x + 2p_y - 2p_z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The lobes of the sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals point towards the vertices of a tetrahedron (or alternate corners of a cube), consistent with the tetrahedral bond angle in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the nearly tetrahedral angles in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Similarly, we can show that we can construct the trigonal bipyramidal electronic shape by making sp and sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids, and the octahedral geometry from three sets of sp hybrids. The picture that emerges from this is that the [[w:Atomic_orbitals|atomic orbitals]] can hybridize as required by the shape that best minimizes electron pair repulsions.
[[File:Hydrogen-sulfide-2D-dimensions.svg|130px|right]]
Interestingly however, the bond angles in PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se are close to 90°, suggesting that P, S, and Se primarily use their p-orbitals in bonding to H in these molecules.  This is consistent with the fact that the energy difference between s and p orbitals stays roughly constant going down the periodic table, but the bond energy ''decreases'' as the valence electrons get farther away from the nucleus.  In compounds of elements in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rows of the periodic table, there thus is a ''decreasing tendency to use s-p orbital hybrids in bonding''.  For these heavier elements, the bonding energy is not enough to offset the energy needed to promote the s electrons to s-p hybrid orbitals.

On the Pauling scale, the electronegativity difference between two atoms A and B was defined in terms of the [[w:Bond dissociation energy|dissociation energies]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of the  A-A, B-B, and A-B bonds:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

On the Pauling scale, the least electronegative elements are the alkali metals (χ = 0.7-1.0) and the most electronegative are oxygen (3.5) and fluorine (4.0) at the uppper right of the periodic table.  Carbon and hydrogen have intermediate electronegativities (2.6 and 2.2 on the Pauling scale, respectively).  The general trend (see table below) is that electronegativities increase going up and to the right in the periodic table.  There are some interesting exceptions to this behavior, most notably two islands of high electronegatvity at the bottom of the transition series, peaking at tungsten (χ = 2.4) and gold (χ = 2.5).  The first of these can be explained by the very high metal-metal bond energy of elements such as Mo and W, which can use all six of their valence electrons in bonding, as we will discuss in Chapter 6.  The second however occurs with more weakly bonded noble metals such as Pt and Au, and is responsible for  their low position in the [[w:Reactivity_series|activity series]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Hammer and J. K. Norskov, &quot;Why gold is the noblest of all the metals,&quot; ''Nature'' '''376,''' 238 - 240 (2002. doi:10.1038/376238a0&lt;/ref&gt; as well as their extraordinary properties as catalysts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The polarity of bonds is determined by electronegativity differences.  As a guideline we define bonds as:

* '''ionic''' if Δχ &gt; 2.0
* '''polar''' if 2.0 &gt; Δχ &gt; 0.5
* '''nonpolar''' if 0.5 &gt; Δχ

The polarity of bonds helps us understand [[w:Intermolecular_force|non-covalent forces]] between molecules, such as [[w:Hydrogen_bonding|hydrogen bonding]] and dipole-dipole interactions. It also helps us interpret the reactivity of molecules.  For example, the Si-H bond (χ&lt;sub&gt;Si&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8, χ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.1) is more hydride-like than the C-H bond (χ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.5, χ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.1).  Therefore silanes react with acids to make H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas phosphines (χ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.1) and hydrocarbons do not.  Similarly, electrophilic substitution reactions occur more readily on Si-H and P-H compounds than they do on C-H compounds.

There is also a correlation between the strength of a chemical bond and the bond length, longer bonds being weaker because of weaker orbital overlap.  Pauling introduced an empirical formula relating bond length to bond strength.  For a given pair of atoms (for example, two carbon atoms):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:&lt;big&gt;'''D(n) = D(1) - 0.6 log&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;10&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(n)'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

where D(n) represents the bond length in Å and n is the bond order. D(1) in this case would be the length of a C-C single bond, which we can obtain from the average bond length in alkanes (1.54 Å).  Using this formula we can predict that the bond lengths in ethylene (C=C double bond) and acetylene (C≡C triple bond) should be 1.36 and 1.25 Å, respectively, which are close to the experimental values of 1.33 and 1.20 Å.  In a related form the Pauling formula can be used to calculate bond lengths when the single bond length D(1) is not available:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:&lt;big&gt;'''D(n) = D(m) - 0.6 log&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;10&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(n/m)'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;


Here n and m represent two different bond orders between the same kinds of atoms.  This tells, for example, that the difference in length between a triple and double bond, D(2)-D(3), should be - 0.6 log&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;10&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(2/3) = 0.11 Å.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Some bond lengths and bond energies are anomalous. For example, the F-F bond length in F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 1.43 Å, which is 0.15 Å ''longer'' than twice the covalent radius of the F atom (0.64 Å).  The F-F bond is also quite weak (bond dissociation energy = 38 kcal/mol) relative to the Cl-Cl bond (58 kcal/mol).  By putting the extra bond length into the Pauling formula, we calculate that the bond order in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is only 0.6, i.e., substantially weaker than a F-F single bond.  The physical reason for this is that the F-F bond is &quot;stretched&quot; by repulsion of the lone pairs on the F atoms.  This crowding is caused by the fact that the [He] 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; core orbital, as well as the valence orbitals of the fluorine atoms, are contracted by the high nuclear charge.  The Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atom, with its larger [Ne] (1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) core, in contrast, has a &quot;normal&quot; single bond length (1.98 Å) that is twice the covalent radius of the Cl atom (0.99 Å).  [[File:A water droplet DWR-coated surface2 edit1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|alt=A shiny spherical drop of water on blue cloth|Fabric treated with fluorosurfactant]]
&lt;br /&gt;

The weak bond in F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is responsible for the high electronegativity of fluorine, as well as the legendary reactivity of elemental fluorine gas, which reacts explosively with hydrogen and powdered metals.  Because of the instability of elemental fluorine and the polar nature of its bonds with more electropositive elements, fluorine compounds tend to be very stable.  For example, the noble gases Xe and Kr react with fluorine to make covalent compounds, whereas other halogens do not react.  Fluorocarbon compounds contain strong C-F bonds and have high thermal and chemical stability.  Perfluorocarbons such as [[w:Teflon|Teflon]] (poly(tetrafluoroethylene), -(CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)n-, PTFE) are also highly hydrophobic.  The extraordinary hydrophobicity of perfluorocarbons arises from the fact that -CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- and -CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups are &quot;fatter&quot; than -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- and -CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups; dissolving them in water is therefore more disruptive to the hydrogen bonding network than is dissolving a hydrocarbon. &lt;ref&gt;V.

'''Group essay project:'''&lt;br&gt;
Join a group of classmates from your inorganic chemistry course.  Each group should have 3 or 4 students.  Arrange a time to meet for an hour or so.  Prior to the meeting, read part I (pp. 1367-1391) as well as the summary at the end of Linus Pauling's [http://courses.chem.psu.edu/chem310/ja01355a027.pdf article] (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1931, 53, 1367-1400) on the nature of the chemical bond.  

This paper was published only a few years after Schrödinger developed the quantum mechanical theory of atomic orbitals and is considered one of the most important papers in the history of modern chemistry.  At the meeting, discuss the following questions:  (1) What was understood about chemical bonding in molecules before Pauling published this work? (2) What new concepts did the paper introduce that we still use today? (3) Why were these ideas important? and (4) What, if anything, did Pauling get wrong, and why?

Together with your classmates, write a ~1000-word essay addressing these questions.  Please include the names of all students in your group on the cover page; all of you will receive the same grade on this assignment.  Anonymous excerpts from a few of these essays will be shared with the class.


'''In-class discussion questions from this chapter:'''
* What are inequivalent resonance structures? Illustrate with some new examples not covered above.
* Explain no-bond resonance and hypervalency, using some new examples.
* What are the limitations of valence bond theory for molecules that contain an odd number of electrons? Illustrate with one or two examples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 2:  Molecular Orbital Theory'''&lt;/big&gt;==
[[file:Carbon-monoxide-LUMO-phase-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150 px|The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the carbon monoxide molecule is a π antibonding orbital that derives from the 2p orbitals of carbon (left) and oxygen (right)]]


Valence bond (VB) theory gave us a qualitative picture of chemical bonding, which was useful for predicting the shapes of molecules, bond strengths, etc.
It fails to describe some bonding situations accurately because it ignores the wave nature of the electrons.

Molecular orbital (MO) theory has the potential to be more quantitative. With it we can also get a picture of where the electrons are in the molecule, as shown in the image at the right.  This can help us understand patterns of bonding and reactivity that are otherwise difficult to explain.

Although MO theory in principle gives us a way to calculate the energies and wavefunctions of electrons in molecules very precisely, usually we settle for simplified models here too.  These simple models do not give very accurate orbital and bond energies, but they do explain concepts such as resonance (e.g., in the ferrocene molecule) that are hard to represent otherwise.  We can get more accurate energies from MO theory by computational &quot;number crunching.&quot;

While MO theory is more correct than VB theory and can be very accurate in predicting the properties of molecules, it is also rather complicated even for fairly simple molecules.  For example, you should have no trouble drawing the VB pictures for CO, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and benzene, but we will find that these are increasingly challenging with MO theory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.1 Constructing molecular orbitals from atomic orbitals==

We use atomic orbitals (AO) as a basis for constructing MO's.

LCAO-MO = '''linear combination of atomic orbitals.''' 
In physics, this is called this the [[w:Tight_binding_approximation|tight binding approximation]].

We have actually seen linear combinations of atomic orbitals before when we constructed hybrid orbitals in Chapter 1.  The basic rules we developed for hybridization also apply here:  orbitals are added with scalar coefficients (c) in such a way that the resulting orbitals are '''orthogonal''' and '''normalized'''.  The difference is that in the MO case, the orbitals come from different atoms.


The linear combination of atomic orbitals always gives back the ''same number of molecular orbitals.''  So if we start with two atomic orbitals (e.g., an s and a p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital as shown in Fig. 2.1.1), we end up with two molecular orbitals.  When atomic orbitals add in phase, we get constructive interference and a lower energy orbital.  When they add out of phase, we get a node and the resulting orbital has higher energy.  The lower energy MOs are ''bonding'' and higher energy MOs are ''antibonding.''&lt;br /&gt;

:[[File:s-pz ao-mo.png|thumb|left|500px|Fig. 2.1.1. Sigma bonding and antibonding combinations of an s and p orbital]]
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:FluorescentCells.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fig. 2.1.2. Different components of endothelial cells are stained by blue, green, and red fluorescent dyes.]]
Molecular orbitals are also called '''wavefunctions''' (ψ), because they are solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the molecule. The atomic orbitals (also called basis functions) are labeled as φ's, for example, φ&lt;sub&gt;1s&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;3pz&lt;/sub&gt; or simply as φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  

&lt;br /&gt;
In principle, we need to solve the Schrödinger equation for all the orbitals in a molecule, and then fill them up with pairs of electrons as we do for the orbitals in atoms.  In practice we are really interested only in the MOs that derive from the valence orbitals of the constituent atoms, because these are the orbitals that are involved in bonding.  We are especially interested in the '''frontier orbitals''', i.e., the highest occupied molecular orbital (the '''HOMO''') and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (the '''LUMO''').  Filled orbitals that are much lower in energy (i.e., core orbitals) do not contribute to bonding, and empty orbitals at higher energy likewise do not contribute.  Those orbitals are however important in photochemistry and spectroscopy, which involve electronic transitions from occupied to empty orbitals.  The fluorescent dyes that stain the cells shown in Fig. 2.1.2 absorb light by promoting electrons in the HOMO to empty MOs and give off light when the electrons drop back down to their original energy levels.


As an example of the LCAO-MO approach we can construct two MO's (ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the HCl molecule from two AO's φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 2.1.1).  To make these two linear combinations, we write:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;  
  
and  

&lt;big&gt;'''ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;



'''Nodes:''' 

The wavefunctions φ and ψ are '''probability amplitudes'''. They have lobes with (+) or (-) signs, which we indicate by shading or color.  Wherever the wavefunction changes sign we have a node.  As you can see in Fig. 2.1.1, nodes in MOs result from destructive interference of (+) and (-) wavefunctions.  Generally, the more nodes, the higher the energy of the orbital.

In this example we have drawn a simplified picture of the Cl 3p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital and the resulting MOs, leaving out the radial node.  Recall that 2p orbitals have no radial nodes, 3p orbitals have one, as illustrated in Fig. 2.1.3.  4p orbitals have two radial nodes, and so on.  The MOs we make by combining the AOs have these nodes too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

:[[File:2p and 3p nodes.png|thumb|left|450px|Fig. 2.1.3. Nodal structure of 2p and 3p orbitals]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Normalization:'''  
We square the wave functions to get probabilities, which are always positve or zero.  So if an electron is in orbital φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the probability of finding it at point xyz is the square of φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(x,y,z).  The total probability does not change when we combine AOs to make MOs, so for the simple case of combining φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to make ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;[[File:orbital overlap.png|thumb|300px|Fig. 2.1.4. The wavefunctions of atomic orbitals decrease exponentially with distance.  Orbital overlap is non-zero when two atoms are close together, as illustrated for 1s orbitals in the upper figure.  The lower figure shows orbitals that are too far away to interact.  In this case both S and β are close to zero.]]


'''Overlap integral and scalar coefficients:'''  

The spatial overlap between two atomic orbitals φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is described by the overlap integral S,&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;big&gt;'''S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = '''{{Unicode|∫}}'''φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dτ'''&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

where the integration is over all space (dτ = dxdydz).

From the normalization criterion we get:&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;big&gt;'''ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/({{math|{{radical|2}}}}(1+S))'''&lt;/big&gt;   (bonding orbital)
&lt;br /&gt;

and
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/({{math|{{radical|2}}}}(1-S))'''&lt;/big&gt;   (antibonding orbital)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In the case where S≈0, we can eliminate the 1-S terms and both coefficients become 1/{{math|{{radical|2}}}}

&lt;br /&gt;


'''Energies of bonding and antibonding MOs:'''  

The energies of bonding and antibonding orbitals depend strongly on the distance between atoms.  This is illustrated in Fig. 2.1.5 for the hydrogen molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  At very long distances, there is essentially no difference in energy between the in-phase and out-of-phase combinations of H 1s orbitals.  As they get closer, the in-phase (bonding) combination drops in energy because electrons are shared between the two positively charged nuclei.  The energy reaches a minimum at the equilibrium bond distance (0.74 Å) and then rises again as the nuclei get closer together.  The antibonding combination has a node between the nuclei so its energy rises continuously as the atoms are brought together.
:[[File:H2PEimage.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Fig. 2.1.5. Energy as a function of distance for the bonding and antibonding orbitals of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

At the equilibrium bond distance, the energies of the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals (ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are lower and higher, respectively, than the energies of the atomic basis orbitals φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This is shown in Fig. 2.1.6 for the MO’s of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

:[[File:H2 MO energy diagram.png|thumb|left|400px|Fig. 2.1.6. Molecular orbital energy diagram for the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The energy of an electron in one of the atomic orbitals is α, the '''Coulomb integral'''.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''α = '''{{Unicode|∫}}'''φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''H'''φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;dτ = '''{{Unicode|∫}}'''φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''H'''φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dτ'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 

where '''H''' is the '''Hamiltonian operator'''.  Essentially, α represents the ''ionization energy'' of an electron in atomic orbital φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The energy difference between an electron in the AO’s and the MO’s is determined by the '''exchange integral β''',
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;β = '''{{Unicode|∫}}'''φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''H'''φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dτ&lt;/big&gt;'''
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

β is an important quantity, because it tells us about the bonding energy of the molecule, and also the difference in energy between bonding and antibonding orbitals.  Calculating β is not straightforward for multi-electron molecules because we cannot solve the Schrödinger equation analytically for the wavefunctions.  We can however make some approximations to calculate the energies and wavefunctions numerically.  In the [[w: Hückel_method|Hückel approximation]], which can be used to obtain approximate solutions for π molecular orbitals in organic molecules, we simplify the math by taking S=0 and setting H=0 for any p-orbitals that are not adjacent to each other.  The [[w: Extended_Hückel_method|extended Hückel method]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hoffmann, R. | title = An Extended Hückel Theory. I. Hydrocarbons. | journal = [[w:J. Chem. Phys.|J. Chem. Phys.]] | year = 1963 | volume = 39 | pages = 1397–1412 | doi = 10.1063/1.1734456 | issue = 6|bibcode = 1963JChPh..39.1397H }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[w: Roald_Hoffmann|Roald Hoffmann]], and other [[w: Semi-empirical_quantum_chemistry_method|semi-empirical methods]] can be used to rapidly obtain relative orbital energies, approximate wavefunctions, and degeneracies of molecular orbitals for a wide variety of molecules and extended solids.  More sophisticated [[w: Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods|ab initio methods]] are now readily available in software packages and can be used to compute accurate orbital energies for molecules and solids.  

Note that the bonding orbital in the MO diagram of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is stabilized by an energy β/1+S and the antibonding orbital is destabilized by β/1-S.  That is, the antibonding orbital goes up in energy more than the bonding orbital goes down.  This means that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) is energetically more stable than two H atoms, but He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with four electrons (ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is ''unstable'' relative to two He atoms.

'''Bond order:'''  In any MO diagram, the bond order can be calculated as ½ ( # of bonding electrons - # of antibonding electrons).  For H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the bond order is 1, and for He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the bond order is zero.


'''Heteronuclear case (e.g., HCl)''' - '''Polar bonds'''

Here we introduce an electronegativity difference between the two atoms making the chemical bond.  The energy of an electron in the H 1s orbital is higher (it is easier to ionize) than the electron in the chlorine 3p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital.  This results in a larger energy difference between the resulting molecular orbitals ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown in Fig. 2.1.7.  The bigger the electronegativity difference between atomic orbitals (the larger Δα is) the more “φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  character” the bonding orbital has, i.e., the more it resembles the Cl 3p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital in this case.  This is consistent with the idea that H-Cl has a polar single bond:  the two electrons reside in a bonding molecular orbital that is primarily localized on the Cl atom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:[[File:HCl MO energy diagram.png|thumb|left|450px|Fig. 2.1.7. Molecular orbital energy diagram for the HCl molecule]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


The antibonding orbital (empty) has more H-character.  The bond order is again 1 because there are two electrons in the bonding orbital and none in the antibonding orbital.  


'''Extreme case - Ionic bonding (NaF):'''  very large Δα 


In this case, there is not much mixing between the AO’s because their energies are far apart (Fig. 2.1.8).  The two bonding electrons are localized on the F atom , so we can write the molecule as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  Note that if we were to excite an electron from ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using light, the resulting electronic configuration would be (ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and we would have Na&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is called a charge transfer transition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''''Summary of molecular orbital theory so far:'''''

•	'''Add and subtract''' AO wavefunctions to make MOs.  Two AOs → two MOs.  More generally, the ''total number of MOs equals the number of AO basis orbitals''.

•	We showed the simplest case (only two basis orbitals).  More accurate calculations use a much larger basis set (more AOs) and solve for the matrix of c’s that gives the lowest total energy, using mathematically friendly models of the potential energy function that is part of the Hamiltonian operator H.  

•	'''More nodes''' →  '''higher energy''' MO

•	'''Bond order''' = ½ ( # of bonding electrons - # of antibonding electrons)

•	'''Bond polarity''' emerges in the MO picture as orbital “character.”

•	AOs that are '''far apart in energy''' do not interact much when they combine to make MOs.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.2 Orbital symmetry==
[[File:makingpottery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fig. 2.2.1. Example of σ symmetry.]]
The MO picture for a molecule gets complicated when many valence AOs are involved.  We can simplify the problem enormously by noting (without proof here) that orbitals of different symmetry with respect to the molecule do not interact.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

AO’s must have the same '''nodal symmetry''' (as defined by the molecular symmetry operations), or their overlap is zero.

For example, in the HCl molecule, the molecular symmetry axis is z →, as shown in Fig. 2.2.2.&lt;br /&gt;


:[[File:noninteracting sigma pi orbitals.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Fig. 2.2.2. Orbitals of σ and π symmetry do not interact.]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;



Because these two orbitals have different symmetries, the Cl 3p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is '''nonbonding''' and doesn’t interact with the H 1s.  The same is true of the Cl 3p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; orbital.  The p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals have π symmetry (nodal plane containing the bonding axis) and are labeled π&lt;sub&gt;nb&lt;/sub&gt; in the MO energy level diagram, Fig. 2.2.3.  In contrast, the H 1s and Cl 3p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals both have σ symmetry, which is also the symmetry of the clay pot shown in Fig. 2.2.1.  Because these orbitals have the same symmetry (in the [[w:Point_group|point group]] of the molecule), they can make the bonding and antibonding combinations shown in Fig. 2.1.1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The MO diagram of HCl that includes all the valence orbitals of the Cl atom is shown in Fig. 2.2.3.  Two of the Cl valence orbitals (3p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and 3p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) have the wrong symmetry to interact with the H 1s orbital.  The Cl 3s orbital has the same (σ) symmetry as H 1s, but it is much lower in energy so there is little orbital interaction. The energy of the Cl 3s orbital is thus affected only slightly by forming the molecule.  The pairs of electrons in the π&lt;sub&gt;nb&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;nb&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals are therefore '''non-bonding'''.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

Note that the MO result in Fig. 2.2.3 (1 bond and three pairs of nonbonding electrons) is the same as we would get from valence bond theory for HCl.  The nonbonding orbitals are localized on the Cl atom, just as we would surmise from the valence bond picture.

In order to differentiate it from the σ bonding orbital, the σ antibonding orbital, which is empty in this case, is designated with an asterisk.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.3 σ, π, and δ orbitals==
[[Image:Octachlorodirhenate(III)-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|Fig. 2.3.1. The octachlorodirhenate(III) anion, [Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, which has a quadruple Re-Re bond.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A.; Harris, C. B. Inorg. Chem., 1965, 4 (3), 330-333. DOI|10.1021/ic50025a015&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Inorganic compounds use s, p, and d orbitals (and more rarely f orbitals) to make bonding and antibonding combinations.  These combinations result in '''σ, π,''' and '''δ''' bonds (and antibonds).  

You are already familiar with σ and π bonding in organic compounds.  In inorganic chemistry, π bonds can be made from p-  and/or d-orbitals.  δ bonds are more rare and occur by face-to-face overlap of d-orbitals, as in the ion Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;.  The fact that the Cl atoms are eclipsed in this anion is evidence of δ bonding.  

Some possible σ (top row),  π (bottom row), and δ bonding combinations (right) of s, p, and d orbitals are sketched below.  In each case, we can make bonding or antibonding combinations, depending on the signs of the AO wavefunctions. Because pπ-pπ bonding involves sideways overlap of p-orbitals, it is most commonly observed with second-row elements (C, N, O). π-bonded compounds of heavier elements are rare because the larger cores of the atoms prevent good π-overlap.  For this reason, compounds containing C=C double bonds are very common, but those with Si=Si bonds are rare.    [[w:delta_bond|δ bonds]] are generally quite weak compared to σ and π bonds.  Compounds with metal-metal δ bonds occur in the middle of the transition series.  

:[[File:sigma-pi bonding.png|380px|left]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:Delta bonding cartoon.jpg|300px]]
[[File:Connelly-Orpen-R3P-M-sigma-bonding.png|150px|right]][[File:Connelly-Orpen-R3P-M-pi-backbonding.png|150px|right]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Transition metal d-orbitals can also form σ bonds, typically with s-p hybrid orbitals of appropriate symmetry on ligands.  For example, phosphines (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P:) are good σ donors in complexes with transition metals, as shown at the right.  

pπ-dπ bonding is also important in transition metal complexes.  In metal carbonyl complexes such as Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Mo(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, there is sideways overlap between filled metal d-orbitals and the empty π-antibonding orbitals of the CO molecule.  This interaction strengthens the metal-carbon bond but weakens the carbon-oxygen bond.  The C-O infrared stretching frequency is diagnostic of the strength of the bond and can be used to estimate the degree to which electrons are transferred from the metal d-orbital to the CO π-antibonding orbital.  

The same kind of backbonding occurs with phosphine complexes, which have empty π orbitals, as shown at the right.  Transition metal complexes containing halide ligands can also have significant pπ-dπ bonding, in which a filled pπ orbital on the ligand donates electron density to an unfilled metal dπ orbital.  We will encounter these bonding situations in Chapter 5.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.4 Diatomic molecules==
Valence bond theory fails for a number of the second row diatomics, most famously for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where it predicts a diamagnetic, doubly bonded molecule with four lone pairs.  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does have a double bond, but it has two unpaired electrons in the ground state, a property that can be explained by the MO picture.  We can construct the MO energy level diagrams for these molecules as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Ne&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:[[File:diatomic MO1.jpg|left|300px]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:diatomic MO2.jpg|300px]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get the simpler picture on the right when the 2s and 2p AOs are well separated in energy, as they are for O, F, and Ne.  The picture on the left results from mixing of the σ&lt;sub&gt;2s&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;2p&lt;/sub&gt; MO’s, which are close in energy for Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The effect of this mixing is to push the σ&lt;sub&gt;2s&lt;/sub&gt; down in energy and the σ&lt;sub&gt;2p&lt;/sub&gt; up, to the point where the pπ orbitals are below the σ&lt;sub&gt;2p&lt;/sub&gt;.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.5 Orbital filling==
MO’s are filled from the bottom according to the '''[[w:Aufbau_principle|Aufbau principle]]''' and '''[[w:Hund's_rule_of_maximum_multiplicity|Hund’s rule]]''', as we learned for atomic orbitals.
&lt;br /&gt;

''Question:''  what is the quantum mechanical basis of Hund’s rule?&lt;br /&gt;

:Consider the case of two degenerate orbitals, such as the π or π* orbitals in a second-row diatomic molecule.  If these orbitals each contain one electron, their spins can be parallel (as preferred by Hund's rule) or antiparallel. The Pauli exclusion principle says that no two electrons in an orbital can have the same set of quantum numbers (n, l, m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;).  That means that, in the parallel case, the Pauli principle prevents the electrons from ever visiting each other's orbitals.  In the antiparallel case, they are free to come and go because they have different m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; quantum numbers.  However, having two electrons in the same orbital is energetically unfavorable because like charges repel.  Thus, the parallel arrangement, thanks to the Pauli principle, has lower energy.  &lt;br /&gt;


For O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (12 valence electrons), we get the MO energy diagram below.  The shapes of the molecular orbitals are shown at the right.&lt;br /&gt;

:[[File:Oxygen molecule orbitals diagram.JPG|left|400px|Oxygen molecular orbital diagram]][[file:2nd_row_diatomic_MOs.jpg|140px|O2 molecular orbitals]]
&lt;br /&gt;

This energy ordering of MOs correctly predicts '''two unpaired electrons''' in the π* orbital and a net '''bond order of two''' (8 bonding electrons and 4 antibonding electrons).&lt;br /&gt;

Other interesting predictions of the MO theory for second-row diatomics are that the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has a bond order of 2 and that the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has two unpaired electrons (both verified experimentally).

We can also predict (using the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Ne&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diagram above) that NO has a bond order of 2.5, and CO has a bond order of 3.&lt;br /&gt;
 

The symbols &quot;g&quot; and &quot;u&quot; in the orbital labels, which we only include in the case of centrosymmetric molecules, refer to their symmetry with respect to inversion.  ''Gerade'' (g) orbitals are symmetric, meaning that inversion through the center leaves the orbital unchanged.  ''Ungerade'' (u) means that the sign of the orbital is reversed by the inversion operation. Because g and u orbitals have different symmetries, they have zero overlap with each other.  As we will see below, factoring orbitals according to g and u symmetry simplifies the task of constructing molecular orbitals in more complicated molecules.
 

The orbital shapes shown above were computed using a one-electron model of the molecule, as we did for hydrogen-like AOs to get the shapes of s, p, and d-orbitals.  To get accurate MO energies and diagrams for multi-electron molecules, we must include the fact that electrons are “correlated,” i.e. that they avoid each other in molecules because of their negative charge.  This problem cannot be solved analytically, and is solved approximately in numerical calculations by using [[w:density_functional_theory|density functional theory]] (DFT).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.6 Periodic trends in π bonding==
As we noted in Section 2.3, ''pπ-bonding almost always involves a second-row element.''

We encounter π-bonding from the sideways overlap of p-orbitals in the MO diagrams of second-row diatomics (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;…O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  It is important to remember that π-bonds  are weaker than σ bonds made from the same AOs, and are especially weak if they involve elements beyond the second row.

''Example:''
[[file:ethylene-silylene.jpg|left|100px|comparison of ethylene and silylene structures]]


''Ethylene:''  Stable molecule, doesn't polymerize without a catalyst.




''Silylene:''  Never isolated, spontaneously polymerizes. Calculations indicate 117 kJ/mol stability in the gas phase relative to singly-bonded (triplet) H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si-SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The large Ne core of Si atoms inhibits sideways overlap of 3p orbitals → weak π-bond.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[[file:p4 and n2.jpg|left|180px|comparison of elemental phosphorus and nitrogen structures]]
&lt;br /&gt;
P cannot make π-bonds with itself, so it forms a tetrahedral molecule with substantial ring strain.  This allotrope of P undergoes spontaneous combustion in air.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
N can make π-bonds, so N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a very strong triple bond and is a relatively inert diatomic gas.

		   S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (solid, ring structure)  vs. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  (gas, double bond)

&lt;br /&gt;
''Exceptions:''
&lt;br /&gt;
2nd row elements can form reasonably strong π-bonds with the ''smallest'' of the 3rd row elements, P, S, and Cl.  Thus we find S=N bonds in sulfur-nitrogen compounds such as S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, P=O bonds in phosphoric acid and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, and a delocalized π-molecular orbital in SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (as in ozone).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.7 Three-center bonding==
Many (but not all) of the problems we will solve with MO theory derive from the MO diagram of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule (Fig. 2.1.5), which is a case of two-center bonding.  The rest we will solve by analogy to the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, which introduces the concept of three-center bonding.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We can draw the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion (and also H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) in either a '''linear''' or '''triangular''' geometry.

''A few important points about this diagram:''

*For the linear form of the ion, the highest and lowest MO’s are symmetric with respect to the inversion center in the molecule.  Note that the central 1s orbital has '''g symmetry''', so by symmetry it has '''zero overlap''' with the '''u combination''' of the two 1s orbitals on the ends.  This makes the σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; orbital a '''nonbonding''' orbital.

*In the triangular form of the molecule, the orbitals that derive from σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and σ*&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; become degenerate (i.e., they have identically the same energy by symmetry).  The term symbol “e” means '''doubly degenerate'''.  We will see later that “t” means triply degenerate.  Note that we drop the “g” and “u” for the triangular orbitals because a triangle does not have an inversion center.

*The '''triangular form is most stable''' because the two electrons in H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; have lower energy in the lowest orbital.  Bending the molecule creates a third bonding interaction between the 1s orbitals on the ends.
&lt;br /&gt;

'''''MO diagram for XH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X = Be, B, C…):'''''

This is more complicated than H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; because the X atom has both s and p orbitals.  However, we can symmetry factor the orbitals and solve the problem by analogy to the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule:

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''Some key points about this MO diagram:''
&lt;br /&gt;
*In the linear form of the molecule, which has inversion symmetry, the 2s and 2p orbitals of the X atom factor into three symmetry classes: 

:&lt;big&gt;2s = σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; = σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, 2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  

*Similarly, we can see that the two H 1s orbitals make two linear combinations, one with σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry and one with σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry.  They look like the bonding and antibonding MO’s of the '''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule''' (which is why we say we use that problem to solve this one).

*The π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals must be '''non-bonding''' because there is no combination of the H 1s orbitals that has π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry.

*In the MO diagram, we make bonding and antibonding combinations of the σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;’s and the σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;’s.  For BeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we then populate the lowest two orbitals with the four valence electrons and discover (not surprisingly) that the molecule has '''two bonds''' and can be written '''H-Be-H'''.  The correlation diagram shows that a bent form of the molecule should be '''less stable'''.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An interesting story about this MO diagram is that it is difficult to predict a priori whether CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; should be linear or bent.  In 1970, Charles Bender and Henry Schaefer, using quantum chemical calculations, predicted that the ground state should be a bent triplet with an H-C-H angle of 135°.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Bender and H. F. Schaefer III, New theoretical evidence for the nonlinearity of the triplet ground state of methylene, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 92, 4984–4985 (1970). &lt;/ref&gt;  The best experiments at the time suggested that methylene was a linear singlet, and the theorists argued that the experimental result was wrong.  ''Later experiments proved them right!''

We can now attempt the  MO diagram for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, building on the result we obtained with triangular H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

''Notes on the MO diagram for ammonia:''

*Viewed end-on, a p-orbital or an sp&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid orbital looks just like an s-orbital.  Hence we can use the solutions we developed with s-orbitals (for H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to set up the σ bonding and antibonding combinations of nitrogen sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals with the H 1s orbitals.

*We now construct the sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals of the nitrogen atom and orient them so that one is “up” and the other three form the triangular base of the tetrahedron.  The latter three, by analogy to the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, transform as one totally symmetric orbital (“a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;”) and an e-symmetry pair.  The hybrid orbital at the top of the tetrahedron also has a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry.

*The three hydrogen 1s orbitals also make one a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and one (doubly degenerate) e combination.  We make bonding and antibonding combinations with the nitrogen orbitals of the same symmetry.  The remaining a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; orbital on N is non-bonding.  The dotted lines show the correlation between the basis orbitals of a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and e symmetry and the molecular orbitals

*The result in the 8-electron NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is '''three N-H bonds''' and '''one lone pair''' localized on N, the '''same as the valence bond picture''' (but much more work!).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion:'''

By analogy to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; we can construct the MO picture for one vertex of the P4 tetrahedron, and then multiply the result by 4 to  get the bonding picture for the molecule.  An important difference is that there is relatively little s-p hybridization in P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, so the lone pair orbitals have more s-character and are lower in energy than the bonding orbitals, which are primarily pσ.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.9 Homology of σ and π orbitals in MO diagrams==
The '''ozone molecule''' (and related 18e molecules that contain three non-H atoms, such as NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and the allyl anion [CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) is an example of '''3-center 4-electron''' π-bonding.  Our MO treatment of ozone is entirely analogous to the 4-electron H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; anion.  We map that solution onto this one as follows:
:[[file:ozone-pi-MOs.jpg|left|500px|constructing the ozone π-system by analogy to H3-]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The nonbonding π-orbital has a node at the central O atom.  This means that the non-bonding electron pair in the π-system is shared by the two terminal O atoms, i.e., that the formal charge is shared by those atoms.  This is consistent with the octet resonance structure of ozone.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An analogous (and seemingly more complicated) case of 3-center 4-electron bonding is '''I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''.
Each I atom has 4 valence orbitals (5s, 5p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, 5p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, 5p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;), making a total of 12 frontier orbitals, and the I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; anion has 22 electrons.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We can simplify the problem by recalling two periodic trends:
*The s-p orbital splitting is large, relative to the bond energy, after the second row of the periodic table.  Thus, the 5s orbital is low in energy and too contracted to make bonds with its neighbors.
*π-overlap of 5p orbitals is very weak, so the 5p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and 5p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals will also be non-bonding.&lt;br /&gt;
This leaves only the three 5p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals to make bonding/nonbonding/antibonding combinations.  Again, the problem is entirely analogous to ozone or H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

:[[file:triiodide frontier orbitals.jpg|left|450px|constructing the I3- MO diagram from frontier 5pz orbitals]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Counting orbitals we obtain 9 lone pairs from the nonbonding 5s, 5p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and 5p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, as well as one bond and one lone pair from the 5p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital combinations above.  The total of 10 nonbonding pairs and one bond accounts for the 22 electrons in the ion.  The non-bonding 5p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; pair is localized on the terminal I atoms, giving each a -1/2 formal charge.  This MO description is entirely consistent with the octet no-bond resonance picture of I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; that we developed in Chapter 1.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Viewed from the top or bottom, the ethylene π-orbitals look like the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; σ orbitals.  Thus we can map solutions from chains and rings of H atoms onto chains and rings of π-orbitals (as we did for the three-orbital case of O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;

''A few notes about this MO diagram:''

*In the linear form of the molecule, the combination of AOs makes a ''ladder'' of evenly spaced energy levels that alternate g – u – g – u ….   Each successive orbital has one more node.  This is a general rule for linear chains of σ or π orbitals with even numbers of atoms.

*In the cyclic form of the molecule, there is one non-degenerate orbital at the bottom, one at the top, and a ladder of doubly degenerate orbitals in between.  This is also a general rule for cyclic molecules with even numbers of atoms.  This is the origin of the '''4n+2 rule''' for aromatics. 

*H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has four valence electrons, and by analogy butadiene has four π-electrons.  These electrons fill the lowest two MOs in the linear form of the molecule, corresponding to two conjugated π-bonds in butadiene (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH-CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

*In the cyclic form of the molecule, the degenerate orbitals are singly occupied.  The molecule can break the degeneracy (and lower its energy) by distorting to a puckered rectangle.  This is a general rule for '''anti-aromatic''' cyclic molecules (4n rule).  Thus ''cyclobutadiene should be anti-aromatic'' and have two single and two double bonds that are not delocalized by resonance.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Cyclobutadiene is actually a very unstable molecule because it polymerizes to relieve ring strain.  Sterically hindered derivatives of the molecule do have the puckered rectangular structure predicted by MO theory.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Benzene π-orbitals:'''

How do we get from a 4-atom to 6-atom chain? &lt;br /&gt;

By analogy to the process we used to go from a 2-atom chain to a 4-atom chain, we now go from 4 to 6.  We start with the orbitals of the 4-atom chain, which form a ladder of g and u orbitals.  Then we make g and u combinations of the two atoms that we are adding at the ends.  By combining g's with g's and u's with u's, we end up with the solutions for a string of 6 atoms.  Closing these orbitals into a loop gives us the π molecular orbitals of the benzene molecule.  The result is three π bonds, as we expected.  Benzene fits the 4n+2 rule (n=2) and is therefore aromatic.
:[[File:benzene pi orbitals.jpg|left|500px|constructing the pi MOs of benzene]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It should now be evident that we can keep adding atomic orbitals to make chains and rings of 8, 10, 12... atoms.  In each case, the g and u orbitals form a ladder of MOs.  At the bottom rung of the ladder of an N-atom chain, there are no nodes in the MO, and we add one node for every rung until we get to the top, where there are N-1 nodes.  Another way of saying this is that the ''wavelength'' of an electron in orbital x, counting from the bottom (1,2,3...x,...N), is 2Na/x, where a is the distance between atoms.  We will find in Chapters 6 and 10 that we can learn a great deal about the electronic properties of metals and semiconductors from this model, using the infinite chain of atoms as a model for the crystal.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.11 Discussion questions==
[[File:Ferrocene-2D.png|thumb|50px|Ferrocene]]
* Derive the molecular orbital diagrams for linear and bent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
* Explain why the bond angles in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S are different.
* We have derived the MO diagrams for the pi-systems of four- and six-carbon chains and rings. Repeat this exercise for a 5-carbon chain and 5-carbon ring (e.g., the cyclopentadienide anion), starting from the MO pictures for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This tricky problem helps us understand the electronic structure of [[w:ferrocene|ferrocene]], and was the subject of a Nobel prize in 1973.


==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.12 Problems==
1.  The ionization energy of a hydrogen atom is 1312 kJ/mol and the bond dissociation energy of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; molecular ion is 256 kJ/mol.  The overlap integral S for the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; molecular ion is given by the expression S = (1 + R/a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/3a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)exp(-R/a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), where R is the bond distance (1.06 Å) and a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the Bohr radius, 0.529 Å. What are the values of α and β (in units of kJ/mol) for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;? 

2.  Compare the bond order in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using the molecular orbital energy diagram for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The bond dissociation energy of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is 436 kJ/mol.  Explain why this energy is less than twice that of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

3.  What is the bond order in HHe? Why has this compound never been isolated?

4.  Would you expect the Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule to be stable in the gas phase? What is the total bond order, and how many net σ and π bonds are there?

5.	Give a plausible explanation for the following periodic trend in F-M-F bond angles for gas-phase alkali difluoride (MF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) molecules. (Hint - it has something to do with a trend in s- and p-orbital energies)

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Compound !! F-M-F angle (degrees)
|-
| BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 180
|-
| MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 158
|-
| CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 140
|-
| SrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 108
|-
| BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 100
|}

6.	Using molecular orbital theory, show why the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has a triangular rather than linear shape.

7.	Use MO theory to determine the bond order and number of unpaired electrons in (a) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, (b) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, (c) gas phase BN, and (d) NO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  Estimate the bond lengths in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; using the Pauling formula, and the bond length in the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule (1.21 Å).

8.  Compare the results of MO theory and valence bond theory for describing the bonding in (a) CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and (b) neutral CN.  Is it possible to have a bond order greater than 3 in a second-row diatomic molecule?

9.	The P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is tetrahedral, with single bonds between each pair of phosphorus atoms.  What shape would you expect for the P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion?

10.	Draw the MO diagram for the linear [FHF]&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion.  The only orbitals you need to worry about are the frontier orbitals, i.e., the H 1s and the two F sp&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid orbitals that lie along the bonding (z) axis.  What is the order of the HF bonds? What are the formal charges on the atoms?

11.  The cyclooctatetraene (cot) molecule (picture a stop sign with four double bonds) has a puckered ring structure.  However in U(cot)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the oxidation state of uranium is 4+ and the cot ligand has a formal charge of 2-, the 8-membered rings are planar.  Why is cot&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; planar?

==Scientific and academic research==
Antwerp State University Centre conducted a survey of 3545 scientists which confirmed that the scientists first consult references at the end of articles in journals and books when staying informed about their field. Ranked second, Current Contents and the library operated SDI service were reviewed for paper titles. Abstracting and indexing journals, followed by personal recommendations, computerized information services, library browsing, theses and catalogues ranked next. The Antwerp survey was compared to Hakulinen's findings which also conclude that for scientific research abstracting and indexing journals are less important. The so-called information explosion poses the challenge of keeping aware of new publications and what has been published on a given
subject. With the increase in information, scientists do not read more, but are finding relevancy to their subject area in a set number of core journals.

The use of computer data bases to scan titles and subjects in a scientist’s field is more pertinent today than when the article was published. A search across multiple listings of journals through computer data bases saves time previously spent reading the table of contents of journals and having to physically retrieve those journals. Academic libraries are maintaining fewer periodicals in print each year. The findings of the article remain important in its contribution to bibliometrics specifically regarding where scientists can find current information in their field.&lt;ref&gt;Van Styvendaele, B.J.H, 1977. University Scientists as Seekers of Information Sources of References to Periodical Literature. Journal of Librarianship 9:270-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Sample User Interface */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like the user to be able to attach multiple files to a form.

== Method ==
We will use the &lt;xf:repeat&gt; around the upload control:

== Sample Source ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;
    xmlns:xhtml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:fr=&quot;http://orbeon.org/oxf/xml/form-runner&quot;
    xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns:xxforms=&quot;http://orbeon.org/oxf/xml/xforms&quot;
    xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;XForms Upload Multiple Simple&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;xf:model&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;save-data&quot;&gt;
                &lt;formdata&gt;
                    &lt;Files1&gt;
                        &lt;MyFile filename=&quot;&quot; mediatype=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/MyFile&gt;
                    &lt;/Files1&gt;
                &lt;/formdata&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;file-upload-template&quot; xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
                &lt;MyFile filename=&quot;&quot; mediatype=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/MyFile&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
        &lt;/xf:model&gt;

    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Demonstration of how to use the repeat element to get multiple uploads.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;fieldset&gt;
            &lt;legend&gt;Add multiple attachments&lt;/legend&gt;
            &lt;xf:repeat ref=&quot;instance('save-data')/Files1/MyFile&quot; id=&quot;repeat-1&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xf:upload ref=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;xf:filename ref=&quot;@filename&quot;&gt;&lt;/xf:filename&gt;
                    &lt;xf:mediatype ref=&quot;@mediatype&quot;&gt;&lt;/xf:mediatype&gt;
                    &lt;xxforms:size ref=&quot;@size&quot;&gt;&lt;/xxforms:size&gt;
                    &lt;!-- Note the event after upload could add a new row --&gt;
                &lt;/xf:upload&gt;
                &lt;xf:trigger ref=&quot;instance('save-data')/Files1/MyFile[2]&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;xf:label&gt;Delete&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                    &lt;xf:delete ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;
                        ref=&quot;instance('save-data')/Files1/MyFile[index('repeat-1')]&quot;&gt;&lt;/xf:delete&gt;
                &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
            &lt;xf:trigger&gt;
                &lt;xf:label&gt;Add Attachment&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                &lt;xf:insert ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot; ref=&quot;instance('save-data')/Files1/MyFile&quot;
                    origin=&quot;instance('file-upload-template')&quot;&gt; &lt;/xf:insert&gt;
            &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
        &lt;/fieldset&gt;

        &lt;fr:xforms-inspector&gt;&lt;/fr:xforms-inspector&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample User Interface ==

[[Image:Upload-multiple-file.png|frame|center|upload multiple attachments]]

== User interface notes ==
# The delete trigger will only be visible after the second upload is shown.
# This interface shows the file name and size in bytes.  The mime-type could also be shown
# You can add any number of files
# You can delete any row by selecting the &quot;Delete&quot; button
# You can re-add a file using the red X

The files will be uploaded to the server in an async process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background To PTSD==
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a type of mental anxiety disorder that affects people that have witnessed or experienced traumatic situations&lt;ref&gt;Seides, R. (2010). Should the current DSM-IV-TR definition for PTSD be expanded to include serial and multiple microtraumas as aetiologies?. Journal Of Psychiatric &amp; Mental Health Nursing, 17(8), 725-731. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2850.2010.01591.x&lt;/ref&gt;. The Australian Bureau of statistics show that PTSD prevalence in Australia is quite high, with 6.4% of the population aged between 16-85 having experienced PTSD symptoms in the 12 months prior to the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing being carried out in 2007&lt;ref&gt;	Australian Bureau Of Statistics (2007). National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. Canberra, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;


General symptoms include, but are not limited to, occurrences of&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical  manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;:
* 	Recollections or dreams of the event that are intrusive, with the possibility of reliving the event
* 	Psychological distress from recollections or mental cues relating to the event
* 	Persistent avoidance of stimuli related to the event, e.g. conversations, settings
* 	Feeling of detachment from others
* 	Decreased interest in significant activities
* 	Anger outbursts
* 	Difficulty sleeping
* 	Lack of concentration
* 	Startled easily
Presently, numerous treatments are available for sufferers. The methods most popularly used include&lt;ref&gt;4.	Imel, Z. E., Laska, K., Jakupcak, M., &amp; Simpson, T. L. (2013).

==How PTSD Can Effect Exercise==

The effect of PTSD not only has a mental effect, but a physical effect. Those diagnosed with PTSD were seen to rate themselves as less active than others, in comparison to those without a diagnosed PTSD&lt;ref name=Zen&gt;Zen, A. L., Whooley, M. A., Zhao, S., &amp; Cohen, B. E. (2012). Post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with poor health behaviors: Findings from the Heart and Soul Study. Health Psychology, 31(2), 194-201. doi:10.1037/a0025989&lt;/ref&gt;. It was also reported that after being diagnosed with PTSD there was a significant decrease in activity from previous activity habits &lt;ref name=Zen /&gt;&lt;ref name=De&gt;de Assis, M. A., de Mello, M. F., Scorza, F. A., Cadrobbi, M. P., Schooedl, A. F., da Silva, S. G., . . . Arida, R. M. (2008). Evaluation of physical activity habits in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Clinics (SaoPaulo), 63,473–478&lt;/ref&gt;. This is an issue because a lack of physical activity leads correlates with poorer health, such as an increased risk of cardiovascular disease&lt;ref name=Dedert&gt;	Dedert, E. A., Calhoun, P. S., Watkins, L. L., Sherwood, A., &amp; Beckham, J. C. (2010). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Cardiovascular, and Metabolic Disease: A Review of the Evidence. Annals Of Behavioral Medicine, 39(1), 61-78. doi:10.1007/s12160-010-9165-9&lt;/ref&gt;, in conjunction with an increase of high risk behaviours such as smoking&lt;ref name=Zen /&gt; that lead to poorer health. De Assis et al. (2008) suggests that this lack of exercise is caused by a trending issue to lack of motivation&lt;ref name=De /&gt;. As the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (IV) suggests, a lack of interest in activities is a symptom of PTSD&lt;ref name=DSM /&gt; and accordingly one can suggest that this reduces the sufferers motivation to exercise.&lt;br /&gt;

Commonly, exercise is used as a compliment or an alternative to traditional treatment of PTSD&lt;ref name=Libby&gt;Libby, D. J., Pilver, C. E., &amp; Desai, R. (2013). Complementary and alternative medicine use among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, And Policy, 5(3), 277-285. doi:10.1037/a0027082&lt;/ref&gt;. Two advantages can be taken from exercise as treatment&lt;ref name=Ottati /&gt;:


:'''''Physiological'''''&lt;br /&gt;

Aerobic exercise has been known to relax the sympathetic nervous system through the release of beta-endorphins&lt;ref&gt;Brosse, A. L., Sheets, E. S., Lett, H. S., &amp; Blumenthal, J. A. (2002). Exercise and the treatment of clinical depression in adults: recent findings and future directions. / Exercice et therapie de la depression chez les adultes: resultats actuels et orientations pour l ' avenir. Sports Medicine, 32(12), 741-760.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as regular exercise being a catalyst for an increase in serotonin in the brain. PTSD has found to be correlated with low levels of serotonin&lt;ref&gt;Callaghan, P. (2004). Exercise: a neglected intervention in mental health care?. Journal Of Psychiatric &amp; Mental Health Nursing, 11(4), 476-483. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2850.2004.00751.x&lt;/ref&gt;, and as such exercise can mimic the effect of SSRI pharmacological treatment of PTSD&lt;ref name=Ottati /&gt;. As well as this, it can be effective in the combating of co-morbidities that come hand in hand with PTSD, such as Cardiovascular disease&lt;ref name=Dedert /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

:'''''Psychological'''''

Exercise can act as a distractor from negative thoughts&lt;ref name=Libby /&gt;, as well as being associated with positive moods and outlooks in individuals&lt;ref&gt;Mata, J., Hogan, C. L., Joormann, J., Waugh, C. E., &amp; Gotlib, I. H. (2013). Acute exercise attenuates negative affect following repeated sad mood inductions in persons who have recovered from depression. Journal Of Abnormal Psychology, 122(1), 45-50. doi:10.1037/a0029881&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;


==Recommendations==
* 	Practitioners, family and friends should be aware of the signs and symptoms of PTSD (mentioned above) in patients and loved ones.  
* 	Consult the APA DSM-IV&lt;ref name=DSM /&gt; for specifics of diagnosis, and seek an official diagnosis from a qualified mental health professional.  
* 	Be aware of the numerous treatment options that include psychological interventions, pharmacological interventions and exercise interventions.  
* 	Exercise interventions are most effective in combination with psychological/pharmacological interventions, however caution must be taken when undertaking any type of treatment for PTSD due to its nature. Always pre-screen before exercise. 
* 	PTSD can cause a decrease in activity levels, and hence it is in important to try to continue exercise not only to reduce comorbidity factors&lt;ref name=Dedert /&gt; but also as a possible treatment.  
* 	Further research is required to determine how effective exercise is in reducing PTSD symptoms, as a larger sample size is needed to confirm validity of the findings found so far. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==

Sarcopenia is defined as atrophy or decay in muscle as a consequence of the process of ageing &lt;ref name=&quot;morley&quot;&gt; Morley, J. E., 2001. Anorexia, sarcopenia, and aging. Nutrition, 17(8), pp. 660-663. &lt;/ref&gt;. After reaching a peak in early adulthood, a progressive loss of muscle begins and increases each year to a point where the loss outweighs the gain. As Sarcopenia progresses, daily living activities and mobility are further impaired by the decrease in muscle mass, accounting for the muscle strength loss.
The etiology of sarcopenia is less understood, but several mechanisms have been proposed:
* Decrease in number of motor unit neurons.
* Altered hormone release (Growth factors, Agonists) and/ or a tissue tolerance to hormone.
* Altered Tissue response to nutrients.
* Diminished physical activity.
Health professionals have stated that to manage sarcopenia is to increase physical activity coupled with adequate nutritional intake &lt;ref name=&quot;morley&quot;&gt;Morley, J. E., 2001. Anorexia, sarcopenia, and aging. Nutrition, 17(8), pp. 660-663. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Prevention==

Sarcopenia comes about due to old age and the consequences that come with it. As a human enters their fourth decade, there is lower motor unit recruitment; the rate of the protein synthesis declines and important hormones such as Human Growth Hormone is also in decline &lt;ref&gt; Hasten, D. L., Pak-Loduca, J., Obert, K. A. &amp; Yarasheski, K. E., 2000. Resistance Exercise Acutely In- creases MHC and Mixed Muscle Protien Synthesis Rates in 78-84 and 23-32 yr olds.. American Journal of Physiology, 278(4), pp. 620-626. &lt;/ref&gt;. There are several ways that an adult can slow the process of sarcopenia and eventually reject the negative effects the disease has on them.

'''Exercise'''

Experts and professionals have a wide-ranging view on the best approach to specifically achieve hypertrophy, but evidence supporting the notion that physical activity; most significant being resistance training, as being the most efficient way to maintain muscle mass. Resistance training has shown to increase muscle mass and strength, with the gains made in muscle mass and strength via resistance training far outweighing those of any nutritional supplement alone. &lt;ref&gt; Dreyer, H. C. &amp; Volpi, E., 2005. Role of Protein and Amino Acids in the Pathophysiology and Treatment of Sarcopenia. Journal of American College of Nutrition, 24(2), pp. 140S-145S. &lt;/ref&gt;. On the other hand, aerobic exercise commonly does not result in effecting tissue hypertrophy. Instead endurance athletes enhance storage of fats and carbohydrates within their muscles &lt;ref&gt; Van Loon, L. &amp; Goodpaster, B., 2006. Increased intramuscular lipid storage in the insulin-resistant and endurance-trained state. Pflugers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology, 451(5), pp. 606-616 &lt;/ref&gt; . The benefits that are provided by resistance training against sarcopenia are attributed to the neuromuscular innervation that the resistance program provides, as well as the muscular hypertrophy. These together replace the progressive muscle loss which sequentially maintains muscular strength &lt;ref&gt; Borst, S. E., 2004. Interventions for sarcopenia and muscle weakness in older people. Age Ageing, 33(6), pp. 548-555. &lt;/ref&gt;. This is achieved physiologically, applying an increased load on the muscular system, and have it adapt to the increased stimuli. &lt;ref&gt; Kumar, V., Abbas, A., Fausto, N. &amp; Aster, J., 2010. Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease. 8th ed. s.l.:Saunders. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nutrition'''

One such way to help counteract the negative effects of sarcopenia by ingesting an adequate diet, such as increasing intake of protein. As our bodies grow older, there is a decrease in the rate of protein synthesis. To keep that rate up, it is recommended that an elderly adult intake around 25-30g of protein per meal to ensure that protein synthesis is still working well. &lt;ref&gt; Paddon-Jones, D. et al., 2005. Exogenous amino acids stimulate human muscle anabolism without inter- fering with the response to mixed meal ingestion. American Journal of Physiology - Endocrinology and Me- tabolism., 288(4), pp. 761-767. &lt;/ref&gt;
The most effective method of preventing sarcopenia however is regular resistance training. With a higher protein intake and an effective resistance training program, an elderly individual will be able to counter the negative effects of sarcopenia.

==Prescription==

Due to the age of the sufferer, it is unsafe for them to be prescribed a hypertrophy resistance training schedule. Therefore a schedule that has contains high repetitions and a low weight is essential for decreasing the effects of sarcopenia.

* Exercises should cover all the major muscle groups. Multi-joint exercises are recommended, however should be complimented with single-joint exercises as well. 
* 10-15 repetitions in each set, for a minimum of one set. &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;&gt; Vella, C., &amp; Kravitz, L. (n.d.). Sarcopenia: The Mystery of Muscle Loss. Exercise Science at UNM. http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/sarcopenia.html &lt;/ref&gt;
* Resistance training sessions should be performed twice per week for optimal results, however studies have shown that even one day per week can lead to the elderly maintaining strength. &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;&gt; Vella, C., &amp; Kravitz, L. (n.d.). Sarcopenia: The Mystery of Muscle Loss. Exercise Science at UNM. http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/sarcopenia.html &lt;/ref&gt;

When prescribing a program for the patient, it should be personalised for what their goals are at the outcome of the program. Most important aspect of the program is the form of the participant, correct form must be used the whole way through the exercise otherwise it is rendered ineffective. &lt;ref name=&quot;vella&quot;&gt; Vella, C., &amp; Kravitz, L. (n.d.). Sarcopenia: The Mystery of Muscle Loss. Exercise Science at UNM. http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/sarcopenia.html &lt;/ref&gt;

==Capitulo 1 - O código da natureza? ==

Com esse livro eu quero convencer o leitor que a matemática é a raiz da realidade. Não tenho nenhuma prova final de que issó é um fato, mas quero guiar o leitor mostrando varias dicas de que a realidde é realmente matematica pura.
Minha pretenção é fazer um livro simples e que possa ser lido por adolescentes que estão aprendendo matematica básica. 

Existem tres pergunta na filosfica que são muito antigas e interessantes : 
1 - O que é matematica? 
2 - Nós inventamos a matematica ou descobrimos na natureza?
3 - Porque a matematica é tão boa para explicar a natureza?

As respostas para essas perguntas não são simples, e pelo decorrer do livro vou respondendo elas.

não pode faltar:
math : realidade vs criacao
estetica mathe  ebeleza (e como realidade está nesse meio)
multiverso e nocao de q tudo que é possivel estrá em todos multiversos

Sub - O que é a matemática

para afirmar que a matematica é a realizade são a mesma coisa , primeiro é preciso entender o que é a matematica.

==Fisica e matematica==

=== A matematica Pura ===
Existe uma área da matematica que não tem nenhuma aplicação.

a teoria do multiverso se encaixa perfeitamente pois ele fala que as constantes fisicas mudariam de universo para universo. sendo que as constantes sao numeros, ai fica facil de entender que so mudanças em numeros faria diferença em varios universos

===Deus?===
Se existe um deus, um arquiteto  então o que ele fez foi a matematica . se existe um deus  que criou algo como a matematica, seria muito dificil imaginar como ele é , algo alem da matematica.

*citar frase de tegmark :  se o universo nao for matematico, precisaremos de testes em fisica para entendermos completamente a realidade , porque existismo, porque existe vida, (etc?) mas poderiamos ficar incapacitados por limites tecnologicos, como precisar de um acelerador de particula maior que a terra ou maior que o sistema solar para saber do que o atomo é constituido, ou ter telescopios (ou outros medidores como o wmap) para &quot;enxergar&quot; o universo em seu limite. Mas se  o universo é realmente matematico, nos poderemos desobrir todos os misterios do universo utilizando apenas a imaginação (talvez com inteligencia artificial, ou com uma nova especie evoluida dos humanos?)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==

Insomnia is a common sleeping disorder that displays symptoms of;
# Increased sleep onset latency&lt;sup&gt;[7][9][13]&lt;/sup&gt;. 
# Frequent awakenings during sleep with difficulty getting back to sleep&lt;sup&gt;[7][8][9][13]&lt;/sup&gt;. 
# Non-restorative sleep&lt;sup&gt;[7][8]&lt;/sup&gt;.

Insomnia is often diagnosed as either acute or chronic&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;. Acute insomnia involves difficulties with sleep lasting less than a month while chronic insomnia is associated with problems persisting longer than a month&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;. Insomnia can also be catergorised as primary or secondary&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;. Primary is the term given to subjects who cannot sleep for no apparent reason while secondary members cannot sleep due to an underlying condition&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Issue ==

Insomnia is more common in women and the elderly&lt;sup&gt;[8][12]&lt;/sup&gt;. With chronic insomnia affecting approximately 15% of adults&lt;sup&gt;[8][12]&lt;/sup&gt;, while some studies have reported that insomnia incidence rises to 50% in the elderly population&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;. Given the widespread occurrence of insomnia, it is now the most prevalent sleep disorder&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;. Severe sleep deprivation also induces stress on carers and is a common cause for instigating institutional care&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;. If chronic insomnia is not treated effectively it can lead to a magnitude of other conditions including;

* High blood pressure&lt;sup&gt;[2][9]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Type ‖ Diabetes&lt;sup&gt;[2][6][9]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Heart Disease&lt;sup&gt;[2][6][9]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Depression&lt;sup&gt;[2][6][9][12]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* Cancer&lt;sup&gt;[2][9]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Mortality&lt;sup&gt;[2][6][8][9][12]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Aerobic exercise and insomnia ==

The most common treatment for insomnia is pharmacological which may lead to a drug related tolerance or dependency&lt;sup&gt;[6][8]&lt;/sup&gt;. However, benefits can be achieved through regular moderate aerobic exercise&lt;sup&gt;[1][2][3][4][5][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]&lt;/sup&gt;. A regular aerobic exercise regime displays better sleep quality in the form of greater sleep duration, less sleep onset latency and a more restorative sleep&lt;sup&gt;[1][4][5][8][10][11]&lt;/sup&gt;. Aerobic exercise also promotes relaxation&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; and reduces anxiety and stress levels&lt;sup&gt;[1][8]&lt;/sup&gt;, depressive symptoms and daytime sleepiness&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;. Participants who undertook aerobic exercise as a treatment also reported improvements in mood, vitality, slow wave sleep or greater restorative sleep and quality of life&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Recommendations  ==

The following table is a general aerobic exercise regime that is applicable to the wider population.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Training level !! Intensity !! Duration !! Frequency 
|-
| '''Trained''' || Moderate/Vigorous || 60 mins || 5+ days/week&lt;sup&gt;[3][13]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| '''Untrained''' || Moderate || 30-40 mins|| 3-4 days/ week&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;        
|}

'''Moderate Intensity''': 75% of maximum heart rate&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Vigorous Intensity''': 85% of maximum heart rate&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;


To obtain the maximum benefit from aerobic exercise subjects should also adhere to the subsequent guidelines;

* Exercise 4-8 hours before going to sleep&lt;sup&gt;[8][13]&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Undertake sleep hygiene education which provides instructions or help to maximize beneficial sleeping habits&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;.  
* Maintaining a sleep log&lt;sup&gt;[1][8][10]&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Avoiding drinking alcohol before going to bed&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;.

Finally exercise need not be intense to attain significant results&lt;sup&gt;[8][9][13]&lt;/sup&gt;. While the greatest benefits were seen in participants who exercised for over an hour, moderate exercise reduced total time awake compared to intense exercise&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;. In fact research shows that prolonged intense exercise actually increased insomnia symptoms&lt;sup&gt;[8][9]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= The Health Professional Concept =
The health professional is one of GNU Health's key components : It's used in appointments, patient evaluation, surgeries, lab tests, etc.. This is why it is important to have them defined in your system before hand.

The health professional is a general concept : It covers physicians, nurses, biochemists, psychologists, and any other occupation related to health sciences.

== Creating and Editing Health Professionals ==

To define or edit a new Health Professional, follow this path :

[[File:Health Professional - Creation.png|thumb|Adding a new health professional]]

'''Health -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Health Professionals -&gt; Health Professionals'''

The Main steps involved in defining a Health Professional are :
# Select (or create) the related party
# Associate an internal user (login user) to the party
# Define the health professional list of specialties
# Set the default or main specialty

=== Party associated to a Health Professional ===
The Health professional is a party with specific attributes, but is always a party. This abstract concept of party allow us to be different entities at the same time. For example, a health professional can be a patient. Both of them sharing the property of being a person.
The party concept provides versatility and simplicity to GNU Health.

[[File:Health Professional - Party.png|thumb|Party associated to a Health Professional]]

When you create the associated party from the Health Professional form, the &quot;person&quot; and &quot;Health&quot; professional attributes will be automatically set . At this point, you need to enter the Health Professional demographics, in the same way as you have done when creating an invividual. You might want to refresh the idea by glancing over the [[GNU_Health/Individuals|Individuals]] section.

[[File:GNU Health - Health Professional creation - login user.png|thumb|Associating the login user to a health professonal in GNU Health]]

=== The Internal User field ===

The Individual, when assigned the property of being a Health Professional, it has an extra - and required - field. The ''&quot;Internal User&quot;'' field.
This internal user is the user that the individual types in then logging into GNU Health. That user allows to digitally sign documents, and to audit their actions.
&lt;br /&gt;

Once you are done with the party, save the party record ( Ctrl + S ).

[[File:Health Professional - Choosing the main specialty.png|thumb|Assigning a Main Specialty to the health professional from the list of this professional.]]

=== Health Professional specific fields ===

A health professional might have more than one specialty. In the Health Professional view, you can add all the specialties related to this particular professional. Once you are done, '''save the record ( Ctrl + S )''' . It is important so the system links the party with the health professional record.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Finally, add the information related to the the professional

* Institution 
* Practitioner ID
* Main Specialty
* Extra information
&lt;br /&gt;

Although these fields are not formally required, they are very important and should be entered in the system. Each health professional must have these fields filled in whenever possible. For instance, the &quot;''Main Specialty''&quot; field will be used as a default value whenever the doctor is assigned an appointment, or when creating a new evaluation.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 3:  Acid-Base Chemistry'''&lt;/big&gt;==
[[file:Faujasite structure.svg|right|150px|thumb|Solid acid catalysts, such as zeolite Y, are used to isomerize hydrocarbons in the processing of crude oil into gasoline.]]

Acids and bases are important for a number reasons in inorganic chemistry.
* Many industrially useful catalytic reactions involve inorganic acids and [[w:superacid|superacids]], such as zeolites, anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, and sulfated zirconia.  These acids are sufficiently strong in anhydrous media that they can protonate olefins and alcohols to produce carbocations.  [[w:carbocation|Carbocations]] are key intermediates in the transformations of hydrocarbons.
* Inorganic compounds are sometimes synthesized in strongly acidic or basic media.  For example, ternary metal oxides can be synthesized and crystallized in molten NaOH or KOH, which are strongly basic.  Organic fluorination reactions are often done in strongly acidic media, such as anhydrous HF.  Understanding the familiar chemistry of acids and bases in water helps us understand how these non-aqueous media work.
* The acidic or basic environment of metal ions affects the stability of their oxidation states.  We will learn more about this in Chapter 4.
* Transition metal complexes (coordination compounds and organometallic compounds) are essentially Lewis acid-base complexes.  We can understand a great deal about their stability and reactivity by considering the acid-base character of metals and ligands.  We will learn about this in Chapter 5.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;3.1 Brønsted and Lewis acids and bases==
[[file:Lewis-Bronsted-Arrhenius.png|180px|left|thumb|Illustration of the hierarchy of acid-base theories.  Arrhenius acids and bases are a sub-class of Bronsted acids and bases, which are themselves a subclass of Lewis acids and bases.]]
There are three major classifications of substances known as acids or bases.  The Arrhenius definition states that an acid produces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in solution and a base produces OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  This theory was developed by [[w:Svante_Arrhenius|Svante Arrhenius]] in 1883.  Later, two more sophisticated and general theories were proposed.  These are the Brønsted-Lowry and the Lewis definitions of acids and bases.  The relationship between these theories is illustrated in the figure at the left.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In water, we normally think about the &lt;u&gt;Brønsted&lt;/u&gt; acidity or basicity of acids and bases. Brønsted-Lowry acidity is based on the transfer of a hydrogen ion in solution.  The acid is a proton donor and dissociate in order to increase [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and the base is a proton acceptor and dissociate in order to increase [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;].  The hyrdogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is often referred to as a proton in these cases.  To clarify, this theory does not imply that protons do not exist independently in solution.  In an aqueous solution the proton is generally designated as H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This theory encompasses any type of solution, not just aqueous ones as the Arrhenius theory does.  The strength of an acid or a base varies depending on the solvent.  This strength can be classified by the extent of the dissociation of the acid or base.  '''Strong''' acids and bases dissociate completely in a solvent.  '''Weak''' acids and bases will only partially dissociate in a solvent.  An acid or base may be strong in one solvent but weak another.  This means that the strength of the acid/base is relative.  The strength of weak acids in solution can be measured through equilibrium calculations.  The equilibrium constant (also known as acid dissociation constant), k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, is the number that represents the degree of dissociation.  For the chemical equation:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;HA &lt;----&gt; A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=[A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;][H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA]&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When an acid dissociates, it gives up a proton and a '''Conjugate Base'''.  When a base gains a proton, the product is called a '''Conjugate Acid'''.  Strong acids produce spectator ions as conjugate bases, while weak acids produce a weak conjugate bases.  This is illustrated below for the weak acid acetic acid and its conjugate base, the acetate anion.&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Bronsted acid base interaction.png|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;

The strength of a conjugate acid/base varies inversely with the strength or weakness of it's parent acid or base.  Any acid or base is technically a conjugate acid or conjugate base also; these terms are simply used to identify species in solution (i.e Acetic acid is the conjugate acid of acetate anions,a base, while acetate anions are the conjugate base of acetic acid, an acid).  Some acids, called '''polyprotic acids''' have more than one proton to donate in acid/base reactions.  For example, Sulfuric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is a strong acid that has a conjugate base that actually happens to be a weak acid itself.  This means that every mole of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in aqueous solution donates more than 1 mole of protons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some substances can act both as an acid and as a base.  An example would be water.  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules may either donate a hydrogen or accept it.This is called an '''amphoteric''' substance.  In the situation where you have an acid in solution, water will act as a base.  Water acts as an acid in base. The &lt;u&gt;strongest acid&lt;/u&gt; we can make in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq). In addition, the &lt;u&gt;strongest base&lt;/u&gt; we can make in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (aq).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Non-aqueous acid-bas chemistry follows similar rules. For example in liquid ammonia:&lt;br /&gt;
:2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(l) → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) + NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;
where NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the strongest acid and NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is the strongest base.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;SOLVENT LEVELING&lt;/big&gt;
Solvent leveling is an effect that occurs when a strong acid is placed in an autoprotic solvent, such as, but not limited too, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Any strong acid donates it's proton to the solvent, this leveling effect means that the strongest possible acid in aqueous solution is H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This means that the strength of acids such as HCl and HBr cannot be accurately determined in water as they both are leveled by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Using an autoprotic solvent of a higher dissociation constant, such as anhydrous acetic acid, can allow for the determination of strength of strong acids. with the strongest possible base of this solvent (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) being a weaker base than aqueous solutions (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), the strength of strong acids can be more accurately measured, as strong acids become weak acids (note: the properties of the acid/base itself do not change, but the dissociation equilibrium begins to favor the undissociated molecule as the solvent approaches the acid/base in acidity/basicity). Solvent leveling also applies to bases, though more basic autoprotic solvents than water are used, such as ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''MOLTEN SALT SOLUTIONS'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a solid salt melts, it forms a solution of the cations and anions (KOH melts and dissociates into K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions) which can act as a solvent for chemical reactions. When water is added to a molten KOH flux, the OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; acts as the solvent, leading to the acid base equilibrium
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;----&gt; OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;----&gt; O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;
this allows for the acidity of a flux to be easily altered through the addition or boiling off of water, a &quot;wet&quot; flux is a more acidic flux, while a &quot;dry&quot; flux is more basic. Molten fluxes are often used in the synthesis of crystals, such as perovskite superconductors (K&lt;sub&gt;1-X&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;BiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''LEWIS ACIDS AND BASES'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Lewis classification of acids and bases is a much broader definition, and encompasses many more substances.  Whereas the Brønsted-Lowry and the Arrhenius classifications are based on proton activity, Lewis acidity is based on the transfer of an electron pair.  '''Lewis acids''' can accept an electron pair, while '''Lewis bases''' can donate an electron pair.  This definition clearly allows many more substances to be considered acidic or basic.  It is not necessary for a compound to contain hydrogen atoms in order for it to be a Lewis acid or base.  Such a substance need not even be a compound, rather only an element.  For example, Aluminum chloride, AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be an acid when combined with an ion that donates an electron pair.  The reaction is shown below.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;------&gt;  AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here, the acid is the AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the base is the Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is because the chloride ion is has multiple electron pairs that it can potentially donate to the aluminum chloride.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lewis acidity is the basis for coordination chemistry.  This is because coordination chemistry involves metals that are Lewis acids bonding to ligands that are Lewis bases.  
&lt;br /&gt;
Certain molecules with five membered geometries happen to be excellent Lewis acids, because when accepting another pair of electrons from a base, they form octahedral geometry.  The octahedral geometry is more stable and therefore favored over the five membered arrangements.  This means that the five membered geometries will readily accept an electron pair from a ligand and are therefore acidic.  Some examples of these acids are PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, AsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  One interesting example of manipulating lewis acidity is the chemical synthesis of Fluorine gas.  Aqueous F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; ions react with MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; to form MnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, which is stabilized by 2 K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.  Reaction with the lewis acid, SbF&lt;sub&gt;5(l)&lt;/sub&gt; forms MnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, an unstable compound. This decays to produce MnF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and (1/2)F&lt;sub&gt;2(g)&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''Determining the strength of a metal Lewis Acid'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are three determining factors of the strength of a metal Lewis acid.  They are as follows:
&lt;br/&gt;
1. The higher positive charge on the metal, the more acidic it is.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The smaller the atomic radius of the metal ion, the more acidic it is.&lt;br /&gt;
3. The more electronegative the metal ion is, the more acidic it will be.  The trend is that the closer the metal is to Au on the periodic table, the more electronegative and acidic it is.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;3.2 Hard acids and bases==
&lt;br /&gt;
Lewis acids and bases can be classified by designating them as hard or soft.&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;b&gt;Hard Acids/Bases:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:&quot;Hard&quot; acids and bases have a &lt;u&gt;high&lt;/u&gt; charge (positive for acids, negative for bases) to atomic radius ratio along with higher oxidation states. Hard acids have LUMOs (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) of relatively high energy, while the HOMOs (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) of low energy.  They interact through &lt;u&gt;ionic&lt;/u&gt; bonding, and are not very polarizable. Hard acids generally have high charge densities, which include metal ions with higher positive charges and smaller ionic sizes. Basically, the term &quot;hard&quot; applies to the chemical species that considered to be small in size, but have high charges, and are weakly polarizable. Therefore, the electrons present are held tightly by the nucleus. This is due to the presence of ''d'' orbitals lacking in the ability to form π bonds. Some examples of hard acids and bases include:  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Specifically, F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is a hard base and metal ions including Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are considered hard acids. &lt;br /&gt;
::*F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;b&gt;Soft Acids/Bases:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:&quot;Soft&quot; acids or bases have a &lt;u&gt;low&lt;/u&gt; charge to atomic radius ratio, with low oxidation states.  They are normally larger acids that interact through &lt;u&gt;covalent&lt;/u&gt; bonding and are &lt;u&gt;polarizable&lt;/u&gt;. Soft acids have LUMOs of lower energy than harder acids, and soft bases have HOMOs of higher energy than harder bases. Soft acids tend to have lower charge densities due to lower ionic charges and increase in ionic sizes. This is due to their ''d'' orbitals being able to form π bonds. Essentially, the term soft applies to those chemical species that tend to be bigger in size, low in charge, and are strongly polarizable, where there is greater distribution of electrons. For example, I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is a soft base and low charge density transition metals, such as Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, are considered soft acids. Soft acids often include transition metals in the second and third row of the periodic table that have a +1 or +2 charge, as well as almost filled ''d'' orbitals.&lt;br /&gt;
::*I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Like binds with Like'''&lt;br /&gt;
Hard acids interact faster with hard bases than they do with soft bases, and soft acids interact faster with soft bases than hard bases; the strongest bonds are Hard-Hard and Soft-Soft bonds. Acids and bases are not strictly hard or soft, with many compounds being classified as borderline, with trimethylborane and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &amp; Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations being borderline acids, and pyridine and aniline being examples of borderline bases. &lt;br/&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;3.3 Discussion questions==

*Discuss periodic trends in the Lewis acidity of metal ions.
*Explain what we mean by hard and soft acids and bases, using specific examples. 

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;3.4 Problems==
1.	For each pair of compounds below, indicate which one is a stronger acid and explain your choice:

	(a) [Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;  or [Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

	(b) H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

	(c) [Ga(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;  or [Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;

	(d) HIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or HIO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

	(e) H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;


2.	The Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations have similar ionic radii, but the acidity of aqueous nitrate solutions containing  the two ions are different.  Explain which ion is more acidic and why.


3.	(a) Sulfides of As&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; precipitate when ammonium hydrosulfide is added to aqueous solutions containing these ions.   When excess sulfide is added they redissolve as anionic complexes.  In contrast, solutions of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; precipitate as sulfides but do not redissolve.  We may consider the first group of ions to be amphoteric for soft acid-base reactions involving SH- in place of OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  The second group is less acidic.  Locate the amphoteric boundary in the periodic table for sulfides implied by this information.  Compare this boundary with the amphoteric boundary for oxides reacting with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  Does this analysis agree with describing S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; as a softer base than O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;?
	
	(b)  Au&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is also precipitated by SH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and the sulfide Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S redissolves to form a soluble complex in excess SH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  Does this fit the trend you discovered in part (a)? Does it make sense in terms of the electronegativity of Au? Explain.

[[File:Vanadium oxidation states.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Oxidation states of vanadium in acidic solution. From left to right the oxidation state goes from +5 to +2.]]
In redox reactions, one species is reduced (gains electrons) and another species is oxidized (loses electrons). Identifying the oxidation states of all species is an important first step for determining which species are oxidized, reduced, or unchanged. In terms of everyday life, redox reactions occur all of the time. One example of redox is with glycolysis, a process that occurs in all living things and involves the conversion of food into a usable energy&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  As with a number of other reactions, oxygen does not undergo redox in glycolysis and is more of a bystander. Another example of redox is fire or combustion, such as in a car engine. In a car engine, carbon in the fuel is oxidized to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, while the oxygen present is reduced to form water upon combination with hydrogen atoms in the fuel&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.


'''Oxidation-reduction''' reactions are important to understanding inorganic chemistry for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*Transition metals can have multiple oxidation states&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*Main group elements (N, halogens, O, S...) also have multiple oxidation states and important redox chemistry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*Many inorganic compounds &lt;u&gt;catalyze&lt;/u&gt; redox reactions (which is especially useful in industrial and biological applications)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*Energy conversion (solar, batteries, fuel cells) relies on inorganic redox reactions &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*Not all elements are equally reactive in redox reactions: there are strong and weak oxidizers and reducers
&lt;br /&gt;

As stated, not all oxidizers and reducers were created equal. Strong oxidizing agents are typically compounds with elements in high oxidation states or with high electronegativity (electrons are gained from oxidizing compounds). Examples of oxidizers include hydrogen peroxide, permanganate, and osmium tetroxide&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For reducing agents, electropositive elements such as lithium, sodium, iron, and aluminum are common because of their willingness to donate electrons&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Additionally, sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride are often used to reduce carbonyl compounds&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;4.1 Balancing redox reactions==
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; is oxidized to &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''I'''&lt;/font&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; by &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;'''Mn'''&lt;/font&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(→&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;'''Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;).
How can this reaction be balanced? The following example demonstrates proper balancing technique, and is known as the ion-electron method.

'''&lt;u&gt;Step 1&lt;/u&gt;''': Write out the unbalanced reaction and identify the elements that are undergoing redox. &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;'''Mn'''&lt;/font&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; → &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''I'''&lt;/font&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;'''Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; (The elements undergoing redox are &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;'''Mn'''&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''I'''&lt;/font&gt;. The oxygen is not undergoing redox since there is no change in its oxidation state.) &lt;br /&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Step 2&lt;/u&gt;''': Separate the original reaction into two half reactions&lt;br /&gt;
:*&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;'''Mn'''&lt;/font&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;'''Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;
:*&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; → &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''I'''&lt;/font&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br /&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Step 2A&lt;/u&gt;''': Balance the &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''Oxygen'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:*Mn&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;→ Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''4'''&lt;/font&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''O'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:*&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''3'''&lt;/font&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''O'''&lt;/font&gt; + I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → I&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Step 2B&lt;/u&gt;''': Balance the &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''Hydrogen'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
:*&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''8H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; + MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;→ Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;O&lt;br /&gt;
The left side has a charge of &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''+7'''&lt;/font&gt; while the right side has a charge of &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''+2'''&lt;/font&gt;
:*&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;O + I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''6H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The left side has a charge of &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''-1'''&lt;/font&gt; while the right side has a charge of &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''+5'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Step 2C&lt;/u&gt;''': Balance the charges with &lt;font color=&quot;violet&quot;&gt;'''Electrons'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:*8H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;violet&quot;&gt;'''5e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; + MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;→ Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;br /&gt;
The left side has a charge of &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''+2'''&lt;/font&gt; while the right side has a charge of &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''+2'''&lt;/font&gt;. They are balanced. 
:*3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 6H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;violet&quot;&gt;'''6e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The left side has a charge of &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''-1'''&lt;/font&gt; while the right side has a charge of &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''-1'''&lt;/font&gt;. They are balanced. &lt;br /&gt;
'''''&lt;u&gt;Note:&lt;/u&gt;''''' We did &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; need to explicitly determine the oxidation states of &lt;font color=&quot;Purple&quot;&gt;'''Manganese'''&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''Iodine'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Step 3&lt;/u&gt;''': Combine the half reactions so that there are equal numbers of electrons on the left and right sides&lt;br /&gt;
: '''&lt;u&gt;6&lt;/u&gt;''' (8H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;violet&quot;&gt;'''5e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; + MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;→ Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;br /&gt;
:'''&lt;u&gt;5&lt;/u&gt;''' (3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 6H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;violet&quot;&gt;'''6e&lt;sup&gt;-'''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;

48H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;violet&quot;&gt;'''30e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; + 15H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 6MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 5I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → 5IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 6Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 24H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + &lt;font color=&quot;violet&quot;&gt;'''30e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; + 30H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


Cancel the &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''hydrogens'''&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''electrons'''&lt;/font&gt;, and &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''water'''&lt;/font&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;'''48H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/s&gt; + &lt;s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;'''30e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/s&gt; + &lt;s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;'''15H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;'''O'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/s&gt; + 6MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 5I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → 5IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 6Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;'''24H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;'''O'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/s&gt; + &lt;s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;'''30e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/s&gt; + &lt;s&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;'''30H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


The final equation is therefore: &lt;br /&gt;
18H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 5I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → 5IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 6Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 9H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure the '''elements''' and '''charges''' are balanced for '''&lt;u&gt;BOTH&lt;/u&gt;''' sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Step 4&lt;/u&gt;''': If the reaction occurs in basic conditions, add &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; to each side to cancel &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''18H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''18OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; + 6MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 5I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → 5IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 6Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''9H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'''&lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''18OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''18H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''18OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; will become &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''18H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'''&lt;/font&gt; so the final equation would be: &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''9H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'''&lt;/font&gt; + 6MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 5I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → 5IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 6Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''18OH'''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''''&lt;u&gt;Note:&lt;/u&gt;''''' Again, we did not need to know oxidation states of &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''Sulfur'''&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''Oxygen'''&lt;/font&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;4.2 Electrochemical equilibria==
In electrochemical cells, chemical species migrate to different areas depending on the electrochemical potential. Species move from areas of high potential to areas of low potential&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The equilibrium reduction potential of a half-cell (reduction or oxidation), as well as the total voltage of a full cell, can be determined by the Nernst equation&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The chemical species in a cell have electrochemical potentials given their location, and the potentials are an indication of how easy it would be to add more of the species to that location&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In equilibrium, the potential of a species is constant everywhere. For calculations, standard reduction potentials for most or all species are available in many pieces of chemical literature.

For systems that are in equilibrium,  ΔG°= -nFE°&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt; where &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; indicates that the electric potential is a &lt;u&gt;standard state&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
More generally , &lt;math&gt; Delta G^o = -nFE&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt; E =  E^o-\frac{RT}{nF} * ln Q&lt;/math&gt; then  &lt;math&gt; E =  E^o-\frac{0.0592}{n} * log Q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For example, if we have the equation 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; = H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; then E°&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.000 Volts (by definition)&lt;br /&gt;

'''Question:'''
What is E&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; at pH 5 and P&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 atm?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; pH = - log [H^+]=5&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; H^+ = 10^-5 M &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; E =  E^o-\frac{0.0592}{n} * log Q&lt;/math&gt; where n=2 and Q is then equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{P (H2)}{(H^+)^2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
So &lt;math&gt; E = E^o -\frac{0.0592}{2} * log&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac{P(H2)}{(H^+)^2}  = E^o -\frac{0.0592}{2} * log (10)^(10) = E^o -\frac{0.0592}{2} (10)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = 0.000 - 0.296 = -0.296V&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Question:''' What is the difference between the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O couples at pH5? &lt;br /&gt;
2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that has an E°&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.000 Volts for (2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O that has an E°&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.229 Volts for (4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, 4e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;u&gt;The total E°&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

:0.000 V&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;u&gt;+1.229 V&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
E°&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.229 Volts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This value '''&lt;u&gt;does not change&lt;/u&gt;''' with pH (since both couples shift -59.2 mV/pH in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Pourbaix diagram)

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;4.3 Latimer, Frost, and Pourbaix diagrams==

There are three kinds of &lt;u&gt;redox stability diagrams&lt;/u&gt; known as Latimer, Frost, and Pourbaix diagrams. Each of these diagrams contain similar information, but one representation may be more useful for a given situation.

Latimer and Frost diagrams help predict stability relative to higher and lower oxidation states. Pourbaix diagrams help understand pH-dependent equilibria and corrosion (which will be talked about more later). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Latimer diagrams'''&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;
Electric potential values are given for successive redox reactions (from highest to lowest oxidation state). The difference in oxidation states for each potential value is not necessarily one as in the provided diagram. For example, potentials in a Latimer diagram can be given for a +1 to +3 oxidation state change, not just for a +1 to +2 or +3 to +4. Identifying the oxidation state for each species is important if it's not already provided. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Example:'''&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;u&gt;Mn in Acid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Mn in Acid.png|500px|center|thumb|The Latimer Diagram for Mn in acid illustrates the standard reduction potentials using the different oxidation states.]]
'''Example:'''&lt;br /&gt;
:Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;+2e-→Mn, E&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;°=-1.18V
:MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;+e-→Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;+2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, :E&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;°=+0.95V
&lt;br /&gt;
We can also easily calculate values for multi-electron reactions by adding ΔG°(=-nFE°)&lt;br /&gt;
'''Example:''' &lt;br /&gt;
:MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;→Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
E° = &lt;sup&gt;1(0.564)+1(0.274)+1(4.27)+1(0.95)+1(1.51)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.51&lt;br /&gt;

:MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;→MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
E° = &lt;sup&gt;1(0.564)+1(0.274)+1(4.27)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.70&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Divide by the number of electrons involved in the oxidation number change (5 and 3 for the above equations).

An &lt;u&gt;Unstable&lt;/u&gt; species on a Latimer diagram will have a lower electric potential to the left than to the right.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example:''' &lt;br /&gt;
:2MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;→MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;; the MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt; species is &lt;u&gt;unstable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:E°=+4.27-0.274=+3.997 (&lt;u&gt;spontaneous&lt;/u&gt;)
&lt;br /&gt;
Which Mn species are unstable with regards to disproportionation? &lt;br /&gt;
:MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;; 5+→6+,4+  
:Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;; 3+→4+,2+&lt;br /&gt;

So stable species are: MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;, MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sub&gt;, MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;, and Mn&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

But '''MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;''' is also unstable, why?
:MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;→MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ; 
2MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; → 2MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ; E° = 2.272 - 0.564 = &lt;u&gt;+1.708&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Moral''': All possible disproportionation reactions must be considered in order to determine stability (this is often more convenient with a Frost diagram).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Note'''&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;u&gt;Thermodynamically&lt;/u&gt; unstable ions can be quite stable &lt;u&gt;kinetically&lt;/u&gt;. Also, most N-containing molecules (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,NO,N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are unstable relative to the elements (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Frost diagrams'''&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;
Stable and unstable oxidation states can be easily identified by plotting &lt;sup&gt;ΔG°&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; (=nE°) vs. oxidation number.

:*Lowest species on diagram are most stable (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
:*Highest species on diagram are strongest oxidizers (MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

*Use the information in the Pourbaix diagram to construct a Frost diagram for copper at pH 8.
&lt;br /&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;4.6 Problems==

1.	Balance the following redox reaction in acid solution and predict whether the reaction would become more or less spontaneous at higher pH.

		MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g) = Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)


2.	Silver metal is not easily oxidized, and does not react with oxygen-saturated water.  However, when excess NaCN is added to a suspension of silver particles, some silver dissolves.  If oxygen is removed (e.g., by bubbling nitrogen through the solution), the dissolution reaction stops.  Write a balanced equation for the dissolution reaction (hint: it is a redox reaction).


3.	The Latimer potential diagram for iodine (in acid solutions) is given below.

 [[File:Cobalt(II)-nitrate-photo.jpg|thumb|left|Cobalt (II) complexes have vastly different colors depending on the ligand.  Here, cobalt (II) nitrate shows a deep red color.]]
Coordination complexes are compounds and molecules formed between a metal ion and a ligand.  The metal ions are essentially Lewis acids while the ligands are analogous to Lewis bases.  Most often, the ligand has a lone pair of electrons that it donates to the empty d-orbitals in the metal.  This forms a Lewis acid-base adduct. 
[[File:D orbitals.svg|400px|thumb|right|The five d orbitals in ψ(x, y, z)2 form, with a combination diagram showing how they fit together to fill space around an atomic nucleus.]]

Like covalent compounds, metal complexes can vary widely in size, shape, charge and stability.  Metals can also form complexes with a variety of ligands and vice versa.  Certain metals may have any number of the same ligand with copper(II)-ammonia complexes being an example.  Copper can have from one ammonia ligand up to six in an octahedral format.  (Ex: [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Since ammonia is a neutral complex, the charge on the complex did not change but if copper were to bind with six cyanide anions, (CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) the complex would be [Cu(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;. Note the negative four charge. Charge depends on both the metal and ligand as seen in the cobalt (II) and cobalt (III) hexaaqua complexes: [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

Examples of possible metals include transition metals like iron, cobalt, copper, silver and tungsten.  Metals could also be alkali or alkali earth metals like sodium and magnesium, although these are much more rare than transition metal complexes.  P-block metals, also referred to as poor metals, like aluminum, tin and lead can also form complexes.  However, each block of the periodic table, and even within certain blocks--especially the transition metal series--complexes can have varying chemistry.   

Ligands, consist of an atom or compound which contains a lone pair or donating pair of electrons, and they also vary widely.  Examples include the iodide ion, the carbon monoxide molecule, and even water.  Ligands are usually neutral or negatively charged and are comprised of elements in the p-block of the table, usually nonmetals.  

Although the first few sections of the chapter will be focused on octahedral complexes, it is possible for complexes to adopt other shapes such as tetrahedral, square planar and distorted forms of these shapes.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.1 Counting electrons in transition metal complexes==
In order to understand the bonds created in transition metal complexes, it is important to understand the energies of the orbitals of both the ligands and the metal.  All of the transition metal ion's interactions with ligands occur through its empty d-orbitals. These d-orbitals are the LUMOs of the metal and will complex with the HOMOs of the ligands.  A ligand acts as a Lewis base by donating its HOMO electrons to the metal.  These electrons come from the lone pairs of the ligand, and the electronic structure of the ligand determines how strongly the complex will form.  For example, the lone pair on the carbon of a CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ligand will form a stronger bond to a metal ion than the lone pair on the oxygen of a water molecule.  The carbon is more electropositive than oxygen and will therefore be more &quot;willing&quot; to donate its electrons. 

Although d-orbitals are of high energy, the corresponding s-orbitals (Ex: 3d with 4s and 4d with 5s, etc.) have slightly higher energy.  These s-orbitals are the first to lose electrons to form an ion.  From there, the metal will continue to lose electrons until it achieves a state of low enough energy and has an oxidation number which is stable.  Because of this trend, it is possible to determine the oxidation state of a metal in complex very easily by subtracting the ion's charge from which group in the periodic table it lies.  Determining the oxidation state of the metal in a complex is relatively easy since the metal retains its oxidation number from its isolated state to its complexed state. Ligands also retain their oxidation number (the cyanide ion is always negative one and water is always neutral).  

Putting this together, we see that we can determine the number of d-electrons in a transition metal cation by subtracting its oxidation state from its group in the periodic table.  For example let's look at an Fe &lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complex.  Iron is in group 8 on the periodic table.  If iron metal gets oxidized to iron (III), it will have lost three electrons.  Two of these electrons come from the 4s orbital, leaving it empty and one electron comes from the d-orbital in iron.  In group eight, it has six d-electrons and when it loses one, it goes to five d-electrons or d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.
::group 8 - 3+ charge = d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
::  8     -      3    = 5

The same &quot;game&quot; can be applied to any transition element. Copper (II), in group 11 on the periodic table has eleven electrons in its valence shell, minus two, leaving it with 9 electrons, all d-electrons. Manganese (II), in group seven, has five d-electrons.   Zinc(II) in group 12 would have 10 d-electrons, a full shell, and manganese (VII) has zero d-electrons.  

For simplicity's sake, this equation can be used: Total d-electrons = Group # - oxidation #. As above, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; would be in group 7 with an oxidation state of +2. 
::e-total = 7 - 2 = 5

This number of electrons can then fill the complex's d-orbitals.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.2 Crystal field theory==

Like p-orbitals, d-orbitals have shapes which align with a certain coordinate system.  The orbitals d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;, and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; point 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; in between the axes of the xy-, xz-, yz-planes respectively.  The axes of these planes can be thought of as the bonding axes.  The d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; points in the direction of the z-bonding axis.  The d&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; points in the direction of the x- and y-bonding axes.  
[[File:D-orbitals.png|thumbnail|center|d-orbitals and their orientation with relation to ligands.]][[File:Octahedral crystal-field splitting.png|250px|framed|left|M.O. diagram for octahedral crystal field splitting.]]

An isolated metal, far from any ligand interaction will have all of these orbitals as degenerate.  But as a ligand is brought closer, these orbitals start interacting with the ligand orbitals and a splitting begins to occur.  At the equilibrium distance of the ligands to the orbitals, an energy gap between the on-axis (d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) and off-axis (d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;, and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;) orbitals begins to form, and is denoted as Δ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; for octahedral complexes. This phenomenon is known as octahedral crystal field splitting.  We will only discuss octahedral complexes for now.  As discussed above with the orientation of orbitals with respect to bonding axes, the three orbitals which point in between the bonding axes (d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;, and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;) will have less electrostatic repulsion and form orbitals of lower energy.  The orbitals which point directly along the bonding axes, d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; will form higher energy orbitals.  The low energy orbitals are referred to as t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and the high energy orbitals are called e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals. The difference in energy of these two sets is Δ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.3 Spectrochemical series==
The spectrochemical series refers to an ordering from soft to hard ligands.  A general trend can be described as follows: ligands on the lower end of the series are referred to as weak field ligands and ligands on the upper end of the series are referred to as strong field. One rule for the series is electronegativity.  Soft bases, like the iodide and bromide ions are easily polarizable due to their large size and relatively small charge.  These ions are not nearly as electronegative as elements like oxygen.  Oxygen holds its lone pairs much closer than iodide does creating poor overlap for the water molecule which results in a weaker bond energy.  A simple electrochemical series might look like this: 

Weak field I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt; Pyridine &lt; NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; CO Strong field 

[[File:Cobalt spin complexes.png|thumb|Low and high spin Complexes]]

The energy gap between the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbital sets depend on both the ligand and the metal.  The stronger the ligand, the larger the gap and vice versa.  The more acidic (the harder the metal is as an acid) the larger the gap as well. Energy can be calculated in a number of ways where E is the splitting energy, λ is the wavelength associated with the photon of light necessary to excite an electron from its ground state to an excited state, ν is the frequency of this electron, h is Planck's constant (6.626x10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; J*s), and c is the speed of light.  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\tilde{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as a &quot;wavenumber&quot; and is the inverse of wavelength, usually measured in cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Energy gaps are usually expressed in terms of wavenumbers.

E = hν = hc/λ = hc&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\tilde{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

For example a red photon can have a wavelength of 620 nm and a wavenumber of 6.2x10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  A common carbon-carbon bond might have a wavenumber of 32000cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  

A list of d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; compounds and the frequency of radiation they absorb (in wavenumbers) are listed below:   [[File:Colorwheel.png|thumb|left|alt=A simple color wheel.|A simple color wheel.]]

Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; - 9300

Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; - 18200 

Co(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt; - 33500

Rh(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; - 27000

Rh(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt; - 45500

As seen, the stronger the ligand, the higher the wavenumber and the larger the energy gap.  By nature, 4d and 5d complexes have larger CFSE. This is due to something referred to as the lanthanide contraction.  In between the 5s and 4d blocks is the 4f series which has a very smooth contraction from lanthanum to ytterbium. This makes it so that the 5s and 6s orbitals of the 2nd and 3rd row transition elements are much smaller than their d-counterparts, unlike the 3d and 4s orbitals which are relatively similar in size.  As a result, 4d and 5d elements have very similar chemistry.  

A simple, qualitative way to see the relative crystal field splitting energy, Δ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, is to observe the color of a compound. The higher the energy of the absorbed photon, the larger the energy gap. However, the color a complex absorbs is opposite the color it appears/reflects on the color wheel.  Thus, Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which looks blue-green absorbs in the red-orange range while Co(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;, which looks yellow, absorbs in the violet and ultra-violet range of the spectrum. This method is applicable to most metal complexes, as the majority of these compounds absorb and reflect in the visible range; however there are complexes which look colorless and either absorb in the ultraviolet or infrared, a large difference in energy.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.4 π-bonding between metals and ligands==
Strength and stability of complexes depends not only on the electronegativity of the bonding atom of the ligand but also on the bonds in the ligand.  Carbon monoxide is higher in the electrochemical series than ammonia even though it contains oxygen, an atom known for its poor orbital overlap.  This can be attributed to the extra pi-bonding orbitals in the carbon monoxide compound which may participate in bonding.  There are three common types of pi-bonding in metal complexes. [[File:Back bonding.png|thumb|Carbon monoxide backbonding with a metal's d-orbitals.]]

The first instance is when a ligand like carbon monoxide or cyanide donates its sigma electrons to the metal, also known as &quot;back-bonding&quot;.  The metal can be referred to as a σ-accpetor and a π-donor since the metal donates π electrons to the ligands π* orbitals. This forms a dπ-pπ bond. 

The second instance is when an element, like phosphorus, has a lone pair that it can donate.  This interaction is also back-bonding and the phosphorus species is a σ-donor and a π-acceptor. This forms a dπ-dπ bond. 

The third instance is when an element with two full p-orbitals donates two lone pairs and as such can be referred to as a σ-donor and a π-donor.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.5 Crystal field stabilization energy, pairing, and Hund's rule==
Crystal field stabilization energy is defined as the energy gained by the complex by filling the split t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals.  As seen in the image, the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals are &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; the octahedral splitting energy.  As electrons are added into the lower set, the crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE) increases with each electron put in.  So a d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; complex would have a CFSE of (3)(&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This method of determining the CFSE as well as the electron count works well if the complex has 3 d-electrons or fewer.  However, when adding a fourth electron, there are two possible orbitals for the electron to occupy: either pair with an existing electron in the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; set or fill a vacant orbital in the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; set.  This depends on whether the splitting energy between the two sets is larger or smaller than the pairing energy for putting two anti-parallel electrons in the same orbital. If the pairing energy is larger than the splitting energy, that is, it is more favorable to place electrons in empty orbitals than to pair them, the complex is said to be high spin. And if the pairing energy is lower than the CFSE, then the complex will be low spin.  High and low spin simply refer to the amount of unpaired electrons.  

Metals in the 3d set with 4 to 7 electrons are the only elements affected by this.  Metals with 1 to 3 d electrons will only fill the lower set and metals with 9 and 10 d-electrons will fill the orbitals regardless of the order.  We will discuss 4d and 5d transition metals later.  This difference in energies is relative to the spectrochemical series. That said, a strong field ligand--a ligand with a strong ability to push electrons into pairs--will widen the octahedral splitting.  This is the opposite for weak field ligands.  Using the spectrochemical series, the following complexes can be determined to either be high or low spin: 

[Co(Cl)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;] contains a d&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; metal with a relatively weak field ligand.  This complex is known to be high spin.  It's splitting pattern can be seen here:  
[Co(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;] is also a d&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; complex but contains cyanide, one of the strongest field ligands will produce a low spin complex.

As mentioned before, the issue of low and high spins for 4d and 5d complexes turns out to be rather simple.  The 4s orbital for 1st row transition series is about the same size as the 3d orbital so their energies are relatively equal; however, for 4d and 5d series, their d-orbitals reach out much farther than their respective s-orbitals. This correlates to a much larger Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; resulting in low spin 2nd and 3rd row transition metal complexes. 

Electrons possess four quantum numbers and one of them, intrinsic to the electron, is spin.  Spin is a quantum mechanical property of the electron which is important to note when pairing electrons. Based on the Pauli exclusion principle, no electron may possess all four of the same quantum numbers in the same sub-orbital.  If two electrons possess the same first three quantum numbers, they must not have the same spin.  Furthermore, electrons must fill up all available and preferred orbitals before they begin to pair.  Parallel spins in adjacent orbitals, in order to maximize angular momentum, are lower in energy, so multiple unpaired electrons are either all spin up or all spin down.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.6 Non-octahedral complexes==

While octahedral is the most prevalent arrangement of ligands, and the only possible arrangement for six ligand systems, other shapes are observed and predictable. By using other shapes and electronic configurations we can rationalize observed [[w:Paramagnetism|paramagnetism]] and explain certain effects that are impossible to glean from making an all octahedral assumption about transition metal complexes.

[[File:Crystal Field Splitting Energy Diagram from Octahedral to Square Planar.png|center|900px|CFSE diagram from octahedral to square planar]]
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Tetrahedral arrangements are the second most common shape of complex and are often observed when the ligands are much larger than the metal ion and have trouble fitting around the core. Tetrahedral differs from octahedral mostly by having four ligands instead of six and also because its crystal field splitting energy is much smaller, about 2/3rds of octahedral CFSE. 
Another less common class of geometry is square planar. This four ligand arrangement is based on the most stable electronic configuration for an ion with 8 d electrons. This arrangement never generates a magnetic complex by virtue of its electronic configuration which raises the energy of an unoccupied orbital to stabilize the complex. The square planar arrangement stems from a distortion of the octahedral complex to give a lower crystal field splitting energy.  The bonds in the z orbitals are stretched and decrease in energy, while the x and y bond orbitals are shortened and increase in energy.  Once the complex reaches a square planar orientation, its three z orbitals are very low in energy.  The CFSE has decreased significantly, leading to a much more stable complex.  4d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and 5d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; are always square planar because their 8 electron fit nicely into the low energy orbitals of the square planar orientation.  3d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; complexes can reach the square planar orientation with strong field ligands.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.7 Jahn-Teller effect==
The Jahn-Teller distorted tetrahedron is another four ligand shape and is related to the square planar arrangement, but is typically observed in complexes with 9 d electrons. By virtue of their odd number of electrons, these complexes are always magnetic. The electronic configuration for these compounds is almost the same as the square planar configuration but the top orbital is only separated from the others by the theoretical CSFE of the tetrahedral shape and the second to fourth highest energy orbitals are inverted.When a complex contains a degenerate ground state orbital, it will distort itself to remove the degeneracy and lower its symmetry to become more stable. In other words, distorting the orbitals of d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;(Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), low spin d&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (NaNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and high spin d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (CrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) complexes lead to lower total energies than their symmetric, octahedral counterparts.  The distortion comes from elongating the z axis ligand bonds.  All orbitals containing a z component are therefore lowered in energy, while the orbitals without a z component are destabilized. Although relatively uncommon, there are some notable [http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Inorganic_Chemistry/Coordination_Chemistry/Coordination_Numbers/Jahn-Teller_Distortions examples] of compounds with this arrangement such as Cu(II).

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.8 Tetrahedral complexes==
Tetrahedral complexes are high spin complexes where the dx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and dz&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals point away from ligands while the dxy, dyz, and dxz orbitals point between ligands.  This increases the energy of the the dxy, dyz, and dxz orbitals and decreases the dx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and dz&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals.  However, the overall splitting energy between the t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and e orbitals is about 2/3s that of an octahedral's geometry and is therefore more stable.  Because of the lowered splitting energy, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin.
Tetrahedral compounds are a class of complexes that are often brightly colored because they lack the center of symmetry that forbids a d-d* transition. Because that low energy transition is at least partly allowed, these complexes normally absorb in the visible range and as such have bright colors unlike many of the octahedral or otherwise Centro-symmetric compounds. Their d-d* transitions are forbidden and their other transitions require more energy.  These complexes therefore absorb in the ultraviolet region and appear fairly dull.  One example of this is dierite.  Dierite is a pink-blue Co(II) Sulfate indicator that is a light pink when wet (octahedral) and a deep blue color when dry (tetrahedral).  2 Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ----&gt; Co[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] + 12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.9 Stability of transition metal complexes==
Transition metal complexes have a wide variety of stabilities depending on CFSE, hard and soft acid/base metals and ligand interactions, as well as chelate and macrocyclic effects.  Hard acids are typically small, high charge density cations that are weakly polarizable such as the Lewis acids H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;. Hard acids are usually electropositive metals with a high oxidation state that typically form oxides. Some hard bases include H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Soft acids are large polarizable low charge metals such as Ni, Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; while soft bases are anions/neutral bases such as H&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, and CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;). Soft acids are typically electronegative metals with low oxidation states that typically form sulfides or arsenides.  Hard acids form strong bonds and stable complexes with hard bases while soft acids do the same with soft bases. Hard bases also have the ability to stabilize higher oxidation states than soft bases.  For instance CuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is stable while CuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not.  Chelating and macrocyclic ligand complexes have higher formation constants due to the large entropic effect their confirmations allow.  The stability of each instance can be predicted by how alike the metal and ligand are as well as other factors like ligand dentate effects. Transition metal complexes are typically unstable when the hard soft acid base character of the ligands do not match, the oxidation state of the transition metal is unstable, or a more stable complex can be formed in the same environment.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.10 Chelate and macrocyclic effects==
Chelate and macrocyclic effects can dominate transition metal complex stability.  The chelate effect refers to the potential of a ligand to bind multiple times to the same metal ion.  The increase in entropy creates a more stable product. For example, the formation constant, K&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, of the Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complex is about 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; as weak as the Cobalt[[w:Ethylenediamine|ethylenediamine]] complex.  Ethylenediamine is a bidentate ligand, meaning it has two possible binding sites, so only 3 particles must be used to form the Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complex.  Ammonia is only a monodentate ligand, so 6 particles must react to form the same Co complex.  Other common multi-dentate ligands are [[w:Acetylacetone|acetylacetone]], a bi dentate ligand, and [[w:Ethylenediaminetetraacetic|EDTA]], a hexadentate ligand that is one of the most effective complexing agents known.  
The macrocyclic effect follows the same principle as the chelate effect, but the effect is further enhance by their cyclic confirmation.  Macrocyclic ligands are not only multi-dentate, but because they are rigidly stuck in their cyclic form, they allow less conformational freedom, almost as if the ligand is &quot;pre-oranized&quot; for binding.  For example heme b is a quadridentate cyclic ligand which is excellent at complexing free Fe&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; ions.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.12 Discussion questions==
*Discuss chelating ligands and what they do, using some new examples.
*Explain (using some new examples) how we know if an octahedral complex of a metal ion will be high spin or low spin, and what measurements we can do to confirm it.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.13 Problems==

1.	Predict the shape of the following complexes, and determine whether each will be diamagnetic or paramagnetic:


(a) [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;

(b) [Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sub&gt;

(c) [Zn(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

(d) [Mo(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]

(e) [Rh(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;


2.	Tetrahedral complexes are almost always high spin, whereas octahedral complexes can be either high or low spin.  Explain.


3.	For each of the Mn complexes in the table below, give electronic configurations (within the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; sets of 3d orbitals) that are consistent with the observed magnetic moments.

4.	In a solution made by combining FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with excess ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at neutral pH, the concentration of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) ions is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;-17&lt;/sup&gt; M.  However, in a solution of ethylenediamine and acetic acid at comparable concentration, the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) concentration is about 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e., 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; times higher.  Explain. 


5.	The complex [Ti(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is violet, while the analogous complex with another monodentate neutral ligand L, [Ti(L)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is orange.  How many of the following statements are true? Explain briefly.

(a) L is a stronger field ligand than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

(b) [Ti(L)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is a high-spin complex.

(c) [Ti(L)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; absorbs yellow and red light.

(d) Both complexes have two 3d electrons associated with the metal.


6.	OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; are both Brønsted bases, and both can form complexes with metal ions.  Explain how OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; can be a much stronger Brønsted base than CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and at the same time much lower in the spectrochemical series.


7.	W. Deng and K. W. Hipps (J. Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 10736-10740) reported an STM study of the electronic properties of Ni(II)tetraphenyl porphyrin (NiTPP), a red-purple, neutral diamagnetic complex that is made by reacting Ni(II) perchlorate with tetraphenylporphine.  When NiTPP is reacted with sodium thiocyanate it forms another complex that is paramagnetic.  Draw the structures of NiTPP and the product complex, and the crystal field energy level diagram that explains each.  What value of the magnetic moment (in units of μB) would you expect for the paramagnetic complex?


8.	Seppelt and coworkers reported the very unusual ion [AuXe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the salt [AuXe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Science 2000, 290, 117-118).  This was the first report of a compound containing a bond between a metal and a noble gas atom.  Draw a d-orbital energy diagram for this ion and predict whether it should be diamagnetic or paramagnetic.  Would you expect to be able to form a similar complex using Cu in place of Au, or Kr in place of Xe? Why or why not?

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;6.1 Unit cells and crystal structures==
[[File:Academ Repetitive patterns by tile groups in a tiling.svg|200px|right]]
Crystals can be thought of as repeating patterns, much like wallpaper or bathroom tiles, but in three dimensions.  The fundamental repeating unit of the crystal is called the '''unit cell'''.  It is a three dimensional shape that can be repeated over and over by unit translations to fill space (and leave minimal gaps) in the structure.  Some possible unit cells are shown in the tiling pattern at the right, along with arrows that indicate '''unit translation vectors'''.  In three dimensions, the hexagonal or rhombic unit cells of this pattern would be replaced by three dimensional boxes that would stack together to fill all space.  As shown in the figure, the origin of the unit cell is arbitrary.  The same set of boxes will fill all space no matter where we define the origin of the lattice.  We will see that pure metals typically have very simple crystal structures with cubic or hexagonal unit cells.  However the crystal structures of alloys can be quite complicated.

When considering the crystal structures of metals and alloys, it is not sufficient to think of each atom as an isolated system like is done for s- and p-block compounds.  Instead, think of the entire metal as a network of atoms surrounded by a sea of delocalized electrons.  The electrons are delocalized because there are not enough of them to fill each atoms orbitals; they must be shared by all of the atoms. A transition metal bonds using its d-orbitals, allowing it to make many bonds to adjacent atoms.  The atoms in a metal lattice arrange themselves in a certain pattern which can be represented as a 3D box structure known as the '''unit cell''' which repeats across the entire metal.

Metal atoms can be thought of as spheres, and therefore will not be 100 % efficient in packing, the same way a stack of cannonballs has some empty spaces between the balls.  Different unit cells have different packing efficiencies.  The number of atoms that is included in the unit cell only includes the fractions of atoms ''inside'' of the box.  Atoms on the corners of the unit cell count as ⅛ of an atom, atoms on a face count as ½, an atom in the center counts as a full atom.  Using this, let's calculate the number of atoms in a simple cubic unit cell, a face centered cubic (fcc) unit cell, and a body centered cubic (bcc) unit cell. 

&lt;u&gt;Simple Cubic:&lt;/u&gt;

8 corner atoms × ⅛ = 1 atom/cell

&lt;u&gt;Body Centered Cubic:&lt;/u&gt;

(8 corner atoms × ⅛) + (1 center atom × 1)= 2 atoms/cell

&lt;u&gt;Face Centered Cubic:&lt;/u&gt;

(8 corner atoms × ⅛)+ (6 face atoms × ½)= 4 atoms/cell

The most efficient packing of metal atoms (fcc) in a metal fills about 74% of space.  A bcc metal fills 68% of space. A simple cubic cell fills 52% of space.  These can be calculated by dividing the volume of the atoms in the cell by the volume of the cell itself.  The volume of the atoms in the cell is equal to the number of atoms/cell times the volume of a sphere, (4/3)πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  The volume of the cubic cells is found by cubing the side length.  As an example, let's calculate the packing efficiency of a simple cubic unit cell.  As we saw earlier in the section, a simple cubic unit cell contains one atom.  The side length of the simple cubic unit cell is 2r, since the centers of each atom occupy the corners of the unit cell. 

Packing efficiency=[(1 atom)×(4/3)πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]/[(2r)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]=0.523

The same method can be applied to bcc and fcc structures for homonuclear structures.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;6.2 Bravais lattices==
Crystal lattices can be classified by their '''translational''' and '''rotational symmetry'''.  In three-dimensional crytals, these symmetry operations yield 14 distinct lattice types which are called '''Bravais lattices'''.  In these lattice diagrams (shown below) the dots represent lattice points, which are places where the whole structure repeats by translation.  For example, in the body-centered cubic ('''bcc''') structure of sodium metal, which is discussed below, we put one atom at the corner lattice points and another in the center of the unit cell.  In the NaCl structure, which is discussed in Chapter 8, we place one NaCl formula unit on each lattice point in the face-centered cubic ('''fcc''') lattice.  That is, one atom (Na or Cl) would be placed on the lattice point and the other one would be placed halfway between.  Similarly, in the cubic [[w:diamond_cubic|diamond structure]], we place one C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit around each lattice point in the fcc lattice.


The fourteen Bravais lattices fall into seven '''[[w:crystal_system|crystal systems]]''' that are defined by their rotational symmetry.  In the lowest symmetry system ('''triclinic'''), there is no rotational symmetry.  This results in a unit cell in which none of the edges are constrained to have equal lengths, and none of the angles are 90º.  In the '''monoclinic''' system, there is one two-fold rotation axis (by convention, the b-axis), which constrains two of the angles to be 90º.  In the '''orthorhombic''' system, there are three mutually perpendicular two-fold axes along the three unit cell directions.  '''Orthorhombic''' unit cells have three unequal unit cell edges that are mutually perpendicular.  '''Tetragonal''' unit cells have a four-fold rotation axis which constrains all the angles to be 90º and makes the a and b axes equivalent.  The '''rhombohedral''' system has a three-fold axis, which constrains all the unit cell edges and angles to be equal, and the '''hexagonal''' system has a six-fold axis, which constrains the a and b lattice dimensions to be equal and the angle between them to be 120º.  The '''cubic''' system has a three-fold axis along the body diagonal of the cube, as well as two-fold axes along the three perpendicular unit cell directions. In the cubic system, all unit cell edges are equal and the angles between them are 90º. 


The translational symmetry of the Bravais lattices (the lattice '''centerings''') are classified as follows:

*'''Primitive''' '''(P)''': lattice points on the cell corners only.
*'''Body (I)''': one additional lattice point at the center of the cell.
*'''Face (F)''': one additional lattice point at the center of each of the faces of the cell.
*'''Base (A, B or C)''': one additional lattice point at the center of each of one pair of the cell faces.


Not all combinations of the crystal systems and lattice centerings are unique. There are in total 7&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;6 = 42 combinations, but it can be shown that several of these are in fact equivalent to each other. For example, the monoclinic I lattice can be described by a monoclinic C lattice by different choice of crystal axes. Similarly, all A- or B-centred lattices can be described either by a C- or P-centering. This reduces the number of combinations to 14 conventional Bravais lattices, shown in the table below.


When the fourteen Bravais lattices are combined with the '''32 [[w:Crystallographic_point_group|crystallographic point groups]]''', we obtain the '''230 [[w:space_group|space groups]]'''.  These space groups describe all the combinations of symmetry operations that can exist in unit cells in three dimensions.  For two-dimensional lattices there are only 17 possible plane groups, which are also known as [[w:Wallpaper_groups|wallpaper groups]].

'''The Crystalline Nature of Metals.''' All metallic elements (except Cs, Ga, and Hg) are crystalline solids at room temperature. Like ionic solids, metals and alloys have a very strong tendency to crystallize, whether they are made by thermal processing or by other techniques such as solution reduction or electroplating. Metals crystallize readily and it is difficult to form a glassy metal even with very rapid cooling. Molten metals have low viscosity, and the identical (essentially spherical) atoms can pack into a crystal very easily. Glassy metals can be made, however, by rapidly cooling alloys, particularly if the constituent atoms have different sizes. The different atoms cannot pack in a simple unit cell, sometimes making crystallization slow enough to form a glass. 


'''Structure and bonding in metals.''' Most metals and alloys crystallize in one of three very common structures: body-centered cubic (bcc), hexagonal close packed (hcp), or cubic close packed (ccp, also called face centered cubic, fcc). In all three structures the coordination number of the metal atoms (i.e., the number of equidistant nearest neighbors) is rather high: 8 for bcc, and 12 for hcp and ccp. We can contrast this with the low coordination numbers (i.e., low valences - like 2 for O, 3 for N, or 4 for C) found in nonmetals. In the bcc structure, the nearest neighbors are at the corners of a cube surrounding the metal atom in the center. In the hcp and ccp structures, the atoms pack like stacked cannonballs or billiard balls, in layers with a six-coordinate arrangement. Each atom also has six more nearest neighbors from layers above and below. The stacking sequence is ABCABC... in the ccp lattice and ABAB... in hcp.  In both cases, it can be shown that the spheres fill 74% of the volume of the lattice.  This is the highest volume fraction that can be filled with a lattice of equal spheres.


'''Periodic trends.'''  Remember where we find the metallic elements in the periodic table - everywhere except the upper right corner. This means that as we go down a group in the p-block (let's say, group IVA, the carbon group, or group VA, the nitrogen group), the properties of the elements gradually change from nonmetals to metalloids to metals. The carbon group nicely illustrates the transition. Starting at the top, the element carbon has two stable allotropes - graphite and diamond. In each one, the valence of carbon atoms is exactly satisfied by making four electron pair bonds to neighboring atoms. In graphite, each carbon has three nearest neighbors, and so there are two single bonds and one double bond. In diamond, there are four nearest neighbors situated at the vertices of a tetrahedron, and so there is a single bond to each one.


The two elements right under carbon (silicon and germanium) in the periodic table also have the diamond structure (recall that these elements cannot make double bonds to themselves easily, so there is no graphite allotrope for Si or Ge). While diamond is a good insulator, both silicon and germanium are semiconductors (i.e., metalloids). Mechanically, they are hard like diamond. Like carbon, each atom of Si and Ge satisfies its valence of four by making single bonds to four nearest neighbors.


The next element under germanium is tin (Sn). Tin has two allotropes, one with the diamond structure, and one with a slightly distorted bcc structure. The latter has metallic properties (metallic luster, malleability), and conductivity about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; times higher than Si. Finally, lead (Pb), the element under Sn, has the ccp structure, and also is metallic. Note the trends in coordination number and conducting properties:
[[File:carbon bonding.jpg|right|400px|]]
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Element !! Structure !! Coord. no. !! Conductivity
|-
| C || graphite, diamond || 3, 4 || semimetal, insulator
|-
| Si || diamond || 4 || semiconductor
|-
| Ge || diamond || 4 || semiconductor
|-
| Sn || diamond, distorted bcc || 4, 8 || semiconductor, metal
|-
| Pb || ccp || 12 || metal
|}

The elements C, Si, and Ge obey the octet rule, and we can easily identify the electron pair bonds in their structures. Sn and Pb, on the other hand, adopt structures with high coordination numbers. They ''do not have enough valence electrons'' to make electron pair bonds to each neighbor (this is a common feature of metals). What happens in this case is that the valence electrons become &quot;smeared out&quot; or delocalized over all the atoms in the crystal. It is best to think of the bonding in metals as a crystalline arrangement of positively charged cores with a &quot;sea&quot; of shared valence electrons gluing the structure together. Because the electrons are not localized in any particular bond between atoms, they can move in an electric field, which is why metals conduct electricity well. Another way to describe the bonding in metals is nondirectional. That is, an atom's nearest neighbors surround it in every direction, rather than in a few particular directions (like at the corners of a tetrahedron, as we found for diamond). Nonmetals (insulators and semiconductors), on the other hand, have directional bonding. Because the bonding is non-directional and coordination numbers are high, it is relatively easy to deform the coordination sphere (i.e., break or stretch bonds) than it is in the case of a nonmetal. This is why elements like Pb are much more malleable than C, Si, or Ge.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;6.4 Bonding in metals==
Due to the electronic nature of the metal atoms in one unit cell, it is not feasible to form typical two-electron bonds. Sodium, for example, has only one valence electron. There are two atoms per unit cell in the body-centered cubic crystal structure of sodium metal. Each centered sodium atom forms a bond with each of the eight corners of the unit cell, resulting in a bond order of one-eighth.

[[File:Lattice body centered cubic.svg|thumbnail|left|The bonds made by the central atom in a bcc unit cell clearly shown in this configuration. A metal exhibiting this crystal structure has a bond order of one-eighth.]]

A more accurate way to describe the bonding in metals is through band theory. In general, X number of atoms will generate X number of molecular orbitals with X-1 possible nodes. Previously, we showed that the energy versus internuclear distance graph for a two hydrogen atom system has a low energy level and a high energy level corresponding to the bonding molecular orbital and antibonding molecular orbital, respectively. These two energy levels were very distinct from each other, and the two electrons of this two atom system will energetically prefer the lower energy level. If more atoms are introduced to the system, there will be a number of additional levels between the lowest and highest energy levels. In band theory, the atom chain is extrapolated to an indefinitely large number so that the different combinations of bonding and anti-bonding orbitals create &quot;bands&quot; of possible energy states for the metal: this approach is called tight-binding approximation. The number of atoms in these situations is so large, that the energies can be thought of as a continuum rather than a series of distinct levels. A metal will only partially fill this band, as there are far fewer valence electrons than there are energy states to fill.

[[File:BandGap-Comparison-withfermi-E.PNG|400px|thumbnail|right|Lower energy bands fill with electrons first. The conductivity of metals is related to the band gap between the valence band and conduction band: the smaller the gap between bands, the better conductive properties the metal displays.]]

The degree to which bands fill also affects the conductive property of metals. The lowest filled energy band in an energy band diagram is referred to as the valence band, which contains the valence electrons of the atoms in the metal. Above that band is the conduction band, which is the band that excited electrons will begin to fill if the appropriate amount of energy is applied. These electrons are charge-carriers, and are capable of traveling freely through the metal. The region between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band is referred to as the band gap, and the energy between the two bands is typically referred to as E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. The value of E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; varies from species to species and is directly affected by orbital overlap. A strong overlap of s and p orbitals will reduce the band gap and vice versa. A small band gap between the valence and conduction bands will allow electrons to much more easily leave their orbit about the nucleus and freely move through the metal. Therefore, a metal with these properties is a conductor. A small band gap typically corresponds to a semiconductor, and a large band gap typically corresponds to an insulator, where the region between the two bands is designated as the forbidden region for electrons.

The ability of metals to conduct electricity can be understood by looking at the '''density of states''', which describes the number of orbitals per unit energy.  When no electric field is applied, the density of states (D.O.S.) is the same in any direction and the band is filled halfway to the Fermi energy level.  When an electric field is applied, the D.O.S. increases in energy in one direction and is lowered in the other.  As a result, the electrons fill the orbitals in the direction opposite the electric field (since electrons are attracted to the positive field) more than the orbitals in the direction of the electric field.  They still only fill up to the Fermi level.  As a result, the electrons begin to move in the direction opposite the electric field, causing a current to flow in the direction of the E-field (remember that current is the movement of positive charge, so it is opposite the direction of the movement of electrons). When an electric field is applied to a conductor, electrons are moving extremely fast due to the force applied to them by the field. A typical value for the speed of electrons in a metal is approximately 3.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m/s, but the drift speed is approximately 0.01 m/s. The slow drift speed across the surface of a metal is attributable to the lack of a free path for the electrons. Other particles in the metal &quot;scatter&quot; electrons, causing a change in direction. This cumulative effect eventually results in electrons traveling against the direction of the electric field across the metal.

Why don't insulators conduct electricity? The band is filled for an insulator, so even if the energy of the density of states in increased in one direction and lowered the energy in the other, the electrons would not move to the lower energy states because all of them are already full.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;6.5 Conduction in metals==
[[file:metalEvsDOS.png|left|200px]]
In metals, the valence electrons are in molecular orbitals that extend over the entire crystal lattice.  As we have learned, metallic crystals are typically micron size, meaning that the spatial extent of the orbitals is very large compared to the size of the atoms or the unit cell.  The diagram at the left shows a generic plot of electron energy vs. density of states for a metal such as Na, Cu, or Ag.  In these cases, there are N orbitals for N electrons, and each orbital can accomodate two electrons.  Therefore the Fermi level, which corresponds to the energy of the highest occupied MO at zero temperature, is somewhere in the middle of the band of orbitals.  The energy level spacing between orbitals is very small compared to the thermal energy kT, so we can think of the orbitals as forming a continuous band.


Classically, if the electrons in this band are free to be thermally excited, we would expect them to have a specific heat of 3R per mole of electrons.  However, experimentally we observe that C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.02 R per mole.  This suggests that only about 1% of the electrons in the metal can be thermally excited at room temperature.  However, essentially all of the valence electrons are free to move in the crystal and contribute to electrical conduction.  To understand this apparent paradox, we need to recall that the electrons exist in quantized energy levels.


Because of quantization, electrons in metals have a [[w:Fermi–Dirac_statistics#Fermi.E2.80.93Dirac_distribution|Fermi-Dirac distribution]] of energies.  In this distribution, most of the electrons are spin-paired, although the individual electrons in these pairs can be quite far apart since the orbitals extend over the entire crystal.  A relatively small number of electrons at the top of the Fermi sea are unpaired by thermal excitation.  This is the origin of the [[w:paramagnetism|Pauli paramagnetism]] of metals. [[File:DOS.png|thumbnail|right|DOS for an insulator or semiconductor]] 

The number of electrons in an element or compound can also determine their conductivity.  The energy to DOS picture to the left shows how an element or compound  with filled orbitals will have no change when an electric field is applied.  The splitting of the orbitals does not stabilize the electrons.  This is the case with semiconductors and insulators.  However, when an electric field is applied to an element with a half filled orbital shell, the shift in the DOS stabilizes the unfilled electrons.  This property makes the element or compound metallic and an conductor of electricity.  This explains the conductivity of Na (3s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), but what about Mg(3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)?  The promotional energy (+267 kJ) is more than offset by the bonding energy (-410kJ).  The ΔE&lt;sub&gt;vaporization&lt;/sub&gt;, or the cohesive energy of metals, is determined by the bonding energy - the promotion energy.  
[[File:Cohesive_energy_of_metals.png|thumbnail|left|The cohesive energy diagram of Mg]]

The situation is more complex for Re, Os, Ir, and Pt.  These can create d-&quot;acid-base&quot; alloys.  For instance, ZrC (a very stable carbide) and Pt form an even more stable alloys (Zrpt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by donating their d electrons in a very exothermic reaction.  HF and Pt also undergo this reaction. Hf is the &quot;acid&quot; with an electron configuration of 6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while Pt is the &quot;base&quot; with the electron configuration of 6s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; to create a stable &quot;salt&quot; product with a filled 5d electron configuration. Some d-acid/base alloys are of particular interest for use in catalysis.  For instance Sc-Pt alloys are good catalysts for oxygen reduction in fuel cells.  Even though Sc is an active metal, it is stabilized by the aqueous acid environment of the fuel cell.










'''How fast are electrons traveling in a typical metal?''' Because of the bell shape of the E vs. DOS curve, most of the electrons have E ≈ E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;.  At the midpoint energy (E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) of the band, the MO's have one node for every two atoms.  We can calculate the de Broglie wavelength as twice the distance between nodes and thus:

:'''λ = 4a'''

where '''a''' is the interatomic spacing.  Since a typical value of '''a''' is about 2 Å, we obtain the ''' de Broglie wavelength λ ≈ 8 Å'''.

Using the de Broglie relation h = λ/p, we can write:

:'''p = λ/h = m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''', 

where '''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the mass of the electron and '''v&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the velocity of electrons with energy E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;.

Solving for v&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = h/m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;λ we obtain '''v&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''' = (6.62 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; J s)/(9.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt; kg)(8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; m) = '''1.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m/s'''

Experimental values of v&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; are 1.07 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.39 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m/s for Na and Ag, respectively, so our approximations are pretty good.

''How fast are electrons moving in metals?'' Really, really fast!!  '''1,000,000 meters per second!''' This is about 1/300 the speed of light, and about 3000 times the speed of sound (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; m/s).


However, the '''[[w:drift_velocity|drift velocity]]''' of electrons in metals is quite slow, on the order of 0.0001 m/s, or .01 cm/s.  You can easily outrun an electron drifting in a metal, even if you have been drinking all night and have been personally reduced to a very slow crawl.

[[file:escattering.png|300px|left]]In order to understand the great disparity between the Fermi velocity and the drift velocity of electrons in metals, we need to consider a picture for the scattering of electrons, and their acceleration in an electric field, as shown at the left.  If we apply a voltage across a metal (e.g., a metal wire), the electrons are subjected to an electric field '''E''', which is the voltage divided by the length of the wire.  This electric field exerts a force on the electron, causing it to accelerate.  However, the electron is frequently scattered, mostly by [[w:phonon|phonons]] (lattice vibrations).  Each time the electron is scattered its acceleration starts all over again.  The time between scattering events is '''τ''' and the distance the electrons travel between scattering events is the '''mean free path''', '''λ'''. (Note that this is NOT the same λ as the de Broglie wavelength, they just unfortunately have the same symbol!)



We can write the force on the electron as:

:'''F = eE = m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;a = m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;drift&lt;/sub&gt;/τ'''
[[file:beavermeanfreepath.png|250px|right]]
In this equation, '''a''' is the acceleration in the electric field, '''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the mass, and v&lt;sub&gt;drift&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''[[w:drift_velocity|drift velocity]]''' of the electron.


Experimentally, the mean free path is typically obtained by measuring the scattering time.  For an electron in Cu metal at 300 K, the scattering time τ is about 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; s.  From this we can calculate the mean free path as:

:'''λ = v&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;τ ≈ v&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;τ''' = (1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m/s)(2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; s) = '''40 nm'''

'''The mean free path (40 nm = 400 Å) is quite long compared to the interatomic spacing (2 Å).'''  To put it in perspective, if the interatomic spacing was scaled to the length of a football (0.3 m), the mean free path would be over half the length of the football field (60 m).  Thus an electron travels a fairly long way between scattering events and scarcely notices the atomic structure of the metal in which it is traveling.

To summarize, electrons are traveling in metals at the Fermi velocity v&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, which is very large (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m/s), but the flux of electrons is the same in all directions.  That is, they are going nowhere fast.  In an electric field, a very small but directional drift velocity is superimposed on this fast random motion.


An important consequence of this calculation is '''[[w:Ohm's_law|Ohm's Law]]''', V = iR.  From the equations above, we can see that the drift velocity increases linearly with the applied electric field:

:'''v&lt;sub&gt;drift&lt;/sub&gt; = aτ = eEτ/m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'''

The drift velocity is proportional to the current, and the electric field is proportional to the voltage.

The '''[[w:Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity|conductivity]] (σ)''' of a metal is proportional to τ (and λ):

:'''σ = ne&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;τ/m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'''

where '''n''' is the density of electrons (8.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; for Cu) and '''e''' is the electronic charge.  Putting in the numbers and converting to cm units we obtain σ = 7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Ω&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for Cu, in good agreement with the measured value (6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Ω&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;6.6 Atomic orbitals and magnetism==
[[file:metal heats of vaporization.png|left|330px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;          There are two main types of periodic trends that are observed relating to orbital size. As one moves across the periodic table ( Sc - Ti - V - Cr - Fe ), orbitals contract, increasing the nuclear charge of the ions. When moving down the periodic table ( V - Nb - Ta ), orbitals expand, increasing the principal quantum number. Other key trends involving 3d, 4d, and 5d elements are observed as well. 3d elements are small because of their contracted orbitals. The contracted orbitals effect the ability for the electrons to bond, as one moves past V and across the periodic table, 3d electrons become much less effective in bonding because they are contracted. Also, 4d and 5d elements are similar to each other in size and have similar chemical properties. Poor overlap of 3d orbitals gives narrow d-bands. Good overlap of 4s, 4p orbitals gives a wide s,p band.
[[File:Orbitals of Cr and W.png|framed|right|Orbital diagrams of Cr and W]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Magnetism, like heat of vaporization, is also related to orbitals and bonding.  Materials can be diamagnetic, paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic.  If a material has no unpaired electrons, it will be diamagnetic, and if it has one or more unpaired electron it can be characterized by any of the other four types of magnetic conditions.  When a material is diamagnetic, it is repelled by magnetic fields.  A material that is diamagnetic will not have its own magnetic field.  This is because all electrons are paired.  In order for a material to have a magnetic field or magnetic susceptibility, it needs to have unpaired electrons.  Magnetic fields are generated by electron spins.  When electrons are paired, their spins cancel, cancelling their induced magnetic fields.  

Using orbitals and bonding, the strength of the magnetic properties of a material can be predicted by determining the number of unpaired electrons.  The magnetic moment of the atom, μ, can be calculated in terms of the Bohr magneton, μ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;.  μ and μ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; are related by the number of unpaired electrons in the atom:  μ=2√(S(S+1))μ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; where S=n/2 and n is the number of unpaired electrons.  The stronger the magnetic moment per atom, the stronger the magnetic properties of the material.  

The magnetic properties of the material also depend on the alignment of orbitals in the structure of the material.  The way bonds form and align in metals, alloys, and various magnetic crystalline compounds can determine whether the compound will be ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, or antiferromagnetic.  For example, in magnetite, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the oxygen between iron causes the 3d orbitals of iron atoms to be opposite its nearest iron neighbor.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;6.7 Ferro-, ferri- and antiferromagnetism==
[[File:Types of Magnetism.jpg|thumb|A rough description of Ferrimagnetism, Ferromagnetism, Antiferromagnetism, and Paramagnetism]]

The magnetism of metals and other materials are determined by the orbital and spin motions of the electrons and the way in which electrons line up to one another and interact. Whether a material exhibits magnetism or not, it is affected by the interaction of atomic magnetic moments or in some cases, the lack of.  Ferromagnetism, anti-ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism, in each of these cases, long-range magnetic order takes places below a critical temperature, the Curie temperature.  Magnetic coupling is observed in systems that have two or more metal atoms bridged by ligands. These types of ordering are primarily seen among 3d and 4f elements and their compounds. 
[[File:CHEM 310 magnetism diagram (Updated graphic).png|thumb|600px|Unpaired electrons vs transition metal or compound]]

'''Ferromagnetic''' materials exhibit parallel alignment of spins, which produces a large magnetization in both the presence and absence of a magnetic field. These types of materials possess a magnetic susceptibility value that is greater than zero.  '''Magnetic susceptibility''' (X) is defined by how easy it is to align electron spins with the applied magnetic field. The value of magnetic susceptibility is magnetization (M) divided by applied magnetic field (H). The value is typically given in molar units in a cgs system. Elements iron, nickel and cobalt and many of their alloys are typical ferromagnet materials. 

'''Antiferromagnetic''' materials exhibit spin alignment that is completely opposite of what was seen with ferromagnetism. In antiferromagnets, neighboring spins are locked in an anti-parallel alignment. The antiparallel formation results in the cancellation of magnetic spins and moments, hence producing a low magnetic moment and magnetic susceptibility, with the trend moving towards zero. The characteristic temperature associated with antiferromagnetism is called the Néel temperature. Below this temperature there is antoferromagnetic ordering, above the temperature this type of ordering is not seen. Many d-metal oxides exhibit this magnetic behavior because of the superexchange occurring with oxygen; examples include FeO and MnO. Superexchange is seen in electrons’ having come from the same donor atom and are being coupled with the receiving ions’ spins. 

'''Ferrimagnetism''' is a net magnetic ordering of ions with different individual magnetic moments and is observed below the Curie temperature. These ions can order with opposed spins, but because the individual spin moments are different, there is an incomplete cancellation and the material has a net overall moment. The magnetic susceptibility of ferrimagnets is greater than zero. A good example of ferromagnetic material is magnetite, Fe3O4 . Two of the iron ions are trivalent and one is divalent, hence the trivalent ions align with opposite moments and cancel one another out and a net moment is produced due to the divalent iron ion.

Whether a material is Ferromagnetic, Ferrimagnetic, or Antiferromagnetic, above the Curie temperature, it will be '''Paramagnetic'''.  A Paramagnetic material has a small positive magnetic susceptibility, and is weakly attracted to magnetic fields.  Paramagnetic materials will align with magnetic fields, but will not retain any magnetic properties once the external magnetic field is removed.  This is because in the Paramagnetic state, thermal motion constantly randomizes and disorders the orientation of magnetic domains.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;6.8 Hard and soft magnets==
[[File:Hard vs Soft Magnets.jpg|thumb|400px|A graphical representation of how remnant magnetization, saturation magnetization, and coercive field relate to magnetic materials characterized as being hard and soft.]]
Whether a material is a '''hard magnet''' or a '''soft magnet''' depends on the ability of the material's magnetic domains to retain magnetic alignment when no field is present.  This ability is characterized by the constant '''Br''', or remnant magnetization at zero applied field.  If a material has a large remnant magnetization, it is characterized as a hard magnet, and if a material has a small remnant magnetization, it is characterized as a soft magnet.  

Typically only Ferromagnetic and Ferrimagnetic materials are capable of having remnant magnetization when no field is present.  However, these materials are usually found or produced with their magnetic domains pointed in randomized directions, with their net dipoles cancelling.  To achieve a remnant magnetization, these domains need to be aligned.  This can be done with an applied magnetic field.  The field required to align the magnetic domains in a material is known as the '''coercive field''', '''Hc'''.  Also, if a remnant magnetization is already present, Hc represents the field needed to bring the net magnetization to zero.  

Saturation magnetization, '''Bsat''' represents the maximum magnetic field that can be present in a material.  This field is stronger than Br, the remnant magnetization of the material, but unlike Br, Bsat is only present when a strong enough field is applied in alignment with the magnetic field of the material.

Materials characterized as '''hard magnets''' have large remnant magnetization, Br.  A large coercive field Hc is required to bring B of a hard magnet to zero.  

Materials characterized as '''soft magnets''' have small remnant magnetization, Br, and a smaller coercive field Hc is required to bring B of a soft magnet to zero.  Soft magnets also typically have a larger saturation magnetization, Bsat.  

Some materials can exist as either hard or soft magnets.  Iron, for example can exist as both hard and soft magnet.  In the case of iron whether it is a hard or soft magnet depends on the crystal grain size.  When crystal grains in iron are smaller, the magnetic domains are pinned.  When the magnetic domains are pinned a stronger coercive magnetic field needs to be applied to cause them to align.  Also a larger remnant magnetism is present as a result of domains being pinned.  When iron is annealed crystal grains grow and become more free to align with applied magnetic fields.  This decreases the coercive field required to align magnetic domains.  This also reduces the remnant magnetism when no applied field is present, as domains are more free to lose alignment when the magnetic field is removed.  Also as a result of the magnetic domains being more free to more, the saturated magnetization increases.

*Draw the hcp unit cell in sections and show how you would calculate (a) the number of atoms in the unit cell and (b) the fraction of space filled by equal spheres.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;6.10 Problems==
1.	C-centered Bravais lattices exist in the monoclinic and orthorhombic systems but not in the tetragonal system.  That is because the C-centered tetragonal lattice is equivalent to one of the other Bravais lattices.  Which one is it? Show with a drawing how that lattice is related to the C-centered tetragonal lattice.  How many atoms are in the unit cell of that lattice?


2.  Which of the following sequences of close packed layers fills space most efficiently? Explain your answer.

(a) ABACCABA...

(b) ABABAB... 

(c) AABBAABB... 

(d) ABACABAC...


3.	Calculate the fraction of space that is occupied by packing spheres in the (a) simple cubic, (b) body-centered cubic structure, (c) face-centered cubic (cubic close packed) structures. Assume that nearest neighbor spheres are in contact with each other.
[[File:HCP crystal structure.svg|100px|right]]


4.  The hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure is shown at the right.  If the radius of the spheres is R, what is the vertical distance between layers in units of R? What fraction of space is filled by the spheres in the hcp lattice?


5.	Consider a one-dimensional chain of sodium atoms that contains N atoms, where N is a large number.  The distance between atoms in the chain is the lattice constant '''a'''.  In the highest occupied molecular orbital of the chain, what is the distance between nodes (in units of '''a''')? 


6. Starting from the left side of the periodic table, the melting and boiling points of the elements first increase, and then decrease. For example, the order of boiling points is Rb &lt; Sr &lt; Y &lt; Zr &lt; Nb &lt; Mo &gt; Tc ≈ Ru &gt; Rh &gt; Pd &gt; Ag. Briefly explain the reason for this trend.


7.  Going across the periodic table from left to right starting from potassium, the bonding energies and heats of vaporization increase in the order K &lt; Ca &lt; Sc &lt; Ti &lt; V, but then decrease going from V to Mn (V &gt; Cr &gt; Mn).  The heats of vaporization of V, Cr, and Mn are much less than those of Nb, Mo, and Tc, respectively.  Explain these trends.


8.	Some alloys of early and late transition metals (e.g., ZrPt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) have much higher enthalpies of vaporization (per metal atom) than either pure metal. Why are such alloys unusually stable, relative to the pure metals?


9.	Graphite is a semimetal composed of sheets of fused benzene rings. There are no bonds between sheets, only van der Waals interactions. What is the C-C bond order in graphite? Show why the C-C distance (1.42 Å) is different from that of benzene (1.40 Å).


10.	Fe, Co, and Ni are ferromagnetic, whereas Ru, Ir, and Pt are diamagnetic. Explain why magnetic metals are found only among the 3d and 4f elements. Why are Sc and Ti, which are also 3d elements, diamagnetic?


11.   The Curie temperature of cobalt is 1127•C, which is higher than that of Fe (770•C) or Ni (358•C). Why does Co have the highest Curie temperature?


12.	Iron metal comes in magnetically “soft” and “hard” forms.  Briefly explain the structural differences between them and draw magnetic hysteresis curves for each, indicating on your curves the coercive field and the remanent magnetization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 7:  Metals and Alloys: Mechanical Properties'''&lt;/big&gt;==

How much do the mechanical properties of metals and alloys vary with processing? The answer is, a great deal. Consider the following hypothetical situation: Upon graduation, you go to work as an engineer for Boeing. Your job is to work with aluminum companies to help them produce high strength alloys. Why? A large jet airplane weighs a total of 500 tons. Of that total, 50 tons is cargo, 150 tons is the plane structure, and the remainder is fuel. If you can triple the strength of the materials in the structure (aluminum), you can reduce the mass of the structure to 50 tons and increase the cargo to 150 tons. Look at what has been done already:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Material !! Tensile strength yield (psi)
|-
| pure (99.45%) annealed Al || 4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| pure (99.45%) cold drawn Al || 24 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Al alloy - precipitated, hardened || 50 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

By chemical and physical manipulation we have already increased the yield strength 12 times over annealed Al. Yet the yield strength of a &quot;perfect&quot; single crystal of pure Al is ca. 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; psi. We still have 3 orders of magnitude to go. This just shows that there will still be plenty to do on this project between now and graduation!

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;7.1 Defects in metallic crystals==
[[File:defects in metals.jpg|thumb|left|300px|]][[Image:Crystallite.jpg|thumb|Grain boundaries in a polycrystalline material]]
Non-directional bonding has an important impact on the mechanical properties of metals. Because there is no strong preference for one atomic position over another, the structure is not greatly impaired by the vacancy of a single atom or the dislocation of a group of atoms. These &quot;mistakes&quot; in packing of metal atoms within crystals are called '''defects'''. The deformability of metals is the direct result of defects in the crystal structure. Defects in materials like Al and Fe are responsible for the three orders of magnitude difference between the yield stress of annealed polycrystalline samples (i.e., normal articles of commerce) and perfect single crystals.

There are several different kinds of defects that can be found in metallic crystals. One kind is called a '''vacancy''', i.e., a place where an atom is missing in the structure. A [[w: dislocation|'''dislocation''']], on the other hand, is a line defect; it runs somewhat like a string through the crystal. A dislocation is the result of one atom or group of atoms being pulled slightly out of position with respect to perfect crystal packing. A third kind of defect is called a [[w: grain_boundary|'''grain boundary''']]; it is a two-dimensional interface between two different crystal grains in a solid sample. Since the two crystallites have in general different orientation, the structures do not match up exactly at the interface.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;7.2 Work hardening, alloying, and annealing==

One of the questions we would like to ask is, why are the yield stresses of normal (polycrystalline) metal samples so much lower (by a factor of 1000) than they are in perfect single crystals? The answer has to do with the motion of dislocations. Consider the picture below, which shows planes of metal atoms near a dislocation (the individual atoms are numbered to help you see which bonds are broken and which are formed). The arrows indicate force applied under shear stress. Notice how the dislocation moves by breaking/making metal-metal bonds.
[[File:dislocation shear.jpg|thumb|left|400px|]]


The key point here is that we can induce plastic deformation (shear) by breaking only one line of metal-metal bonds at a time along the dislocation line. This involves far less force than breaking an entire plane of bonds, as we would need to do to shear a perfect crystal. In a given polycrystalline sample, there are many dislocation lines that run perpendicular to all possible shear directions, so their motion can be used to &quot;tear&quot; the metal apart. Turbine rotors on large jets are made of very expensive '''single crystal''' nickel-titanium alloys, so that these shearing deformations can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;P. Caron and T. Khan (1999), Evolution of Ni-based superalloys for single crystal gas turbine blade applications, Aerospace Science and Technology, 3, 513–523. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1270-9638(99)00108-X&lt;/ref&gt;


We can see that motion of dislocations is basically bad news if we want a metal to be strong and hard (e.g., if we want a structural material, or a knife that can hold a decent edge). There are several ways we can overcome (to some extent) this problem:

1. Use '''single crystals''' and anneal out all the dislocations (expensive - especially with large items like turbine blades, and impossible with very large items like airplane wings or bridges).

2. '''Work hardening''' of the metal - this moves all dislocations to grain boundaries (the dislocation essentially becomes part of the grain boundary). Since a grain boundary is a planar defect, it is much less responsive to stress than a line defect.

3. Introduce '''impurity atoms''' (that is alloying elements) or impurity phases that &quot;pin&quot; the motion of defects. An impurity atom stops the motion because it is a different size, or makes stronger bonds, than the other metal atoms; the line defect has a hard time moving away from rows of such atoms. An impurity phase (like Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C in iron) makes extra grain boundaries that can stop the motion of defects. This effect is analogous to the graphite fibers in fiber-reinforced cross-linked polymers (used, e.g., in tennis rackets) that stop the propagation of cracks.



A simple illustration of work hardening can be done with a piece of copper wire. When struck many times with a hammer, the copper wire became stiffer, and it is possible to hang a weight from it. Dislocations move to the crystal grain boundaries during work hardening, effectively halting their motion and at the same time making the individual crystal grains smaller. Because the crystal grains are now smaller, the amount of grain boundary area has increased, and with it the free energy of the material.  Annealing reverses the process by lowering the free energy.  When the wire is annealed in a flame (heated so that atoms can move and rearrange), the crystal grains grow, and the dislocations reappear. The copper again becomes ductile, and bends easily. Cold-working (work hardening) of metals is important for strengthening structural materials (e.g., iron beams) and for making brittle, hard edges (this is why blacksmiths hammer on knives and swords when they are making them. If you have ever watched them, they do the same thing to horseshoes, when they cool down, to make them stiff).

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;7.3 Malleability of metals and alloys==
[[File:slipplanes.jpg|thumb|left|450px|]][[File:Bronze_age_weapons_Romania.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Bronze age weapons from Romania]]Metals with close-packed structures (hcp and ccp) such as copper, gold, silver, zinc, magnesium, etc. are in general more malleable than those with the bcc structure (tungsten, vanadium, chromium, etc.). Why? In the close-packed structure, there is relatively little corrugation between sheets of metal atoms. This means that these planes can slip past each other relatively easily. In the bcc structure, there are no close-packed planes, and much greater corrugation between atoms at different levels. This makes it much harder for one row to slide past another.

This effect explains the hardness of alloys like brass (CuZn, which has a bcc structure), which are made by combining two soft metals (Cu and Zn, which are respectively ccp and hcp as pure metals, are both soft and ductile).  Bronzes - originally made as alloys of copper and arsenic, but later as alloys of copper and tin - are harder than either of the constituent metals for the same reason. In the Bronze Age, possession of these harder alloys provided a tactical advantage in warfare (see image at right), that was later supplanted when the technology for smelting iron was developed.

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;7.4 Iron and steel==
[[Image:Brosen ironcarbon.svg|thumb|250px|left|The iron–iron carbide (Fe–Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C) phase diagram. The percent carbon determines the type of the ferrous alloy: iron, steel or cast iron]][[File:Mendel II 072 r.jpg|thumb|200px|Blacksmith, 1606]]
One other place where the difference between the hardness of a bcc and a close-packed metal is important is in steelmaking. Between room temperature and 900&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, iron has the bcc structure, and is a tough, hard metal (&quot;tough as nails&quot;). Above 900&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, pure iron switches over to the ccp (austenite) structure, which is much more ductile. So hot iron can be bent and worked into a variety of shapes when it is very hot but still solid (it melts at 1535&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C). Rapid quenching of hot iron - e.g., when the blacksmith plunges a red hot piece directly into cold water - cools it to room temperature, but doesn't allow time for the ccp --&gt; bcc phase transition; therefore, such pieces are still relatively malleable and can be shaped. 

Carbon is added (about 1% by weight) to iron to make &quot;carbon steel&quot;, which is a very hard material. Carbon is rather soluble in the ccp phase of iron, but not in the bcc phase. Therefore, when the ductile ccp phase cools and turns into bcc (&quot;tempering&quot; the steel, which means cooling it slowly enough so the ccp to bcc transformation can occur), the iron can no longer dissolve the excess carbon. The carbon forms grains of an extra phase, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C (&quot;cementite&quot; - a very hard material) which are dotted throughout the matrix of bcc iron grains. The effect of all these little grains of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C is to stop the motion of dislocations, making for a very hard, brittle material. This is why knives and swords are quenched, cold worked into the appropriate shapes, heated up again and tempered (before they are sharpened) when they are made.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160;7.5 Amorphous alloys==
[[w:amorphous metal|Amorphous metals]], also called bulk metallic glasses, are materials of growing technological importance.  Because their glassy structures do not support the movement of dislocations, they are stronger and more wear-resistant than crystalline metals of similar composition.

All pure metals and most simple alloys crystallize easily.  Bulk samples of metals prepared by ordinary chemical or electrochemical methods are '''polycrystalline''', with grain sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to tens of microns in size.  Larger crystals of metals can be made by very slow crystal growth, e.g., by the [[w:Czochralski_process|Czochralski process]].  In contrast, glassy or amorphous metals can be prepared by very rapid cooling from the melt.  With pure metals and simple alloys the cooling rate needed is so fast - on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K/s - that amorphous samples can only be made as very thin films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TMAG.1976.1059201|author=Libermann H. and Graham C.|title=Production Of Amorphous Alloy Ribbons And Effects Of Apparatus Parameters On Ribbon Dimensions|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|issue=6|year=1976|page=921|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?isnumber=22822&amp;arnumber=1059201&amp;count=158&amp;index=111|volume=12|bibcode=1976ITM....12..921L}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[file:polycrystalline vs liquid.png|300px|left]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alloys of metals with more complex stoichiometries can be made in amorphous form by slower cooling from the melt. These alloys have been prepared and studied since the 1960s, and since the 1990s amorphous alloys have been discovered that can be prepared in bulk form at cooling rates on the order of 1 deg/s, similar to the cooling rates of other kinds of glasses.

Currently amorphous metals (marketed under the tradenames Vitreloy and [[w:liquidmetal|Liquidmetal]]) are used commercially in golf clubs, watches, USB flash drives, and other applications where very high elasticity, yield strength, and/or wear resistance are needed.

1.   Show in a drawing how a planar dislocation moves through a solid under stress.


2.  Why is a metal sample that has been annealed more malleable than one that has been work hardened? Explain which state of the metal has smaller crystal grains and why.


3.  Explain (on the basis of structure) why alloys such as bronze make better structural materials than the constituent metals (copper and tin).  How did the discovery of these alloys change civilization?


4.	    A layer sequence for an FCC = CCP metal is shown below.  A body diagonal passes through the centers of atoms numbered 1 and 12.  A close-packed plane perpendicular to this diagonal contains the centers of atoms numbered 3, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 8:  Ionic and Covalent Solids - Structures'''&lt;/big&gt;==
There are a large number of potential structures that an ionic or covalent compound can take. These structures are often more complicated than the basic structures of simple cubic, body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, or hexagonal-close packed. Examples of other structures include NaCl, CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, fluorite, perovskite, rutile, and spinel. Some structures can also be layered with sections missing if they are more covalent compounds. Furthermore, certain structures are frequently adopted by magnetic compounds. In other words, the structure of a compound can be simple or complex and it plays a large role in the properties of a compound. Here are some examples of simple close packed and non-close packed lattices (face centered cubic, or cubic close packed, and hexagonal close packed are the close packed structures listed):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;gallery mode=&quot;packed&quot; heights=&quot;150&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==&amp;#160; 8.1 Close-packing and interstitial sites==
[[File:Sites interstitiels cubique a faces centrees.svg|left|180px|thumb|One octahedral and one tetrahedral site in a face-centered cubic unit cell.  Each cell contains four packing atoms (gray), four octahedral sites (pink), and eight tetrahedral sites (blue).]]Many common inorganic crystals have structures related to the hexagonal close packed, and the face centered cubic lattices. The crystals naturally contain two types of holes that the interstitial atoms fill, these holes are known as either '''tetrahedral''' or '''octahedral'''. The two types can be differentiated based on the number of packing atoms that the interstitial atoms are coordinated to. An interstitial atom filling a tetrahedral hole will be coordinated to four packing atoms, while an atom filling an octahedral hole will be coordinated to six packing atoms. For either the hexagonal close packed or the face-centered cubic lattice, there is one octahedral hole and two tetrahedral holes per packing atom. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Question:''' Would anions or cations be better as packing atoms? &lt;br/&gt;
We may suspect the anions would be better than the cations because of their larger size, but let us examine the NaCl cell to be sure. [[File:NaCl polyhedra.png|thumbnail|Structure of NaCl unit cell]] The NaCl unit cell can be seen on the right, here the green spheres are the Cl&lt;sup&gt;1-&lt;/sup&gt;, and the gray spheres are the Na&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;. The octahedral holes in a typical  face-centered cubic lattice can be found at (1/2 1/2 1/2), (1/2 0 0), (0 1/2 0), and (0 0 1/2). There are four of these holes per cell, and they are filled by the chlorine ions. The packing atoms (Na&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; have similar coordinates, they are (0 0 0), (0 1/2 1/2), (1/2 1/2 0), and (1/2 0 1/2). NaCl is interesting in that it is a three-dimensional checkerboard, there are no &quot;NaCl&quot; molecules that exist in the structure. Rather, the Na&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; and the Cl&lt;sup&gt;1-&lt;/sup&gt; ions form two individual face-centered cubic lattices offset by a translation of  (1/2 0 0) that are then super-imposed. Since each atom forms a face-centered cubic lattice, there are four Na and four Cl atoms per NaCl unit cell. It is because of this ratio that NaCl has a 1:1 stoichiometry. The shaded green and gray bipyramidal structures in the NaCl lattice show that the Na&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are coordinated to six Cl&lt;sup&gt;1-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and vice versa. In terms of the overall packing of the structure, it can be written as AcBaCbAcBa... Where the uppercase letters are the packing atoms, and the lower case letters are the interstitial atoms. The layered packing is illustrated below: &lt;br/&gt;
* ------------ A
* - - -c- - - -
* ------------ B
* - - -a- - - -
* ------------ C
* - - -b- - - -
'''Note:''' While most structures have fixed packing and interstitial atoms, the packing vs. interstitial differentiation is arbitrary in NaCl.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The NaCl structure is fairly common among ionic compounds: &lt;br/&gt;
* Alkali Halides (except CsCl, CsBr, and CsI)
* Transition Metal Monoxides (TiO, VO,..., NiO)
* Alkali Earth Oxides and Sulfides (MgO, CaO, BaS... except BeO and MgTe)
* Carbides and Infrides (TiC, TiN, ZrC, NbC)
** these are very stable refractory, interstitial alloys (metallic)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

==&amp;#160;8.2 Structures related to NaCl and NiAs==
There are a few compounds that are similar to the Nacl structure, but have a lower symmetry than the typical NaCl structure. These compounds include:
[[File:Calcite.GIF|thumbnail|Calcite Structure]]
* FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (pyrite, &quot;fools gold&quot;): S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup2-&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
*CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (a salt-like carbide): Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;
* CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (calcite, limestone, marble): triangular CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
The calcite structure is shown at the right. The triangular CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; is visible in between the blue (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) spheres. From this image it is somewhat easier to see why the CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a lower symmetry than the NaCl structure. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the previous section, NaCl's structure was discussed in detail. NaCl has a face-centered cubic lattice with all of the octahedral holes filled. What if we start with a hexagonal-close packed lattice rather than a face-centered cubic lattice?&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Nickel-arsenide-3D-unit-cell.png|left|thumbnail|Nickel Arsenide Unit Cell]]
In terms of layers, we get AcBcAcBc... This structure is known as '''NiAs''', and the cations are in purple while the anions are in blue. In this case, all of the &quot;c&quot; sites are occupied by the cations and are eclipsing each other. The cations are in the octahedral position, each cation is coordinated to six anions. The anions are also coordinated to six cations, but they occupy the trigonal prismatic site. It is often helpful to think of unit cells in terms of sections which can be imagined by observing the unit cell pictured to the left. &lt;br/&gt;
The NiAs structure cannot be adopted by ionic compounds because of the eclipsing cations, because the cation-cation repulsions would be internally destabilizing for an ionic compound. This structure is mainly adopted by covalent and polar covalent MX compounds. For example: MS, MSe, MTe (M=Ti, V, Fe, Co, Ni). Often these are nonstoichiometric or complex stoichiometries with ordered vacancies (Cr&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;).

==&amp;#160;8.3 Tetrahedral structures==

   [[File:CaF2 polyhedra.png|250px|thumb|left|The fluorite (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) crystal structure]]In ccp and hcp lattices, there are two tetrahedral holes per packing atom. A stoichiometry of either M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X or MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives a structure that fills all tetrahedral sites, while an MX structure fills only half of the sites. An example of an MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure is fluorite, CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whose structure is shown in the figure to the left. The packing atom in fluorite is Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the structure is composed of three interpenetrating fcc lattices. It should be noted that the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion as a packing atom is strange because F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is larger and would seem to be the better packing ion as a result. The fluorite structure is common for ionic MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X compounds and the hexagonal version of the structure is quite rare and less favorable. &lt;br /&gt;
In terms of geometry, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is in a cubic geometry and F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is in a tetrahedron. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is coordinated by eight F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is coordinated by four Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to give the MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stoichiometry. The three fcc lattices have Ca at 0,0,0 , 1/2,1/2,0 , etc....F at 1/4,1/4,1/4 , 3/4,3/4,1/4 , etc... and F at 3/4,3/4,3/4 , 1/4,1/4/3/4 , etc. Looking more closely at tetrahedral sites, there are two types:T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;. If the tetrahedral is oriented and pointing upwards, the site is T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;. Likewise, a tetrahedral whose point (bottom of the tetrahedral) is oriented downward is T&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;. The alternation of T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt; sites in a lattice such as CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows for greater packing in the structure. The packing structure of fluorite is AT&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;BT&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;C when including only the uppercase packing ions. A more complete picture of the structure layers is:

[[File:Animation of zincblende unit crystal cell.gif|200px|left|thumb|Animation of the zincblende unit cell]]&lt;br /&gt;
As stated, compounds with a stoichiometry of MX only fill half of the tetrahedral sites (either the T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; or T&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt; sites). Such compounds are very common and the zinc blende and wurtzite structures are two examples. Both structures are favored by p-block compounds that follow the octet rule and are usually semiconductors or insulators. The zinc blende structure, shown to the left, is a ccp close packed lattice. Examples of compounds with the zinc blende structure include CuCl, CuI, ZnSe, HgS, BeS, CdTe, AlP, GaP, SnSb, CSi, and diamond. Additionally, the compound CuInSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is zinc blende in an ordered, doubled unit cell and is used for solar cell research. Using ZnS as a representative of zinc blende, the coordination of both Zn and S is tetrahedral. The structure layers, which are AbBc, form the &quot;chair&quot; version of cyclohexane. The chair conformation allows for a relatively large distance between positive and negative charges and, as a result, zinc blende is slightly more covalent than wurtzite. A layered structure of zinc blende filling in the T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; sites is shown as AbBcBaA and is illustrated below:
[[File:Chair zincblende.jpg|thumb|Chair zincblende]]&lt;br /&gt;

* - - -a- - - T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;
* ------------ A
&lt;big&gt;[[File:Boat wurzite.jpg|thumb|The boat conformation appearing in wurtzite.]]&lt;/big&gt;
Following zinc blende, wurtzite is an MX structure in the hcp form. In terms of the discussed cyclohexane formed from the layers, wurtzite is the &quot;boat&quot; conformation. As a result, the two ends are pointed up and closer together, which is why wurtzite is more ionic than zincblende. As with zincblende, both ion species are in a tetrahedral geometry in a 4:4 ratio and there are typically eight electrons in the compound. Examples of compounds with this structure include: BeO, ZnO, MnS, CdSe, MgTe, AlN, and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F. The layered structure of wurtzite is AbBaAbB because of its hcp form and the layering with T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; sites filled is illustrated below:
* ------------ A
* - - -b- - - T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;
* ------------ B
* - - -a- - - T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;
* ------------ A
* - - -b- - - T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;
* ------------ B
&lt;br /&gt;
Some compounds are dimorphic and can have either the zinc blende or wurtzite structure. Several examples of these compounds that have intermediate polarities include CdS, ZnS, and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The zinc blende and wurtzite structures have good packing arrangements and are commonly found in networks with tetrahedral coordinations. Water, for example, has a tetrahedral H-bonding network and is wurtzite-type. Although wurtzite and zinc blende structures often have eight electrons, nine or ten electron compounds such as GaSe and GaAs are seen as distorted wurtzite. In GaSe, extra electrons form lone pairs and this event creates layers in the structure, as can be seen in the diagram. To the right of GaSe, the diagram of As, Sb, and SbAs shows an ever further breakdown of layers.  
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hexagonal ice is the form usually taken by ice upon freezing and is a hcp wurtzite-type structure. Looking at the structure shown to the right, we see that there are irregular arrangements of the O-H---O bonds. In the structure, van der waals forces and H-bonds are present to result in a non-covalent structure that's more favored by wurtzite than by zinc blende. Since hexagonal ice is hcp and not ccp, the layered structure is ABABAB.

==&amp;#160;8.4 Layered structures and intercalation reactions==
'''Layered structures''' can form when some fraction of the octahedral and/or tetrahedral sites are filled in the fcc and hcp lattices.  For example, the CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure is formed by filling all the octahedral sites in alternate layers of the fcc lattice, and the CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure is the relative of this structure in the hcp lattice.
[[File:CdCl2 and CdI2.png|400px|left|thumb|Comparison of the CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (left) and CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) crystal structures]][[File:Cadmium-iodide-3D-octahedra.png|250px|thumb|Polyhedral drawing of one layer of the CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure showing edge-sharing MX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra.]]

In the '''CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure''', the stacking sequence of anion layers is ABCABC... &lt;br /&gt; 
In the '''CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure''', the anion stacking sequence is ABAB..., and all the cations are eclipsed along the stacking axis.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are examples of '''6-3 structures''', because the cations are coordinated by an octahedron of six anions, and the anions are coordinated by three cations to make a trigonal pyramid (like NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  Another way to describe these structures is to say that the MX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra each share six edges in the MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheets.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because these structures place the packing atoms (the anions) in direct van der Waals contact, they are most stable for relatively '''covalent''' compounds.  Otherwise, the electrostatic repulsion between contacting anions would destabilize the structure energetically.  More ionic MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds tend to adopt the fluorite (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or rutile (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) structures, which are not layered.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite the fact that these two structure types are the same at the level of nearest and next-nearest neighbor ions, the CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure is much more common than the CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure.

'''CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure:'''  
:MCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd)
:NiBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NiI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

'''CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure:'''  
:MCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Ti, V)
:MBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Mg, Fe, Co, Cd)
:MI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Mg, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Cd, Ge, Pb, Th)
:M(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cd)
:MS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Ti, Zr, Sn, Ta, Pt)
:MSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Ti, Zr, Sn, V, Pt)
:MTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Ti, Co, Ni, Rh, Pd, Pt)
&lt;br /&gt;
Physically, layered compounds are '''soft''' and '''slippery''', because the layer planes slide past each other easily.  For example, graphite,  MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and talc (a silicate) are layered compounds that are used widely as '''lubricants''' and lubricant additives.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An important reaction of layered compounds is '''intercalation'''.  In intercalation reactions, guest molecules and ions enter the galleries that separate the sheets, usually with expansion of the lattice along the stacking axis.  This reaction is typically reversible if it does not perturb the bonding within the sheets.  Often the '''driving force for intercalation is a redox reaction''', i.e., electron transfer between the host and guest.  For example, lithium metal reacts with TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and graphite to produce LiTiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Li&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (x &lt; 1), and LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.  In these compounds, lithium is ionized to Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the sheets are negatively charged. Oxidizing agents such as Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and AsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; also react with graphite.  In the resulting intercalation compounds, the sheets are positively charged and the intercalated species are anionic.

[[file:intercalation schematic.png|left|500px|thumb|Oxidative or reductive intercalation involves the placement of anions or cations between sheets.]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Intercalation reactions are especially important for electrochemical energy storage in '''secondary batteries''', such as [[w:Lithium-ion_batteries|'''lithium ion''' batteries]], [[w:Nickel-metal_hydride_battery|'''nickel-metal hydride''' batteries]], and [[w:Nickel-cadmium_battery|'''nickel-cadmium''' batteries]].  The reversible nature of the intercalation reaction allows the electrodes to be charged and discharged up to several thousand times without losing their mechanical integrity.  In lithium ion batteries, the negative electrode material is typically graphite, which is intercalated by lithium to make LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.  Several different oxides and phosphates containing redox active transition metal ions (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) are used as the positive electrode materials.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Lithium ion batteries based on CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were first described in 1980&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; by [[w:John B. Goodenough|John B. Goodenough]]'s research group at Oxford.  In batteries based on CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure, the positive electrode half-reaction is:

:&lt;math&gt;{LiCoO_2}\leftrightarrows\mathrm{Li}_{1-x}\mathrm{CoO_2}+x\mathrm{Li^+}+x\mathrm{e^-}&lt;/math&gt;

The negative electrode half reaction is:
:&lt;math&gt;x\mathrm{Li^+} + x\mathrm{e^-} + x\mathrm{C_6} \leftrightarrows\ x\mathrm{LiC_6}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The battery is fully charged when the positive electrode is in the CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; form and the negative electrode is in the LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; form.  Discharge involves the motion of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions through the electrolyte, forming Li&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and graphite at the two electrodes.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lithium ion battery is a &quot;rocking chair&quot; battery, so named because charging and discharging involve moving Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions from one side to the other.  CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is one example of a positive electrode material that has been used in lithium ion batteries.  It has a high energy density, but batteries based on CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have poor thermal stability.  Safer materials include lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and LiMO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = a mixture of Co, Mn, and Ni).  These batteries are used widely in laptop computers, portable electronics, cellular telephones, cordless tools, and electric and hybrid vehicles.

A similar intercalation reaction occurs in nickel-cadmium batteries and nickel-metal hydride batteries, except in this case the reaction involves the movement of protons in and out of the Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lattice, which has the CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NiO(OH) + H_2O + e^- \rightarrow Ni(OH)_2 + OH^-}&lt;/math&gt;

There are many layered compounds that cannot be intercalated by redox reactions, typically because some other stable product is formed.  For example, the reaction of layered CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Li produces LiI (NaCl structure) and Cd metal.

==&amp;#160;8.5 Bonding in TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and pyrite structures==
Many layered dichalcogenides, such as TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, have the CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure.  In these compounds, as we have noted above, the metal ions are octahedrally coordinated by S.  Interestingly, the structures of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while they are also layered, are different.  In these cases, the metal is surrounded by a '''trigonal prism''' of sulfur atoms. NbS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also have the trigonal prismatic molybdenite structure, which is shown below alongside a platy crystal of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
[[File:Molybdenite.GIF|350px|left]][[File:MoS2chips.jpg|250px]]
&lt;br /&gt;

The coordination of the metal ions by a trigonal prism of chalcogenide ions is '''sterically unfavorable''' relative to octahedral coordination.  There are close contacts between the chalcogenide ions, which are eclipsed in the stacking sequence '''AbA/BcB/AbA/BcB'''... (where &quot;/&quot; indicates the van der Waals gap between layers).  What stabilizes this structure?

The molybdenite structure occurs most commonly in MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds with a '''d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron count'''.  The figure below compares the splitting of d-orbital energies in the octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination environments:

[[File:TiS2-MoS2.png|450px|left|thumb|d-orbital splittings and energy bands in TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a semiconductor with a 1.3 eV gap between its filled and empty bands.]]
The trigonal prismatic structure is stabilized in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by filling the lowest energy band, the d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital which points vertically through the triangular top and bottom faces of the trigonal prism, has the least interaction with the sulfide ligands and therefore the lowest energy.  The d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, which point at the ligands, have the highest energy.  The d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is lower in energy in this structure than the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals are in the octahedral structure of TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PtS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, like TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, adopts the octahedral CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure.  In this case, because Pt&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; has six d-electrons, the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals are filled.  There is a large crystal field stabilization energy (which stabilizes the high oxidation state of Pt) because S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; is a strong field ligand.  Like MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PtS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is semiconducting because there is an energy gap between the filled t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and empty e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; bands.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although early (TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and late (PtS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) transition metal disulfides have layered structures, a number of MS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds in the middle of the transition series, such as MnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and RuS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, have three-dimensionally bonded structures.  For example, FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the '''pyrite structure''', which is related to the NaCl structure.  The reason is that FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not Fe&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but is actually Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), where S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; is the disulfide anion (which contains a single bond like the peroxide anion O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;).  S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; is too strong a reducing agent to exist in the same compound with Fe&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a strong oxidizing agent.  Because FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is actually Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), it is a 1:1 compound and adopts a 1:1 structure.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:INT-WS2_TEM.tif|200px|thumb|Transmission electron microscope image of an individual WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; multi-wall nanotube.]]
Because it has an unfilled t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; band, TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is relatively easy to reduce by intercalation with Li. For this reason, LiTiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was one of the first intercalation compounds studied by [[w:M. Stanley Whittingham|Stanley Whittingham]], who developed the concept of the non-aqueous lithium ion battery in the early 1970's.&lt;ref&gt;M. Stanley Whittingham &quot;Lithium Batteries and Cathode Materials&quot; Chem. Rev., 2004, vol. 104, pp. 4271–4302. DOI: 10.1021/cr020731c&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it has a filled d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; band, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is harder to reduce, but it can be intercalated by reaction with the powerful reducing agent n-butyllithium to make Li&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (x &lt; 1).  Atoms in the van der Waals planes of these compounds are relatively unreactive, which gives MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; its good oxidative stability and enables its application as a high temperature lubricant.  Atoms at the edges of the crystals are however more reactive and in fact are catalytic.  High surface area MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which has a high density of exposed edge planes, is used as a hydrodesulfurization catalyst and is also of increasing interest as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of water to hydrogen.

Layered metal dichalcogenides, including MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, can form closed nanostructures that take the shape of multiwalled onions and multiwalled tubes.  These materials were discovered by the group of [[w:Reshef Tenne|Reshef Tenne]] in 1992, shortly after the discovery of carbon nanotubes.  Since then nanotubes have been synthesized from many other materials, including vanadium and manganese oxides.

==&amp;#160;8.6 Spinel, perovskite, and rutile structures==
There are three more structures, which are derived from close-packed lattices, that are particularly important because of the material properties of their compounds.  These are the '''spinel''' structure, on which ferrites and other magnetic oxides are based, the '''perovskite''' structure, which is adopted by ferroelectric and superconducting oxides, and the '''rutile''' structure, which is a common binary 6:3 structure adopted by oxides and fluorides.
&lt;br /&gt;
[[file:AB2O4 spinel.png|350px|left]]

The '''spinel structure''' is formulated MM'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where M and M' are tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated cations, respectively, and X is an anion (typically O or F).  The structure is named after the mineral MgAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and oxide spinels have the general formula AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. 

In the '''normal spinel''' structure, there is a close-packed array of anions.  The A-site cations fill 1/8 of the tetrahedral holes and the B-site cations fill 1/2 of the octahedral holes.  

'''Inverse spinels''' have a closely related structure (with the same large unit cell) in which the A-site ions and half of the B-site ions switch places.  Inverse spinels are thus formulated B(AB)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where the AB ions in parentheses occupy octahedral sites, and the other B ions are on tetrahedral sites. There are also mixed spinels, which are intermediate between the '''normal''' and '''inverse''' spinel structure.



Some spinel and inverse spinel AB combinations are:
:A&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, e.g., MgAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (normal spinel)
:A&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, e.g., Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = Pb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Pb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Pb&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (inverse spinel)
:A&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, e.g., Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (normal spinel)

Many magnetic oxides, such as Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, are spinels.


'''Normal vs. inverse spinel structure.'''  For transition metal oxide spinels, the choice of the normal vs. inverse spinel structure is driven primarily by the '''crystal field stabilization energy''' (CFSE) of ions in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites.  For spinels that contain 3d elements such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, the electron configuration is typically '''high spin''' because O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; is a '''weak field ligand'''.

As an example, we can consider magnetite, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  This compound contains one Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and two Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions per formula unit, so we could formulate it as a normal spinel, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or as an inverse spinel,  Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  Which one would have the lowest energy?

[[file:d6cfse.png|left|300px|thumb|d-orbital energy diagram for Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

First we consider the crystal field energy of the '''Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;''' ion, which is d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.  Comparing the tetrahedral and high spin octahedral diagrams, we find that the CFSE in an '''octahedral''' field of O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; ions is [(4)(2/5) - (2)(3/5)]Δ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; - P = '''0.4 Δ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; - P'''.  In the '''tetrahedral''' field, the CFSE is [(3)(3/5) - (3)(2/5)]Δ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - P = '''0.6 Δ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - P'''.  Since Δ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is about 2.25 times larger than Δ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, the octahedral arrangement has a larger CFSE and is preferred for Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[file:d5cfse.png|left|300px|thumb|d-orbital energy diagram for Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In contrast, it is easy to show that '''Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;''', which is d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, would have a CFSE of zero in either the octahedral or tetrahedral geometry. This means that Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has a preference for the octahedral site, but Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; has no preference.  Consequently, we place Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on octahedral sites and '''Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is an''' '''inverse spinel''', Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Ferrites''' are compounds of general formula '''M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  We can see that magnetite is one example of a ferrite (with M = Fe).  Other divalent metals (M = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn) also form ferrites.  Ferrites can be normal or inverse spinels, or mixed spinels, depending on the CFSE of the M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion.  Based on their CFSE, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; all have a strong preference for the octahedral site, so those compounds are all inverse spinels.  ZnFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a normal spinel because the small Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion (d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) fits more easily into the tetrahedral site than Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), and both ions have zero CFSE.  MgFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and MnFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, in which all ions have zero CFSE and no site preference, are mixed spinels.  '''Chromite''' spinels, '''M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''', are always '''normal spinels''' because the d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has a strong preference for the octahedral site. 

[[File:MnO-superaustausch.GIF|thumb|Illustration of antiferromagnetic superexchange between two transition metal cations through a shared oxygen atom.]]
'''Magnetism of ferrite spinels'''.  Ferrite spinels are of technological interest because of their magnetic ordering, which can be ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the structure (normal or inverse) and the nature of the metal ions.  Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are all inverse spinels and are ferrimagnets.  The latter two compounds are used in magnetic recording media and as deflection magnets, respectively.

In order to understand the magnetism of ferrites, we need to think about how the unpaired spins of metal ions are coupled in oxides.  If an oxide ion is shared by two metal ions, it can mediate the coupling of spins by [[w:superexchange|superexchange]] as shown at the right.  The coupling can be antiferromagnetic, as shown, or ferromagnetic, depending on the orbital filling and the symmetry of the orbitals involved.  The '''Goodenough-Kanamori rules''' predict the local magnetic ordering (ferromagnetic vs. antiferromagnetic) that results from superexchange coupling of the electron spins of transition metal ions.  For ferrites, the strongest coupling is between ions on neighboring '''tetrahedral and octahedral sites''', and the ordering of spins between these two sites is reliably '''antiferromagnetic'''.  
[[file:Fe3O4ferrimagnetism.png|left|300px]]
&lt;br /&gt;

Because all the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in a spinel or inverse spinel crystal are coupled together identically, it works out that ions on the tetrahedral sites will all have one orientation (e.g., spin down) and ions on all the octahedral sites will have the opposite orientation (e.g., spin up).  If the number of spins on the two sites is the same, then the solid will be antiferromagnetic.  However, if the '''number of spins is unequal''' (as in the case of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) then the solid will be '''ferrimagnetic'''.  This is illustrated at the left for Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  The spins on the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites cancel, because half of them are up and half are down.  However, the four unpaired electrons on the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are all aligned the same way in the crystal, so the compound is ferrimagnetic.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[file:perovskite.jpg|left|250px|thumb|ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite structure.  A, B, and X are white, blue, and red, respectively.]]
'''Perovskites''' are '''ternary oxides''' of general formula '''ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  More generally, the perovskite formula is ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where the anion X can be '''O, N, or F'''.  The A ions are typically large ions such as Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or a lanthanide 3+ ion, and the B ions are smaller transition metal ions such as Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nb&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ru&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.  The mineral after which the structure is named has the formula CaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

The perovskite structure has simple cubic symmetry, but is related to the fcc lattice in the sense that the A site cations and the three O atoms comprise a fcc lattice.  The B-site cations fill 1/4 of the octahedral holes and are surrounded by six oxide anions.

[[File:ReO3.png|350px|right|thumb|Polyhedral representation of the ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure showing the large cuboctahedral cavity that is surrounded by 12 oxygen atoms]]

The coordination of the A ions in perovsite and the arrangement of BO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra is best understood by looking at the ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure, which is the same structure but with the A-site cations removed.  In the polyhedral representation of the structure shown at the right, it can be seen that the octahedra share all their vertices but do not share any octahedral edges.  This makes the ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and perovskite structures flexible, like three-dimensional wine racks, in that the octahedra can '''rotate and tilt cooperatively'''.  Eight such octahedra surround a large '''cuboctahedral cavity''', which is the site of the A ions in the perovskite structure.  Cations in these sites are coordinated by 12 oxide ions, as expected from the relationship between the perovskite and fcc lattices.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because the A-site is empty in the ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure, compounds with that structure can be reversibly '''intercalated''' by small ions such as '''Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''', which then occupy sites in the cuboctahedral cavity.  For example, smart windows that darken in bright sunlight contain the '''electrochromic''' material WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure.  In the sunlight, a photovoltaic cell drives the reductive intercalation of WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; according to the reaction:

:&lt;math&gt;x\mathrm{H^+} + x\mathrm{e^-} + {WO_3} \leftrightarrows\ {H}_{x}\mathrm{WO_3}&lt;/math&gt;

WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a light yellow compound containing d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; W(VI). In contrast, H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is mixed-valent W(V)-W(VI) = d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, has a deep blue color.  Such coloration is typical of mixed-valence transition metal complexes because their d-electrons can be excited to delocalized conduction band levels by red light.  Because the electrochemical intercalation-deintercalation process is powered by a solar cell, the tint of the windows can adjust automatically to the level of sunlight.

'''Ferroelectric perovskites.'''  The flexibility of the network of corner-sharing BO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra is also very important in [[w:ferroelectric|ferroelectric]] oxides that have the perovskite structure.  In some perovsites with small B-site cations, such as Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Nb&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;, the cation is too small to fit symmetrically in the BO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedron.  The octahedron distorts, allowing the cation to move off-center.  These distortions can be '''tetragonal''' (as in the example shown at the right), '''rhombohedral''', or '''orthorhombic''', depending on whether the cation moves towards a vertex, face, or edge of the BO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedron.  Moving the cation off-center in the octahedron creates an '''electric dipole'''.  In ferroelectrics, these dipoles align in neighboring unit cells through cooperative rotation and tilting of octahedra.  The crystal thus acquires a net electrical polarization.

[[w:ferroelectricity|'''Ferroelectricity''']] behaves analogously to [[w:ferromagnetism|'''ferromagnetism''']], except that the polarization is electrical rather than magnetic. In both cases, there is a '''critical temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)''' above which the '''spontaneous polarization''' of the crystal disappears.  Below T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, the electric polarization of a ferroelectric can be switched with a coercive field, and hysteresis loop of polarization vs. field resembles that of a ferromagnet.  Above T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, the crystal is '''paraelectric''' and has a high dielectric permittivity.  

Ferroelectric and paraelectric oxides (along with piezoelectrics and pyroelectrics) have a wide variety of applications as switches, actuators, transducers, and dielectrics for capacitors.  '''Ferroelectric capacitors''' are important in memory devices (FRAM) and in the tuning circuits of cellular telephones.  '''Multiferroics''', which are materials that are simultaneously ferroelectric and ferromagnetic, are rare and are being now intensively researched because of their potential applications in electrically adressable magnetic memory.


[[File:Rutile-unit-cell-3D-balls.png|200px|left]]
[[file:polyhedralrutile.png|175px|right|thumb|View down the tetragonal c-axis of the rutile lattice, showing edge-sharing MO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra.]]
The '''rutile structure''' is an important MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X = O, F) structure.  It is a 6:3 structure, in which the cations are octahedrally coordinated by anions, and as such is intermediate in polarity between the CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (8:4) and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (4:2) structures.  The mineral rutile is one of the polymorphs of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the others (anatase and brookite) also being 6:3 structures.

The rutile structure can be described as a distorted version of the NiAs structure with half the cations removed.  Recall that compounds with the NiAs structure were typically metallic because the metal ions are eclipsed along the stacking axis and thus are in relatively close contact.  In rutile, the MO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; '''octahedra share edges''' along the tetragonal c-axis, and so some rutile oxides, such as '''NbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''' are also '''metallic''' because of '''d-orbital overlap''' along that axis.  These compounds are important as electrolyzer catalysts and catalyst supports because they combine high catalytic activity with good electronic conductivity.  

Rutile TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, because of its high refractive index, is the base pigment for white paint. It is a wide bandgap semiconductor that has also been extensively researched as an electrode for water splitting solar cells and as a photocatalyst (primarily as the anatase polymorph) for degradation of pollutants in air and water.

Use the Pauling  formula to predict the M-X bond length in the CsCl structure of a compound that has a bond length of 3.5 Å in the NaCl structure.  Would applying a high pressure stabilize the CsCl form, or the NaCl form of this compound? (''hint:''  calculate the volume per formula unit)

Would kind of magnetic ordering (ferro-, ferri-, or antiferromagnetic) would you predict for NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;?

In Chapter 8, we learned all about crystal structures of '''ionic compounds'''.  A good question to ask is, ''what makes a compound choose a particular structure?'' In addressing this question, we will learn about the forces that hold crystals together and the relative energies of different structures.  This will in turn help us understand in a more quantitative way some of the heuristic concepts we have learned about, such as hard-soft acid-base theory.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160; 9.1 Ionic radii and radius ratios==
.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.2 Structure maps==

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.3 Energetics of crystalline solids: the ionic model==
Let's start looking at the lattice energies from the sense of chemical bonding. There are mainly two kinds of force that dictates the energy/stability of a chemical bond. 
 [[Image:Coulombslaw.svg|center|A graphical representation of Coulomb's law]]
1) Electrostatic Force of attraction and repulsion.(Coulomb's Law):
The Charges of 2 ions q1 and q2 seperated by a distance, r, experience and attractive froce- F.

&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf F|=-e^2{|q_1q_2|\over r^2}\qquad&lt;/math&gt;

Their Coulombic potential energy, V, is then given by

&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf V|=\int_\infty^r F(r)\,\mathrm{d}r=-e^2{|q_1q_2|\over r}\qquad&lt;/math&gt;

2) Born Replusion:
B is a constants and n is a number ranging from 5~12

&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf V|={B\over r^n}\qquad&lt;/math&gt;

The lattice energy is then calculated by the combination of net electrostatic attraction and the Born repulsion energies.
Lets first combine the net Electrostatic energy of a lattice.

Consider a chain of anion and cation. 
 [[Image:Chain of Cation and Anion.jpg|center|A chain of anion and cation]]

Start with the most left cation and add up the electrostatic energy which will give us the following:

&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf V|=-6{e^2|q_1q_2|\over r}\qquad&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf V|={12\over \sqrt{2}}{{e^2|q_1q_2|\over r}\qquad}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf V|={-8\over \sqrt{3}}{{e^2|q_1q_2|\over r}\qquad}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf V|={6\over \sqrt{4}}{{e^2|q_1q_2|\over r}\qquad}&lt;/math&gt;

The net attractive energy between the cation and anion in a infinite series will then result in a function:

&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf V|={-{e^2|q_1q_2|\over r}}(6- \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}}+ \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}- \frac{6}{\sqrt{4}}+\cdots)&lt;/math&gt;

Generalizing it and well get a function:

&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf V|=-e^2{|q_1q_2|\over r}NA\qquad&lt;/math&gt;

and A is called the ''Madelung constant''. '''Madelung constant''' depends only on the geometrical arrangement of the point charges so it varies between different type of crystal structures.

Having that formula in hand we can then combine the two froces into an equation which gives us the lattice energy.
[[Image:IonicBondLength.jpg|Right|Lattice Energy]]

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_L=-e^2{|q_1q_2|\over r}NA+ \frac{BN}{r^n}&lt;/math&gt;

Lattice Energy is equivalent to the equlibrium bond lenght so....

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dr}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B=\frac{e^{2}q_1q_2Ar^{n-1}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_L={-{e^2|q_1q_2|NA\over r_e}}(1-\frac{1}{n})&lt;/math&gt;

and by expressing the repulsion term in exponential form we result in the Born-Mayer eqation: 

where p is the fudge factor~0.35Å

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_L={{e^2|q_1q_2|NA\over r_e}}(1-\frac{p}{r_e})&lt;/math&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.4 Born-Haber cycles for NaCl and silver halides==
Which the equation and the derivation mentioned above we know that lattice energy is equivalent to its heat of formation.
Lets consider the formation of table salt (NaCl)

Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(g)+Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(g) -------&gt; NaCl(s) 

'''&lt;u&gt;Born-Harber cycle:&lt;/u&gt;'''
 [[Image:BHC-NaCl.jpg|400px|Left|Born-Haber Cycle of NaCl]]

S= Sublimation  

IP= ionization of Na(g)

D= Dissocation energy

EA= Electron affinity

E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;=Lattice energy

R= Gas constant

t= Temperature

&lt;u&gt;'''From Hess' Law:'''&lt;/u&gt;

dH&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = S + 1/2D + IP + EA + E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + 2RT = -92.2

Acutal dH&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;= -98.3

The error is only about 3% off. The result is promising because we neglected the van der Waals term.

&lt;u&gt;But....Why did we get away when can der Waals term is neglected?&lt;/u&gt; 

This is because we used energy minimization during the calculation. This results an overestimation of the repulsion force and underestimation of the attraction force. The two's error compensates each other out.

'''&lt;u&gt;Silver Halides&lt;/u&gt;'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Silver Halide !! Calculated !! Cycle !! Difference
|-
| AgF || 220 || 228 || 8
|-
| AgCl || 199 || 217 || 18
|-
| AgBr || 105 || 215 || 20
|-
| AgI || 186 || 211 || 25
|-
|}

Looking at the table, we know that the ionic model didn't work for AgI from section 9.1 and 9.2 due to the electronegtivity different dx=0.6. However we are still acquiring answers within ~10% error. How do we account for the partial covalent part of the E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;? The answers follows the same rule explained above. The ionic model over estimates the Madelang energy and this compensate for neglect of covalency.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.5 Kapustinskii equation==
The Lattice energy, E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, for an ionic crystals are difficult to determine experimentally . In 1956 a Russian chemist, Anatoli Fedorovich Kapustinskii, published a formula that allow us to calculate E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; for any compound if we know the univalent radii. The Formula was later named The &lt;u&gt;''Kapustinskii Formula.''&lt;/u&gt;

A. F. Kapustinskii noticed that the Madeling constat, A, is propotional to the number of ions in formula unit, n. showing:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{n}= invariant&lt;/math&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Structure!! A/n
|-
| NaCl || 0.874
|-
| CsCl || 0.882
|-
| Rutile || 0.803
|-
| Fluorite || 0.800
|}

The difference in ionic radii between M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; compensates for the differebnce in A/n for monovalent (NaCl, CsCl) and divalent (Rutile, CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) structure.

This gives the Kapustinskii formula in (&lt;math&gt;\frac{kcal}{mol}&lt;/math&gt;) as:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_L= {290.1Z_+Z_-n \over r_++r_-}(1-\frac{0.345}{r_++r_-})&lt;/math&gt;

The formula allows Neil Bartlett to fill out the fissing thems in the Born-Harder cycle, in this case EA, which is hard to measure and discovered the first Noble Gas.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.6 Discovery of noble gas compounds==
In 1962 at the University of British Columbia, Neil Bartlett synthesized PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and accidentally noticed the compound’s reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
[[File:O2PtF6.jpg|500px]]&lt;br /&gt;
EA can be calculated by following step. EA = -38 - 278 + 134 = -182 kcal/mol&lt;br /&gt;
Bartlett noticed Xe has ionization energy of +280 kcal, which is identical to the ionization energy of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so he concluded that Xe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; should be about the same size as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and that Xe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; should be a stable compound. The successful synthesis of Xe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; demonstrated that similarities in lattice energies can predict the stability of unknown compounds. In the formula shown below detailing the reaction between Xe and PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Xenon prefers the +2 oxidation state. 
[[File:PtF6Formula.png|500px]]
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, CuF and AuF are unknown compounds, but AgF is a known, stable compounds, so from the Born Haber cycle for CuF, the compound should be marginally stable with respect to the elements.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:CuFBornHaber.png|600px]]

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.7 Stabilization of high and low oxidation states==

To predict the stability of a certain oxidation state of a given ion, we can apply the lattice energy theories. Let's see two cycles showing the formation of CuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is known to exist, and CuF which is unknown for its existence. 
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:CuF2BornHaber2.png|500px]]
&lt;br /&gt;
From the first cycle, CuF should be marginally stable with respect to the elements. The second cycle is for CuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is known to exist.
 
Combining the two cycles shows that disproportionation is spontaneous (Same for 3AuF → AuF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2Au). AgF is stable because the second IP is very high (495 kcal vs. 468 kcal for Cu, 473 for Au). Note that the difference in E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (690-230=460 kcal) drives the disproportionation. This difference is bigger for smaller ions. For example, in fluorides, CuF is unstable but CuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is stable. However, in iodides, CuI is stable while CuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is unstable. As a conclusion: '''small anions (O,F) stabilize high oxidation states, large anions (S, Br, I...) stabilize low oxidation states.'''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.8 Alkalides and electrides==

Another interesting consequence of lattice energies involves the formation of certain salts containing Na&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; as anions. &lt;br /&gt;
[[File:2NaBornHaber.png|500px]]
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:NaBornHaber.png|500px]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:18Crown6Ether.png|thumbnail|right|18-Crown-6 Ether]]
Complexing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) with crown ethers stabilizes the M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; form of the metal (&quot;salt&quot; form) without generating a large E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; cost.


[[File:AlkalideElectrideSalts.png|500px]]&lt;br /&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.9 Resonance energy of metals==

Consider the stability of Na (metal) relative to Na+ e-. The Na (metal) is more stable relative to the Na+ e- &quot;salt&quot; due to the fact that valence electrons are shared by all atoms in the crystal. In the &quot;salt&quot; form, electrons are localized and the additional kinetic energy adds to the total energy.

&lt;math&gt;KE = \frac{h^2 n^2}{8mL^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where:
 h = Plank's constant;
 n = energy level, assume to be the lowest, n = 1
 m = electron mass
 L = size of box
For a 3Å box:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;KE = \frac{(6.626\cdot10^{-34})^{2}(6.022\cdot10^{23})}{8\cdot (9.1\cdot10^{-31})(3\cdot10^{-10})^{2}} = +96 \frac{kcal}{mol}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;salt&quot; is unstable.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.10 Lattice energies and solubility==

Lattice energies can also help predict compound solubilities. 

[[File:LatticeSolubility.png|500px]]

&lt;math&gt;E_{L} \propto \frac{1}{r_{+}+r_{-}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_{H} \propto \frac{1}{r_{+}^{2}}+\frac{1}{r_{-}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

For large anions, E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; doesn't change much with respect to r&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r_{+}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, with sulfate salts, MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (epsom salts) are soluble, while the larger BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt;)is insoluble. 
For small anions, E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to r&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, while E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; does not depend on r&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as strongly. For fluorides and hydroxides, LiF is slightly soluble while CsF is vastly soluble, and Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is insoluble where Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is very soluble. In both cases, the solubility depends on the size. 

Combining the trends listed above:
&lt;br /&gt;
Increasing size mismatch between the anion and cation leads to greater solubility, so CsF and LiI are the most soluble alkali halides. In addition, increasing covalency leads to lower solubility in the salts. For example, AgCl, AgBr, and AgI exhibit lower solubility as the atoms move down the row.  
* AgCl(K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; AgBr&gt; AgI(K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;-17&lt;/sup&gt;)
Lastly, increasing charge on the anion generates lower solubility due to the increased effect on the E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; compared to the E&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Small, polyvalent cations generate soluble salts with large, univalent anions such as I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and acetate. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Examples:
&lt;br /&gt;
* Lanthanides

* Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: Nitrate salts are soluble, but oxides and hydroxides are insoluble. 

* Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: Perchlorate is soluble, but sulfate is insoluble.

Also, multiple charged anions such as O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;, and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; generate insoluble salts with most M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and M&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; metals.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.11 Discussion questions==
*Explain why lattice energy calculations are very accurate for NaCl and CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but less accurate (by about 10%) for AgCl and PbCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Does the Born-Mayer equation under- or overestimate the latter values?
*Fluorine is more electronegative than oxygen.  However, for many transition metals, we can make higher oxidation states in oxides than we can in fluorides.  For example, Mn(IV) is stable in an oxide (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but MnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is unstable relative to MnF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and fluorine.&lt;ref&gt;K. O. Christe, &quot;Chemical synthesis of elemental fluorine,&quot; ''Inorg. Chem.'' '''1986''', ''25,'' 3721–3722. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic00241a001 DOI: 10.1021/ic00241a001]&lt;/ref&gt;  Can you explain this in terms of lattice energies?

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;9.12 Problems==
1.	Use lattice energies to explain why MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; decomposes to magnesium oxide and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at a much lower temperature than does BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.


2.	    Solid MgO might be formulated as Mg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; or Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;.  Use the thermochemical data below (some of which are irrelevant) and Kapustinskii's formula to determine which is more stable.  The lattice constant for MgO (NaCl structure) is 4.213 Å. While the idea of an O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion might seem strange, note that the second electron affinity of O and the second ionization potential of Mg (in the table below) are both quite endothermic.

3.	From the heat of formation of solid NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (-75.2 kcal/mol) and gaseous NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (-11.0), the bond dissociation energies of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (104.2) and Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (58.2), the ionization potential of atomic hydrogen (313.4), and the electron affinity of atomic chlorine (-83.4), calculate the gas-phase proton affinity of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  The lattice energy of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl may be estimated from Kapustinskii's formula using r&lt;sub&gt;N-Cl&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.50 Å.


4.	Bottles of aqueous ammonia are often labeled “ammonium hydroxide.”  We will test this idea by using a lattice energy calculation to determine whether the salt NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; can exist.
	
	The heats of formation of gaseous OH- and H2O are respectively -33.7 and -57.8 kcal/mol.  Assuming that NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is about the same size as Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; about the same size as F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, using Kapustinskii's formula, ionic radii, and the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; proton affinity calculated in problem 3, determine whether NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; should be a stable salt relative to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  At what temperature should NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; be unstable relative to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and HCl, if ΔH&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; for HCl is -22.0 kcal/mol and ΔS&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl --&gt; NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl) = 67 cal/mol K?


5.  (a) Do you expect BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to be more soluble in water?  (b) Is LiF more soluble than LiClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;? Explain.


6.  Which polymorph of ZnS (zincblende or wurzite) would you expect to be more stable on the basis of electrostatic energy?

6.	Pure Ge is much more conductive than pure Si.  Given their bandgaps (0.74 and 1.15 eV, respectively), estimate the ratio of their conductivities at room temperature.


7.	Sketch a silicon p-n junction, showing the depletion region, band bending, and the Fermi level in the absence of light or applied potential.  In the dark, the p-n junction acts as a rectifier.  Which way does current flow with an applied bias? In the light, the junction acts as a photodiode.  Which way does current flow in this case?</text>

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;11.6 Discussion questions==

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;11.7 Problems==
1.	Consider a spherical gold nanoparticle that is 3 nm in diameter.  If the diameter of an atom is approximately 3 Å, how many atoms are on the surface of the particle? What fraction of the gold atoms in the particle are on the surface?

2.	Now consider a 3 nm diameter droplet of mercury.  Mercury atoms are also about 3 Å in diameter.  The heat of vaporization of bulk mercury is 64.0 kJ/mol, and the vapor pressure of mercury is 0.00185 torr = 2.43 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; atm.  The surface tension of mercury (γ&lt;sub&gt;Hg&lt;/sub&gt;) is 0.518 N/m, and the surface excess energy can be calculated as γ&lt;sub&gt;Hg&lt;/sub&gt;A, where A is the surface area.  Using this information and the Clausius-Clapyron equation (P = const•exp(-ΔH&lt;sub&gt;vap&lt;/sub&gt;/RT)), calculate the vapor pressure of  3 nm droplets of mercury.

3.	James Heath and coworkers (Phys. Rev. Lett. 1995, 75, 3466) have observed Ostwald ripening in thin films of gold nanoparticles at room temperature.  Starting with an uneven distribution of particle sizes, they find that the large particles grow at the expense of smaller ones.  Can you explain this observation, based on your answers to problems (1) and (2)?

4.    The bandgap of bulk silicon is 1.1 eV.  What bandgap would you expect for a 3 nm diameter Si nanocrystal?  Use the Brus formula,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta {{E}_{gap}}\approx \frac{{{h}^{2}}}{8\mu {{d}^{2}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{4d\pi \varepsilon {{\varepsilon }_{0}}}+...&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where d is the particle diameter, ε&lt;sub&gt;Si&lt;/sub&gt; = 12, h = 6.6 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; J s, 1 eV = 1.6 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; J, 1 J = 1 kg m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. and e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4πε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.44 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; eV m.  Assume that the electron-hole reduced mass μ is approximately equivalent to the electron mass, m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.1 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt; kg.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Polychaeta or polychaetes are a
polyphyletic [1] class of annelid worms,
generally marine. Each body segment has a
pair of fleshy protrusions called parapodia
that bear many bristles, called chaetae , which
are made of chitin. Indeed, polychaetes are
sometimes referred to as bristle worms.
More than 10,000 species are described in
this class. Common representatives include
the lugworm (Arenicola marina) and the
sandworm or clam worm Nereis.
Polychaetes as a class are robust and
widespread, with species that live in the
coldest ocean temperatures of the abyssal
plain, to forms which tolerate the extreme
high temperatures near hydrothermal vents .
Polychaetes occur throughout the Earth's
oceans at all depths, from forms that live as
plankton near the surface, to a 2–3 cm
specimen (still unclassified) observed by the
robot ocean probe Nereus at the bottom of
the Challenger Deep , the deepest known
spot in the Earth's oceans. [2] Only 168
species (less than 2% of all polychaetes) are
known from freshwaters.

The Class Polychaeta (“many bristles”) is
the largest group of annelids, containing
over 10,000 species, most of which are
Marine. Polychaete characteristics include
a well-developed head and lateral
appendages called parapodia, which are
found on each segment. Parapodia are
used for both creeping and swimming.
They can also take part in gas exchange,
which is possible because parapodia
contain a large number of respiratory
capillaries. In some forms (fanworms), the
parapodia have been modified into large,
feathery gills. In terms of nutrition, many
polychaetes are carnivorous, seizing prey
in chitinous jaws or teeth that are everted
rapidly from a muscular pharynx. Some
sedentary forms are particle feeders that
use ciliary currents and mucus to trap
organic food molecules, plankton, etc.
Examples of polychaete worms include:
Nereis virens (the clamworm), Amphitrite
(the spaghetti worm), Glycera (the beak
thrower), Chaetopterus (the parchment
worm), Aphrodita (the sea mouse) and fan
worms (also called feather duster worms
or Christmas tree worms)

Oligochaete Anatomy
Like the polychaetes, oligochaetes have
bodies divided into segments. However, they
lack parapodia and, with a few exceptions,
have relatively few and inconspicuous setae.
The setae are usually arranged in four
bundles on each segment; those of aquatic
forms are longer than those of land forms.
The setae of an earthworm may be felt as a
roughness if one rubs a finger along its side.
Oligochaetes are less varied in their external
form than the polychaetes, but are much
more numerous. As many as 4,000
oligochaetes have been counted in 1 square
meter of lake bottom, and about 9,000 in 1
square meter of meadow soil. In almost all
oligochaetes, the head is a simple cone-
shaped structure without sensory appendages.
Light is detected by photoreceptor cells in
the skin, usually concentrated toward the
front of the animal.
Oligochaete Digestion
The mouth, located under the head, leads to
a relatively simple, straight digestive tract
consisting of a pharynx, an esophagus, and an
intestine, terminating in an anal opening.
Terrestrial oligochaetes tunnel through the
ground, swallowing soil as they go. The
digestive tract of such a worm is specially
modified for this rough diet. Typically it has
a thin-walled storage area, or crop, and a
muscular gizzard for grinding the soil to
remove the organic matter that is the actual
food of the worm. Specialized calciferous
glands remove excess calcium, magnesium,
strontium, and phosphate and regulate the
level of these ions in the blood. Solid wastes
are egested and plastered against the burrow
wall, or ejected from the mouth of the
burrow; the ejected material is called
castings. Earthworms, through their burrowing
and digestive processes, are largely
responsible for the mixing and aeration of
the soil. Not all oligochaetes have soil diets;
some of the small aquatic worms are active
predators on other small invertebrates.
Excretion is typically carried out by a pair of
tubes in each segment.
Oligochaete Circulation and Respiration
The circulatory system is that typical of the
annelids and has many contractile vessels, or
hearts. Although a few aquatic forms have
gills for respiration, most oligochaetes lack
such specialized structures and use the
capillaries of their body walls for respiratory
exchange. Oxygen dissolved in the soil water
diffuses through the moist epidermis of the
worm. If earthworms are forced to the
surface, as when their burrows are filled with
rainwater, they suffocate as a result of
desiccation.
Oligochaete Reproduction
All oligochaetes are hermaphroditic, and
nearly all cross-fertilize by copulation. Male
and female reproductive organs are located
in separate segments. The copulating pair
exchange sperm, which are stored in the
body of the recipient worm until its eggs are
mature. The worm then secretes a cocoon
into which it deposits the eggs and the
sperm; fertilization and development of the
eggs occur in the cocoon. When the young
emerge they are miniatures of the adults.
The cocoon is secreted by a glandular region,
the clitellum, consisting of several thickened
segments. The clitellum of an earthworm is a
conspicuous saddle-shaped region near its
front end.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background - What is COPD? ==
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a term used to account for a number of lung conditions that are; irreversible, gradually worsen, and cause breathing difficulties and dyspnea (breathlessness).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asthmaaustralia.org.au/COPD.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== What are the Main Types of COPD?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asthmaaustralia.org.au/COPD.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* Emphysema - The elastic fibres of the air sacs (alveoli) and breathing tubes (bronchi &amp; bronchioles) are irreversibly destroyed causing an inability to breathe regularly or empty the lungs of air.  
* Chronic Bronchitis - Increased mucus production (sputum) due to the constant swelling and irritation of the breathing tubes (bronchi &amp; bronchioles).

=== Causes of COPD&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asthmaaustralia.org.au/COPD.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* Cigarette smoking - The main cause of COPD. 15-20% of smokers will develop severe lung conditions.
* Exposure to pathogens - Long term exposure to fumes, cigarette smoke, chemicals or dust&lt;ref&gt;Salvi SS &amp; Barnes PJ 2009. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in non-smokers. Lancet 374:733-43&lt;/ref&gt;
* Genetic - A very rare condition caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may cause COPD between the ages of 20-50.

== Exercise as a Component of Treatment for COPD ==
If suffering from COPD, exercise can help you learn to use the lung capacity you have more efficiently. Attending exercise groups run by certified Exercise Physiologists can be inexpensive, improve your quality of life and increase your understanding of the disease as well as allowing you to meet people in the same situation and develop a support network. Pulmonary rehabilitation exercise programs are also beneficial as they can help you acquire the tools to be in control of your breathing, instead of your breathing controlling you and causing extra anxiety and stress. This will allow you to retain your independence and complete daily household tasks .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thoracic.org/clinical/copd-guidelines/for-patients/what-is-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/pulmonary-rehabilitation-for-copd&lt;/ref&gt;
=== What Benefits will I see from Exercise?&lt;ref&gt;http://my.clevelandclinic.org/disorders/chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_copd/hic_diaphragmatic_breathing.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Exercise Will Increase Your !! Exercise Will Decrease Your
|-
| Sleep quality || Shortness of breath
|-
| Muscular strength, endurance, flexibility &amp; balance || Levels of anxiety, stress and depression
|-
| Ability to retain independence and complete household tasks || Blood pressure
|-
| Bone Density and circulation || Muscular strength loss

=== Recommendations for Exercise&lt;ref&gt;Puhan, M. A., Schünemann, H. J., Frey, M., Scharplatz, M., &amp; Bachmann, L. M. (2005). How should COPD patients exercise during respiratory rehabilitation? Comparison of exercise modalities and intensities to treat skeletal muscle dysfunction. Thorax, 60(5), 367-375.&lt;/ref&gt;  ===

There are four main recommended exercise types:

* increase strength of respiratory muscles  
* increases upper, lower body and core strength
* maintains functionality for daily tasks 
* maintains bone health reducing chances of osteoporosis 
|| 
* specific range of exercises for each muscle group selected by an exercise physiologist
* starting with 1 set with 8-10 Repetitions twice a week
* working up to 3 sets of 6 - 10 Repetitions three times a week 
 
|-
| Breathing Exercises&lt;ref&gt;Gosselink, R. (2004). Breathing techniques in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic Respiratory Disease, 1(3), 163-172.&lt;/ref&gt; || 
* Pursed Lip Breathing - sealing the lips and breathing through the nose while exercising, this may reduce breathlessness during and post exercise effort.
* Diaphragmatic Breathing - method of breathing used to strengthen the diaphragm,decrease breathing rate and therefore oxygen demand and decrease effort needed to breathe. 
|| 
* during exercise
* exercises may be performed as much as COPD patient desires
* the more regularly the better
|}

=== Guidelines you Should Know Before Getting Started ===
An exercise evaluation by a certified exercise physiologist(EP) is highly recommended to assess your current cardiovascular capabilities and any other conditions that may be present eg. cardiac issues. The EP will conduct a range of fitness and medical tests and determine an appropriate exercise program tailored just for you!

== Welcomes &amp; Wikis! ==

I realised after I hit save you were quite a bit more experienced than me - so sorry if it seemed odd.  I tend to keep an eye on RC and when I see a red talk page the fingers move! Differences - neither of us have that long to live &lt;g&gt;.  I moved from WP some time ago for all kinds of reasons but this place is interesting (only one of my &quot;homes&quot;).  The pace is very different and takes some getting used to - policy here is different too as much does not exist and much that does is &quot;open to interpretation&quot;.

I didn't know there was a &quot;WikiProject Herbs and Spices&quot; project - either here or there (same name) leave me a link I will at least look at it.  Drinks I like - herbs I grow and use - catch you round - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
:BTW we don't use wiki links anything like as much here as wp - I did when I started and it was pointed out that these are &quot;text books&quot; (tho that does seem to be completely forgotten on some pages!).  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
::Hum - unless the link is duff the project has gone!  Oddly I am a deletionist but for stuff that isn't of a quality (on here).  There is some really stubby stuff and I know people may contribute but if they don't for too long then I think it sends the wrong messages.  That said there is some strange stuff that goes and equally that stays.  However the Bartending book is pretty well established (be warned, as I have removed some - I really am not a fan of external links and was a spam fighter in a previous incarnation!).  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Are there book &quot;editions&quot;? ==

I'm enjoying Wikibooks after making the leap from Wikipedia. One question... does Wikibooks ever take a snapshot of a book's content and release it as an &quot;edition&quot;? One print/ebook publisher I know makes errata corrections in each subsequent printing (and to their ebooks continually), but only adds substantive content in new &quot;editions.&quot; I believe this is common for textbooks and other instructional material.

The concept of a &quot;printing&quot; seems forgettable in the digital age (better to push out errata fixes immediately), but the idea of an &quot;edition&quot; might still hold merit. A teacher may value a Calculus text that doesn't change from year to year. There may be an analogy with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team &quot;Wikipedia 1.0&quot;], and the concept makes even more sense for books. 

A related question: Are there guidelines for when to revise a book versus when to start fresh? If the state of public knowledge on a topic changes suddenly and drastically (e.g. subatomic physics), should a previous book on the topic be gutted and rewritten, should a new edition be released, or should a newer book be created? 

Apologies if this is covered in the docs. I've spent some time reading it, but may have missed it. [[User:Proxyma|Proxyma]] ([[User talk:Proxyma|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Proxyma|contribs]]) 05:33, 2 September 2013 (UTC)

Yes, Wikibooks does take snapshots -- but of individual &quot;pages&quot; of a book, rather than the book as a whole.
Every time a person makes some change to a page and hits the &quot;save&quot; button,
the old version and the (hopefully improved) version are both stored in the &quot;history&quot; of that page.
Later, people such as yourself can review those changes and perhaps approve them (see [[WB:REVIEW]] for details), or perhaps revert those changes.
When a person thinks a page is pretty good and wants to link to it, there are 4 different URLs that can be used:
* https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikijunior:Solar_System/The_Sun&amp;oldid=524413 : a [[w:permalink]] to the exact page that person just read -- the contents will never change.
* https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikijunior:Solar_System/The_Sun&amp;stable=1 : the &quot;stable version&quot;, the latest reviewed version of the page -- the contents only change after both someone edits the page, and then some reviewer approves those edits.
* https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikijunior:Solar_System/The_Sun&amp;stable=0 : a link to the very latest version of the page, which changes every time someone edits the page (so occasionally might be defaced by vandalism).
* https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior:Solar_System/The_Sun : the &quot;current version&quot; of the page, which is either the stable version or the latest version (set through [[Special:ConfiguredPages]]).

''When to revise a book versus when to start fresh?''
That's a difficult question.
I generally lean towards creating a new book and leaving the old one alone,
if the changes are extensive.
For example,
when Python 3 came out,
rather than completely re-writing the Wikibook &quot;Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python&quot;,
I'm glad we created a new [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3]]
(and renamed the old book to [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6]] and otherwise left it alone).

:David, thanks, that helps clarify things. It looks like the concept of &quot;review&quot; is one difference from Wikipedia. [[User:Proxyma|Proxyma]] ([[User talk:Proxyma|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Proxyma|contribs]]) 04:05, 4 September 2013 (UTC)

:: Review is overt only on Wikijunior.  In other Wikibooks content spaces, review is really only a behind-the-scenes thing.  The difference is that on Wikijunior, when an anonymous user (someone who isn't logged in) looks at a page, by default they see the most recently ''sighted'' version of the page.  In other namespaces, an edit to a page is immediately visible to everyone.  Our intention is to give kids a degree of protection against viewing vandalism.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:34, 4 September 2013 (UTC)
== Categorize a book on the library selves ==

Hello Folks, I have been contributing with a book named “Information systems in the consumer industry “ but I have difficulties in categorizing it; it could belong to to a class like “enterprise information systems” or similar. Can someone help me ? Thanks for the help in advance {{unsigned|94.167.7.34}}
: Hi. I'm not sure how old this request is, but it looks like the book already is categorized pretty well. If you need anymore help, you either can reply here (be sure to sign your messages with '''&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' so we can see your name and the date you posted) or leave me a message on my [[User talk:Willscrlt|talk page]]. I also see that you used an anonymous IP address to post the preceding message. You really should join Wikibooks, because it makes both editing and communicating directly with one another much easier. If you do have an account, you must not have been logged in when you posted that. Welcome to Wikibooks, and I hope that we have been able to help you. &lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 09:53, 9 September 2013 (UTC)

== Personal Library Feature ==

I have just discovered WB, and the first feature that seemed very obvious to me, but was missing, was a My Library capability.  At first, I thought the Watchlist might work, but does not appear to do what I am suggesting.  
At the top of the page, right next to My Discussion and Preferences, there would be a My Library button.  When clicked, it would have a list of links to books that I am reading and perhaps tracking of which pages or chapters I have read / not read.  Somewhere else on the page, maybe on the left sidebar, there would be an &quot;Add to My Library&quot; button.  Whenever I'm on a book page, clicking the button would add the book to my library.  Whenever I come back to WB, I can go to My Library and see what I had been reading on past visits and figure out where I was in the book.  Maybe there would be a Bookmark button, too, so that I could bookmark a page or paragraph, and my bookmarks would show up on the list, as well.  Thoughts anyone? {{unsigned|Tjamison|13:49, February 21, 2013‎}}
: Hi. Welcome to Wikibooks. I am surprised that nobody responded sooner. I like your concept, but I'm not sure how feasible it would be. Tracking pages and chapters would be quite difficult to do since this is not a static document like a PDF file or a eBook. These are essentially just Web pages, and you can skip around between the pages, and even between sites (like Wikipedia, Wiktionary, etc.), right in the middle of reading a book.
: The English Wikipedia has the ability to create a collection of articles and bundle them together into a &quot;book&quot;. I am not very familiar with the technical details on how it works, or even what it is like to use them. That is, I think, either an extension (i.e., an add-on to the software) or part of the core functionality of the MediaWiki software. Either way, if en.wiki has that feature, it's very likely that it could be enabled here if there is a consensus that agrees it would be a good idea. It may even be here now, but I don't see it in the menu bar like it is on en.wiki.
: As far as bookmarking, I think that your own Web browser's bookmarks should work for that. The watchlist is another type of bookmark that you could use. It keeps track of all the changes to pages you've added, and it alerts you when changes are made to the page. You also can setup your own User page with links to pages that are of interest to you. People use their user pages for all sorts of things, and making your own reading list is a great use for it.
: I hope that I have given you some ideas. Maybe someone a little more familiar with the Book feature of the software or extension can chime in on that specific feature. Good luck! And please remember to sign your posts with '''&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''. &lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 09:44, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
== Contributing a manual on setting up libraries in rural communities ==

Hi,
I am new to Wikibooks. I have just completed a manual in MS Word describing how to create and set up a library in rural Africa. Since 1997 my wife and I have set up 53 libraries in Ghana, West Africa in small rural communities. We have also developed a curriculum for training librarians for these small rural libraries. I summarized our experiences into a step by step manual which I want to make available to any internet user on any continent.
How do I convert a MS Word document to a Wikibook and upload it?
The material in the manual is copyrighted, and I hope to make the material available for sale as a Kindle book and as a PDF on our website. My purpose is to make the material more widely available. Is this allowable to have the material in a Wikibook also published in different forms?

: Hi Kirt!  That sounds like a fantastic thing to have in wikibooks.  I can help you out, but you should also read [[Wikibooks:Copyrights#Contributors.27_rights_and_obligations|your rights and obligations as a copyright holder]].  One important thing to note is that if you put it up on wikibooks, you are allowing the public to have access to it under the CC-BY-SA and GFDL licenses, and that wikibooks editors can use and edit it in any number of ways without seeking your permission first.  Also note that you can't revoke these licenses, so if you sell the book as a Kindle book later, people would still be able to find your work for free here on Wikibooks without paying for your kindle book.  But you do retain copyright to your book, so you can certainly publish your work in other ways as well.  (I'm not a lawyer at ALL, but that is my understanding of the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]])
: As far as getting your manual up on Wikibooks, I would suggest that you read through [[Help:Editing|this]] to get familiar with the basic editing tools.  Then you can create a page for each of the chapters of your manual, copy/paste your content from Word, and then go back and revise formatting and such.  I am also more than happy to help (I am a librarian in a rural community, and I have been doing a lot of work with library-related textbooks here on wikibooks) -- to get in touch with me, you can go to my [[User_talk:Sandbergja|talk page]] and click &quot;Add Topic&quot;.

== My fiction book ==

I have been reading Wikipedia, it seems forever. A few years back I wrote my first novel, which I kept in manuscript form, but never published. Editors characterized my novel as too &quot;cerebral&quot;, but with literary merit. It does not fill  the Hollywood void of car chases or &quot;jumping into the sack&quot; scenario. According to reviewers/editors, I would have more success if published within the European market. I never had the time to do so, because I was busy with my own medical practice. The manuscript remained in a corner eating dust. Now that I have finally closed my practice after more than 30 years, I am ready to continue my pursuit as a novelist. I would like to donate this first novel to Wikipedia, but need assistance as to the steps to follow. 
It is about 120 words and falls within the genre of the psychological thriller. The main premise of the book is that &quot;we can fool most of the people some of the time but ultimately we must confront ourselves&quot;.

At present, I am changing certain portions of the book's structure and other aspects of the plot and the book is being translated into a foreign language for the European market. Still I would like to donate this original manuscript before the changes I am about to make.

Thanks in advance.

: Hi, Daifu.  Wikimedia has several sister projects, each with a different purpose and different policies.  There's Wikipedia, which develops [[w:WP:What is Wikipedia?|a free-content encyclopedia]].  Wikibooks, here, develops [[WB:What is Wikibooks?|a collection of free-content textbooks]].  Wikisource develops [[s:WS:What is Wikisource?|a free-content library of source texts]].  Wikiversity is a [[v:WV:What is Wikiversity?|learning community]], and can often take research books that contain too much original research to fit in here at Wikibooks.

: I'm not aware of a Wikimedian sister that would be a good fit for a work of fiction.  Perhaps someone else here can suggest where would be a good place to go for that, or perhaps someone at [[v:WV:Colloquium|Wikiversity]] could suggest a suitable place.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:00, 22 September 2013 (UTC)
== It's time to reclaim the community logo ==

Hello community,&lt;br /&gt;
this is to inform you about the (re)start of a discussion in which you might be interested. In short, myself and a few other Wikimedia editors decided to oppose the registration of the [[:File:Wikimedia Community Logo.svg|community logo]] as a trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation.

The history of the logo, the intents behind our action and our hopes for the future are described in detail on [[m:Community Logo/Reclaim the Logo|this page]]; to keep the discussion in one place, please leave your comments [[m:Talk:Community Logo/Reclaim the Logo|the talk page]]. (And if you speak a language other than English, perhaps you can translate the page and bring it to the attention of your local Wikimedia community?) I’m looking forward to hearing from you!

== Page not updating ==

Hi,&lt;br&gt;
Can anybody help?   My page [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Style_Presentation_Modes_in_Opera_12.16 '''Here'''] is not updating properly.   I have the right display when I save it while logged in but when I go to the page while logged out I have some incomplete revision of my work.   Any ideas? [[Special:Contributions/86.171.217.168|86.171.217.168]] ([[User talk:86.171.217.168|discuss]]) 10:19, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

An additional point: I have found that when the page shows the old version, I can force the system to fetch the good updated one by adding a question mark to the existing address, and then hitting ''Enter''.   If I have understood from the past, the sequence of work for the browser is:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look first in the browser cache
&lt;li&gt;if not there go to the ISP's cache
&lt;li&gt;and if not there go out to the source server
&lt;/ol&gt;
By putting a question mark at the end, neither the browser cache nor the ISP will recognize the address and go out for it.   The trouble is, I would have thought that after getting it right, the ISP would deliver it with the ''new'' version after that.   It reverts to the ''old'' one when I clear my browser cache and reload.

What does it take to get a clean updated version?[[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Armchair|contribs]]) 14:48, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Osteoporosis ==
Osteoporosis is a disease of the bone which predominantly affects the aged population, more often females become osteoporotic than males during their lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pei-Yang&quot;&gt;Pei-Yang, L. et al. (2011) 'Aerobic Exercise and Whole-Body Vibration in Offsetting Bone Loss in Older Adults'. Journal of Aging Research. Vol. 2011, Article ID 379674, pp 1-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R.C. Offer&quot;&gt;R.C. Offer (2001) 'Osteoporosis and menopause: Taking charge of bone health'. BCMJ, Vol. 43, No. 8, October 2001, page(s) 458-462&lt;/ref&gt;  Osteoporosis comes about through the gradual deterioration of Bone Mineral Density (BMD), thus meaning that the bone structure becomes far weaker, even brittle to a certain extent and is therefore a lot more susceptible to fractures and breaks&lt;ref name=&quot;Pei-Yang&quot;&gt;Pei-Yang, L. et al. (2011) 'Aerobic Exercise and Whole-Body Vibration in Offsetting Bone Loss in Older Adults'. Journal of Aging Research. Vol. 2011, Article ID 379674, pp 1-9&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bone normal and degraded micro structure.jpg|thumbnail|right|Healthy Trabecular bone on the left, Osteoporotic bone on the right]]
====Prevalence====
Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease as an estimated 200 million people worldwide are dealing with some severity of osteoporosis&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean-Yves Reginster&quot;&gt;Jean-Yves Reginster, (2005) 'Osteoporosis: A still increasing prevalence'. World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Public Health Aspects of Rheumatic Diseases, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;. The main reason osteoporosis is more common in women than men is due to women going through menopause which results in their oestrogen levels dropping significantly. As oestrogen levels drop the breakdown of bone becomes far greater due to the increased activity of osteoclasts which are enzymes that breakdown bone tissue this greatly lowers their BMD&lt;ref name=&quot;R.C. Offer&quot;&gt;R.C. Offer (2001) 'Osteoporosis and menopause: Taking charge of bone health'. BCMJ, Vol. 43, No. 8, October 2001, page(s) 458-462&lt;/ref&gt; 
==== Why It's An Issue ====
Due to the majority of people suffering from osteoporosis being of an older age mobility and everyday living can become a very large issue&lt;ref name=&quot;Pei-Yang&quot;&gt;Pei-Yang, L. et al. (2011) 'Aerobic Exercise and Whole-Body Vibration in Offsetting Bone Loss in Older Adults'. Journal of Aging Research. Vol. 2011, Article ID 379674, pp 1-9&lt;/ref&gt;. The quality of living being effected from osteoporosis can have a large impact on everyday activities such as; grocery shopping, house cleaning and some forms of exercise dependant on the severity of their osteoporosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;KaiMingChan&quot;&gt;KaiMingChan, (2003) 'Exercise interventions: defusing the world’s osteoporosis time bomb'. Bulletin of the World Health Organization. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Osteoporosis&lt;ref name=&quot;R.C. Offer&quot;&gt;R.C. Offer (2001) 'Osteoporosis and menopause: Taking charge of bone health'. BCMJ, Vol. 43, No. 8, October 2001, page(s) 458-462&lt;/ref&gt; == 
There are a lot of things that can effect the development of osteoporosis which include:
* Deterioration of bone tissue
* Decreased bone mineral density
* Loss of collagen fibres 
* Decreased hormone levels (oestrogen, testosterone)
* Minimal or No exercise
* Low calcium intake and poor diet
* Large amounts of sedentary behaviour
Some factors that effect the chances of being diagnosed with osteoporosis can be preventable while others can't be changed as shown in the table below:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Preventable Factors !! Non-Preventable Factors
|-
| Smoking || Gender
|-
| Amount of Exercise || Age
|-
| Low calcium intake || Genetics
|-
| Sedentary behaviour || Menopause
|-
| Peak bone density || Previous fractures
|}

== Exercise Prevention ==
With the main problem of osteoporosis being the loss of bone mineral density and bone structure, the idea behind exercise prevention is to maintain or even increase that BMD thus decreasing the chance of falls, fractures or breaks and the onset of osteoporosis&lt;ref name=&quot;KaiMingChan&quot;&gt;KaiMingChan, (2003) 'Exercise interventions: defusing the world’s osteoporosis time bomb'. Bulletin of the World Health Organization. &lt;/ref&gt; Exercise prevention can start as early as childhood because it is very important to have a high peak bone density or bone mass before it starts to deteriorate with age. Peak bone mass occurs around 25-30 years of age, the higher someones peak means they have more bone mass to lose before it becomes a serious issue thus decreasing the risk of osteoporosis&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson&quot;&gt;Martin Nilsson, (2012) 'Increased physical Activity is Associated With Enhanced Development of Peak Bone Mass in Men: A Five-year Longitudinal study'. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 2012 May; 27(5): 1206–1214.&lt;/ref&gt; What studies show is that exercise type is very important, resistance training and weight-bearing or high impact exercise including; weightlifting, running and jumping exercises has a far greater effect on increasing and maintaining BMD while non-weight-bearing exercise such as swimming has little to no effect and at best will only help maintain BMD levels&lt;ref name=&quot;J A Todd, R J Robinson&quot;&gt;, J A Todd, R J Robinson (2003) 'Osteoporosis and exercise'. Postgraduate Medical Journal 2003;79:320-323&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise Recommendations ==
Each type of exercise requires different time and frequency to have an effect in preventing the onset of osteoporosis and some is more effective than others&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter R Ebeling&quot;&gt;, Peter R Ebeling (2011) 'Building healthy bones throughout life: an evidence-informed strategy to prevent osteoporosis in Australia'. Medical Journal of Australia 20 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This is shown in the table below:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Exercise type !! Time (min) !! Frequency !! Effectiveness
|-
| Weight-bearing (high impact) || 30-50 || 3-5 days/wk || Very effective
|- 
| Weight-bearing (low impact) || 30-45 || 3-5 days/wk || Effective
|-
| Resistance Training || 30-50 || 3-5 days/wk || Very effective
|-
| Non-weight-bearing || 45-60 || 3-5 days/wk || Not very effective
|}
As shown above some exercise types are more effective at increasing BMD than others. The exercise types that are recommended for developing bone strength and preventing osteoporosis are high impact weight bearing exercises or resistance training exercise. To get the best results it must be regular exercise upwards of 3 times a week and preferably of a minimum of 30 minutes per session. Although if the person was of an older age they may be unable to perform these high-impact exercises so they would be recommended to do low-impact weight bearing or low loads with resistance training, they may even do water based weight-bearing exercises if they are of a very elderly age because they may be at risk of a fall or injury with out of water exercise&lt;ref name=&quot;Ed McNeely&quot;&gt;, Ed McNeely (2010) 'Training to Improve Bone Density in Adults: A Review and Recommendations'. United states sports academy, the sports journal 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In previous units on renderer settings, you learned about
* [[../Quickie Render|Basic settings]], and
* [[../Basic Animation/Rendering|Animation rendering]].

Here we will describe some more renderer settings that can be useful in certain circumstances.

== Stamping ==
[[File:Blender268RenderContextStampOptions.png|thumb]]
The “Stamp” panel in the Render [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]] context provides options for placing descriptive text on top of each rendered frame. The topmost checkbox enables/disables stamping (off by default), while the other checkboxes control the precise information to include, and you can even specify the text and background colour and font size. The information is inserted at the corners of the image, so it can be included in production renders that get appropriately cropped as part of the post-production process.

{{Clear}}

== Toon Renders ==
[[File:Blender268RenderContextPostProcOptions.png|thumb]]
Blender has long had an option for doing simplified “toon” (cartoon-style outlined) renders. In the Render [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]] context, look for the “Post Processing” panel and check the “Edge” box. You will also have to set up the lighting and materials for your objects to give a more flat-shaded look.

A more powerful set of options for doing this sort of thing is available with [[../Advanced Tutorials/Introduction to Freestyle|Freestyle]], which you will learn about [[../Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Rendering|later]].

{{Clear}}
== Clay Renders ==
There is sometimes a need to render a scene without detailed materials and textures, just to see what the object shapes look like. In the Render Layers [[File:Blender267RenderLayersContextButton.png]] context, there is an option to override all lighting and materials for objects in the layer with a particular light group and a particular material. It is common to use a plain diffuse, colourless grey material for this purpose, making all the objects look like they are made out of clay, hence the name.

{{Clear}}
== Transparent Backgrounds ==
Blender by default provides a “sky” or background for your rendered scene; settings for this can be controlled in the World [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]] context.

Sometimes you don’t want such a background at all; you simply want the objects in your scene set against a ''transparent'' background. So, for example, if you insert the image in a Web page, the scene is displayed against the page background, rather than its own image background.

The way to do this is quite simple:
* Choose to render the Sky as Transparent. In the Render [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]] context, look for the Shading panel, where there is a popup menu labelled “Alpha:”, with items “Sky” and “Transparent”. Change this from its default “Sky” to “Transparent”. You have to do this before rendering the image.
* When saving the rendered image, choose a file format (in the Output panel in the Render [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]] context) that includes an ''[[w:Alpha channel|alpha channel]]''; for example, PNG allows for this, but JPEG does not. With such a format chosen, you further have to remember to select the “RGBA” button, not “RGB”, otherwise the transparent areas will simply be filled with black.
{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''If you are not sure which formats support alpha channels''': the formats which do not support alpha channels will ''not'' show the “RGBA” button.}}</text>

== Effects of Exercise on Crohn's Disease Patients ==

=== Exercise Disadvantages ===

The only consistent negative effect found from exercising, is nutritional deficiencies &lt;ref name = &quot;Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease&quot;&gt;Crohns &amp; Colitis Australia.

A poor diet pre and post-exercise, especially with intense strength and hypertrophy exercises, can result in poor recovery extending Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) and poor immune defence. There is an increase risk of zinc deficiencies in Crohn's disease patients, especially after exercise. A zinc deficiency in a Crohn's disease patient, leads to a loss of appetite and can potentially result in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa &quot;anorexia&quot;].

=== Nutrition in Accordance to Exercise in Crohn's Disease Patients ===

Diet is seen to be the primary form of treatment for Crohn's Disease &lt;ref name = &quot;Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease&quot;&gt;Crohns &amp; Colitis Australia. Retrieved September 26, 2013, http://www.crohnsandcolitis.com.au/about-crohns-and-colitis.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Elemental diet as primary treatment of acute Crohn's disease&quot;&gt;O'Morain, C., Segal, A. W., &amp; Levi, A. J. (1984). Elemental diet as primary treatment of acute Crohn's disease: a controlled trial.

Depending on the symptoms present, and during flare-ups, it is recommended that the patient have a low protein, low fibre diet. In saying that though, because symptoms are extremely individual some patients may not have to change their diet at all &lt;ref name = &quot;Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease&quot;&gt;Crohns &amp; Colitis Australia. Retrieved September 26, 2013, http://www.crohnsandcolitis.com.au/about-crohns-and-colitis.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Elemental diet as primary treatment of acute Crohn's disease&quot;&gt;O'Morain, C., Segal, A.

With the increase in activity, just like any other person, an increase in nutrients will be required to aid recovery. This can be another disadvantage to heavy strength and hypertrophy training in some Crohn's disease patients. Some patients will also be unable to supplement crucial nutrients like protein, and some vitamins and minerals, as these supplements can irritate and flare up abdominal pain &lt;ref name = &quot;Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease&quot;&gt;Crohns &amp; Colitis Australia.

== Recommendations for Nutrition and Exercise ==

Crohn's disease patients should get to know the signs and symptoms that are individual to them, and what foods and supplements they can consume that doesn't make their symptoms worse.

      <comment>There seems to be problems with this approach, but it's still good for the lead text.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are some questions you can answer to verify that you have understood the material in this chapter. Note that finding the answer to some of those questions could require having knowledge that is not presented in this chapter. This is normal: the quizzes are part of the learning experience, and they can introduce information that is not available elsewhere in the book.</text>

{{B3D:N2P/NAV
|next=UV Map Basics
|previous=Putting It All Together: A Dragon!
}}

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.68}}

Blender’s UV/Image Editor window serves a number of related purposes:
* It is a place to view rendered images, and save them to files.
* It is a place to view and edit images being used as textures.
* It is a place to perform ''UV mapping'' of meshes to texture images.

In the window header, you will see “View” and “Image” menus, followed by a menu for choosing which image to view. The rest of the window header varies depending on your choice from this last menu.

== Viewing Render Results ==

[[File:Blender268ImageEditorRenderResultMenus.png]]

Here is what the variable part of the window header looks like when you choose the special “Render Result” entry in the image-selection menu. The next menu, showing the word “View”, serves no useful purpose in this case (it is only applicable to editable images, not the render result). Next to that is a Slot menu, allowing you to select from any of 8 numbered slots. Each slot can hold a separate Render Result image. This is handy for trying out different render settings (e.g. quality etc), and quickly flip between them for comparison. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts {{B3D:N2P/Do|1KEY}} .. {{B3D:N2P/Do|8KEY}} to switch slots. When you perform a render, the generated image is put into the slot you are currently viewing in the UV/Image Editor.

The next two menus, showing “RenderLayer” and “Combined” in the above screenshot, allow you to view different render layers and render passes, if you have more than one of these configured in the render settings, as well as the final compositor result.

The rightmost group of four icons make a further breakdown of the image into RGB channels with/without alpha transparency layer, alpha on its own, and Z (depth) buffer on its own. Alpha transparency only matters if you are rendering a transparent background in place of the sky, as discussed [[../Further Rendering Options/|later]].

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''What you see is what you save.''' When saving an image to a file, the saved image will correspond—choice of slot, layer and pass—to what you are currently viewing on-screen.}}

== Viewing/Editing Texture Images ==
[[File:Blender268ImageEditorImageMenus.png]]

Here is what the variable part of the window header looks like when you select some other image, or create a new one. Now the editing-context menu [[File:Blender268ImageEditorEditingMenu.png]] becomes useful: selecting the “Paint” item lets you paint on the image.

Note the rightmost group of icons in the header has shrunk slightly: there is no more Z-buffer option, though the alpha-related options still exist.

== UV Mapping ==
[[File:Blender268ImageEditorUVMenus.png]]

Here is what the variable part of the window header looks like when you select a texture image, and go into Edit mode on a mesh in the 3D View window.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have moved this page into the “Miscellaneous Tutorials” section, because I see it as having limited general applicability as a modelling technique. It seems more common to produce smooth objects using Catmull-Clark subdiv, NURBS patches, or even Sculpt Mode, rather than metaballs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== If Statement: ==
The if statement in c# is so simple like other languages. The syntax for if statement is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
if(condition){
// Statements
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is condition we can check some expression for true or false. For example 5 &gt; 4 is true but 4 &gt; 5 is false.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
if(5 &gt; 4){
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Yes five is still greater than 4&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Else part: ==

In the else part if if condition we can give statements which will execute if condition is false.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
if(5 &gt; 4){
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Yes five is still greater than four&quot;);
} else {
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Oh No! five is now no longer greater than four&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.68}}

Blender is an '''Open Source''' project. That doesn’t just mean you get to use it for [[w:Free software|free]], you also get to see how it works, and you can even make your own changes and share them with others.

Blender is also a large software project (well over a million lines of code), with a great many active contributors over a lifespan of more than a decade, and it continues to be developed at a rapid rate. This can make things somewhat intimidating for less-experienced programmers.

This unit assumes you have some decent programming experience under your belt. Blender is mainly programmed in the [[w:C (programming language)|C]], [[w:C++|C++]] and [http://www.python.org/ Python] programming languages. It can be built using either the [http://www.cmake.org/ CMake] or [http://www.scons.org/ SCons] build systems.

== Getting the Blender Source Code ==
The official Blender source is kept in [http://git-scm.com/ Git] repositories located at &lt;TT&gt;developer.blender.org&lt;/TT&gt;. There are actually several separate repositories:
* [http://developer.blender.org/diffusion/B/ blender-main] — the main part of the Blender source, excluding most Python addons
* [http://developer.blender.org/diffusion/BA/ blender-addons] — the Python addons included in the standard Blender distribution
* [http://developer.blender.org/diffusion/BAC/ blender-addons-contrib] — additional useful Python addons
* [http://developer.blender.org/diffusion/BT/ blender-translations] — localized language translations for text messages.
* &lt;!-- [https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/lib blender-lib] — prebuilt libraries for various platforms. Linux is no longer included here; the assumption is you will have standard packages for necessary dependencies in your distro, or alternatively build them from source. --&gt; &lt;!-- doesn’t seem to exist any more --&gt;
* [https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/lib/tests blender-tests] — some interesting example &lt;TT&gt;.blend&lt;/TT&gt; files used for testing and demonstrating Blender functionality.

== Layout of the Blender Source ==

Say you’ve checked out a copy of the main Blender source tree. The top level looks like this:
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|build_files/}} — files used during the build process
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|CMakeLists.txt}} — top-level control file for CMake
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|COPYING}} — note about Blender licensing (GPLv2)
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|doc/}} — documentation files, among them:
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|doc/blender_file_format/}} — the format of &lt;TT&gt;.blend&lt;/TT&gt; files
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|doc/build_systems/}} — how to build Blender, and hack the build system
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|doc/manpage/}} — the man page
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|extern/}} — non-Blender-specific libraries, primarily developed elsewhere, included in the source
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|GNUmakefile}} — simple build script for those who can’t be bothered to go through the CMake setup process
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/}} — libraries which are non-Blender-specific but primarily developed here, also glue code for interfacing to external libraries not included in the Blender source. Notable subdirectories:
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/bsp/}} — Constructive Solid Geometry routines
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/cycles/}} — the Cycles renderer
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/elbeem/}} — the fluid simulator
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/ghost/}} — Blender’s platform-independent GUI (including platform-dependent implementations). See {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/ghost/GHOST_ISystem.h}} for a more detailed description.
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/guardedalloc/}} — thread-safe memory management with consistency checking
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/iksolver/}} — the Inverse Kinematics library
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/smoke/}} — the library for simulating smoke and flames
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|release/}} — additional files to be included in the Blender distribution, including GUI icons and fonts
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|SConstruct}} — top-level control file for SCons
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/}} — the main part of the Blender source, further divided (ignoring the &lt;TT&gt;CMakeLists.txt&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;SConscript&lt;/TT&gt; files which you will find just about everywhere) into
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/}} — the bulk of the source, of which some useful parts are
*** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/blenlib/}} — low-level stuff for file management, geometry algorithms, sorting and suchlike
*** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/blenkernel/}} — core Blender-specific code (no UI stuff)
*** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/blenloader/}} — code for reading and writing &lt;TT&gt;.blend&lt;/TT&gt; files
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blenderplayer/}} — some additional files for building the Blender Player executable
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/creator/}} — the Blender mainline
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/gameengine/}} — the Blender Game Engine
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/icons/}} — some files specific to the Windows build
** {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/tests/}} — some test scripts

=== Common Subdirectory Layout ===
Within many of the subdirectories in {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/}} and {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/}}, you will see the following pattern:
* A bunch of &lt;TT&gt;.h&lt;/TT&gt; files in the directory, and
* an &lt;TT&gt;intern&lt;/TT&gt; subdirectory.
The &lt;TT&gt;.h&lt;/TT&gt; files define the functionality exported to other modules, while the &lt;TT&gt;intern&lt;/TT&gt; subdirectory contains the &lt;TT&gt;.c&lt;/TT&gt; or &lt;TT&gt;.cpp&lt;/TT&gt; files that actually implement the module. Sometimes the &lt;TT&gt;.h&lt;/TT&gt; files are put into an &lt;TT&gt;extern&lt;/TT&gt; subdirectory instead of the upper directory level.

(And yes, these meanings of &lt;TT&gt;intern&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;extern&lt;/TT&gt; are not the same as the meanings of &lt;TT&gt;intern&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;extern&lt;/TT&gt; at the top directory level.)

== Blender’s “Genetic Code”: “DNA” and “RNA” ==
You will find references to “DNA” (or “SDNA”) and “RNA” throughout Blender’s source code. The analogy to the terms from genetics is weak at best, but what they refer to is:
* “DNA” or “SDNA” (“structure” DNA?) is the system for mapping Blender’s in-memory data structures to the on-disk &lt;TT&gt;.blend&lt;/TT&gt; file format. A &lt;TT&gt;.blend&lt;/TT&gt; file is little more than a memory dump, which makes it quick to write. However, the file needs to be readable by Blender builds on machines with different [[w:Endianness|endianness]], 32 versus [[w:64-bit|64-bit]] pointers, etc, not to mention future versions with different capabilities. Thus, the saved &lt;TT&gt;.blend&lt;/TT&gt; file includes a detailed description of the layout of all the data structures saved in the file, and this description is stored in the “DNA1” block at the end. This block is generated by the &lt;TT&gt;makesdna&lt;/TT&gt; tool, which is built and run automatically as part of the overall build process, so its output can be included directly into the Blender executable. It parses all the &lt;TT&gt;.h&lt;/TT&gt; files in the directory {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/makesdna/}}, so all data structures that could get saved into &lt;TT&gt;.blend&lt;/TT&gt; files must be defined here, and they must be careful to use a limited subset of C that the parsing tool can handle.
* “RNA” defines the Python interface to Blender’s internal data structures and routine calls.

[http://www.blendernation.com/2008/12/01/blender-dna-rna-and-backward-compatibility/ Here] is Ton “Mr Blender” Roosendaal explaining DNA and RNA.

== Special Globals: “G” and “U” ==
There is a frequently-referenced global variable named “G”, of type &lt;TT&gt;struct Global&lt;/TT&gt;, declared in {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/blenkernel/BKE_global.h}}. The variable is defined in {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/blenkernel/intern/blender.c}}. This same file also defines the global “U”, of type &lt;TT&gt;struct UserDef&lt;/TT&gt;, declared in {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/makesdna/DNA_userdef_types.h}}.

== Naming Conventions ==
Some (but not all) global symbols have prefixes on their names indicating (roughly) where they come from. Here is a partial list.

== User-Interface Implementation ==
The UI code is structured into several layers. This code also handles finding of user-preference files and shared application data. Starting from the lowest, the layers are:
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|intern/ghost/}}
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/windowmanager/}} (see {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/windowmanager/WM_types.h}} for an overview)
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/editors/screen/}}
* {{B3D:N2P/RepoMain|source/blender/editors/interface/}}

=Plane types=
The phase space of a quadratic map is called its '''parameter plane'''. Here:

&lt;math&gt;z0 = z_{cr} \,&lt;/math&gt; is constant and &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; is variable.

There is no dynamics here. It is only a set of parameter values. There are no orbits on the parameter plane.

The parameter plane consists of :
* The Mandelbrot set
** The bifurcation locus = boundary of Mandelbrot set
** Bounded hyperbolic components of the Mandelbrot set = interior of Mandelbrot set &lt;ref&gt;[http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0805.1658 [[Lasse Rempe]], Dierk Schleicher : Bifurcation Loci of Exponential Maps and Quadratic Polynomials: Local Connectivity, Triviality of Fibers, and Density of Hyperbolicity]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different types of the parameter plane&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/julia/altplane.html Alternate Parameter Planes by David E. Joyce ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=Point Types=
Criteria for classification of parameter plane points :
* arithmetic properties of internal angle ( rotational number)
* landing of external rays ( for boundary points ) : biaccesible
* Renormalization
* set properties ( interior of set and set )  

Simple classification of parameter plane points :
* exterior of Mandelbrot set
* Mandelbrot set
** boundary of Mandelbrot set
** interior of Mandelbrot set

There is no complete classification.  The &quot;unclassifed&quot; parameters
are uncountably infinite,  as are the associated angles.  




A partial classification of boundary points would be :&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/244344/classification-of-points-in-the-mandelbrot-set/507766#507766 stackexchange : classification-of-points-in-the-mandelbrot-set]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Boundaries of primitive and satellite hyperbolic components:
** [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/parabolic|Parabolic]] (including 1/4 and primitive roots which are landing points for  2 parameter rays with rational external angles = biaccesible ).
** [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/siegel|Siegel]] ( a unique parameter ray landing with irrational external angle)
**  [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/cremer|Cremer]] ( a unique parameter ray landing with irrational external angle)
* Boundary of M without boundaries of hyperbolic components:
** non-renormalizable (Misiurewicz with rational external angle  and other).
** finitely renormalizable (Misiurewicz and other).
**infinitely renormalizble (Feigenbaum and other). Angle in turns of external rays landing on the Feigenbaum
point are irrational numbers 
* non hyperbolic components ( we believe they do not exist but we cannot prove it ) Boundaries of non-hyperbolic components would be
infinitely renormalizable as well.

Here &quot;other&quot; has not a complete description.  The polynomial may have
a locally connected Julia set or not,  the critcal point may be rcurrent
or not,  the number of branches at branch points may be bounded
or not ...

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[Wikipedia:Citizen Science|Citizen Science]]''' is the study of science (whether that be geology, biology, chemistry, or any other field of study), outside of normal patterns, credentials, and institutions. This term more generally is used to describe people conducting scientific research outside of conventional research organizations. Citizen science is also used to describe public participation in various kinds of science research.

==About this Book==

At [http://sf.sciencehackday.com/about-shdsf/ Science Hack Day San Francisco 2013], some of us remarked that many people who do citizen science have trouble disseminating their work to peers and the general populous. Citizen scientists often find that conventional science journals are inconvenient places to publish their work; journals can have undesirable licensing, they can be slow to publish, and they can be expensive. There are many other places where people may choose to disseminate their discoveries, but many people are not aware of these places. This is why we are writing this book about how to communicate to the external world the discoveries and experiments conducted by citizen scientists. 

We consider it imperative that scientific research, of all kinds, be easily accessible by professionals and laymen alike. As well, that there be some sort of portal for these people to communicate their ideas to one another. Scientific research and inquiry no longer must be limited to the privileged few, but can be made freely available and accessible to most people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like all research, the value of contributions in citizen science are greatest when communicated effectively. Further, citizen science in particular stands to benefit from the opportunities and affordances of openness, both in terms of [[Wikipedia:Open Access|open access]] (broadcast) and [[Wikipedia:Open science|open collaboration]] (feedback). Digital and network technologies, especially the web, enable many substantive opportunities to practice and communicate citizen science.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 2013-09-28 reordering ==

Even though the advanced track chapters are not meant to be necessarily read in order, I felt shuffling them could give some readers a more pleasant experience. I put monoids and applicative functors first as they are the easiest chapters; furthermore, they relate quite obviously to the later parts of the Beginners Track (monoids and MonadPlus; applicative functors as something in-between a simple functor and a monad). Next come the two chapters on arrows and the CPS one, which IMO feel like part of the same arc. If the planned chapter on MonadFix stays here (rather than returning to the monad sub-track) it is likely to be somewhere in this middle section too. Finally, at the end come the miscellaneous topics - zippers, mutability, concurrence.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.68}}

[[File:Blender268ObjectContextTransformPanel.png|thumb]]

Every object in a scene has common settings in the Object [[File:Blender255ObjectContextButton.png]] Context. This includes the common transform settings shown at right: location in the scene, overall rotation and overall scaling. Most objects also have additional properties, such as the geometry of a mesh and the materials that govern how it appears in the render.

The '''Empty object''' has none of these additional properties. It has the overall transform settings, and not much else. And it has no appearance in the final render. So what is the point of having such a thing?

In fact, it has many uses, such as:
* In the Physics [[File:Blender255PhysicsContextButton.png]] Context, it can be set as the source of a force field (e.g. wind).
* It can be used as the [[../Parenting|parent]] for multiple other objects. That way they can be moved together just by moving the Empty, rather than each child object individually.
* It can be used as a target object in an '''array modifier''', where it adds its transformation to the copies of the object being modified by the array.
*  It is a handy marker and place holder if you are moving things around.  You can mark an object's original position, and then put it back easily where the empty object is.

In these situations, the invisibility of the Empty in the render is an advantage, because it can be placed wherever necessary, without introducing unwanted clutter into the final image.

== Using an Empty With the Array Modifier ==

[[File:Blender268ObjectAddEmptyMenu.png|thumb|The types of Empties]]
Open a new default Blender document, complete with default cube. Add a new Empty object to the scene. It doesn’t matter what type of Empty you choose; the options just control its appearance in the 3D view, not the actual behaviour of the Empty. Besides, you can change your mind about this later anyway.

{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender268ArrayModifierWithEmpty1.png|thumb]]
Now select the default cube, go to the Modifiers [[File:Blender255ObjectModifiersContextButton.png]] Context and add an Array modifier. In the settings panel, there are three different ways the modifier can produce its copies of the original object: via a Constant Offset, Relative Offset, or Object Offset. The Constant and Relative offsets only allow a simple displacement for the copies, but the Object Offset looks at the full transformation of the specified object, which can include rotation and scaling.

Here I have unchecked the default Relative Offset, checked Object Offset, and from the popup menu for selecting the target object, I have selected my Empty (which by default would have been called “Empty”).

{{Clear}}

But if you look at your 3D view, nothing seems to have happened: the cube is still sitting, unmoved, in its original position. In fact, it might be hard to see the Empty, because it would have been inserted in the same position as the cube, so it ends up within it. If you switch to Wireframe {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} view, you should be able to see the Empty sitting within the cube.

Before doing anything further, increase the Count field in the cube’s array modifier to 3. This will give you a clearer idea of the effect of subsequent manipulations. Doing so will not have any noticeable effect to start with, because all the copies will be lying right on top of each other.

Now select the Empty, and move it to one side: you will immediately see a second copy of the cube follow the empty, and the third copy move ''by the same amount in the same direction'', so it ends up beyond that.

Return the Empty to its original location, and this time try moving the cube. As the original cube moves, you will see the second copy stay with the Empty at the centre of the scene, while the third copy moves beyond that, by the same distance and in the same direction as the second copy is removed from the original cube.

Now if you return the cube to the same location as the Empty, select both and try moving them together, you will see no additional copies of the cube appear, because they remain exactly on top of the original cube.

The rule for using an Object Offset with the Array modifier is this:
{{B3D:N2P/Note|The transformation applied to copies of the modified object is the '''difference between the transformations of the target object and the modified object'''.}}

In other words:
* the translation applied is the difference between their origins.
* the rotation applied is the difference between their object rotations.
* the scaling applied is the ''ratio'' between their object scaling factors.

Try moving the Empty to one side, as before; this time leave it there, so the three copies of the cube are nicely spread out. Now try applying a rotation to the Empty; see how this applies the corresponding rotation to the second copy (the one located where the Empty is), while the third copy gets ''twice'' that rotation.

Return the Empty to its unrotated state, and this time try rotating the cube: see how the second copy (where the Empty is) stays unmoved, while the third copy gets the opposite rotation.

Undo the rotations, and now try scaling: shrinking/enlarging the Empty correspondingly shrinks/enlarges the second copy, while the third copy gets transformed by the ''square'' of the shrink/enlarge ratio (the ratio multiplied by itself, or alternatively the ratio raised to the second power). Or shrink/enlarge the original cube, and see the second copy stay unchanged (as before), while the third copy enlarges/shrinks by the ''inverse'' ratio.

When you change the transformation of the original cube, the second copy always stays unchanged because the Object Offset transformation is the ''inverse'' of the transformation you are applying to the original; hence it always cancels out for the second copy, but you can see corresponding increasing powers of it applied to subsequent copies.

=== Editing the Modified Object ===
Make sure the Empty is positioned so the array instances are well separated. Select the cube, {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into Edit mode, select all the vertices, and try transforming them: moving, rotating or scaling.

Note the difference in behaviour from doing this to the cube in Object mode: this time all the copies of the cube transform along in unison. This is because we are not affecting the object transformation, which is what controls the behaviour of the array modifier.

=== Arranging Object Copies in a Circle ===
Which brings us to a convenient trick for a common need: arranging copies of an object in a neat circle.

The easiest way to do this is start with the cube and the Empty in their original central positions. Suppose you want 8 copies of the cube in your circle; the angle between them then needs to be 360° ÷ 8 = 45°. So rotate the Empty by 45°. Now select the cube. Set the Fixed Count field of its Array modifier to 8. {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into Edit mode, and move all the vertices to one side. You should see the other 7 copies of the cube correspondingly move away from the centre in different directions, maintaining a nice neat circle arrangement. Your cube mesh is simply being rotated about its origin, which is not where the vertices are, but where the Empty is!

      <comment>Rationale for the track move</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Move from the Haskell in Practice track ==

Reasons for moving this chapter from the practical track to the middle of the Beginner's Track:
* There is really no way we can justify not mentioning something this basic early on.
* The recently incorporated [[Haskell/Arrow tutorial]] has an example with console interaction which is best ran from a terminal, so we'd better have explained how to compile an independent program already.
* It doubles as a trivial, but complete, example of how to write and use a whole module, thus complementing [[Haskell/Modules]].
* In its current shape, this chapter is brief enough not to be obtrusive - very simple examples and the minimal explanation to get things going.
* [[Haskell/Using GHCi effectively]] is a precedent for practical interludes like this one; indeed, I feel it would be strange having a short chapter with tips and tricks about GHCi and not even mentioning how to build a standalone executable.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.68}}

In 2D drawing programs, you may be familiar with the concept of ''grouping'' objects together, so that they can be manipulated and transformed as an indivisible whole.

Blender can achieve a roughly similar effect through its concept of {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|parenting}} one object to another. (Blender also has a concept called “grouping”, but that serves an entirely different purpose, which will not be discussed here, so don’t be confused.)

== Parenting and Unparenting ==

[[File:Blender268SetParentMenu.png|thumb]]
'''To parent one object to another''' is simple: in object mode, select the to-be-child object(s), then select the to-be-parent object, then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|PKEY}} to bring up the “Set Parent To” menu. The options in the menu have the following meanings:
* Object: set the parent of the rest of the selection to the active (last-selected) object, clearing any existing parent relationships the new-children-to-be may have had. Any objects that were previously parented are reset to their original transformations before that previous parenting.
* Object (Keep Transform): similar to the above, except the children keep the transformations from any previous parenting they may have had.
* Vertex: this allows you to parent a child to a single, currently-selected vertex in the parent (which must be a mesh). You can go into Edit mode on the parent mesh to make the selection before using this option. The child will then track the movements of just that vertex, not the entire object.
* Vertex (triangle): here 3 vertices are selected in the parent mesh. The child tracks, not just their translations, but also their relative rotations as well.

When viewing your scene in Object mode, you will see black dashed lines connecting child objects to their parents. Try moving, rotating or scaling just the parent object, and you can see how the same transformation is automatically applied to its children as well.

A parent of objects may in turn be a child of yet another object; any transformation of its parent will automatically be passed on to it and all its children, and their children, and so on.
{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender268ClearParentMenu.png|thumb]]
'''To remove a parent relationship:''' select the child in Object mode, and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|PKEY}} to bring up the clear-parent menu. The options here are:
* Clear Parent: remove the parent/child relationship, and reset the child to the original transformation it had before the parenting.
* Clear and Keep Transformation: remove the parent/child relationship, but the child keeps its current transformation as a result of the parenting.
* Clear Parent Inverse: this doesn’t actually clear the parent/child relationship, but it sets the transformation of the child relative to the parent to the same as the transformation the child had on its own before it was parented.

=== Clear Parent Inverse Clarified ===
Normally, when a parent relationship is set up, if the parent has already had an object transformation applied, the child does not immediately inherit that. Instead, it only picks up ''subsequent'' changes to the parent’s object transformation. What happens is that, at the time the parent relationship is set up, the ''inverse'' of the current parent object transformation is calculated and henceforth applied before passing the parent transformation onto the child. This cancels out the initial transformation, leaving the child where it is to start with. This inverse is not recomputed when the parent object is subsequently moved or subject to other object transformations, so the child follows along thereafter.

The “Clear Parent Inverse” function sets this inverse transformation to the identity transformation, so the child picks up the full parent object transformation.
{{Clear}}

== Lock Up Your Children! ==
[[File:Blender268PropertiesShelfTransformPanel.png|thumb]]
In the Properties shelf at the right of the 3D view (you can toggle its visibility with {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}}), you will see at the top the Transform panel. This shows the overall object transformation (translation, rotation, scaling), but note also the padlock icons next to the transformation fields: clicking each one closes its padlock, locking the corresponding field against further changes, ''including changes made with the usual object-transformation tools in the 3D view''. (If you click a closed padlock, it will open again and remove the lock.)

This can be useful for a child object: if its object transforms are locked, it will still follow changes to transformations on its parent, but it cannot have its transformation changed directly. This can prevent accidents when manipulating an “object” which is actually made up of multiple Blender objects: parent them all to a common root object (e.g. an Empty), and then lock them all, apart from the root object, and so they will transform together by manipulating just the root object, and cannot (accidentally) be separated.

For example, you might construct a car with separate objects for the doors and wheels; these might be left free to rotate (about their hinges and axles respectively), but are otherwise locked in position relative to the car body.

##No or impaired imitation (for example, does not wave bye-bye; does not copy parent's domestic activities; mechanical imitation of others' actions out of context);
##No or abnormal social play (for example, does not actively participate in simple games; refers solitary play activities; involves other children in play only as mechanical aids); and
##Gross impairment in ability to make peer friendships (for example, no interest in making peer friendships despite interest in making fiends, demonstrates lack of understanding of conventions of social interaction, for example, reads phone book to uninterested peer.
#Qualitative impairment in verbal and nonverbal communication and in imaginative activity, (the numbered items are arranged so that those first listed are more likely to apply to younger or more disabled, and the later ones, to older or less disabled) as manifested by the following:
##No mode of communication, such as: communicative babbling, facial expression, gesture, mime, or spoken language;

##Marked abnormalities in the form or content of speech, including stereotyped and repetitive use of speech (for example, immediate echolalia or mechanical repetition of a television commercial); use of &quot;you&quot; when &quot;I&quot; is meant (for example, using &quot;You want cookie?&quot; to mean &quot;I want a cookie&quot;); idiosyncratic use of words or phrases (for example, &quot;Go on green riding&quot; to mean &quot;I want to go on the swing&quot;); or frequent irrelevant remarks (for example, starts talking about train schedules during a conversation about ports); and
##Marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others, despite adequate speech (for example, indulging in lengthy monologues on one subject regardless of interjections from others);
#Markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests as manifested by the following:
##Stereotyped body movements (for example, hand flicking or twisting, spinning, head-banging, complex whole-body movements);
##Persistent preoccupation with parts of objects (for example, sniffing or smelling objects, repetitive feeling of texture of materials, spinning wheels of toy cars) or attachment to unusual objects (for example, insists on carrying around a piece of string);
#Marked distress over changes in trivial aspects of environment (for example, when a vase is moved from usual position);
##Unreasonable insistence on following routines in precise detail (for example, insisting that exactly the same route always be followed when shopping);
##Markedly restricted range of interests and a preoccupation with one narrow interest, e.g., interested only in lining up objects, in amassing facts about meteorology, or in pretending to be a fantasy character.

* PDD-NOS
===ICD-10 (1992)===
#Qualitative impairment in reciprocal social interaction, three from the following five areas:
##failure to use eye gaze, body posture, facial expression and gesture to regulate interaction adequately;
##a failure to develop (in a manner appropriate to mental age, and despite ample opportunity) peer relationships that involve a mutual sharing of interests, activities and emotions;
##rarely seeking and using other people for comfort and affection at times of stress or distress and/or offering comfort and affection to others when they are showing distress or unhappiness;
##a lack of shared enjoyment in terms of vicarious pleasures in other people’s happiness and/or a spontaneous seeking to share their own enjoyment through joint involvement with others;
##a lack of socio-emotional reciprocity, as shown by an impaired or deviant response to communicative behaviours;
#Qualitative impairments in communication, two from the following five areas
##a delay in, or total lack of, spoken language that is not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through the use of gesture or mime as alternative modes of communication;
##a relative failure to initiate or sustain conversational interchange (at whatever level of language skills is present) in which there is a reciprocal to and fro responsiveness to the communication of the other person;
##stereotyped and repetitive use of language and/or idiosyncratic use of words or phrases;
##abnormalities of pitch, stress, rate. rhythm and intonation of speech;
##a lack of varied spontaneous make-believe play, or when young, social imitative play.
#Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities, two from the following six areas
##an encompassing preoccupation with stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest;
##specific attachments to unusual objects;
##apparently compulsive adherence to specific, non-functional routines and rituals;
##stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms that involve either hand/finger flapping or twisting or complex whole body movements; 
##preoccupation with part-objects or non-functional elements of play materials (such as odour, the feel of their surface, or the noise/vibration that they generate);
##distress over changes in small, non-functional details of their environment.
#Developmental abnormalities must be present in the first three years for the diagnosis to be made
#Clinical picture is not attributable to other varieties of pervasive developmental disorder, specific developmental disorders of receptive language with secondary socio-emotional problems; reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited attachment disorder, mental retardation with some associated emotional/ behavioural disorder, schizophrenia of unusually early onset; and Rett syndrome.

===DSM-V (2013)=== 
====Autism Spectrum Disorder====
#Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently  or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):
##Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth   conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions or affect, to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.
##Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction; ranging for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.
##Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts, to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends, to absence of interest in peers.
#Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):
##Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g.; simple motor stereotypes, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).
##Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking pattern, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat same food every day).
##Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests).
##Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
#Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).
# Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.
# These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.

Enabling Social Media Research Through Citizen Social Science

To test the feasibility of citizen social science for social media analytics we are building a webbased tool, which volunteers will be able to use to access social research collected by COSMOS and 
perform simple annotation tasks. These volunteered annotations will then be used to check and improve the quality of the COSMOS computationally-generated annotations. Our approach is modelled on a crowdsourcing facility now being piloted by the BBC to put massive, searchable media archives online using a combination of algorithms and crowdsourcing (Raimond and Lowis, 2012). BBC Research &amp; Development has built a browsable and searchable online archive, which uses crowdsourcing to validate and improve the quality of computationallygenerated annotations. Registered users can listen to programmes in the archive, add new annotations and vote on the quality of existing annotations.

“Can open government data and internet-based information be expanded to empower citizens and workers to help regulate markets and press governments and firms toward reforming the economy? Can the success of citizen science initiatives be a model for projects that can galvanize citizen social science and public governance initiatives? Can petitions and internet activism have significant impact to press major institutions to change policies?” -

You have just seen how animation can be applied to most object property values. In addition to this, Blender provides some specific features to aid in animating movements of parts of objects:
* Meshes can have ''shape keys'' defined for them. These give different positions to the vertices (though their number and ''topology''—edge/face connections—cannot change). The amount of influence each shape key contributes to the shape can be continuously adjusted from nothing to 100%, and like other property values can be made to vary over time.
* ''Armatures'' are specialized objects, consisting of rigid ''bones'' that can be connected by joints, and moved and rotated relative to each other to produce different poses, very much like the skeleton of a human or animal. Armatures do not appear in the final render, but a mesh can be ''deformed'' (i.e. have its shape changed) by an armature to bring lifelike movement to a character.
* ''Lattices'' are another kind of specialized object that can also be used to deform a mesh. Like armatures, they do not appear in the final render. Unlike armatures, they lack rigid joints, and so produce more rubbery changes of shape, characteristic of creatures without bones, or perhaps for a cartoony effect.
* Curve and surface objects can also have shape keys defined for them. And of course curves can be used to deform a mesh via the curve modifier.
* You previously saw the usefulness of the [[../The Empty Object|Empty object]] in modifiers. But being an object with position, scale and rotation properties like any other, these properties can be animated for an Empty, too, with corresponding effects on those modifiers. Also if the Empty happens to be a [[../Parenting|parent]] of other objects, then those objects can be animated as a group, just by animating the Empty.</text>

== Preface ==
This Wikibook will cover the technical subject of anodizing.  It will include the following:
# An introduction to anodizing including its history and applications
# The theory of anodizing
# A list of metals that can be anodized along with recipes for anodization.
# Coloring of anodized metals
# The equipment used in anodizing such asː tanks, power supplies, water treatment systems, etc...
== Introduction ==

Anodizing is a method for growing oxide films on metals for the purposes ofː
# Corrosion protection
# Scratch resistance
# To provide a base for coloring or painting.

== The Theory of Anodizing ==

== Recipes ==
=== Aluminum and Its Alloys ===
The native oxide on aluminum is 40 to 50 Å thick.  It provides some protection from corrosion but because it is thin, porous and mechanically fragile, it cannot provide a robust degree of protection.  One way of improving corrosion resistance is to grow a thicker oxide film.  This can be done in the following waysː
* Heating in air or oxygen
* Treating with oxidizing agents
* Anodic polarization

Oxide films created by heating (thermal treatment) are also thin and weak.  Oxide films created by treatment with oxidizing agents do not provide appreciable corrosion protection, but the can provide a good base for paint or varnish.  By anodic polarization (also known as anodization) it is possible to grow oxide films up to 200 μm thick which provide good corrosion protection and can improve other properties such as scratch resistance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Resistance Training==
Resistance Training (RT) is exercise that emphasises muscle contraction against force. There are three different types of RT: Dynamic, Isometric, and Isokinetic.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Dynamic !! Isometric !! Isokinetic
|-
| The shortening and lengthening of muscle fibres i.e. Eccentric and Concentric contraction. || Applying force to muscle without any change in muscle length. || The application of force across a range of motion at a constant speed.

==Blood Pressure==
[[General_Anatomy/Regulation_of_Blood_Pressure|Blood Pressure]] (BP) is the pressure that blood exerts on the arterial walls as it is pumped from the heart. Measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It is denoted as Systolic BP (SBP) over Diastolic BP (DBP) i.e 120/80.

===Normotension===
People with BP in normal ranges are termed normotensive.

===Hypertension===
People with BP above normal ranges are considered hypertensive with three different classifications.

===Hypotensive===
Abnormally low BP. Not strictly defined.

==Research==
Research on the effects of RT on BP is limited with conclusions varied. The benefits of aerobic exercise for reducing BP are well documented. Studies looking at RT have generally focused on Dynamic Resistance training with very few on Isometric and Isokinetic.

==Recommendations==
Including RT in an exercise program is beneficial for all with regards to the increased muscle mass and especially the increase in ease of everyday living for the elderly. With regards to including it a hypertensive subjects program come precautions must be taken.
===Normotensive===
Here there should be no problems including a RT program.
===Hypertensive===
With regards to using a RT program with high blood pressure subjects, studies have found decreases in BP&lt;sup&gt;[4][7]&lt;/sup&gt;. The more important factor to consider is that none of these studies have found RT increases resting blood pressure. However slight the decrease in BP achieved through RT, Collins, R. et al. in Kelley &amp; Kelley&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; found that while it may not affect cardiovascular disease it decreases the chance for stroke or coronary heart disease. 
During RT BP is elevated by employing some of these techniques we can lower the risk for hypertensive patients during RT. Lamotte, M. Niset, G &amp; Borne, P. &lt;ref&gt;Lamotte, M. Niset, G &amp; Borne, P. (2005). The effect of resistance training on beat-to-beat blood pressure in cardiac patients. ''European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention &amp; Rehabilitation, 12'', 12-17. doi: 10.1097/01.hjr.0000159275.96437.c7 &lt;/ref&gt; found that low weight with high repetitions elevated blood pressure the most, while higher weight with lower repetitions increased BP less significantly. BP's of 320/250 can be seen from heavy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum 1 repetition maximums] (1RM) &lt;ref&gt; Macdougall, J. Tuxen, D. Sale, D. Moroz, J. Sutton, J. (1985, March). Arterial blood pressure response to heavy exercise [Abstract]. ''Journal of Applied Physiology 58''[3], 785-790. Retrieved from http://jap.physiology.org/content/58/3/785.short &lt;/ref&gt;.This increases the chance of bursting capillaries so 1RM's should not be included within an RT for hypertension. Therefore when resistance training hypertensive subjects should use around 75% &lt;sup&gt; [8] &lt;/sup&gt; estimated 1RM with no more than 10 repetitions.

===Fun Fact===
Resistance Training may maintain lowered blood pressure achieved from Aerobic Exercise in the elderly&lt;ref&gt;Cononie, C. Graves, J. Pollock, M. Phillips, M. Sumners, C. Hagberg, J. (1991).

== Physical Activity as a Treatment ==
Physical activity (exercise) may be the most effective, malleable and inexpensive modality available to achieve optimal outcomes for people with osteoarthritis&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marian&quot;&gt;Marian, A.M, 1999.

BJSM, Is exercise effective tratment for osterarthritis of the knee? doi: 10.1136/bjsm.34.5.326&lt;/ref&gt;.  Physical activity has proved to be integral in achieving therapeutic goals, improving general health, reducing secondary disability&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marian&quot;/&gt;, facilitating weight loss, preserving joint range of movement, improve strength, improve functional performance and reducing symptoms&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;.  Physical and occupational therapists and doctors prescribe exercise to reduce pain, impairments and improve function&lt;ref name=&quot;Marian&quot;/&gt;. Although further research is needed to investigate and identify the optimal frequency, intensity, time and type of exercise intervention&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane&quot;/&gt;, research has shown that resistance (strength) and aerobic (cardiovascular)exercise provides benefit to those who suffer OA&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane&quot;/&gt;.  Implementing both modes of training will help to improve symptoms and reduce comorbidities. The positive changes made with physical activity do not persist if the program is discontinued, thus, the motivation of the patient to start and continuously practice exercise is vitally important&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;.  As a basic guide to physical activity, patients should follow the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Physical_Activity_Guidelines ''National Physical Activity Guidelines''].

====[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training ''Resistance Training''] ====
Resistance training improves muscle strength and self-reported measures of pain and physical functioning&lt;ref name=&quot;Lange&quot;&gt;Lange, A.K., Vanwanseele, B. &amp; Fiatarone sigh, M.A. 2008. Strength training for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee: A systematic review, vol 59, pp 1488-1494. doi: 1-.1002/art.24118.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Resistance training interventions could take the form of resistance machines, free weights, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_exercise ''isometric''] exercise and other devices such as resistance bands or a combination of methods&lt;ref name=&quot;Lange&quot;/&gt;.  Studies have shown a relationship between weaker [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps ''quadriceps''] and an increased risk of developing OA, particularly in women, so strength training may be able to prevent and/or help manage knee OA&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennell, Hinman, K. &amp; Rana 2005. Exercise as a treatment for osteoarthritis. Current opinion in rheumatology, vol 17(5), pp 634-640.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Recent studies support the assumption that muscle weakness and atrophy contribute to the disease process&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt; therefore resistance training should be performed on a regular basis in order to counteract these problems&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;.  Low and high intensity resistance training leads to reduced pain and increased functioning, high resistance training yields higher functional performance and greater reduction of pain&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;.  Low and high resistance training with or without weight bearing has been shown to have beneficial effects&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;.

==== [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise ''Aerobic Training''] ====
Aerobic (Cardiovascular) exercise both high and low intensity is beneficial to patients with OA&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;.  Aerobic exercise decreases pain, increases muscle function&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;, increase aerobic capacity, decrease depression and anxiety, decrease fatigue and increase muscular strength and flexibility&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane&quot;/&gt;.  Aquatic based aerobic exercise has been shown to be less efficient in reducing pain and improving muscle function than land based exercise&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;, however, in cases of severe pain and/or obese patients, an initial period of water-based aerobic exercise is helpful ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy ''Buoyancy''] creates a low-impact environment) the aquatic environment provides a workout without joint loading, which is beneficial as further pain and weight-related joint destruction is avoided&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;.

==== Recommendations and Considerations ====
It is recommended to participate in physical activity as a treatment for OA&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;, However certain precautions should be taken to ensure safe progression though any exercise programs.
*Participate in physical activity at least 3 times per week following national physical activity guidelines&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;.
*Supervised exercise over non-supervised or at home&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;.
*Physical activity must be specific and individualized to the person training, there is no one template to follow for the treatment of OA when physical activity is used as an intervention.
*Pre-exercise medical screening including medical clearance from a Doctor or GP as well as ongoing communication.
*Take into consideration any co-morbidities a person may have and progress accordingly.
*Ensure exercise does not elicit too great of a pain response.
*The use of heat creams or gels before exercise and icing of the affected area/s after exercise.
*The use of painkillers during the first weeks of an exercise program&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;.
*Low impact exercise is recommended over high impact.

LibreOffice Calc is a free and open source spreadsheet. Calc's native file format is .ods, the [[w:OpenDocument|OpenDocument Text]] format. Saving in native format is always recommended even if you're planning to save it to another Office format like Microsoft Excel's .xls format, because this ensures that no formatting would be lost because of .doc's inability to save certain formatting elements.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.68}}

Blender provides several different kinds of lights:
*'''Point''': Single point light source. Useful to provide very localized light. The shadows can be sharp, or you can set its size to something nonzero to make the shadows fuzzy. Can represent light sources within the scene; e.g. if there is a lightbulb or candle or something in the scene, position one of these within it to give the impression of light coming from that object.
*'''Sun''': A light with parallel rays that will illuminate the scene with an even light. Because the sun is (effectively) infinitely far away, the position of this lamp does not matter, only its direction. Good to use in brightly-lit outdoor scenes (i.e. a sunny day).
*'''Spot''': Spot lights produce light constrained to a cone-shaped beam, and have some special features. They are the only light source that can be made visible with the 'halo' option, to simulate light in a fog. They are also the only light source that can cast buffer shadows (see below).
*'''Hemi''': 180°-wide uniform, shadowless light source. Great for use as a fill light, or as a back light, or to represent light from the sky. Similar to Sun, its position does not matter, only its direction.
*'''Area''': These are similar to point lamps, except that they are rectangular. As a result they can cast accurate raytraced soft shadows, at the expense of additional render time.

There are two different kinds of shadows that lights may cast: ''buffered'' and ''ray-traced''. The main difference is that buffered shadows are much quicker to calculate, but take more memory, and can be of lower quality without some fiddling. Also strand-rendered materials (as can be used for hair or fur) cannot cast ray shadows with the Blender Internal renderer, so you have to use buffer shadows for them so their shadows look realistic.

Only spot lamps can cast buffered shadows. Hemi lamps cannot cast shadows at all.

== Light Settings ==
Blender’s lights offer many settings you can mess with to adjust their effect, such as:
* '''Energy''' — the strength of the light.
* '''Colour''' — real lights often have a colour, rather than being pure white. It is common in photography to talk about lights adding “warm” (reddish/yellowish) or “cool” (bluish) tints to a scene.
* '''Falloff''' — real lights get weaker with distance according to the well-known [[w:Inverse-square law|inverse-square law]]. But Blender doesn’t force you to conform to reality: point and spot lamps also allow for other options, like inverse-linear or even a custom curve.
* '''Distance''' — even with inverse-square falloff, the intensity of real lights never quite goes to zero at any distance, though it may become too low to measure. Blender’s distance specification allows you to limit the effect of the light to a finite maximum distance. This can be useful for having multiple lights illuminating different parts of a scene, while minimizing unwanted interactions between them—a headache that real photographers and lighting technicians cannot avoid!
* '''Negative''' — instead of ''adding'' light to a scene, this light source can actually ''darken'' the scene. Again, not possible with real lights, but useful for certain kinds of effects.
* '''This Layer Only''' — this light only illuminates objects on the same layer(s). Another useful way to minimize unwanted interactions between different lights.
* '''Specular''' — uncheck this box to prevent this light illuminating specular parts of materials.
* '''Diffuse''' — uncheck this box to prevent this light illuminating diffuse parts of materials.

=== Lighting Without Lamps ===
It is possible to light a scene without lamps, or with fewer lamps. In the World Context [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]] of the Properties Window, there are three options, for “Environment Lighting”, “Ambient Occlusion” and “Indirect Lighting”.

Environment Lighting adds a shadowless light that seems to come from all directions and fill all parts of the scene.

Ambient Occlusion (“AO” for short) is supposed to mimic the effect of shadows darkening corners and crevices of real-world objects (in theory this should naturally fall out of accurate lighting calculations, but it is easier to compute it separately); Blender also allows you to use AO to ''brighten'' parts of the scene outside those corners and crevices.

Indirect Lighting tries to mimic light bouncing off diffuse surfaces and illuminating other diffuse surfaces. It only works when the “Gather” option (next panel down) is set to “Approximate”.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.68}}

[[File:BlenderSuzanneDefaultLighting.png|thumb|Blecch]]
Open a new Blender document. Delete the default cube, and insert the Monkey (Suzanne) instead. Hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render. You should get something like this.

See how the character’s face—arguably the most important part you usually want to look at—is in shadow? That is absolutely terrible lighting.

In this section, we will look at how to improve the lighting of this scene. The object of the game is not to get rid of ''all'' shadows, because flat-lit scenes tend to look pretty boring, too. Instead, we will look at how to make imaginative use of the placement and strength of highlights and shadows, to add interest and realism to the scene.

{{Clear}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''If you have any experience with photography''', a lot of this material should be familiar to you. Lighting in 3D rendering borrows a lot from the accumulated experience that photographers have had with lighting real-world scenes. However, because computer graphics cannot be 100% faithful to the laws of physics, some limitations apply. And also some tricks become possible that are simply not achievable in the real world.}}

In photography, there are basically two kinds of lighting setups: outdoor and indoor. In the real world, outdoor lighting (at least in daylight) is dominated by the Sun. This is a single, extremely strong light source. But there is also indirect sunlight reflected off other objects, including the sky, and these tend to soften the shadows and even add some colour to them. Outdoor close-up model photo shoots also frequently make use of metal sheets, held up by support crew, to deliberately add more of this indirect reflection and make the lighting of a model more even.

Indoor (studio) lighting setups are commonly described in terms of the number of lights employed, commonly “one-point”, “two-point” or “three-point” for 1, 2 or 3 lights.

In 3D graphics, you can cheat over this outdoor/indoor distinction. After all, the Sun is just another light source you can choose to place in a scene. Instead of metal reflectors, it is usually simpler to just add more lights, even if it is meant to be an outdoor scene. In Blender, the lights themselves need not show up in the render, only their illumination of the scene.

== One-Point Lighting ==
[[File:BlenderSuzanneOnePointLighting.png|thumb|Ho-hum]]
Continuing on from the above example, move the default lamp so it is roughly in the same location as the camera. Now your render should look something like this:

This is similar to the lighting you get when you take a picture on a point-and-shoot or cameraphone with flash enabled: because the light source is close to the lens, you don’t see many shadows (think about it: the parts the light doesn’t reach are close to the parts your vision doesn’t reach), leading to a very flat image. This is why experienced photographers often try to avoid using the flash.

{{Clear}}

== Two-Point Lighting ==
[[File:BlenderSuzanneTwoPointLighting.png|thumb|At least some variation...]]
This time I have gone back to the default light position, and added a second light (“fill light”) close to the camera, reducing its strength to 0.5, while the original “key light” stays at 1.0. That way the second light fills in the shadows just enough to make things legible, without flattening out the lighting completely.

The important point is that '''the key (brightest) light is not at the camera position'''. That way, the image will contain some interesting shadows.

{{Clear}}

== Three-Point Lighting ==
[[File:Blender268MonkeyBacklightPosition.png|thumb|Positioning the backlight]]

Now we add a ''third'' light, called the “backlight”. This is positioned behind and a little above the model, and serves to accentuate the upper silhouette (particularly the head and shoulders), and make our model stand out from the background. I set its energy to 2.0, to increase the effect. This screenshot shows what should be a good position for this light (it is directly above the green line of the Y-axis). Put it too close to Suzanne, and her bald head will glow a little ''too'' brightly. :)

{{Clear}}

[[File:BlenderSuzanneThreePointLighting.png|thumb|I’m ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille.]]
Now the render looks like this. Does the effect look familiar? You should have seen something like it in countless close-ups in film and TV, as well as portraits.

{{Clear}}

== Other Lighting Setups ==
Of course, there are countless other ways to light a scene. The above ones are mainly intended for close-ups and portraits. But where there are multiple characters in a scene, or even no characters at all and just the scene, you may want to position multiple lights to draw attention to some parts or characters while playing down other parts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== &lt;big&gt;'''Background'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ==== 
[[File:Prostate (normal and enlarged).jpg|thumbnail|right|National Cancer Foundation|Normal and Enlarged Prostate]]
===== '''''Prostate Cancer''''' =====
The prostate is part of the male reproductive system. The walnut sized organ is located below the bladder and in front of the bowel. Its primary function is to produce fluid to protect and enrich sperm&lt;ref name=&quot;PCFA&quot;&gt;Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia. (2013). The Prostate – What is it? Retrieved from Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia website: http://www.prostate.org.au/articleLive/pages/The-Prostate-%252d-What-is-it%3F.html &lt;/ref&gt;. The development of prostate cancer (PCa) occurs when the abnormal growth of cells mutate and form a tumour within the prostate. Left untreated, the tumour can spread to other areas of the body, including lymph nodes and bone, and can be life-threatening&lt;ref name=&quot;PCFA&quot;/&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
There are several symptoms associated with PCa, often dismissed as being a natural consequence of ageing&lt;ref name=&quot;PCFA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCI&quot;&gt;Prostate Cancer Institute. (2012). Exercise and Diet. Retrieved from Prostate Cancer Institute website: http://www.prostatecancer.org.au/PCI/Exercise_%26_Diet.html&lt;/ref&gt;. ''See further readings for an indepth description of symptoms''.&lt;br/&gt;

===== '''''Prevalence''''' =====
Prostate cancer has the highest level of incidence for men within Australian and New Zealand populations. Approximately 18,700 men are diagnosed each year, with an approximate 14.9% mortality rate (over a five year period) in Australian and New Zealand alone&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;World Health Organisation (2008). Globocan Fast Stats: Australia/New Zealand Cancer Statistics. Retrieved from WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer website:  http://globocan.iarc.fr/factsheet &lt;/ref&gt;. PCa is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths among the male population&lt;ref name=&quot;PCFA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Culos&quot;&gt;Culos-Reed, S. N., Robinson, J. W., Lau, H., Stephenson, L., Keats, M., Norris, S., ... Faris, P. (2010). Physical activity for men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: Benefits from a 16-week intervention. Support Care Cancer, 18, 591-599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;Smith, M, R., Finkelstein, J.S., McGovern, F.J., Zeitman, A.L., Fallon, M., Schoenfeld, D.A. &amp; Kantoff, P.W. (2002). Changes in body composition during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 87(2), 599-603.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
It is more common for PCa to impact men over 50 years of age. However younger individuals, with family history of PCa, have a greater risk of developing the cancer&lt;ref name=&quot;PCFA&quot;/&gt;.{{BookCat}}

===== '''''Androgens''''' ===== 
Androgens are primarily produced in the form of testosterone by the Leydig cells in the testes &lt;ref name=&quot;grossman&quot;&gt;Grossmann, M.E., Huang, H., &amp; Tindall, D.J. (2001). Androgen receptor signalling in androgen-refactory prostate cancer. Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 93(22), 1687-1697.&lt;/ref&gt;. It circulates in the blood where it binds with albumin and sex-hormone-binding-globulin&lt;ref name=&quot;feldman&quot;&gt;Feldman, B.J., &amp; Feldman, D. (2001). The development of androgen-independent prostate cancer. Nature Reviews Cancer, 1(1), 34-45.&lt;/ref&gt;. When testosterone enters prostate cells, it get converted to dihydrotestosterone, enabling it to have a greater affinity with the androgen receptors (AR)&lt;ref name=&quot;feldman&quot;/&gt;. The development of prostate cancer relies on AR for the growth of the cancerous cells to avoid apoptosis&lt;ref name=&quot;grossman&quot;/&gt;. As a result, standard therapy for PCa is to deprive the cancerous cells of the androgens, i.e. through androgen deprivation therapy&lt;ref name=&quot;feldman&quot;/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;

==== &lt;big&gt;'''Androgen Deprivation Therapy'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ====
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a widely utilised form of hormonal treatment for advanced prostate sufferers&lt;ref name=&quot;Galvao&quot;&gt;Galvao, D.A., Nosaka, K., Taaffe, D.R., Peake, J., Spry, N., Suzuki, K., ... Newton, R.U. (2007). Endocrine and immune responses to resistance training in prostate cancer patients. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases, 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsai&quot;&gt;Tsai, H.K., D’Amico, A.V., Sadetsky, N., Chen, M.H. &amp; Carroll, P.R. (2007). Androgen deprivation therapy for localised prostate cancer and the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 99(20), 1516-1524.&lt;/ref&gt;. ADT can be achieved through either surgical castration or medicinal administration of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH)&lt;ref name=&quot;Galvao&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Letsch&quot;&gt;Letsch, M., Schally, A.V., Stangelberger, A., Groot, K. &amp; Varga, J.L. (2004). Antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH) enhance tumour growth inhabitation induced by androgen deprivation in human MDA-Pca-2b prostate cancers. European Journal of Cancer, 40, 436-444.&lt;/ref&gt;. LH-RH acts through blocking the androgen receptors, suppressing growth of the cancerous cells&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsai&quot;/&gt;. 
The main aim of ADT is to reduce the size of the tumor in the prostate&lt;ref name=&quot;Galvao&quot;/&gt;, further increasing the survival rate by reducing the amount of testicular androgen production via LH-RH&lt;ref name=&quot;Galvao&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsai&quot;/&gt;.
Studies have identified ADT to adversely be associated with significant morbidities, including an increase in body mass index, increased fat deposition, muscle atrophy, reduced strength, decreased insulin sensitivity, osteoporosis, fatigue, depression and loss of sexual functioning&lt;ref name=&quot;Culos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsai&quot;/&gt;. Many of these side effects may compromise a patient’s quality of life (QOL)&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsai&quot;/&gt;, which can impair psychological wellbeing of the individual&lt;ref name=&quot;PCI&quot;/&gt;.

==== &lt;big&gt;'''Exercise: An Intervention'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ====
Pharmaceutical intervention is expensive and does not provide an intervention to improve physical functioning or quality of life&lt;ref name=&quot;Galvao&quot;/&gt;. Research has shown that men receiving ADT should undertake progressive resistance and aerobic training to alleviate the potential side effects of the treatment&lt;ref name=&quot;Galvao2&quot;&gt;Galvao, A, D., (2006). Resistance exercise in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. School of Exercise, biomedical and health sciences Edith Cowan University. 5,64-73&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;

As pedagogy theoretically articulates the transmission of knowledge from teachers to students, peeragogy describes the way peers produce and utilize knowledge together. We have been working together as a volunteer team since January, 2012 to build a public domain [[Peeragogy_Handbook_V1.0|Peeragogy Handbook]] that communicates practical strategies for successful collaboration, learning, and adaptation. We see Wikimedia as a living case study in peeragogy. In the six-month project we propose, we would use peeragogical methods to enhance Wikimedia as a peer-learning platform.</text>

== [[Template:Rndnear]] - unprotect or edit please ==

Hi. I would like to request an admin to either unprotect [[Template:Rndnear]] so that I can edit it, or else an admin edit the page directly.

The only thing that needs to be done to the template is to wrap the current function with &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;s&gt;ifnumber&lt;/s&gt;isnumeric|1=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; at the beginning, and &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;s&gt;|3=&lt;/s&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; at the end.

For a working example with the change (that you can copy and paste, which may be the easiest), please see [[User:Willscrlt/Rndnear]]. I have tested it to be sure that everything works correctly.

FYI -- I would consider this a low-risk template since only 4 pages outside of its own docs, its own talk page, and my test page currently transclude it. However, I am planning on incorporating it as a subtemplate within another template that will be used throughout the [[Bartending]] Guide, so it may become more important after that happens. *shrug*

Either way, help one way or the other would be appreciated. Thanks! &lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 09:13, 9 September 2013 (UTC)

: That would ''break the template''.  It doesn't work right.  {{tl|ifnumber}} returns 1 if true, which is almost always the wrong answer for {{tl|rndnear}}.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:28, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
::Yeah. I didn't do enough test cases. In my test case, it rounded to 1, and that's the answer I got, so it looked right.

== CSS styles NavFrame, NavHead, and NavContent ==

Hi again. I just ported the {{tl|collapsible list}} template over from en.wiki. In the process, I believed that Lua modules support didn't seem to be enabled here yet. No biggie, I thought. I just went back a version or two before the template was converted to Lua, and I tried that version here. It didn't work either. I looked into the CSS used by the template and compared it with what my browser pulled down. I discovered that three classes (NavFrame, NavHead, and NavContent) were not being sent from WikiBooks. Naturally, that would explain why the templates aren't working here. Any chance that those styles could be added to common.css (or whatever the name of the best CSS file is to implement that)? Also, was my assumption about Lua modules incorrect, and Lua module support IS active, and I just couldn't tell because of the CSS problem? Thanks! &amp;mdash;[[User:Willscrlt|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#007FFF&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FC2847&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Willscrlt|“Talk”]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[w:en:User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;span title=&quot;Talk at English Wikipedia&quot;&gt;“w:en”&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[commons:User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;span title=&quot;Talk at Wikimedia Commons&quot;&gt;“com”&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[m:User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;span title=&quot;Talk at Meta Wikipedia&quot;&gt;“m”&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/small&gt; 01:03, 10 September 2013 (UTC)

== Enable Cat-a-lot Gadget on en.books please ==

Hi. I was just working through [[Special:UncategorizedTemplates]], and I was about to do some categorization, when I realized that the most useful tool to do so is not enabled on this wiki. Can we please add the Cat-a-lot Gadget to this Wiki? If you are not familiar with the tool, see [[commons:Help:Gadget-Cat-a-lot]] for all the details. In a nutshell, it gives editors an easy way to add, remove, or change categories on a page or image without having to open a lot of pages in edit mode, make the changes, and then save them all. It's a great time saver! Thanks. &amp;mdash;[[User:Willscrlt|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#03D&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#B01&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Willscrlt|“Talk”]]&amp;nbsp;[[w:en:User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;span title=&quot;Talk at English Wikipedia&quot;&gt;“w:en”&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/small&gt; 10:24, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
: I point out that Wikibooks does not, under current procedures, categorize individual pages of a book except by putting {{tl|BookCat}} on them, and the main page of a book is categorized mostly via {{tl|subjects}}.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:36, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
::I spent a lot of time reading through all the relevant pages, templates, and categories on the subject, and I see now how Cat-a-lot--even in the hands of a well-meaning editor, like me--could cause more damage than good here. Since categorization via templates is the standard means of categorizing, cat-a-lot would sort of circumvent that. Too bad there's not a tag-a-lot gadget to do the same thing that cat-a-lot does, but with templates instead. :-) Please consider my request for cat-a-lot to be rescinded. I think there ''might'' still be some benefit to enabling it for experienced en.book editors familiar with categorization here, it probably would increase workload rather than help.
::Would AWB be an alternative that would work here? I used to use it before I replaced my computer. I haven't reinstalled it on my newer one. But if that is a good way to tag pages and templates here with proper templates, then it might be worth it for me to reinstall. Do we need to be authorized for AWB specifically on en.books? Or would my en.wiki authorization count? If not, where do I make that request?

::::AWB usage - Something like tagging all of the CPT* (and other) templates in [[Special:UncategorizedTemplates]] with their appropriate templates. It's not a huge deal to do it manually, but I'd rather speed up the process. After all, if we have the tools, why not use them?
::::My head is still reeling fro your Wndialog tools. Those are just regular templates (albeit on steroids)? I am constantly impressed by how creative people are when it comes to wikitext, parser and string functions, and magic words. Now that they have added Lua modules, things are going to go even crazier and more wonderful (though the editing tool could use some improvement). I don't think you answered me (or I didn't see it yet) -- are LUA modules enabled on en.books?
:::: Visual Editor... Um. Yeah. I don't get what's hard about wikitext. I've used other wiki software, supposedly simpler than MediaWiki, but, to me at least, they are clunky and difficult. MW's wikitext is very straight forward and simple to use, read, and edit (well, tables intermixed with templates--especially esoteric ones--can't get unwieldy pretty quickly). I don't see how the Visual Editor is going to help, and I worry about how badly it will screw up the more complex wikitext on some pages (especially the kind I just described). While I guess it will be beneficial to have previously disenfranchised editors that couldn't wrap their heads around wikitext, I wonder about how good of a job they are going to do, and how willing they are going to be to abide by the policies and guidelines, let alone learn the quirks of each different sister project and language variation. If you have a bunch of editors who are unable to dedicate the time to learning the basics of a simple markup language, are they going to strive to learn anything else about their environment? Personally, as long as I can opt-out and completely disable the VE, then I will be happy. If I am forced to deal with it, well, I will adapt. I won't have a choice in that case, will I? And, if the VE makes it too hard to edit, I'll probably just fade off into the mists of memory along with many other disillusioned veteran editors. Obviously, I hope that won't happen. I don't thnk that was a rant on my part, but it was my first time expressing my opinions on VE. &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#007FFF&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FC2847&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt| Talk ]]{{!}}[[w:en:User talk:Willscrlt| w:en ]]{{!}}[[commons:User talk:Willscrlt| com ]]{{!}}[[meta:User talk:Willscrlt| meta ]])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 07:49, 10 September 2013 (UTC)

::::: Ah, yes, duh &amp;mdash; you ''started'' all this by saying you were looking at [[Special:UncategorizedTemplates]].  Back at the time we souped up {{tl|BookCat}} to work for nearly everything, I think AWB was, in fact, used in categorizing nearly everything on the project.

::::: Is Lua not available?  There's a module namespace.  I was under the impression what was missing was libraries; and I've never paid enough attention to Lua to know whether there's any provision for inheriting Lua modules from some central point (commons or meta or something) or whether they all have to be brought in from elsewhere.

::::: Btw, speaking of bringing in from elsewhere &amp;mdash; the preferred way to do this is to [[WB:RFI|request import]].

::::: The templates in my wndialog facility are actually not very powerful; they simply provide a neat interface for generating html with class tags on it.  The muscle is provided by some (pointedly small) javascript in Common.js, which finds the tagged html elements and converts them into dialog boxes and buttons and stuff.  Then there's javascript elsewhere, that doesn't get expensively loaded on every page access (unlike Common.js), that makes the real magic happen.  {{red|&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt;}}An equivalent facility would be a lot faster if it were a wiki extension instead of being done with javascript, but a wiki extension would be subject to the wikimedian bureaucracy, which the non-Wikipedian sisters have learned the hard way to think of as fundamentally unfriendly to non-Wikipedia sisters.  So I assumed the only way to make my vision a reality would be to do it all myself, which meant javascript.  (Lua, which would only appear on the scene when I was about a year and a half into my project, doesn't provide any of the things I set out to accomplish, and in fact I've only used it once, for something that the standard magic words annoyingly don't support.)

::::: I haven't decided what I think of the Lua extension.  I immediate saw some downsides.  It's making programming a lot more complicated, in fact introducing a whole new programming language into the mix, thus fostering yet another ''high priesthood'' of users who know the additional language, in order to solve inadequacies of power of the magic words and template facility of wiki markup, which they ''could'' have instead devoted resources to improving.  That's in contrast to my tools whose design focuses on enabling things to be done ''within'' wiki markup, on the assumption that wiki markup is to be the ''one'' language ordinary wiki contributors deal with.  And at the same time, it doesn't really provide the sorts of fundamentally new capabilities I long since identified as the key need of the wikimedia sisters, which my tools seek to address.  There ''is'' a linguistic problem that Lua addresses, which is that the set of magic words is a rats' nest of underpowered features that aren't well coordinated with each other, and rather than attempt to apply some overall design vision to figuring out what is needed to extend the set of magic words in a coherent way, they simply bring in a full-blown programming language that already has far more coherent design than they've achieved with the magic words.  This ignores however the very real design merits of the existing template system, which I got very familiar with when developing [[Template:Navlist]] (facilities I never ''quite'' finished to the point where they'd be ready to start using systematically on all books, and now I suppose they'd want a major overhaul in consideration of Lua).  The way templates avoid unbounded recursion and therefore avoid creating exploits in a universally-available facility is quite clever imho.

::::: Wiki markup is dead easy; that, in case anyone's forgotten, is ''why wiki markup took off like wildfire in the first place''.  One of the best parts of it is that if you don't know how to do something you can just imitate where it's already done.  The other day I decided to try out the Visual Editor on what seemed like a very minor edit, and only realized once I was using VE that what I wanted was to add an item to a bulleted list.  But I hadn't the faintest idea how to do that.  If I'd been a newbie contributor using the simple, straightforward text-editing interface, it'd be dead easy for me to add an item to a bulleted list because I'd be ''looking'' at examples of how to do it (the items already on the list); but afaics the Visual Editor means everything is made harder for newbies because you don't get to see examples of how things are done.  Instead of a single language of wiki markup with various gradations of skill, and examples right there to help you use stuff that's a little beyond your experience, you're provided with multiple languages (the same mistake as with Lua) and it's made harder to advance from complete ignorance.  Even if they don't discourage the veteran wikimedians with expertise from continuing to contribute, they'll discourage newcomers from becoming experts.  And the biggest problem with all the wikimedian sisters, I believe, ''including'' Wikipedia, is that it neeeds to become easier for newcomers to perform, and learn, expert tasks.  So I basically said &quot;screw this&quot; and went to use the simple text-based editor; why should I have to puzzle out an additional problem that's been gratuitously thrown in my way?

::::: It seems they're throwing technical solutions at the wrong problems because&amp;nbsp; (a)&amp;nbsp;they've mididentified the technical problem, per above, and&amp;nbsp; (b)&amp;nbsp;they're in denial about the very real social problems that have been discouraging newcomers from Wikipedia for years.{{red|&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;}}  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:42, 10 September 2013 (UTC)
== Development Stages ==

Hi,

I would like to suggest to repaint the 75% image in blue:[[Image:75%.svg]]

This image is used for the development stages:
{{Stages}}

The order of the colors is not logical. It is too close from 25%. It's confusing at a glance. [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 20:12, 9 August 2013 (UTC)
#{{Support}} I have long thought that the colors are, um, a bit &quot;weird&quot;. It would seem that they should go from a more alarming color (red) for the smallest one (developing text), to something like pumpkin or gold for maturing, something calm and mellow--like the blue you recommend--for Developed text, and the bright green and the gray make sense where they are. I think that Maturing text is okay with the violet, but once Developed changes to blue, they might be too similar. That's why a gold/orange color might be a better choice. &amp;mdash;[[User:Willscrlt|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#03D&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#B01&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Willscrlt|“Talk”]]&amp;nbsp;[[w:en:User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;span title=&quot;Talk at English Wikipedia&quot;&gt;“w:en”&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/small&gt; 09:27, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
#:OK, so I can change the [[:Image:75%.svg|Developed text]]. Then I will wait to see if anybody agree and after that we can change the Maturing text but it will need at least one more support.

:Thanks for the cautionary warning. I was aware of that, and I had already downloaded the source files to change their colors and reupload as a new set. I also was thinking of making a set that works in 1/8s. Sometimes the jump between 1/4s--especially in larger books--can be quite big. We already have one that works in decimals (although it looks totally different), so there appears to be nothing sacred about 25% increments. Traditional, maybe, but not inviolate.

== Temperature conversions in Lua ==

I've created [[Module:Temperature]], which is an attempt to make temperature conversion a little bit more standardized and nice-looking.

The module could use a little polishing, and I'm going to be working on that over the next couple of hours, but I'd appreciate suggestions about what it should look like.

The first few improvements I'm going to work on will be adding gas mark conversions (according to the existing [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures]] page) and playing with the output of temperatures. I'd really like to trash the ref-based implementation and use tooltips instead, but I think that will require some gadget hacking and I'd rather not jump to that if I don't have to.

I'll likely also be writing a conversion module for other measurements - cups, teaspoons, gallons, quarts, etc., over the next week or so. I don't know what that will look like yet.

Cheers! --[[User:MarkTraceur|MarkTraceur]] ([[User talk:MarkTraceur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MarkTraceur|contribs]]) 21:36, 29 September 2013 (UTC)

:Update, I've converted it to using {{tl|H:title}}, so it should work a little better now. See the [[Module:Temperature|documentation]] for a how-to. :) --[[User:MarkTraceur|MarkTraceur]] ([[User talk:MarkTraceur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MarkTraceur|contribs]]) 23:06, 29 September 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Designing your game should be the first step in making your game. Now, oftentimes you will end up designing your game as you go. You'll be constantly reinventing, reevaluating, and remaking your game. If you start using the studio with a game design, make it, and never change a single plan, there is probably something fundamentally wrong with your game. In this chapter, we will go over designing your game, and more specifically, utilizing ROBLOX's cloud-hosted game platform to quickly receive feedback to revise your game. We'll go over what to do, and not to do, in terms of graphics and looks, as well as functionality.

== Finding an idea ==

Finding a game idea can be hard. With many of the ideas you may get, there will be many things wrong with the design. The concept may be unachievable, or just have technical difficulties or restrictions that prevent its accomplishment. In this case, you'll want to refine the design. Remembering finding a game idea isn't the hard part, the hard part is making it, and having the willpower to do so. Here are some suggestions that should help you find a game idea:

* What's your favorite game? What irks you about it? What can you improve? Do it!
* Pick a genre. Think of what sort of game you would want to play in it. Do it!
* Ask on ROBLOX's Game Design forum, or use another such resource—there's always someone there who has a good idea.
* Piggyback on someone else's project (there are many groups on ROBLOX that exist for this purpose).
* Research it, on the web, for example! Get inspired by what you can find elsewhere, what you've experienced, and what you enjoy.  
* Ask yourself &quot;Do you really want to make this game?&quot; and &quot;Would I play this game?&quot;

Once you have an idea in mind, you want to analyze it for several things. You want to make sure it's feasible. Think of each component of the game and ask yourself how you can do it and whether you have seen it before: if you haven't seen it before, in particular on ROBLOX, and you can't think of how to do it, ask a more experienced game developer and designer who may have a clear idea on how to do it. People who are more experienced than you will usually have a more clear view of the situation than you, and can share that view with you, which can help you greatly. With all of this in mind, you'll want to start the most important part.

== Recording your idea ==

Yes, you need to record your idea. You need to write it down. Especially if it's a group project, or a project others will be helping you on. You must do this because recording your idea provides several things for you:

* '''Recording your idea will help prevent loss of motivation.''' Most people tend to lose motivation in their projects due to not knowing what to do next.  By having a specific guide there, in front of you, scheduled out and planned, when you ask yourself &quot;What do I need to do to make this game working?&quot; you will easily have a solution right there in front of you.  Oftentimes uploading this document to the cloud can prove most beneficial when working with groups, as you can constantly mark off, and debate over topics in the project. Planning and coordination in a group project are one of the keys to success, more so in the virtual world of ROBLOX where motivation is purely from want—chances are that no one is paying you to make your own game.
* '''Recording your idea will give you something to show off.''' When recruiting people to a group project, or even when fans gather and ask you about your game, you want ''something'' to show off. You need to inspire, make them stop, and differentiate between your project and the dozens of other opportunities that exist on ROBLOX. The best developers are picking the best games, and in order to make your game the best, it must be ''professional'' and well planned. 
* '''Recording your idea will allow you to plan.''' As mentioned in the previous paragraph, planning is required. When you plan out your game, you discover potential problems, and can receive feedback before it's made. As a single person you will not be able to catch all the mistakes in your own mind.

== Leveraging support ==

It is important to remember that, as in the real world, making a successful game that is played not only requires a good idea, a finished and polished core, but also marketing. This is also the case for ROBLOX games, but marketing is much less difficult, because the game is hosted by ROBLOX and is mentioned in various places on the website. Regardless, if you want to get a big community of players to play your game, you will need to spend some time marketing it.

== Time management ==

Managing your time is essential when developing a game. It is sometimes a good idea when developing a game for ROBLOX to first complete the plan and then to skip the first fourth of the plan to directly get something working, even if it is something that is not as good as what the plan requires. Having a working demonstration makes it possible to get feedback and to have an area where it is possible to try things: with a working demonstration, it is possible to try things in the game directly before the basic infrastructure of the project is completed.

== Game constituents ==

Games on ROBLOX consist of three elements: '''the game engine''', which is part of ROBLOX and handles the physical world, the rendering (displaying of your game), the networking (the communication between the server and clients) and other things, '''the game content''', which is composed of maps, buildings, images, assets and other items that are created by the developer, and '''the game code''', which is what makes the game interactive and what forms the player experience. The game content was already covered in part in the previous chapter. The game engine will be the subject of the next  chapter, and the game code will be the subject of the other chapters, along with the game content.</text>

      <comment>/* Denary numbers in binary */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">You already know the denary number system (although you might not have known what it is called).  Denary is the number system we use in our everyday lives and has ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.  In computing we also use the [[GCSE Computer Science/Hexadecimal|hexadecimal]] and '''binary''' number systems.

In binary we have only two digits 0 and 1.  Computers as we know them today are electronic machines which at their most basic level are simply a collection of billions and billions of switches which can be either on (represented by the digit 1) and off (represented by the digit 0).  For Humans to be able to work with computers we need ways of representing all of the data we use in binary.  Everything you see on your computer screen can be converted in to binary so that it can be processed by the computer.  In this section you will learn how all numbers, text, pictures, videos and sounds can be represented in binary.

==Denary numbers in binary==
In denary if we want to use numbers bigger than 9 we have to start using multiple numerals.  The number three-thousand, one-hundred and forty is shown in denary in figure 1 below.
[[File:Denary-3140.PNG|center|frame|Figure 1: The number three-thousand, one-hundred and forty shown in denary]]

This works in a very similar way with binary.  Here we can see how the number forty would be represented in binary.

==Vocabulary==

===Engram===
The neural representation of memory that has been stored.

===Equipotentiality===
The principle that if certain areas of specialization, the specialization may be lost is the whole area is removed; but it may not be lost if a small part of the area is spared or other parts of the brain may take on the role of the damaged portion.

===Ethology===
The scientific study of animals in their natural environment to learn about the animals' natural and instinctive behaviors. Karl Lorenz and  Nikolaas Tinbergen were considered ethologists.

===Functionalism===
Emphasis on the how or why of mental operations rather than the content.

=== General Factor of Intelligence ===
Also known as  'g'. General intelligence that is thought to underlie specialized types of intelligence. Often measured by correlating results of a variety of intellectual tasks (subtests) which results in an IQ score.  

===Gestalt===
Focus on the whole as an area of interest rather than reducing mental operations to their parts.

===Hormic===
Focus on instincts.

=== Idiographic ===
Focuses on the individual case. A perspective in psychology that is opposite to the nomological approach.

===Evolutionary Theories ===
Larmarck: An organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring

Darwin: Specific variations give the advantage or disadvantage in the competition for a mate. The inherited traits that are passed down to the offspring make it more likely for an organism to survive and reproduce become more common in a population over successive generations

=== Longitudinal Research===
A research method where the same individual is studied over several time points.

===Maturation===
Development after birth in an orderly sequence.  For example, a baby learns to crawl, then, proceeds to learn to walk (p.412).

===Mass Action===
Memory cannot be confined to a cortical area, but is dispersed throughout the cortex.

=== Nativism ===
We are born to perceive as we do.

===Neuroscience=== 
Physiological psychology that is mainly concerned with the brain and nervous system. The aim is to understand the relationship between mind and body, or mind and brain.

=== Nomothetic ===
A science of quantitative laws. A perspective in psychology that is opposite to the idiographic approach.

===Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny===
Dead end theory in developmental psychology by Ernst Haeckel. Theory suggested that the growth and development changes in size and shape of a particular organism reflect evolution from the beginning of its fertilization (embryo) and developing through its adulthood.

===Operationism===
A point of view where scientific concepts are defined by their measurement. 

===Phenomenology===
The study of how individual experiences determine the way that we perceive; related to the subjective sensory experience. 

===Phrenology===
Phrenology is the belief of mapping the brain with specific areas to precise functions. In the 18th and 19th century Phrenology was widely accepted but not academically proven. It was even believed that certain mental behaviors could be measured by the size of a specific portion of the brain. Phrenology was eventually proven to be pseudoscience, but contributed towards further developing the neuroscience field.

===Reductionism===
Explaining complex phenomena by reducing it to its units or elements. 

===Sociobiology===
Field related to psychology. Focuses on the influence of evolution on the social behavior of humans and animals. 

===Structuralism===
Emphasis on the content of consciousness rather than the process.

===Vicarious Functioning=== 
A concept developed by Franz that an eliminated habit may be restored through learning in another part of the brain.

==Schools and Systems==

===Animal Psychology===
Study of psychology of animals either because an animal model is a convenient substitute for humans or to learn more about animal behavior and cognition. 

=== Clinical psychology===
Focuses on providing professional services to people who are mentally unwell. Clinical psychologists assess, diagnose, treat, and prevent mental disorders. The field was named and defined by Witmer in 1907.

===Comparative Psychology===
Study of the cross-species relationships between humans and animals in search for the understanding of human behavior.

===Cognitive Psychology===
This perspective focuses on the whole range of mental activities, including attention and perception, and higher mental processes such as remembering.

===Organizational Psychology===
The application of psychological principles to the workplace. The study of helping an organization perform at its best when considering the needs of the workers and the organization as a whole.

==Theories==
===Cannon's Emergency Theory ===
Suggests that emotions result when the thalamus sends a message to the brain in response to a stimulus, resulting in a physiological reaction; we react to a stimulus and experience the associated emotion at the same time. Cannon’s theory contradicts James-Lange theory, which argues that physiological responses occur first and result and are the cause of emotions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The IUPAC system of nomenclature is a set of logical rules framed which are mainly aimed at giving an unambiguous name to an organic compound. By using this system, it is possible to give a systematic name to an organic compound just by looking at its structure and it is also possible to write the structure of organic compound by following the IUPAC name for that compound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background: ==
==== What is a Stroke? ====
A stroke will occur when there is a disruption of blood flow to the brain. The lack of blood causes a lack of oxygen which is what damages the brain &lt;ref name=&quot;Stroke Foundation&quot;&gt;Stroke Foundation. (2013). What is a Stroke. Available: http://strokefoundation.com.au/what-is-a-stroke/. Last accessed 4th Oct 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;. Depending on what section of the brain is starved of oxygen varies the disabilities that will result. These dead cells can cause disabilities in how you move your body, your sensory systems function, language, how you think, and your memory&lt;ref name= &quot;Effects of Stroke&quot;&gt;Stroke Foundation. (2013). Effects of Stroke. Available: http://strokefoundation.com.au/what-is-a-stroke/effects-of-stroke/. Last accessed 4th Oct 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
=====Types of strokes:=====
* Ischaemic: This occurs when there is a blockage of the artery which stops the blood flow to the brain &lt;ref name= &quot;Types of Stroke&quot;&gt; Stroke Foundation. (2013). Types of Stroke. Available: http://strokefoundation.com.au/what-is-a-stroke/types-of-stroke/. Last accessed 4th Oct 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;.
* Haemorrhagic: This occurs when there is a break in the artery wall causing the blood to be released on the brain stopping oxygen and nutrients to the brain &lt;ref name= &quot;Types of Stroke&quot;&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==== What is Hemiparesis? ====
Hemiparesis is the loss of strength on one side of the body. Hemiparesis is prevalent in 80 percent of all stroke victims. The legs, arms and face can all be effected by this loss of muscle strength, making it difficult to do daily activities such as eating, dressing and grabbing objects. &lt;ref name= &quot;Hemiparesis&quot;&gt;National Stroke Association. (2012). Paralysis. Available: http://www.stroke.org/site/PageServer?pagename=hemiparesis. Last accessed 4th Oct 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Quality of Life:==
Quality of Life (QOL) is defined by the World Health Organisation as an &quot;individuals perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns.&quot; &lt;ref name= &quot;WHO&quot;&gt;World Health Organisation. (1997). Measuring Quality of Life. Programme on Mental Health. - (1), 1&lt;/ref&gt;. Depending on how damaging the stroke is and how affected the patient is by the severity of their hemiparesis, effects their chance to function normally in society post stroke. The ability to achieve goals and to make expectations on normal daily life is drastically reduced due to their inability to function independently.  

==Benefits of Aerobic Exercise on QOL:==
The main benifit from aerobic exercise is the adaptation that allows the patient to perform day to day tasks with greater ease. In addition, it reduces the tiredness and fatigue of the patient so the body can increase its efficiency in daily life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strength Training&quot;&gt;Swank, A. (2008). Adaptations to Aerobic Endurance Training. In: Beachle, T. and Earle, R Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning. USA: National Strength and Conditioning Association. 122-129&lt;/ref&gt;. There are so many different physcial and mental barriers that are associated with having chronic dissabilities that make it difficult for health promoting exercise to occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adaptive Physical activity&quot;&gt; Macko,R. Benvenuti,F. Stanhope,S. Macellari,V. Taviani,A. Nesi,B. Weinrich,M. Stuart,M. (2008). Adaptive physical activity improves mobility function and quality of life in chronic hemiparesis.. Journal of Rehabilitation Research &amp; Development. 45 (2), pg1-4&lt;/ref&gt;. These barriers if not overcome with simple and beneficial exercises, are what lead to the decline in QOL due to the sedentary behaviour of the patient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Circuit Training&quot;&gt;Dean,C. Richards,C. Malouin,F.. (2000). Task-Related Circuit Training Improves Performance of Locomotor Tasks in Chronic Stroke:. Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 81 (-), 409-417.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown the positive effects of aerobic exercise on perceived exertion. One study showed in the pre test that the maximal perceived exertion of a participant was the equivalent of vacuuming for 5 minutes with rest intervals. Post 8 weeks their new perceived maximal exertion was equivalent to walking 2 miles non-stop. &lt;ref name= &quot;Muscle Strengthening&quot;&gt; Fuscaldi, L. Olney,S. Nadeau, S. Brouwer, B.. (1999). Muscle Strengthening and Physcial Conditiong to Reduce Impairment and Disability in Chronic Strok Survivors. Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 80 (-), 1215&lt;/ref&gt;.

==What else can be done?==

====Aerobic and Strength Training:====
Evidence has shown that aerobic training combined with strenth training leads to large gains in overall QOL.&lt;ref name= &quot;Effects of Exercise on QOL&quot;&gt;Chen, D. Rimmer, J. (2011). Effects of Exercise on Quality of Life on Stroke Survivors. Journal of the American Heart Association. 42 (-), 835.&lt;/ref&gt; With the added muscular strengthening program the patients are able to gain more movement in their muscle effected by the hemiparesis. Gaining grip strength and the increase in range of movement can lead to independence which will then lead to a better quality of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Effects of Exercise on QOL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Limitations:====
Limitations in the research involved with this field are the number of willing volunteers to participate. The sample size of all the research done are below 20 participants, with the age differences varying from 50 to 85. This means that the benefits aren't spread evenly between all participants due to the ability to adapt to exercise. Obviously in some cases exercise isn't possible due to age and the severity of the stroke, this can make for false positive tests during the research. If the participants are all volunteering it means they are driving for success, meaning they are more motivated which will usually see greater results and more adaptations to training.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muscle Strengthening&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====More Research Needed:====
The research is very limited in the field of aerobic exercise improving quality of life alone. There hasn't been enough research into the long term benefits of the exercise programs. This is due to the expenses and voluntary nature of these kinds of studies.

[[:W:Lefse|&lt;span class=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;Lefse&lt;/span&gt;]] is a potato-based Norwegian dish that's great as a dessert, as a side, or as a main course with the appropriate filling. It's similar to a [[Cookbook:crêpe|crêpe]] in that you can add many different fillings to create a different dish each time.

== Ingredients ==
* &lt;span class=&quot;ingredient&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;cups&lt;/span&gt; mashed russet potatoes&lt;/span&gt;

== Equipment ==
* Large pot for boiling potatoes
* Flat griddle of approximately 16 inches diameter
* Rolling pin
* Potato masher
* Potato peeler (or knife)

== Procedure ==
&lt;div class=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;
# Boil and mash the potatoes
# Mix with melted butter
# If preparing ahead, refrigerate overnight, and take the potatoes out one hour before beginning the rest of the preparation
# Mix sugar, salt, cream, and potato mix in a large bowl
# Gradually stir in flour
# Using about two tablespoons (or a golf ball-sized chunk) of mix at a time, roll mix into flat, round shapes on a flat, smooth surface. Use flour to keep the mix from sticking to the surface and the rolling pin.
# Place the round lefse on the griddle, cook until browned on bottom, flip and repeat.
# Add toppings, and serve hot!
&lt;/div&gt;

== Toppings ==
* A favourite sweet recipe is to simply spread melted butter on each piece and sprinkle sugar over it, then roll the lefse into a cylindrical shape and serve hot. About 1-2 teaspoons of sugar should do the trick for lefse of about 10 inches diameter.

== Tips ==
* Stirring the flour into the mix may be very difficult, especially in drier climates. An electric mixer might help, or you might consider adding extra cream to the mix in order to ease the process.
* Your objective when rolling out the lefse is to get it to be very thin. This becomes more difficult as you go because it may begin to fall apart, and even if it doesn't, you may have difficulty prying it up when it's time to transfer it to the griddle.
* While adding flour to the lefse itself may increase the ease of rolling it out, it may also make the lefse tougher in texture, which is undesirable.
* It may be useful to hand-pat the lefse until it's about 1/2 or 1/4 inch thick, then use a rolling pin to roll it out the rest of the way.
* It might also help to flip the lefse when you're about halfway done rolling it out. This may give you a chance to add more flour to the prep surface, too.
* As you gain the ability to make thinner lefse, you might try getting larger amounts of the mixture at a time, and producing larger lefse.

== Background ==

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_training Resistance Training] is any training that primarily stresses the musculo-skeletal system, as opposed to Aerobic or Cardio-vascular training. Resistance Training is used to improve muscle strength, bone density, motor pathways, and connective tissue strength. It can also be used to improve balance, and as a rehabilitation or amelioration activity for people with chronic diseases or severe injuries.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke Stroke] is a neurological impairment, caused by either a lack of blood flow to an area of the brain ([http://www.heartandstroke.com/atf/cf/%7B99452D8B-E7F1-4BD6-A57D-B136CE6C95BF%7D/stroke_isc_web.jpg ischemic]), or a hemorrhage ([http://www.heartandstroke.com/atf/cf/%7B99452D8B-E7F1-4BD6-A57D-B136CE6C95BF%7D/stroke_hem_web.jpg hemorrhagic]). This can result in loss of sight, speech, or movement functionality, often on only one side of the body &lt;ref&gt;http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484157/k.8AD7/Stroke__Effects_of_a_stroke.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Impairments to motor control can severely limit capacity of patients to move, perform day to day tasks, and remain independent –either financially or socially.

This article investigates the uses of Resistance Training in the rehabilitation of Stroke patients. Stroke sufferers often lose the ability to innovate muscle groups effectively, and are subsequently severely impaired in day to day activities. They suffer from loss of coordination, strength, and mobility in the affected regions.

== Stroke and Resistance Training ==


Resistance Training has been demonstrated to improve a variety of recovery and rehabilitation metrics in Stroke patients. Resistance Training activities can be used to facilitate improvements in strength, movement functionality, and motor function for Stroke patients. A meta-analyses by Morris et al. &lt;ref&gt;http://cre.sagepub.com/content/18/1/27.short&lt;/ref&gt; found that there were few reported negative effects to strength training stroke patients, while achieving large effect sizes and improvements in practical activities like walking up stairs. Ouellette et al. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cebp.nl/media/m1082.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; found that high intensity Resistance Training over 12 weeks had a variety of benefits when compared to a control group who completed only stretching. Flansbjer et al. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mjl/sreh/2008/00000040/00000001/art00007&lt;/ref&gt; found that strength training improved the speed and ease with which older patients could stand upright from a seated position, in addition to increases in overall strength. Meanwhile, a 4 year longitudinal study, again from Flansbjer et al. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22366878&lt;/ref&gt; found that strength gains from Resistance Training were maintained which indicates that there are significant long term benefits to Resistance Training as a rehabilitation intervention. Weiss et al. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10892623&lt;/ref&gt; determined that for patients &gt;60 years old, resistance training not only improved strength and motor functionality, but also increased competency in both static and dynamic balance. These studies also found that strength was improved on both the impaired, and non-impaired side, which indicates that resistance training provides a benefit for stroke patients beyond rehabilitation of their movement and motor control.

== Recommendations ==


Stroke patients should consult with their doctor regarding the integration of Resistance Training as a recovery intervention. It is vital that patients undergo a pre-exercise screening; Stroke victims may have additional morbidity risks which need to be taken into account when designing the resistance training program &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncpad.org/94/706/Resistance~Training~for~Persons~with~Physical~Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;. Resistance Training for recovery and rehabilitation from stroke should be undertaken with care, using a program defined by a health professional. Weight or resistance used in the program should be moderate to low, at least initially. Neurological gains can be made through lifting with the damaged, or undamaged side. Fixed joint activities such as leg extension, leg press, ankle dorsiflexion and other similar activities are recommended as they remove the requirement for the patient to stand and balance during the activity.

The [http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/ American Heart Association] includes Resistance training in its recommendations for the recovery and rehabilitation of Stroke patients&lt;ref&gt;http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/109/16/2031.full&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also recommended that the prescribing professional take consideration to integrating other exercise types to enhance rehabilitation and complement the gains obtained from Resistance Training. Incorporating other types of exercise into the rehabilitation of a Stroke victim will also assist in reducing further risk factors, particularly in the case of cardio-vascular type exercise activity.

So far we used Internet to reach out directly to the public.  Why do not we try to use also a means for distribution?

We decided to create a  [[File:Google plus 32.png|17px]]  [https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/105351488204270692301/communities/105969776192653058150 Google+ community] specifically dedicated to distribution, and we started building the partnerships for distribution and broadcast of the edited episodes.  Which we continued to edit as the story of the documentary moved on in  overcoming the distribution challenges.  Thanks to the feedback from the distributor-community and of the users of [[Development Cooperation Handbook|this Wikibook]], we got new ideas for improvement and customization of the documentary for specific target audiences. &lt;br /&gt;

Wilma, who was the first of the members of the producing team to share the efforts for distributing the documentary  posed an important question.  But which broadcaster would be interested to distribute on the &quot;small screen&quot; something that is being already &quot;aired&quot; through the Internet?  I had not thought to it, since for me these are different medias and surely is interesting to make a film of something that already has been seen in theaters  and read in books.  Internet and TVs  have different audiences and are seen through a different relational pragmatics. They can well coexist.  But the mentality of Television is generally very narrowly confined to self centered stereotypes and they want to be &quot;the news&quot;, which for them often means &quot;the first&quot;  (as if the whole people were watching the whole palimpsest of all the televisions all the time!) . 

I suggested her to challenge this self centered notion of the televisions,  And actually present to the television the fact (that was true) that we were narrating (in the television)  the story of how a group of people had created an Internet channel and a wikibook on the International Cooperation of development.  It was the story of that adventure, which we collected in the videos and that we were presenting to the TV audience for the first time. 

Wilma decided to contact one of the Directors she interviewed  at the [http://www.biografilm.it/2013/ Biografilm Festival], an Italian Documentary Festival focused on Lives/Biographies. Wilma found out that in fact now TV broadcasts do not care about the presence or not of the products on the Internet because TV audience in altogether a different one. They only care what the other broadcasters have in their shelves.

She said that what we needed to do  was finding out a good sales agent or distributor.   She took responsibility of searching for one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preoperative exercise for CABG surgery and subsequent cardiovascular health ==
== Background ==
=== What does surgery involve? ===
Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery or CABG involves redirecting heart blood flow around a narrow artery so that the blood can flow smoothly around the heart. This can potentially reduce the risk of a Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack) from occuring. This is a major surgery and a thorough assessment should be undertaken before opting to have the surgery.
=== CABG and Exercise ===
CABG is a medically proven way to improve mortality rates and provide an improved quality of life for patients(at least short term). Preoperative exercises and other lifestyle interventions provide important postoperative benefits for patients and hence can assist in maintaining or improving subsequent Cardiovascular (CV) health after CABG surgery. Some of these benefits include; 
* reduced hospital stay 
* decrease risk of pulmonary complications during surgery 
* strengthen respiratory muscles
* Improve percerived quality of life pre and post surgery
When determining the type of preoperative exercise a patient should undertake, an appropriate risk assessment procedure should be used to identify if there is a high risk of Postoperative Pulmonary complications.
== Types of Preoperative Exercise ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type of exercise !! Procedures 
|-
| Inspiartory Muscle Training (IMT) || Patients should perform 5-7 30 minute sessions per week 
using a resistive breathing device and under supervision of an apropriately qualified physician  
|-
| Low Intensity Exercise || Can be perfromed without supervision or with supervision (depending on risk factor). 
Light exercises such as strecthing and going for easy walks or exercising on a stationary bike can be used.
Number of sessions per week can vary between 2-5 depending on intensity of sessions.
Very light Resistance training can also be performed. 
|}
== Benefits of Preoperative exercise==
=== Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) ===
* Increase Respiratory Muscle Strength
* Increase Respiratory Muscle Endurance
* May decrease mortality 
* Better pulmonary gas exchange before and after surgery
* Increase Maximal Inspiratory Pressures(MIPS)
=== Low Intensity Exercise ===
* Improve physical and Mental Quality of Life
* Improve Blood Pressure
* Improve Heart function
* Increase V02 peak value
* Improve exercise tolerance
== Recommendations ==
It is reccommended that patients who are undrgoing CABG surgery should do some kind of light physical activity (PA) prior to their operation. PA can vary between light walks or rides, light resistance training, stretching and inspiratory muscle strengthening. Activity at a higher intensity has not been researched or trialled before, so higher intensity physical activity is not recommended before a CABG operation. It conjunction with PA other lifestyle changes can be made to improve health before the operation, this includes things such as;
* Practicing Relaxation Techniques
* Education about dealing with possible stresses that may arise
* Check up phone calls from hospital staff helps patients feel better and adhere to exercise programs.
* Diet Supplementation such as Omega-3 fatty acids
Undertaking the above lifestyle changes prior to a CABG operation can provide patients with a postoperative advantage into the rehabilitation phase after the surgery. One of the most important benefits from preoperative exercise is the improved Quality of Life patients perceive to have follwing surgery, this can be the key to a longer term health benefit and lifestyle change.
