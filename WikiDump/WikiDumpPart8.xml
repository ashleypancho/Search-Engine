==Revolutionary France==
The monarchy failed to handle the economic crisis and social change before and during the Revolution. The systems of the Ancien Regieme proved ineffective at handling a society in which the middle class are the most productive group.
Absolutism was destroyed by Louis's indecision and cowardice, combined with the Enlightenment and destruction of Christianity
Absolutism had peaked during the reign of Louis XIV, whose numerous wars and palaces bankrupted the nation.
;National Constituent Assembly
:Served as a legislature and a body to draft a constitution
:Abolished feudalism 1789

* The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen was not a constitution, but a set of principles (like the US Declaration)
* Created a single unicameral house and the king would only have a suspensive veto
* In 1790, according to the Tennis Court Oath, they were required to have elections, but Mirabeau successfully argued for elections to be suspended until the constitution was finished

Amidst these intrigues, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organization made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. Jury trials started for criminal cases. The king would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war. The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed guilds, masterships, and workers' organisations: any individual gained the right to practise a trade through the purchase of a license; strikes became illegal. 
===Causes of the French Revolution===
1. Seven Years' War (1756 - 1763) 	
A series of conflicts fought between France and her alliances against a coalition of Great Britain and her alliances in an attempt to gain greater territory in India, Germany and North America. However, these conflicts ended poorly for France, with great investment put into the war effort (money, troops), that resulted in a loss of land in the disputed areas. Furthermore, France assumed a massive debt through these wars, which contributed to the financial crisis during the 1780s. The Austrian War of Succession (1740-48) and the American War of Independence (1776-83) worsed the debt situation.

2. The War of Independence 
France's involvement in the American Revolution was not only costly on the French economy, it provided an example for revolution. Many French soldiers returned with 

3. The Three Estates and Taxation (c. 1700s)
The three estates in France were: the clergy, the nobility, and the peasants/bourgeoisie. The first two estates, the clergy and the nobility, were exempted from taxes, which laid the taxation burden on the Third Estate, the peasants. The peasants were the pooerest of the three estates and were forced to bear the burden of the taxes. This inequality led to a general resentment of the feudal system, which was especially dangerous given that 97% of France's populace belonged to the third estate.  

4. Emergence of the Bourgeoisie (c.1700s)
The men from the upper end of the Third Estate in France were known as the bourgeoisie. This emerging middle class was well educated and rich. However, they held no political power because they were still considered part of the Third Estate, the peasantry.

5. Louis XVI (King of France from 1774 - 1792)
Louis XVI was King of France before and during the French Revolution. He had no real interest in the political affairs of his country while he was the monarch of France. He was a weak leader at a time that required a strong monarch. He was also greatly influenced by his wife, Marie Antoinette, who was strong willed and ignorant of what the people of France needed.  

6. Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712 - 1778) 	Jean Jacques Rousseau was an Enlightenment philosopher from France who lobbied for the rights of the masses. He came from the lower classes of society and believed that equality, freedom and justice should be the foundations of a country.

7. Need for Economic Reform (c.1760s)
After the Seven Years' War, France faced severe financial difficulties. Not only was the Crown facing enormous debt from this war, but the method of collecting taxing was completely disorganized. Individuals appointed by Louis XVI attempted to reform taxation by including the Nobles and Clergy. His finance ministers, (ie. Turgot and Necker) were unsuccessful in addressing the deficit situation, largely because they faced fierce opposition from the first and second estate. Had Louis invoked the 'lit de justice' (which would force the reforms to pass), his finance minister may have stood a better chance. 

8. Bankruptcy of the Crown (c. 1760s - 1780s)
The expenditures of the French Crown during the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution ultimately led to the bankruptcy of the Crown. This event was also caused by standstill in economics; no reforms were successfully carried out. 

9. Revival of Parlements (c. 1774)
The Parlements were royal courts that could register laws from the King. They were abolished before the reign of Louis XVI, who revived them in order to gain popularity. They mainly consisted of 'nobles of the robe', who were lesser nobles, and would follow the king as long as he respected their privileges.

10. HIgh Prices and Famine (c. 1780s)
In Europe during the early sixteenth century, prices were rising. In France however, wages were not increasing to balance high prices. In addition to this deteriorating situation, harvest was destroyed by the weather in 1788. These two factors led to much starvation and the creation of a desperate mob in the streets of Paris.

===The Legislative Assembly===
A legislative assembly was formed, but it lasted less than a year.  It resembled early America - complete with  Articles of Confederation, military branches including an army and a navy (though weak at the time), and a treasury without any funds to substantiate its existance.

In 1792, The Paris Commune took control and took the ruling family as its prisoners.  A new republic was formed, and subsequently forced upon the nation.  The true power of the new government rested in the Committee on Public Safety, which was controlled by the Jacobins.

Eventually, a constitutional monarchy was formed as a moderate solution to handle the balance of power between the people, the king, and the nobles.  Apart from the obvious lack of any king, which eliminated the monarchist theory, the constitutional monarchy fell apart because external pressure from other countries (the Duke of Brunswick, the Brunswick Manifesto) - combined with an internal revolt - caused the nation to drift towards a more extremist, totalitarian government.

===Directory===
The new constitution installed the Directoire (English: Directory) and created the first bicameral legislature in French history. The parliament consisted of 500 representatives (the Conseil des Cinq-Cent (Council of the Five Hundred)) and 250 senators (the Conseil des Anciens (Council of Seniors)). Executive power went to five &quot;directors,&quot; named annually by the Conseil des Anciens from a list submitted by the Conseil des Cinq-Cent.
The new régime met with opposition from remaining Jacobins and royalists. The army suppressed riots and counter-revolutionary activities. In this way the army and its successful general, Napoleon Bonaparte gained much power.&lt;br&gt;
On November 9, 1799 (18 Brumaire of the Year VIII) Napoleon staged the coup which installed the Consulate; this effectively led to his dictatorship and eventually (in 1804) to his proclamation as emperor, which brought to a close the specifically republican phase of the French Revolution.

==Hitler's Effectiveness==
===Overview===
Hitler’s Nazism was a political philosophy bent on the creation of a stronger Germany, both militarily and economically, as well as an ethnically clean and superior Germanic race. Hitler’s rise was precipitated by a power vacuum, and the failure of the Weimar Republic to effectively address the needs of the people. The Weimar Republic’s ratification of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), the treaty that ended the First World War, was the cause of great embarrassment and anger throughout the land. The greatest cause for anger in the Treaty of Versailles was the Guilt Clause which placed all of the blame for the First World War on Germany and forced them to pay reparations. This anger and disgrace, mixed with a worsening economic situation as well as the use of propaganda, clearly aided in Hitler’s rise.

Not all of the goals that Hitler set out for himself were accomplished, but he did manage a great deal of success overall. His successes were mainly due to the intertwining of policies, such as his economic policy and his foreign policy.

During Lebensraum, Hitler enacted two different economic plans to support it, the first being &quot;Partial Fascism&quot; (from 1933 to 1936), which started a job creation program to reduce unemployment and curb union power. The second economic plan, the New Plan (enacted in 1934), called for greater exportation to increase Germany's liquid assets.  Later, he enacted the Four Year Plan, which called for autarky (self sufficiency) right before the war. Hitler also supported Lebensraum by masterfully orchestrating a string of agreements which he never wished to fully follow, such as the Non-Aggression Pact (1934), which pledged that Germany would not attack Russia; and the Munich Pact (1938), which said that Germany would stop attacking countries after taking the Sudetenland (Germanic part of Czechoslovakia).

===Rise to Power===
Hitler’s rise to power is partly due to an amazing upsurge in nationalistic feeling due to the failure of the Weimar Republic’s government to effectively address the worsening economic problems of the Republic. “Of all of the industrial states, Germany was undoubtedly the most vulnerable to a sudden downturn in economic conditions... As the depression deepened, foreign loans were withdrawn and the banking system eventually collapsed in 1931... The inevitable result was a rapid increase in unemployment, from 2 million in 1929 to 3.5 million in 1930, 4.4 million in 1931, and over 6 million in 1932.” (Lee 156)

Germany‘s current situation quickly connected with the already low national moral due to the indignation of the Guilt Clause in the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler appeared onto the national stage as a prominent and very appealing personality “The rise of Hitler involved distinct processes which, although connected, did not lead inevitably from one to the other… [One] was the emergence of an entirely new form of right wing movement which, under Hitler, eventually replaced this…system with a totalitarian regime.” (Lee 159)

The “new form of right wing movement” that Lee talks about is the Nazi’s extreme right wing nationalism (Nazi being a shortened name for Nazional Sozialismus - National Socialism). The basis of this nationalism was the belief of German, or Aryan, supremacy over all other Worldly societies, especially Judaism and Slavicism. According to Lee “Race was the fundamental rationale for all social developments” (Lee 203). This ‘Aryan society’, or dream of an Aryan society, was clearly part of Hitler’s propaganda campaign to bring in new followers.

===Foreign and Domestic Policy===
Hitler’s foreign and domestic policies were intertwined. This is most clearly seen in the policy of Lebensraum and its influence on economic policy. Lebensraum is an externally expansionist policy. According to Lee, pan-European expansionism is seen in Hiter’s ''Mein Kampf'' where “he argued that Germany should abandon her former pursuit of economic power through colonies or through attempts to dominate Western Europe. Instead, he advocated ‘turning our eyes towards the land in the east.’ “(Lee 193). Hitler saw the east as a large plot of land with innumerable resources waiting to be reaped, according to Lee, Hitler also speaks of visions of ‘new communities.’ “New communities would eventually be established on land carved out of Poland and Russia by the German army. Germany would have self sufficiency in raw materials and food, as well as guaranteed outlets for her manufactured goals.” This is where economic policy begins mixing in even more with foreign policy. 

Since Lebensraum called for expansion, it also called for military re armament. Since the Treaty of Versailles limited the number of troops that Germany could have at one-hundred thousand as well as forbade Germany of creating large caliber munitions such as those used in the Paris Gun, Hitler had to create a cloak of trust throughout Europe. He achieved this by combining every aggressive move he made with a symbolic appeasement move. This is best seen when Hitler proclaims to have an air force, according to Lee “The reaction of other powers posed a major diplomatic problem which Hitler needed to resolve.”(Lee 213) Hitler resolves this by creating a series of unilateral treaties, such as the Non Aggression Pact with Poland, and the Anglo-German Naval Pact, both of which served to quell the fears of European powers, as well as divide the Stresa Front (Britain, France and Italy). 

====Hitler’s economic policy had three main points====
=====The period of ‘Partial Fascism’=====
According to Lee during the period of ‘Partial Fascism’ “the state moved into a programme of job creation to reduce the level of unemployment while, at the same time, seeking to control wages and eliminate trade union power.” (Lee 194) There was of course a more militaristic side to this policy; this is seen in the fact that most of these jobs were created through the creation of civilian as well as military infrastructure. Some of these great projects include the ''Autobahn Projekt'' which were integral to the blitzkrieg, as well as the armament and tank factories used for weaponry.

=====The New Plan (1936)=====
The New Plan, under Schacht, “regulated imports and allocations of foreign exchange in key sectors of the German economy. Overall Schacht was convinced that it was essential to raise the level of exports if Hitler’s objective of increased military expenditure were to be realized.”(Lee 194). Also under Schacht Germany developed trade agreements with “underdeveloped areas” to gain new markets and resources (Lee 194). All of these were necessary steps for German rearmament.

=====The Four Year Plan=====
According to Lee “The basic purpose of the Four Year Plan was to achieve self sufficiency, or autarky, in both industry and agriculture...” (Lee 194). According to Lee “The plan resulted in increased military expenditure.” (Lee 195). The epitome of policy intertwining is noted by Lee when he notes that the final economic step was the implementation of blitzkrieg. Blitzkrieg is utilized as a economic strategy to war due to the fact that German oil reserves could not hold on much more after one month of fighting.

=====Degree of Success=====
Hitler’s success in implementing the party line can be called successful to an extent. This is due to the fact that most of his initial policies, such as his economic policies, served their purpose as he had planned them. This is seen in the methodical calculation of timing economic necessities with the introduction of war. The first of the three steps of economic preparation for war, and their military equivalents all go through flawlessly, it is in the fourth step that Hitler stumbles, the fourth step being total war. According to Lee, by the time that total war began “The German economy was now pushed to its limit.”(Lee 195). Germany’s final downfall was due to its inability to not be outproduced by the U.S.S.R and the United States. The verdict on Hitler’s economic policy is mixed, relatively successful for the original goals, yet failed to make it past the finish line. Due to the failure of his economic policy the failure of his foreign policy, Lebensraum and the Thousand Year Reich, also failed.

==Rise and Rule of Single Party States

==The USSR (1917 - 1953)==

====Russia Prior to Lenin - a resumé====
During the early 20th century, Russia was still governed by Tsars (Tsar Nicholas II at this point).  Though the peasants had been freed from serfdom by Tsar Alexander, they still suffered severe conditions and servitude to wealthy landowners and more advantaged peasants (kulaks).  

By 1905, tensions were growing until the situation overboiled into a mass movement of strikes in February.  They were caused by labor shortage, food shortage, an unsuccessful war against Japan and horrid working and living conditions.  These strikes were so violently repressed on order of the Tsar that it led other labor and intellectual sectors of Russia to rise in mass revolt.  The 'Bloody Sunday' took place on the 22 of January when Father Gapon and many other important figures (along with several thousand commoners) marched into the Palace Square of St. Petersburg with a petition, whereupon they were shot at by the guards and were attacked by the kossaks out of fear - unknowingly to the people, the Tsar was not even there.

Such was the violence and disorder of the state of affairs that the Tsar conceded to a setting up of a 'Duma' (a democratically elected parliament of sorts) to give democracy to Russia.  However, the Duma was dissolved so many times by the Tsar that it was ineffective. 

The onset of the Great War of 1914 and the ineffectiveness of the Duma leads to the planned revolt of February 1917 and Lenin's April Theses (also 1917).  A Provisional Government was created with a mixture of Soviets and Political Parties represented.  This was also ineffective and led to the seizure of power by Lenin with his Red Guards in October of 1917 (aka The Great October Revolution).

&lt;br&gt;
=====The End of the War=====
Lenin wanted peace and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 with Germany.  Russia lost Poland, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Ukraine, and parts of Belorussia and Transcaucasia.  This accounted for 1.3 million square miles of territory, 62 million people, 1/3 of Russia's railways, the most fertile land it possessed (accounting for over two thirds of its agricultural gross product), and much of her coal and iron resources.  However, the Bolsheviks did not have to appease discontented minorities, allowing for time to concentrate on revolutionizing Russia and putting down the counter-revolutionaries in the Civil War.
&lt;br&gt;

=====Lenin’s Aims=====
Lenin's primary goal in Russia was to destroy class barriers and establish a socialist republic, which would gradually transition from socialism to communism.  Through this process, he would establish a &quot;withering away of the state.&quot;  In order to speed the achievement of his goal, he wanted to redistribute the land to the peasants and give control of industry over to the Soviets of various industrial sectors.
&lt;br&gt;
However, these goals had to change, since the Bolsheviks had minor support inside Russia and since the Civil War was beginning.  The transition would be made more difficult by the fact that Russia was not an advanced industrial state and that it still relied largely on a relatively conservative peasantry.  Therefore, Lenin instituted an economic system now known as War Communism (see below) to provide for the workers and soldiers during the Civil War.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

=====War Communism and the Civil War=====
''1918 to 1922''

''The Civil War'' came as a result of the seizure of power and dissolving of the Provisional Government by Lenin and the Bolsheviks.  Many other parties and partisans of an ulterior political situation banded together to bring down the new socialist state.  As a result, three factions formed: (a)the Whites, a gathering of all types, from Monarchists, to Liberals to the angry moderate Socialists (b)the Greens, land-based angry people who generally consisted of anarchists, peasants and cultural/ethnic independentists (c)the Reds, Bolsheviks and many Mensheviks led by Lenin and other key players such as Leon Trotsky.
&lt;br&gt;
''War Communism'' was an economic policy of urgency (or perhaps created on purpose, see historical debates) so that the war effort could be supplied in order to win against the Whites (the Greens being fairly docile and often banding with Red Army troops).  The central policy of War Communism was the forced requisitioning of grain and the nationalization of all industry (large and small scale).  The effects by the end of the Civil War in 1922 were very bad.  Several million rurally based people had starved and several more million emigrated to the West or to the southern Middle-Eastern or Eastern countries in three major waves between 1918 and 1921.  Working and living conditions were horrid and the industrial and rural production levels had fallen very far below the 1913/1914 levels (pre-Communism). Figures:

1132 million linear meters of textile prodution in 1918 and 219 million by 1919
Decline in marketings from 9.5% in 1913 to 4.9% in 1926 as a result of reduced peasant taxes

&lt;br&gt;

=====New Economic Policy (aka NEP)=====
''1922 to ca.1926''

Lenin discovered that a policy revision was necessary to avoid a counter-revolution, even though it opposed communist ideals.  Former industrial managers were instated because they were the only ones with expertise.  A more lax attitude was also used in relation with the peasants so that they would reconciliate with the government.  For them, the land and selling taxes were lessened, they were allowed to sell on markets for profit, but had to cede a certain grain tax to the government which was low enough for even small peasants to afford (in theory).  Lenin eventually regained control of the economy, but many smaller enterprises were lost to private owners (even though the figures show that there were only approximately four thousand private managers in the USSR by 1925).  Lenin grouped state-controlled industries together for an easier transition towards socialism.  As a result of this action, food and industrial production increased.  Lenin also brought education under state control, introduced social security schemes, attacked the Church’s position, and purged opposing factions of the Party by mandating a law banning factionalism (eventually to the detriment of Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kemenev, Bukharin, Tomsky, etc.).

&lt;br&gt;
=====Death of Lenin=====
Lenin died of a stroke in 1924, leaving Russia poised on the brink of a major socialist movement and leaving the development of the NEP unattended to.  His death created a major competition for leadership of the country between several players: Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Tomsky, Ryutin and Josef Stalin.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Rise of Stalin====
The rise of Stalin can be accounted for by his new doctrine of “Socialism in One Country.”  Within that theory, Stalin placed the development of Russia before any world revolution.  By January of 1924 - following the death of Lenin - two conflicting ideologies competed for power in Russia.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The ''Left Wing Militant Communists'', led by Trotsky, had a foreign policy that held that an immediate worldwide revolution was necessary to revolutionize a backwards Russia.  Additionally, their domestic policy favored the rapid development of the economy and the creation of a socialist society.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The ''Right Wing Communists'', led by Stalin, had a foreign policy based in the belief that a worldwide revolution would be unlikely in the near future.  Their domestic policy relied on a gradual development through pragmatic programs such as the NEP.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A general agreement existed that Russia could not have a successful socialist program without help from more economically forward countries.  Stalin competed for leadership by aligning himself with two other powerful politicians: Kamenev and Zinoviev of the All-Union Communist Party (the former Bolshevik party).  In 1925, they removed Trotsky as Commissioner of War.  After Trotsky's removal, Stalin slowly consolidated power and eventually broke with Kamenev and Zinoviev to take power in Russia.  He then implemented his &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; doctrine, which called for the construction of a socialist society in Russia regardless of the international situation.  Finally, he exiled Trotsky in 1928, having ousted leaders of the left wing party in 1927.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Domestic Policy Under Stalin====
Stalin viewed Russia as too far behind in technology. He wanted Russia to rise above the Western powers and become an industrial world pillar.  To do so, he had to revolutionize the way Russia - a country of farmers - was organized internally. He collectivized agriculture, introduced new and cutting-edge technology with aid from the West, and further controlled what was being produced in Russia. His &quot;five year plans&quot; were also meant to rapidly revitalize various industrial sectors. Stalin revamped his government by conducting purges to wipe out opposition and introduce younger, more obedient officials.
&lt;br&gt;
=====Collectivization and the Five Year Plans=====
According to Stalin’s viewpoint, Russia had fallen too far behind in technological advances, and could either rise to power or be crushed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Do you want our Socialist fatherland to be beaten and to lose its independence? If you do not want this you must put an end to this backwardness as speedily as possible and develop genuine Bolshevik speed in building up the Socialist system of economy. There are no other ways……We are fifty to a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this lag in ten years. Either we do it or they crush us.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
======Collectivization (Agriculture)======
In 1924, oftentimes &quot;backwards&quot; methods were used by peasants who worked in agriculture (roughly 80% of the population), who lived in widespread poverty, and had to deal with primitive conditions and archaic farming methods.  Several problems were encountered because of the farmers' archaic methodology.  According to Stalin, the conservative attitude of the population held back progress and especially blamed the 'kulaks' (wealthy farmers) for it.  Industrial labor development was deemed impossible because of inefficient farming and unskilled peasant labor.  Additionally, the peasants would not allow for a surplus, which would pay for imported foodstuffs.  When Stalin collectivized farming by force, the peasants rebelled, destroying crops and animals.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The collectivization of agriculture had a number of advantages.  A majority of peasants were organized onto collective farms, allowing the government greater control over food production and allocation.  As a result, farming was modernized, and farmers were allowed access to modern machinery and methods.  A stable food supply became available for the industrial reforms (Stalin's five year plans) and for future wars.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, due to the peasant rebellion, the initial effect was a massive drop in net production when animals and crops were destroyed.  The peasantry had to pay heavy tariffs in order to maintain their way of life.  The uprising also resulted in a large human cost, as most of the rebels and many able farmers were killed or starved in the process.  Additionally, long-term agriculture collectivization was insufficient because it was not responsive to local needs.
&lt;br&gt;

======Five Year Plans (Industry)======
A central planning system was required to allow the government to control production and allocate resources.  Each sector was given a five year target.  The &quot;five year plans&quot; would - Stalin believed - eliminate waste and increase concentration upon vital areas of the economy.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The first Five Year Plan, enacted from 1928 to 1932, aimed to create a solid industrial base.  It was designed to achieve the expansion of coal and steel production, transportation, electrical power, and other such industries.  However, its goal of a 20% per annum increase was  diversify Russia's industrial interests.  It had a more realistic aim of a 14% increase in production.  As a result of this plan, certain areas experienced rapid and large growth, particularly in the engineering and metal-working sectors.  The planners and workforce had more experience, and government control over labor increased.  The consumer goods and similar sectors were less successful, and weapon production increased during the rise of Hitler.  More resources were aimed towards weapon production, but no corresponding increase in wages occurred.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The third Five Year Plan, enacted from 1938 to 1941 (only lasting three years because of the onstart of World War II and the need to fund the war effort), had the central goal of strengthening Russia's economy.  It had what was perhaps the most realistic goal: 12% growth.  It resulted in the construction of new plants in Eastern Russia, but labour shortages and disorganization due to staff purges further hindered its adoption, as did Germany's invasion and armament plans in 1941.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ultimately, the Five Year Plans met with a degree of short term success, having turned the USSR into a major industrial power in fifteen years.  They allowed Russia to resist the German invasion in 1941.  The plans led to a higher degree of government control, and an overall improvement in the standard of living.  However, there was initially much error and waste, as well as an initial decline in living standards.  The plans were harshly enforced, and a new elite was formed as a result.  The plans also became increasingly complex, making them more difficult to organize and maintain.  By 1945, a major reform would be needed.

=====Stalin’s Purges=====
In 1932, Stalin began to attack his political opponents in a series of purges (chistka, the show trials and the Yezhovshina) aimed at destroying the vestiges of political opposition to him.  As a result, his opposition was eliminated, allowing for Stalin to become Russia's dictator.  However, most of the able, experienced members of Soviet society were eliminated - including politicians and military officers.  Millions of the population were executed, and fear grew within Soviet society to the point where the denouncement of others had become commonplace.  Society became scared to voice its opinions, thereby hindering whatever initiative it once had.

=====Conclusion=====

Stalin was successful in some theoretical areas - Russia's army grew in power, her industries were expanded, and she became a world power.  However, the costs of the improvements (purges, collectivization, and so on) proved an enormous burden on Russia as a whole.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Foreign Policy Under Stalin====

=====Overview=====
The foreign policy of Russia was dominated by expansionist nationalism and hostility towards the capitalist world under its Marxist ideology.  Stalin also had a distinct “Real Politik” ideology to all his foreign policies. This resulted in Russia adopting a variable political stance under his rule.

=====Bolshevik’s (revised)  Policy (pre - 1934)=====

The Bolshevik’s revised policy was enacted when it became clear that the capitalist western world would not be revolutionized.  It was founded in the belief that a revolution would eventually occur in the long run.  The policy was designed to help nations against western imperialism, to exploit capitalist state rivalries, and to use the Comintern to encourage labor unrest.

=====Stalin’s Foreign Policy (post - 1934)=====
The change in Russia's foreign policy came about because of Hitler’s rise in power, and the total control over state policy by Stalin - which was based on “cold-blooded realism.”

Russia joined the League of Nations in 1934 and adopted “collective security.”  An agreement of mutual assistance was signed with France, diplomatic relations were established with the United States, and Communist parties in other nations were urged by the Soviets to cooperate with left-wing groups against fascism.  However, Britain and France saw fascism as a greater threat than communism, and adopted a policy of appeasement towards Hitler.  As a result, the proposal for military cooperation against Germany failed, and collective security failed because of a severe lack of support.  Russia was ultimately excluded from the Munich Conference.

=====Nazi-Soviet Pact=====
This lead Stalin to sign the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939 with Hitler. Also called the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (named after the two foreign ministers). Stalin had to accept this pact because of his suspicion of Britain and France and their lack of support against Germany.  Additionally, he wanted to strengthen the Red Army and hoped that the pact would delay military conflict with Germany.  Hitler promised Polish territory and the Baltic states to Russia, and promised to stay out of Russia's sphere of interest.

======German Invasion (1941)======
The Nazis eventually became more aggressive in Western Europe, and Stalin realized that there was no controlling Hitler.  He moved his army into the Baltic states for protection, but still had trust in Hitler instead of his generals and decided to purge them.  The military was weakened by his purges, a fact that was taken advantage of by Hitler.  He did not accept the British proposal for Polish protection in exchange for help against Russia, and Stalin - according to traditional views - did not listen to his generals about the impending German invasion.

In May of 1941, the German army invaded Russia (Operation Barbarossa), overtaking it within kilometers of Moscow.  Due to the cold harsh winter, and effective Soviet war industry and German unpreparedness for the environment, the Soviet army began to push the Germans back.

=====WWII and Russia (1941-1945)=====

Now that Stalin was in the war, he began to make his first post-war moves.  He demanded that Britain accept all of his annexations, but Britain refused him.  He demanded that the United States and Britain send troops to the second front, but Britain and the U.S. delayed entering the second front until a year later, which resulted in increased tensions.  At the Conference of Tehran (between Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill) Stalin asked for the warm water ports of Dairen, and Roosevelt and Churchill acquiesced to this demand.  Stalin’s new boundaries and territorial divisions are also accepted under the condition that democracy be instigated in Eastern Europe.  Soviet troops were sent to Eastern Countries to establish a Russian rule in place of a Nazi one.  To placate the West, Stalin signed the Declaration of Liberated Europe, though elections only occurred in Hungary.
&lt;br&gt;

=====Cold War and Russia (post - 1945): Berlin Crisis=====

The divided Germany and divided Berlin led to increased tensions between the U.S. (who controlled West Germany and West Berlin along with France and Britain) and Russia (who controlled East Germany and East Berlin).  In June of 1948, Stalin ordered the blockade of West Berlin, allowing no entry into or out of the city aside from a small airspace.  The U.S. sent planes full of resources to the West Berliners.  Not wanting to risk an all-out conflict, Stalin does nothing, and - on May 12, 1949 - Stalin backs down and stops the blockade.

=====World Revolution and the Comintern=====

The U.S.S.R. used the Comintern to promote a world revolution, with Russia - and therefore Stalin - as its leader.  In 1927, it was used in the suppression of Trotskyism and Stalin’s subsequent concentration on building socialism in Russia, at which point the Comintern’s actions were moderated.  In 1935, fascist dictators threatened the Comintern, which was taken as an act of aggression against all communist parties.  In 1943, the Comintern is abolished as a action of goodwill towards Britain and the U.S.; however, Russia remains the leader of all parts of the Communist Party.

=====The Fall Of Stalin=====
On March 6, 1953, Stalin - now 73 - died in his sleep after a lengthy illness, according to Russian reports.  Many theories circulated about the death of Stalin, including one that theorized that his top generals assassinated him, fearful of another purge.  He was supplanted as dictator by Nikita Khrushchev.

===Castro (1958 - present)===
----
====Cuba Prior to Castro====
=====The First United States Occupation (1899 - 1902)=====
The Occupation had three major goals, primary of which was the desire of the U.S. to make Cuba into a self-governing protectorate.  Additionally, the U.S. wanted to repair the damage caused by war.  Finally, the United States wanted to absorb Cuba into the American economic sphere.
&lt;br&gt;
=====The Politics of Corruption (1902 - 1953)=====
'''The Revolution of 1933'''&lt;br&gt;
The provisional government under Carlos Manuel de Cespedes could not stop the escalating violence in Cuba.  On September 4th, 1933, a group of army sergeants and the Student Directory overthrew the government - Fulgencio Batista was a part of this overthrow.  The new government had no political backing, and views differed within the regime; whereas the army wanted to defend the new order, the students sought genuine reforms.  The reigns of power were ultimately handed over to Dr. Ramón Grau San Martín.  He was forced out of office in January 1934, fled to exile, and was replaced by Carlos Mendieta.
&lt;br&gt;
=====The Era of Batista (1934 - 1944) =====
Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar led Cuba  - first through puppet presidents, from 1934 to 1940 - then as president from 1940 to 1944.  Batista was alienated from the &quot;respectable&quot; elements of the upper and middle classes, but was nevertheless extremely popular with the masses.  He presided over a mild reform program, eventually moving openly leftward in 1937 to support labour unions and communists.
&lt;br&gt;
=====The Auténtico Interlude (1944 - 1952)=====
Batista allowed an election for the constituent assembly, and Grau - who represented the Auténtico party - won.  After many different presidents took control of Cuba, and the corruption continued unabated, Batista staged a coup with the help of low officers just prior to the election in March of 1952.  
&lt;br&gt;

=====The Return of Batista as Dictator (1952 - 1959)=====
Batista abandoned the Cuban constitution and gave himself the title of Dictator; from this point on, all elections would be staged.  Batista was on good terms with the U.S. government, and allowed large American corporations to enter Cuba and use Cuba’s resources for their own profit.  However, the Cuban people remained poor; and no education or health care system was in place for the country’s people.
&lt;br&gt;

====Rise to Power====

=====1st Coup (1956 - 1958)=====
Castro opposed Batista’s unfair regime, and staged an unsuccessful coup.  He was part of the M-26-7 - which included Che Guevara - which trained in Mexico.  At this time, Castro believed in the cooperation of capital and labour, and was a true Marxist who told people to gain their support.  He returned to Cuba and staged an unsuccessful coup on July, 26, 1953; he was caught and imprisoned, but eventually released.

=====2nd Coup (1959)=====
Castro’s movement gained support and eventually toppled Batista.  The movement had grown to over 800 men (including army deserters), and - although outnumbered by Batista’s army - Castro won many military victories, especially against Batista in Operation Verano.  On December 31, 1959, Batista fled the country to the Dominican Republic, and on January 8, 1959, Castro took Havana.
&lt;br&gt;

====Domestic Policy Under Castro====
In the beginning of Castro’s dictatorship, he implemented many reforms.  He created social services, improved life for the rural masses, and endorsed public health and literacy.  However, his economic failures and dictatorship rule would eventually eclipse these reforms.  Under his Nationalization of Multinational Business policy, American corporate investments and land holdings in Cuba were seized.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the mid-1990’s came the breakup of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance and the USSR.  The need to establish a basis for growth without changing the regime were concerns for Castro, and the economy of Cuba began to free-fall.  In the economic crisis, Cuba’s GDP dropped by half, and her already low living standards took a plunge.  The economic conditions on the island - in addition to the re-emergence of small, isolated pockets of domestic opposition - caused the government to resort to a dual policy of liberalization of the external economic sectors and heightened repression in an effort to head off an impending political crisis.
&lt;br&gt;

====Foreign Policy Under Castro====
Cuba became dependant on the USSR for economic aid, as well as the trade of sugar and oil.  She participated in the &quot;world revolution&quot; movement (Marxist-Leninist) by championing over the revolution in Latin America, and tried to end dependence on the U.S. - though she failed because of the collapse of the USSR and all benefits from the former Soviet Union.  The new economic policy required Cuba to open up to foreign investment and ownership of select parts of the economy, as well as the legalization of the circulation of the U.S. dollar.

===Hitler (1930 - 1945)===
----
====Germany Prior to Hitler====
Germany remained vengeful, friendless, and threatened because of the Treaty of Versailles.  The German people were in search of a leader who would return them to their former glory.
&lt;br&gt;
=====Treaty of Versailles=====
''We agree to sign under compulsion, a dishonourable peace.'' --German Parliament
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The terms of the Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to demilitarize the Rhineland, and to abdicate Alsace and Lorraine.  In additon, it had to accept full responsibility for the war, and pay large reparations to other nations.  The army was reduced to 100,000 units; the navy, to 15,000; and the air force was completely eliminated.  The terms of the treaty were humiliating to the German public, and sentiments of anger and revenge began to grow.  Germany was left poor and under a devastating debt roughly equivalent to what is US$35 million by today's standards.  After it could not repay its reparations in full, France and Belgium invaded the Ruhr; Germany went through a period of hyperinflation which destroyed any of her economy left, leaving her people defenseless, threatened, and isolated.
&lt;br&gt;

=====Weimar Republic=====
Germany became a democracy after the revolution, during which the Kaiser was overthrown.  The Germans, however, did not know how to run an effective democracy due to lack of experience. After the Kaiser stepped down, a power vacuum ensued, which pitted opposing ideologies and parties against one another.  Ultimately, too many new ideas and too many people led to widespread fighting and brawling.
&lt;br&gt;

=====Soviet-German Relations=====
The Treaty of Rapallo was signed in 1922, formalizing an alliance with Russia.  Extensive trade agreements were made - specifically in weapons - and Russia and Germany renounce all war claims. It was in this way that Germany was able to breach the agreements made at the Versailles treaty through a technicality.  In the Treaty of Locarno (signed in 1925), Germany agreed to France’s possession of Alsace and Lorraine, and made the concession that the Rhineland would stay demilitarized.  Additionally, Germany consented to the inviolability of France and Belgium, and gained admittance to League of Nations.
&lt;br&gt;

=====German Domestic Situation=====
A global depression kept Germany’s economy down, and unemployment soared following the Great Depression in the United States. Many European countries were reliant on American loans, most of all Germany, and the failure of the US economy meant a subsequent failure of the Weimar Republic.  Jewish land owners demanded rent during the depression, which added to the economic crisis as well as growing ill-sentiment towards the Jewish people.
&lt;br&gt;

====Account for Rise to Power====
Hitler rose to power during a time of depression in both the industrial and political sectors.  He used the general public sentiment to further his cause.  Bavaria became the epicenter of many different ideological societies -  including antirepublican, antidemocratic, antisocialist, and anticommunist societies - which had corresponding organizations led by officers that were left disgruntled by the Weimar democracy.  Hitler was part of the political instruction program, which was against socialist and democratic propaganda.  He eventually joined the German Worker’s party, where he quickly rose the ranks to become the leader of the party.

=====Birth of Nazism=====
In 1920, Nazism was born when Hitler announced the program (25 points) of the National Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei (NSDAP).  The party adopted the swastika as a symbol of white supremacy and German values, and the red flag bearing it as the party symbol.  On November 9th, 1923, the Beer Hall Revolution occurred, interrupting a meeting between Bavarian Prime Minister Kahr and General von-Lossow, who had earlier declared that he had taken over the Bavarian Reichswehr.  On November 8th, Hitler called for a march on Berlin and - on November 9th - he attempted his Putsch, but due to lack of support from Kahr and the Reichswehr, he is quickly arrested by the Bavarian police force and sentenced to a five-year jail sentence by a reactionary judge.  The judge later reduced the sentence considerably.  During the nine months Hitler spent in jail, he wrote Mein Kampf, in which he outlined his ideology and philosophy.  He expounded his views of racism, nationalism, collectivization, history, anti-Semitism, and politics within the tome; he summarily condemned the treaty of Versailles, called the Weimar Republic a humiliation and weakness, and denounced Marxists, Bolsheviks, communists, and socialists.

=====Hitler Takes Control=====
Nazis had never won a majority in the government; however, on January 30, 1933, after many attempts to gain the position of Chancellor, Hitler is appointed.  He immediately calls for an election, but one week prior the Reichstag is set on fire and destroyed.  After declaring a state of emergency, Hitler is given dictatorial powers and begins his Nazi revolution, calling it the Third Reich.

=====Historiography=====
* Marxist: Nazi victory last manifestation of capitalism before socialist revolution
* Shirer: Nazism a continuation in German evolution, natural development
* Others: Weakness in Weimar republic, and positive values of Nazis attractive after Versailles Humiliation

====Domestic Policy Under Hitler====
The domestic policy instantiated in Germany under Hitler's dictatorship centered on indoctrinating the German people using propaganda, race ideology, and anti-Semitism.

=====Propaganda=====
The Nazi party was successful in imposing its ideals upon the people of Germany using effective propaganda tools including posters, newspaper articles, movies, books, and film among others.  Additionally, the Hitler Youth program was created, with the ulterior motive of indoctrinating the youth.  It was successful to a failing point; in fact, the children became so indoctrinated that as they grew older they were programmed to think that they were superior to all others, which caused them to become disobedient, violent, and irresponsible.

=====Race Inferiority/Superiority Ideology=====
The Nazi party promoted the ideology that the Germanic peoples represented the Aryan race, and believed that the Teutons were the purest of the Aryan race.  To that end, the party worked to strengthen, develop, and expand the Teuton bloodlines.  The Slavic people were considered to be inferior to Germanic peoples, as were Jews; in fact, Hitler believed that the Jews were the opposite of the Aryans, and were meant to destroy the race by interbreeding and thus contaminating German genetics.  Hitler experimented with breeding men and women trained to fight - whom he considered genetically &quot;perfect&quot; - with the aim of creating a perfect race.

=====Anti-Semitism=====
Since the Nazis considered Jews to be inferior to Germans, they took measures against Jewish people living in Germany.  On April 01, 1933, Jewish officials were dismissed from their government ranks, and a boycott of Jewish shops began.  On April 07, 1933, the newly-passed Civil Service Law forced the retirement of non-Aryan officials in any government position, including teachers.  From this point on, a pseudo-science was taught in schools, which worked to spread the belief that the Jews were an inferior race compared to Aryans.  On September 15, 1939, the Nuremberg Laws were passed, removing German citizenship from Jewish people and forbidding them to marry Germans.  On November 09, 1938, Kristalnacht began; Jewish-owned shops were broken into and looted and destroyed, as were synagogues, schools and houses.  This led to Jewish children being banned from schools with German children.  During World War II, 90% of all the Jews in Germany were killed in concentration camps.

=====Economic Development=====
In 1932, the first Four Year Plan was passed, which aimed at the reduction of unemployment.  It met with success, and five million jobs were created.  In 1936, the second Four Year Plan was penned, which aimed at economic self sufficiency.  It did not meet with the same success as the first plan. This is perhaps because the initial boom of jobs came largely from the expulsion or migration of the Jewish population, which opened up hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Whereas independence from foreign trade was established, production and industrialization reached less than half of expectations.

====Foreign Policy Under Hitler====
Germany's foreign policy under Hitler concentrated on the expansion of Nazism, revising the Versailles treaty, uniting all German speaking peoples, and the concept of Lebensraum.

=====Expand Nazism=====
The central concept of the expansion was to spread the influence of Nazism to more industrial, political, educational, and similar areas.  Additionally, the Nazi party focused on establishing more independent governments adhering to Nazi principles (they met with success in Austria, Sudetenland, and Czechoslovakia).  In 1934, Germany signed a ten-year non-aggression pact with Poland.  In 1936, they joined in the anti-Comintern Pact with Japan and Italy.  In 1939, the party took part in the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact.

=====Revise Versailles Treaty=====
In 1933, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and Disarmament Conference.  In March of 1935, conscription was introduced, and the Saar Basin was repossessed; and, in 1936, the Rhineland was remilitarized.  Germany had succeeded in revising the Versailles treaty, and were allowed to do so under the pretense of appeasement.

=====Unite All German-speaking Peoples in a Greater Reich=====
Hitler succeeded in uniting German-speaking peoples in the Third Reich, which included Austria, Suetenland, and Czechoslovkia.

=====Lebensraum=====
The idea behind Lebensraum was to take control of Russia and border states for &quot;living space.&quot;  Germany met with initial success, having conquered Poland and one-half of Russia.  However, Germany ultimately failed, as Operation Barbarossa was unsuccessful and they ultimately lost World War II.

====Account for Fall====
*Turning point in war: Operation Barbarossa
* War was essentially lost
* 1944: Russians defeated German forces in the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Baltic states and Poland
* 1945: Russian troops 40 miles from Berlin, Americans 60 miles away
* June, 06, 1944: British, Canadian and American troops invade Europe successfully in D-day (operation Overlord), took Normandy
* April, 30, 1945: Hitler commits suicide
* May, 07, 1945: German troops surrender. Fighting stops at 11:00am. Germany signs surrender the following day.

==Comparison of the Causes of World War I and II==

'''World War I'''
* The arms race
* Final Cause – The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo
# Ferdinand wanted to marry a lady-in-waiting but Franz-Josef would only allow him to if the relationship would end his power.
# Kaiser Wilhelm wanted to Austria to punish Serbia and he thought that Russia would back him.
# He assured Austria-Hungary that Germany would defend her even if Russia took punitive action. He assumed that the bond of monarchy would outrank Russia's connection to the Slavs.
&lt;br&gt;
** He misjudged the reaction of Russia, he didn't predict military involvement.
** Eventually, the Kaiser thought that the czar was using the telegram conversation to get a head start on military preparations
&lt;br&gt;
'''World War II'''
* The appeasement of Hitler
** Britain and France gave him a part of Czechoslovakia.
** They put up with his Lebensraum plans

* Hitler's personality
** He hated both the Jews and the Russians. He had a “mindless hatred” for the Slavic people.
** He was not globally aware

* Short term cause – Hitler's invasion of Poland
** He allies with Stalin so that the eastern front is eliminated and he can quickly crush Poland.
** Britain was obligated to protect Poland

'''Both WWI &amp; WWII'''
* Germany
** In the first, the Kaiser's ambitions and policies led to the outbreak
** In the second, it was Hitler's aggression

* Nationalism
** In the first, nationalism in the Balkans
** In the second, Hitler's desire for “living space”
*** The lack of a working international system
*** Alliances &amp; the failure of diplomacy
*** Neither side could fathom the actual size of the impending war
**** Only General von Moltke thought it would be a long war

'''Sockerdricka''' (Swedish for &quot;sugar drink&quot;) is a soft drink from the 19th century. It is traditionally a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] drink that contains ginger, but modern commercial versions consist of carbonated water, some sugar, and citric acid.

== Ingredients ==
* 20 litres of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* the peel of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 60 g [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 25 g [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]

== Procedure ==
# Boil the sugar, water, lemon and crushed ginger for 15 minutes. 
# Strain the mixture and let it cool. 
# Mix in the yeast and let the mixture ferment for two days. 
# Put the drink in bottles and add a raisin to each bottle. 

After five days the sockerdricka is ready for drinking.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* The recipe above has '''lots''' of yeast, and not much ginger. It would work well with just 10g yeast. More ginger would be good, e.g. 100g of fresh ginger for 20 litres.

'''Kroppkakor''' is a traditional Swedish dish: potato [[Cookbook:dumpling|dumplings]] with a filling of pork or bacon. They are cooked and served with butter and lingonberry jam. There are some regional variations to the recipe.

== Ingredients == 
* 1 kg cooked potatoes
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 1 onion
* 100 g smoked [[Cookbook:ham|ham]]
* 100 g bacon
* salt, pepper
* optional [[Cookbook:allspice|allspice]]

== Procedure ==
# Mash the potatoes. Put this on a breadboard and make a small pit in the middle.
# Put eggs, flour and salt in the pit and work the potato dough fast together. Too much kneading will make the potato tough. 
# Chop the onion finely, cut the bacon and ham into small pieces and fry it until it gets coloured. Flavour it with white pepper.
# Form the dough into a thick roll. Cut it in thick slices and put a pile of bacon mix in a pit in a slice, then put another slice on top of it, press the edges together and roll it into a ball. 
# Lower the balls into boiling salted water and boil them approx. 10-12 minutes or until they float to the surface. Pick them up with a perforated ladle and put them on a hot serving plate. Don’t boil too many at a time, they will then have some difficulty floating to the surface. 
# Serve hot with melted butter and red whortleberry (lingonberry) jam or cranberry jam.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lek Polygyny==

Lek polygyny is a mating system common in polygynous species of insects and birds in which the male provides no parental care to its offspring.  The lek mating system is uniquely driven by the females’ pursuit of their mate, rather than the males'. Males of lekking species do not hunt for receptive females.  Males form aggregates in neutral locations devoid any resources valuable to females.  The group of males performs intricate vocal, visual or chemical displays to lure receptive females to their lekking site.  In most lekking species, these group displays typically increase the ratio of visiting females per males.  At the lekking site, visiting females are able to compare the males’ physiques and courtship displays, picking the most attractive male as their mate (Alcock, 2001).  Thus, the few, most attractive males will do the majority of the mating (about 99%), while the subordinate males do no mating at all (Sherman, 1999).

==Alternative Hypothesis: Kin Selection Hypothesis==

The Lek Polygyny mating system promotes a heavily skewed mating success rate among lekking males.  Although most of the individuals in a lek never receive a mating opportunity, lek polygamy continues to flourish among various species of birds and insects (Sherman, 1999).  This suggests that the fitness of subordinate males must somehow be indirectly benefited by communal displays.  A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the reasons behind lekking behavior.  Widely recognized hypotheses include the Hotspot Hypothesis, the Hotshot Hypothesis, and the Female Preference Hypothesis (Alcock, 2001).  Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) proposed an alternative hypothesis predicting that lekking behavior is driven by kin selection. 
	
In the kin selection hypothesis, Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) suggests that if all the males in a lek where genetically related, then the males (even the subordinate males) would receive fitness benefits.  Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) demonstrated the kin selection hypothesis by determining the genetic structure of different lekking groups of the Whipsnade Park peacock population.  Peacocks, a typical lekking species, form aggregates at neutral display sites.  Peacocks use their calls to attract receptive peahens.  Upon the arrival of a peahen, the peacocks cease calling and perform intricate plumage displays.  As common in lekking species, the peacocks with the most appealing courtship displays have a high mating success while the subordinate peacocks have no mates.  The lekking sites of peacocks are carefully chosen and after a male’s fourth year of lekking, he will establish his permanent lekking site.  Peacocks will return to this same lekking site every mating season (Petrie ''et al.'', 1999).
	
Using multilocus fingerprinting, Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) compared the genetic similarity of within and between the lekking groups of Whipsnade Park’s peacocks.  The results supported the proposed kin selection hypothesis.  As predicted, the degree of band-sharing within the leks was substantially higher than the band-sharing between the leks.  The band sharing within the leks was indicative of that of half-siblings.  After this discovery, Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) proposed subsequent hypotheses of why these lekking groups consisted of related individuals.  Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) suggested that related peacocks tended to display together because their dispersal was concentrated around their natal sites.  This hypothesis was rejected when peacocks of mixed relatedness were reared away from their natal sites but, upon reintroduction into the Whipsnade Park population, joined leks with closely related peacocks.  It was then suggested that peacocks’ tendency to congregate with relatives was due to a shared genetic preference for habitat-selection.  This was rejected due to the homogenous environmental features of the park.  Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) concluded that unique structure of the peacock leks was driven by kin selection based on self-referent phenotypic matching [[(“Armpit Effect”]]).  Petrie ''et al.'' (1994) predicted that peacocks match heritable similarities of their own phenotype with those of other males.  Because the authors believed that peacocks do not participate in the rearing of their offspring, they posit that a peafowl’s recognition of their father must be genetically innate.  The tendency to form leks with relatives, therefore, occurs in the absence of social cues to their identity.  By cooperatively forming leks with genetically related individuals, subordinate peacocks forfeit their chances of mating, but increase the chance that their genes will be passed on via successful relatives.  The indirect benefits of fitness seen in peacock lekking displays outweigh the costs of communal displays (Petrie ''et al.'', 1999).

There are four distinct genera of Peafowl: Pavo, Afropavo, Rheiinartia and Argusianus. Though it is frequently reported that male peafowl do not participate in nest defense or rearing paternal care of young has been observed in all four genera. Only the common Indian Peafowl Pavo cristatus is frequently kept in captivity. Its behaviors in zoo settings may not reflect its evolutionary history to the degree that wild populations of the species might.

==Hotspot Hypothesis==

According to the hotspot hypothesis, males form leks because females frequently visit certain &quot;hotspots&quot;.

==Hotshot Hypothesis==

The hotshot hypothesis predicts that males form leks because subordinate males congregate around highly attractive males to increase their chance of being noticed by receptive females.

==Female Preference Hypothesis==

The female preference hypothesis predicts that males form leks because female like to visit large clusters of males consisting of a variety of potential mates from which she can quickly and safely compare the quality of her mating choices.

[[File:Wikijunior Puma.jpg|thumb|A puma hiding behind a rock]]
The '''Puma''' or '''Mountain Lion''' is a rather large cat, though it is classified as a smaller cat by scientists.  Like smaller cats, pumas cannot roar though they can muster a very startling snarl or a piercing cry.  In some places, these cats are also called cougars, catamounts, painted cats, panthers or painters.  Scientists call them ''Puma concolor''.

According to an old Mayan legend, all the animals of the jungle once looked the same until the gods offered to make them look different.  The jaguar asked, &quot;Let me be spangled with stars,&quot; and it was so.  He was pleased with his gift and showed it to the puma.  Not to be outdone, the puma asked the gods that he be as splendid as the jaguar, and it was so.  Pleased with himself the puma went out to hunt.  Unfortunately, he fell and rolled in the dust which clung to his still-wet design.  For this foolishness he and all pumas thereafter went through life the color of the earth.

==Where do pumas live?==
[[Image:Puma range.png|thumb|left|Places pumas live are colored green]]
Pumas are widely spread in North, Central and South America.  They can be seen in a variety of habitats including deserts, swamps and forests from northern British Columbia all the way down to the southern end of the Andes mountain range.  Pumas were driven out of the eastern half of North America by human pressure; a small population remains in Florida and occasionally there are puma sightings in other eastern states.

==What do pumas look like?==
[[Image:MountainLion.jpg|thumb|right|A mountain lion in Arizona]]
Most pumas are a light brown color, with black-tipped ears and tail.  The pumas that live closest to the Equator are the smallest, and increase in size in populations closer to the poles. (This sort of size increase is seen in tigers too.  The smallest ones live in the tropics, the largest Siberian tigers live far to the north where winters are very cold.)  The endangered Florida Panther is the smallest of the Pumas. Like many other cats, they can retract their sharp claws into their paws, which have four toes.  The largest male pumas can be as big as eight feet (2.4 meters) long, and females can be as large as seven feet (2.1 meters).  The males weigh in a bit less than the average adult human at about 150 pounds (70 kilograms),  with females weighing even less at 75 pounds (35 kilograms) or less.

Although pumas do not have a bright pattern, there are distinct black &quot;tearstains&quot; on their upper lips and a vivid white fur around the mouth that emphasizes facial expressions.  Although cougars cannot roar, when they growl their &quot;business end&quot; looks rather intimidating, helped along by the markings.

==What do pumas eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
[[Image:Cougar closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Puma closeup.]]
Pumas mostly eat large animals like deer.  Because the puma can run very fast, as much as 45 mph (72.42 km/h), and because they can jump 30 ft (10 m) forward from a standing position, they can very easily catch slower animals. Pumas can jump 18 ft (6 m) straight up and can climb onto rocks and up trees to hunt. Their bite is very strong, much stronger than a strong dog's bite, and their largest teeth are about twice the size of a large dog's teeth. 

Pumas have a very powerful hunting instinct, and have sometimes been known to chase and catch humans on bicycles. A favorite food for pumas is the deer, but they will also eat smaller animals.  In areas where pumas and people live close together, pumas have hunted dogs and cats for food, but they usually do not hunt people for food. If you are around a puma, it is better not to run fast or to ride a bicycle, because their instinct is to chase, catch and kill running animals.

On January 8, 2004 a puma killed and partly ate a mountain biker in Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park, in Orange County, California, but attacks on humans are rare.

===Stay safe around pumas===
[[Image:Saguaro National Park1.JPG|right|350px]]
These are good safety ideas for areas where pumas live:

*Never hike alone, Pumas are more likely to attack people who are alone than in a group. 
 
*If you see a puma, do not run, because their instinct might make them chase you. Instead, stand and face the animal, and look into its eyes. Stand tall, raise your arms, and make yourself look large. The puma will think you are a giant and run away. If it comes toward you, scare it away by shooting a gun, waving your arms, or throwing things.

*Warning: Guns should be handled by an adult. 

*Do not turn away from the puma; do not crouch down or do anything that would make you seem like an animal.  If you or someone in your group is attacked, fight back by throwing stones, hitting or kicking. Pumas have been chased away by using rocks, sticks, garden tools and bare hands.  The best place to hit a puma is on the nose.

*Watch around you when in an area where pumas might be.  Like other cats, they like to spring out from a hiding place and attack their prey from behind.

*Don't go hiking with your pet in areas with pumas, because any animal (even a dog) can make a puma want to chase and kill it, because of the &quot;chase reflex&quot; that pumas have.  Also, the puma might be attracted to your pet's food.

==Fun facts==
* Female pumas call to potential mates with a piercing cry that sounds much like a high pitched scream. Every year some panicked people call the police to report an &quot;attack&quot; in progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Polyandry ==

Polyandry is defined as “the mating of one female with more than one male while each male mates with only one female.” Exclusive polyandry (as opposed to polyandry in concert with polygyny) is very rare, occurring in only about 1% of animal populations, most being shorebirds like the sandpiper. The basis of polyandry is a sex role reversal. The females compete for the males and are larger and more colorful, while the males take on the parental role. With the sex role reversal, a natural selection against older males evolves. This is accomplished by the females tending to select the males with the best sperm in order to give the female the most offspring possible. Younger males will more likely have fertile sperm; therefore impregnating the female on more instances than an older male with less fertile sperm. 

===Types===
There are two major [http://www.stanfordalumni.org/birdsite/text/essays/Polyandry.html types of polyandry]: simultaneous and sequential. Simultaneous polyandry is when the female controls a very large territory.  Inside this territory, the female has multiple smaller nesting territories with different males. The female mates with all males simultaneously, keeping control of the smaller territories. Another form of simultaneous polyandry, cooperative simultaneous polyandry, is when the female only has one nesting area where she mates with multiple males producing a clutch of eggs of mixed parentage with all males contributing to the eggs. Sequential polyandry, the most common form, is where the female mates and produces a clutch of eggs with one male, then leaves the male to incubate and rear the eggs while moving on to another male in a different nesting territory. Here, the female moves from one male to another, leaving the male in full responsibility of the eggs instead of sharing the responsibility.

===Benefits===
There are many genetic benefits of polyandry. The first being fertility insurance. This hypothesis suggests that by mating with multiple males, the female is guaranteed to fertilize all of her eggs. The multiple partners potentially make up for one male that may not be able to fertilize the eggs. The good genes hypothesis states that the females have multiple mates because she is in search of the male that will pass along the best genes to her offspring. By finding this male, the female is increasing the survival rate of her offspring. The genetic compatibility hypothesis is one that suggests that the female finds multiple mates in order to find the most compatible genetic match for her eggs. While looking for a good match, she is also eliminating the males that are least compatible with her eggs. 

	The material benefits of polyandry can be seen through three hypotheses. The more resource hypothesis suggests that the more mates the female has, the more males she has to care for her clutch. The better protection hypothesis states that by having multiple partners, the female is better protected from predators. The infanticide reduction hypothesis is one that claims that since the female has multiple males, she has a lower infanticide rate because the males do not know which progeny belong to them. This prevents the males from killing other male’s young. Although some infanticide occurs between females and other female’s eggs, it is minimal among males.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A DBQ is a document-based question.  It typically provides anywhere from 4 to 10 primary source documents and is primarily found on the European History, World History, and US History Advanced Placement classes.

==Analyze the Question==
1. Rask Words? - Analyze, compare, contrast, criticize, interpret, trace, etc.?

2. What are the key subjects and terms? - People, places and events?

3. What are the boundaries or limits? - Dates and periods

4. What is the source? (&lt;u&gt;Hint&lt;/u&gt;: In the source, look for anything that could have possibly influenced the author or documents' point of view)

==Prewrite==
1. Brainstorm a list of ideas to write about (i.e. P.O.V., frame of reference, credibility, bias, etc.)

2. Group your documents by category, which arouse you most?.

3. Practice writing a thesis sentence on scratch paper making sure to answer all parts of the question.

==Write==
1. The intro paragraph should include an introduction sentence, possibly including the historical setting, significance and/or history of the subject, and the thesis statement.

2. Each of the body paragraphs (2-3) SHOULD tie back to the categories in the thesis sentence.

3. Each of the body paragraphs (2-3) SHOULD explain the P.O.V. of at least 1 document, and what might have influenced this P.O.V. (i.e. frame of reference).

4. In each of the body paragraphs, explain what additional document P.O.V. would have helped you better answer the question and why.

5. Good essays have conclusions. Good writers will pick up one essay point in their conclusion. (&lt;u&gt;Hint&lt;/u&gt;: D.B.Q. conclusions could easily be used to discuss missing documents or “voices”) see #4.

==Drugs==
'''SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators)'''
*tamoxifen

'''Aromatase inhibitors:'''
*anastrozole (Arimidex)
*exemestane (Aromasin)
*letrozole (Femara)

'''Others:'''
*fulvestrant - unique mechanism of action, binds to ER creating a complex that is destroyed by the cell.

==Tamoxifen==
*'''NSABP B-14''', (1982-88) - Tamoxifen for ER-positive tumors
**2818 pts. LN negative, ER-positive, any type of surgery, randomized to placebo or tamoxifen 10 mg BID x 5 years. Tamoxifen given concurrently with XRT. Type of surgery: total mastectomy 62%, lumpectomy + RT 38%.
**''Modifications'': From 1987-94, a 2nd randomization (643 pts) for those who completed 5 yrs of tamoxifen were randomized to 5 additional years of tamoxifen vs placebo. Also, in 1988, 1211 pts were registered (but not randomized) to tamoxifen x 5 yrs. Those who were event free were randomized (1992-94) to an additional 5 yrs or not.

==Radiation with tamoxifen==
*'''NSABP B-21''', 2002 (1989-98) - Node negative &lt;1 cm tumors - randomized to tamoxifen alone, RT alone, or tamoxifen + RT
**1009 women. Lumpectomy + AND. ER/PR status not required but was available for 70%
**PMID 12377957 &amp;mdash; &quot;Tamoxifen, radiation therapy, or both for prevention of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after lumpectomy in women with invasive breast cancers of one centimeter or less.&quot; Fisher B et al. J Clin Oncol. 2002 Oct 15;20(20):4141-9. 
***At 8 years, ipsilateral breast recurrence in 16.5% (TAM), 9.3% (XRT), 2.8% (T/RT). (That is, about 0.5% / year for T/RT). No difference in DM. Contralateral breast cancers in 5.4% (XRT without TAM) vs 2.2% (TAM +/- RT). XRT alone group had fewer IBTR than the TAM group for both ER+ and ER-. In ER+ tumors, adding TAM to RT resulted in a N.S. lower rate of IBTR.  Adding RT to TAM resulted in a lower IBTR rate for both ER+ and ER-.
***Risk of IBTR: XRT alone vs TAM alone: 49% reduction with XRT. XRT + TAM vs XRT alone: 63% reduction. XRT + TAM vs TAM alone: 81% reduction.

===Sequencing===
In vitro studies showed that breast tumor cells are less sensitive to radiation in the presence of tamoxifen.  This is believed to be due to the fact that tamoxifen is cytostatic and thus places the cells in a radioresistant part of the cell cycle.  Clinical studies showed that chemotherapy + tamoxifen was less effective, and this was extrapolated to radiation.

No randomized studies.

'''Retrospective studies:'''
&lt;br&gt; All 3 studies show no difference in any survival parameters.
*Yale-New Haven, 2005 (1976-99) - PMID 15545666 &amp;mdash; &quot;Sequence of radiotherapy with tamoxifen in conservatively managed breast cancer does not affect local relapse rates.&quot; Ahn PH et al. J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jan 1;23(1):17-23.
**Retrospective. Stage I-II invasive breast cancer treated with breast conserving therapy + tamoxifen. 254 pts concurrent RT+TAM, 241 RT followed by TAM. Median f/u 10.4 yrs. No difference in OS, DM, LR. However, pt groups unbalanced--younger pts (58 vs 62 yrs) and more pts given chemo (38% vs 14%) in sequential group.

**107 pts received RT then chemo then TAM, 202 chemo then concurrent RT/TAM. About 50% had hormone receptor negative tumors. No difference in OS&lt; DFS, LF, RF, DF.

==Chemotherapy with tamoxifen==
*'''NSABP B-09''' (1977-80) - Combination chemotherapy PF (L-PAM + 5-FU) +/- tamoxifen
**1891 pts. Combination chemotherapy (L-PAM + 5-FU) +/- tamoxifen

**1124 pts. Node-positive, ER+.
**PMID 2189950, 1990 &amp;mdash; &quot;Postoperative chemotherapy and tamoxifen compared with tamoxifen alone in the treatment of positive-node breast cancer patients aged 50 years and older with tumors responsive to tamoxifen: results from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-16.&quot; Fisher B et al. J Clin Oncol. 1990 Jun;8(6):1005-18.

**CMF x 6 cycles monthly. AC x 4 cycles. Tamoxifen 5 years.
**No differences between AC and CMF nor any between chemotherapy and chemotherapy+tamoxifen.

*'''International Breast Cancer Study Group IBCSG 13-93''' (1993-99)
**PMID 16505417, 2006 &amp;mdash; &quot;Tamoxifen After Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Premenopausal Women With Lymph Node-Positive Breast Cancer: International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial 13-93.&quot; Colleoni M et al [International Breast Cancer Study Group]. J Clin Oncol. 2006 Mar 20;24(9):1332-41.
**Randomized. 1246 pts, premenopausal, node-positive. EC or AC chemo followed by CMF followed by tamoxifen or no hormonal therapy. 59% were ER+.
**Tam improved DFS for ER+ but not ER-. HR = 0.59 for ER+. In ER-absent (0% staining) pts, Tamoxifen was detrimental with HR=2.10. 
**Conclusion: Tamoxifen improves DFS in ER+ pts after chemotherapy.

**1477 pts, node-positive, hormone receptor positive. Randomized to 1) TAM alone, 2) CAF followed by TAM, or 3) CAF + TAM concurrently.
**Median f/u 8.5 yrs. DFS 67% (sequential) vs 62% (concurrent), S.S.
**Conclusion: antagonism between tamoxifen and chemotherapy. Treatment should be sequential not concurrent.

==Aromatase inhibitors==
'''Introduction:''' Aromatase converts androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens--estrone and estradiol.  In post-menopausal women, estrogen synthesis takes place in muscle, skin, fat, and breast by aromatase, leading to low levels of estrogen.  

Aromatase inhibitors produce a near-total blockade of aromatase activity and lead to an estrogen level of 1-10% of its pretreatment level.  '''Aromatase inhibitors have been ineffective in pre-menopausal women because of higher levels or ovarian aromatase.'''
Commercially available aromatase inhibitors: 
*''non-steroidals'' &amp;mdash; anastrozole (Arimidex), letrozole (Femara)
*''steroidal'' &amp;mdash; exemestane (Aromasin)

'''Trials:'''
*'''ARNO 95''' (1996-2002) 
**Randomized. 979 patients, postmenopausal, pT1-3N0-2. Treated with Tamoxifen x2 years, then randomized to Arimidex x3 years vs. Tamoxifen x 3 yrs
**'''3-years, 2007''' PMID 17563395 -- &quot;Improved overall survival in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer after anastrozole initiated after treatment with tamoxifen compared with continued tamoxifen: the ARNO 95 Study.&quot; (Kaufmann M, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jul 1;25(19):2664-70.) Median F/U 2.5 years after randomization (which was after 2 years of TAM)
***3-year outcome: OS benefit (HR 0.53, SS); DFS anastrozole 93% vs. tamoxifen 89% (SS); contralateral incidence 1.4% vs. 1.0%
***Toxicity: anastrozole 23% vs. tamoxifen 31% (SS), mainly due to fewer endometrial events
***Conclusion: After 2 years of tamoxifen, switch to Arimidex better
***JCO Editorial: PMID 17563391

*'''ATAC Trial (1996-2000)''' - Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination
**First results (2002): [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12090977 Abstract] [http://www.thelancet.com/journal/vol359/iss9324/full/llan.359.9324.original_research.21481.1 Full text] &amp;mdash; Baum et al. &quot;Anastrozole alone or in combination with tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer: first results of the ATAC randomised trial.&quot; Lancet. 2002 Jun 22;359(9324):2131-9.
***9366 post-menopausal pts (3125 randomized to anastrozole, 3116 to tamoxifen, 3125 to combination). Treatment for 5 years. Arimidex 1 mg qd; tamoxifen 20 mg qd. Started within 8 weeks after finishing chemotherapy, but could start during XRT. Median F/U 33 months. 84% were hormone receptor positive, 8% negative, 8% unknown. 47% had mastectomy. 60% were N0.
***At 3-years, DFS 89.4%(A) vs 87.4%(T) vs 87.2%(C). 2% absolute risk reduction. Comparing A vs T: 317 vs 379 events, HR=0.83. Comparing A vs C, HR=0.81. Combination not significantly different than A alone. Time to recurrence hazard ratio = 0.79.   DFS improvement seen in hormone receptor positive patients but not receptor negative pts.  Decreased rate of contralateral breast cancer 58%.  Improved side effect profile (see below). No difference in ischemic heart disease. Further follow-up needed before reporting OS or DM.
***Initial results showed that a new cancer had developed in 317 women in the Arimidex group (10%), 379 women in the tamoxifen group (12%), and 383 women in the group of women taking both drugs (12%). This means that the relative risk of recurrence for everyone in the study was 17% less for the women taking Arimidex as compared to the women taking tamoxifen. (This analysis included both hormone-receptor-positive and hormone-receptor-negative cancers.)  After this publication, stopped randomization to the combination arm.

***Median F/U 68 months. Improved DFS (HR=0.87), time to recurrence (HR=0.79), distant mets (HR=0.86), contralateral breast cancers (42% reduction). No difference in overall survival.  Improved side effect profile for endometrial cancer (0.2 vs 0.8%), vaginal bleeding (5.4 vs 10.2%) or discharge (3.5 vs 13.23.5%), strokes (2.0 vs 2.8%), thromboembolic events (2.8 vs 4.5%), hot flashes (35.7 vs 40.9%), and need for hysterectomy (1.3 vs 5.1%)&amp;mdash;but worse for joint symptoms (35.6 vs 29.4%) and fractures (11 vs 7.7%).  Also, the rate of fractures increased approximately two-fold since first publication (for both drugs), showing the long-term effect of antiestrogen therapy or older population.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Peppered Moth (''Biston betularia'') ==
[[Image:Biston.betularia.7200.jpg|thumb|260px|''Biston betularia f. typica'', the white-bodied peppered moth.]]

Within one hundred years (1850 to 1950); the dotted whitish form of the peppered moth (''Biston betularia'') was almost entirely replaced by the melanic (black) form. The melanic form appeared to be best suited for survival against the soot that had collected on forest tree trunks from pollution because the moths could camouflage with their resting area on the tree. The dotted whitish form of the peppered moth was no longer predominant in this environment because they were easily detected and predated on. How does this happen? Many animals have anti-predator adaptations. Adaptations are defined as “a heritable trait that either spread because of natural selection and has been maintained by selection to the present or is currently spreading relative to alternative traits because of natural selection (Alcock, 2001).” Anti-predator adaptations suggest that a heritable trait, which enables the organism to hide from predators by seeking cover against a background, has spread by natural selection because of reproductive success. H.B. D. Kettlewell’s experiments on the peppered moths, as well as, those conducted by R.J. Howlett and M.E.N. Majerus have proven that the peppered moth’s preference for their resting places on trees are anti-predator adaptations.

In 1955, H.B. D. Kettlewell published his study on pepper moths: ''Selection Experiments on Industrial Melanism in the Lepidoptera''. Kettlewell hypothesized that the dotted whitish form of the peppered moth were more likely to be eaten than the melanic form because they could be easily detected against the soot covered trees. His studies showed that the moths that were easily identified by humans were at a higher risk of predation from birds. The dotted whitish form was at higher risk of predation than the melanic form in the polluted environment.

Howlett and Majerus further examined this hypothesis in their study: ''The Understanding of Industrial Melanism in the Peppered Moth'', published in 1987.  They tested it by pinning 50 of both forms of the peppered moths on pale and dark tree trunks.

== Calculations ==
'''Moths in Polluted (dark) Woodland'''

Dotted Whitish Form: (30/50) x 100 = 60%
Melanic Form: (20/50) x 100 = 40%

60% - 40% = 20%  The Dotted Whitish form is predated on 20% more than the melanic form in the polluted woodland.

'''Moths in Non-polluted (pale) Woodland'''

Dotted Whitish Form: (15/50) x 100 = 30%
Melanic Form: approx. (30/50) x 100 = 60%

60% - 30% = 30% The Melanic form is predated on 30% more than the dotted whitish form in the nonpolluted woodland.
----
Their studies showed that the dotted whittish form was preyed on 20% more than the melanic form in the polluted woodland. The melanic form is predated on 30% more than the dotted whitish form in the nonpolluted woodland. 

In addition to the difference in predation, their studies also showed that in both the polluted and nonpolluted environments the moths that were located on the limb joints instead of the trunks were less likely to be preyed on. 

Howlett and Majerus showed that the dotted whitish form was at a higher risk of predation when resting against the polluted (dark) trees. The melanic form had a greater chance of survival and reproduction because they were less likely to be detected against the soot-covered trees, the same findings of Kettlewell years before. Their experiment proved that the melanic form was an anti-predator adaptation, which is why the dotted whitish form had become so rare. The melanic form had become the dominant trait for survival and reproduction in the polluted woodland.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Antipredator Adaptations used by the Monarch Butterfly==

The relationship between prey and predators continually changes.  Prey need to find ways to outsmart predators in order to survive and reproduce.most monarch butterflies do not live very long. that's why they are endangered. One way monarch butterflies increase their fitness is by forming huge groups of up to ten million.  As their group size increases, the probability that any one monarch butterfly will be captured decreases.  Moreover, the butterflies located in the center of a large group are more likely to survive than those on the outside (Pike, 1999).  This is known as the “dilution effect (Alcock, 2001).”

Monarch butterflies that choose to migrate to closed-area overwintering sites are less likely to be attacked by a predator.  Also, by reacting as a group to the movement of a predator, monarch butterflies are better able to scare away predators (Pike, 1999).  This “mass startle effect” is thought to stun the predators and provide time for the butterfly to escape (true shock and awe indeed).

The aforementioned are collective ways in which the butterfly behaves in order to elude a predator.  There are, however, certain individual inherent features that the monarch butterflies possess that increase their probability of avoiding a predator.

Monarch butterflies contain chemicals that are toxic to many predators.  Evidently, this makes other similar but harmless species envious.  In Batesian mimicry, a palatable species attempts to mimic an unpalatable species in an attempt to increase its own fitness.  The monarch butterfly species is one that some Batesian mimics model themselves after perhaps because the monarch butterflies are so successful at avoiding predators (Mappes, 1997).  The Batesian mimics, although they are not harmful to predators, experience increased fitness because they model a potentially harmful species such as the monarch butterfly.  The viceroy butterfly (''Limenitis archippus'') is one such butterfly that models itself after the monarch (Pike, 1999).

Although monarch butterflies do not gain an increase in fitness as models of Batesian mimics, they do benefit from Müllerian mimicry.  In Müllerian mimicry, two unrelated, toxic species converge on a similar morphology.  If more than one unpalatable species has a similar morphological trait, then the predators may more easily recognize a Müllerian mimic as potentially harmful.  This saves both the mimics and the predators time and energy.

Lastly, monarch butterflies display aposematism or warning coloration.  This warning coloration is meant to be very conspicuous (Alcock, 2001).  Monarch butterflies make themselves conspicuous by having bright orange areas on its wings.  Predators quickly learn that prey containing these bright colors are potentially harmful.  For example, when a blue jay consumes a monarch butterfly, it vomits shortly after.  From that point on, the blue jay associates features of the monarch butterfly, such as its bright colors, as unpalatable (Alcock, 2001).  Because of their morphological features, Batesian mimics, Müllerian mimics, and many other aposematic species all gain from the monarch’s unpalatability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Say you have a surface charge plastered over a sphere's surface (which no charge within sphere).  Does Gauss' law suggest that E inside the sphere is 0 (since a Gaussian surface fully contained within the sphere will enclose no charge)?

===Answer===
Yes and no, Gauss's law does not say that there is no electric field flux through an empty area, it just says that the fluxes will all cancel out. 
But if you do have a spherical shell that is uniformly charged, there will indeed be no electric field inside it. --[[User:Frontier|Frontier]] 12:36, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Honeybee Foraging Behavioral Analysis ==

The common honeybee (''Apis mellifera'') forages around the hive in search of resources.
Usually this resource constitutes food in the form of pollinating flowers. Several landmark studies were performed in the middle of the 20th century to analyze how these social organisms communicated exact distances and direction to one another in order to effectively locate these resources. Karl von Frisch determined that honeybees perform two distinct dance routines that coincide with two different distance approximations made by the foraging bee. These two dances, the Round dance and the Waggle dance, communicate to the other the approximate distance from the hive to the new resource. Only the Waggle dance communicates direction (von Frisch 1967).

The Round dance is performed by the returning bee usually in complete darkness, vertically on a honeycomb. The circuitous motion attracts other foragers, which then learn that the resource is within approximately 50 meters of the hive. No direction is given by this routine (von Frisch). As a result, the newest foragers leave to search in all directions surrounding the hive. Behaviorally, this dance is energetically favorable due to the short distances travelled. In contrast, the Waggle dance is energetically unfavorable to the individual, but beneficial to the hive.

The Waggle dance is performed primarily when the resource is further than 50 meters. The
returning forager either performs the dance on a vertical surface or a horizontal one. To determine distance and direction, the bee orientates itself relative to the sun. Any deviation from this point gives the angle the new foragers should pursue. If vertical, the bee orientates itself to gravity. Perpendicular to the ground becomes the reference point (i.e. the sun). Deviations from such relay direction accordingly. Distance is communicated by the length of the abdomen shake that forms the middle of a figure eight dance (von Frisch).

Kirchner et al. determined that the Round dance does not convey direction. By tipping several
hives onto their horizontal axis and placed a resource 10 meters away, the reference heading was experimentally altered. Regardless of the hive orientation, the number of successful returning foragers was constant (1998). Once the distance crossed 50 meters, the success rate decreased for hives orientated horizontally, indicating direction is dependent on hive orientation for the waggle dance to be effective.

Honeybees foraging behavior can be interpreted from a historical or adaptationist view.
Lindauer performed historical analysis that reveals that distantly related bees might have evolved through 3 stages of development: First stage analysis reveals that the genus ''Trigona'' conveyed direction by buzzing to gain their hivemates attention. The odors trapped on the bee trigger others to forage in search of the odor. The secondary stage involves marking the path from the resource to the hive with mandibular pheromones. She then buzzes, and the bees follow the scent markers. The third stage involves an in-flight &quot;waggle dance&quot; in the direction of the resource (Lindauer 1961).

Seely et al. provides an adaptationist theory on bee dance evolution. The foragers seek new
resources to provide increased hive fitness. By dancing, the cost/benfit ratio is reduced to the individual level more so than a group of foragers expending energy searching in all directions all the time (Seely et al. 1998). Their study demonstrates that dancing has become an evolutionarily desirable trait because less time foraging allows for more time collecting the resource. Honeybee dancing provides an evolutionarily advantageous behavior which optimizes the hive's fitness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Concept of Total Depravity==

===What Total Depravity Is Not===
*It does not mean that someone who is considered unregenerate has absolutely no concept of morality or conscience.
*It does not mean that someone is totally sinful - that is, as wicked as is possible.
*It does not mean engagement in every possible mode of sin.

===What Total Depravity Is===
*It does mean that sin affects each and every aspect of a person: the mind, body, will, and spirit.
*It does mean that acts thought to be altruistic will always contain at least a shade of improper motive - nothing one does is born totally and completely out of a perfect, flawless desire to serve God.
*It does mean that we as human beings are wholly incapable of eradicating our problem of sin by means of our own volition.

==''Ezâfe''==

{{Persian/translation |en=the door of the house|fa=در خانه
|در|'''dar'''|door|
||e|of|
|خانه|xu'''ne'''|house|}}
An important part of Persian grammar is the handy little linking element called {{term-fa|اضافه|ezâfe|addition}}. It is used to extend a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase by adding an unstressed particle similar English “of”, followed by other words like adjectives, nouns, pronouns, and full phrases.

After a consonant, the ''ezâfe'' particle is pronounced as an unstressed ‹e› in standard Persian and is not usually written.  On the right, {{term-fa|در|dar|door}} is extended by the ''ezâfe'' particle and the noun {{term-fa|خانه|xune|house}}, making the Persian phrase {{Persian/text|در خانه|'''dar'''-e xu'''ne'''|the door of the house}}.  {{Persian/text|در|dar}} ends in a consonant, so the ''ezâfe'' particle is pronounced ‹e› and is not written.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation |en=my house|fa=خانه (خانهٔ) من
|خانه|xu'''ne'''|house|
||ye|of|
|من|'''man'''|me|}}
After a vowel, the ''ezâfe'' particle is pronounced as unstressed ‹ye› and may be written as &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; or, after a silent &lt;big&gt;ه&lt;/big&gt;, it may be written as a miniature superscript &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; that looks like a ''hamze'' diacritic, i.e. as &lt;big&gt;هٔ&lt;/big&gt;.  Usually, though, it is only written after a vowel when extra clarity is wanted; otherwise it is often left unwritten.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation |en=the woman’s scarf|fa=روسریی زن
|روسری|rusa'''ri'''|scarf|
|ی|ye|of|
|زن|'''zan'''|woman|}}
When ''ezâfe'' extends one noun by adding another, it often indicates that the first noun’s referent belongs to the second one’s, as shown on the right in the Persian phrase {{Persian/text|روسریی زن|rusari-ye zan|the woman’s scarf}}.  In older texts, ''ezâfe'' after &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; is often represented by a small superscripted &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; that resembles ''hamze'' (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;ء&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;), so you may see words like &lt;big&gt;{{Persian/text|روسرئ زن}}&lt;/big&gt;, but today, &lt;big&gt;{{Persian/text|یی}}&lt;/big&gt; (and thus &lt;big&gt;{{Persian/text|روسریی زن}}&lt;/big&gt;) is more common.

Colloquially, short forms are used even after vowels.
{{Persian/stub|Is this correct in all dialects?}}

Adding a noun with ''ezâfe'' is not only used for ownership.  It may indicate a family relationship:
* {{Persian/text|ناصر خسرو|nâ'''ser'''-e xos'''row'''|Nasir, [son] of Khusraw}}
* {{Persian/text|پدر و مادر من و شما|pe'''dar''' o mâ'''dar''' e '''man''' o šo'''mâ'''|mother and father of me and you}}

It may indicate composition or purpose:
* {{Persian/text|کاسه مس|kâ'''se'''-ye '''mes'''|the bowl [made] of copper, the copper bowl}}
* {{Persian/text|آب زندگی|'''âb'''-e zende'''gi'''|the water of life}}

It may also used for [[w:Apposition|apposition]]:
* {{Persian/text|آقای پیمان|â'''qâ'''-ye pey'''mân'''|the gentleman Peyman, Mr. Peyman}}
* {{Persian/text|روز جمعه|'''ruz'''-e jom'''’e'''|the day Friday}}
* {{Persian/text|شهر تهران|'''šahr'''-e teh'''rân'''|the city of Tehran}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation |en=the big door |fa=در بزرک
|در|'''dar'''|door|
||e|[that is]|
|بزرک|bo'''zorg'''|big|}}
''Ezâfe'' is also used to add an adjective, as in the phrase {{Persian/text|در بزرک|'''dar''' e bo'''zorg'''|the big door}}, shown on the right.  The particle in such constructions is not usually translated into English as a separate word, but it may be thought of as “that is”.
* {{Persian/text|آب گرم|'''âb'''-e '''garm'''|water [that is] warm, warm water}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation | en=on (the face of) the wall|fa=بر روی دیوار
|بر|bar|on|
|روی|'''ruy'''|face|
||e|of|
|دیوار|di'''vâr'''|wall|}}
''Ezâfe'' is also used with certain nouns that have preposition-like meaning.  In the example on the right and the one below, the nouns {{term-fa|روی|ruy|face}} and {{term-fa|زیر|zir|underside}} are used like prepositions with the help of ''ezâfe'':
* {{Persian/text|از زیر میز|az '''zir'''-e '''miz'''|from the underside of the table}}

''Ezâfe'' is also used to add prepositional phrases, e.g. {{term-fa|بعد از|ba’d az ...|after ...}}:
* {{Persian/text|روز بعد از آن اتفاق|'''ruz'''-e '''ba’d''' az un ette'''fâq'''|the day after that accident}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation |en=the big door of my house|width=50%|fa=در بزرک خانه من
|در|'''dar'''|door|
||e|[that is]|
|بزرک|bo'''zorg'''|big|
||e|of|
|خانه|xu'''ne'''|house|
||ye|of|
|من|'''man'''|me|}}
A noun phrase created with ''ezâfe'' may be extended with ''ezâfe'' again, as shown on the right.
&lt;!--

The following examples are from Encyclopedia Iranica (http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v9f2/v9f209.html).  They are too advanced for introduction at this level since we haven't yet covered infinitives or participles:

* Reduced relative clause: ‹dânešjuyân-e az orupâ bargašta› (“students back from Europe”)
* Nominalized verb phrase with infinitives and participles: {{Persian/text|کشتن شیر|koš'''tan'''-e '''šir'''|the killing of the lion}}, {{Persian/text|کشنه شدن شیر|'''koš'''te šo'''dan'''-e '''šir'''|the lion’s being killed)
* Figurative association: ‹nâma-râ ba-dast-e adab gereft› (“he took the letter with the hand of deference”, i.e., deferentially)
* Modification by infinitive: ‹âb-e xordan› (“drinking water”)

--&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

== Demonstrative Adjectives ==
{{Persian/translation | fa=این متاب|en=this book
|این|in|this|
|کتاب|ketâb|book|}}
{{Persian/translation | fa=آن پسر|en=that boy
|آن|un|that|
|پسر|pesar|boy|}}
As the dialogues in the previous lessons have shown, Persian does not have a word that corresponds to the English definite article “the”.  To say, “the book”, for example, the noun {{term-fa|کتاب|ketâb|book}} is normally used alone. Persian does, however, have the demonstrative adjectives {{term-fa|این|in|this}} and {{term-fa|آن|un|that}}.  These two words, unlike typical adjectives, are used before the noun with no intervening particle, as shown in the examples on the right.

Demonstrative contractions:
* {{term-fa|اینجا|injâ|here}}
* {{term-fa|آنجا|ânjâ|there}}, colloquially pronounced ‹unjâ›
* {{term-fa|چنین|conin|like this}}, colloquially pronounced ‹cenin›
* {{term-fa|چنین|conân|like that}}, colloquially pronounced ‹cenun›
* {{term-fa|همین|hamin|this [very] same}}
* {{term-fa|همان|hamân|that [very] same}}, colloquially ‹hamun›
* {{term-fa|کجا|kojâ|where}}

Demonstrative pronouns:
* {{term-fa|آنها|unhâ|those there}} or just &quot;those&quot;, special case where ها is always joined
* {{term-fa|اینها|inhâ|these here}}, second special case where ها ‹hâ› is always joined

== Plural nouns ==
{{Persian/connecting letters box|Arab=کتاب&amp;zwnj;ها|Latn=ketâbhâ
| کتاب&amp;zwnj;|ketâb|&amp;zwnj;ها|hâ}}
The usual way to make a plural in Persian is to add the suffix {{Persian/text|ها|ha}} to the noun.  The suffix is written immediately after the noun with no intervening space, but it is not normally joined to the last letter in the noun.

Colloquially, {{Persian/text|ها}} is pronounced ‹â›.

Many words have an alternative plural form that may be used instead of the normal Persian form.  In most cases, the alternative plural form comes from Arabic.  For example, animate nouns (those that denote humans or things with human-like characteristics) and nouns that denote paired body parts (e.g. eyes, ears, and hands) have an alternative plural form made with the suffix {{Persian/text|ان|ân}}:
* {{term-fa|پسر|pesar|boy}}  + {{Persian/text|ان|-an|-s}}
* {{term-fa|چشم|cešm|eye}} + {{Persian/text|ان|-an|-s}}

Many Arabic words have different plural forms that may be used in Persian.  Some are created by adding suffixes:
* {{term-fa|باغ|bâq|garden}} + {{Persian/text|ت|-at}} = {{Persian/text|باغت|bâqat|gardens}}
* {{term-fa|معلّم|mo’allem|teacher}} + {{Persian/text|ین|-in}} = {{Persian/text|معلّمین|mo’allemin|teachers}}

Others are called “broken plurals”:
* {{Persian/text|كِتاب|ketâb|book}}, {{Persian/text|كُتُب|kotob|books}},[http://www.zarsara.com/default.aspx  کتاب]
* {{Persian/text|وِقْت|vaqt|time}}, {{Persian/text|اوقات|owqat|times}}
* {{Persian/text|طَرَف||side, direction}}, {{Persian/text|اَطْراف||sides, directions}}
* {{Persian/text|شَخْس||person}}, {{Persian/text|اَشْخاس||persons}}

* {{Persian/text|شاعر||poet}}, {{Persian/text|شُعَرا||poets}}
* {{Persian/text|عَرَب||Arab}}, {{Persian/text|اَعْراب||Arabs}}

{{Persian/translation | fa=این کتاب‌ها|en=these books
|این|in|this, these|
|کتاب|ketâb|book|
|ها|-hâ|-s|}}
To make a noun phrase plural, only the main noun is changed.  Adjectives and demonstrative adjectives are not, as shown on the right.

====Numbers====
{{Persian/translation|en=twenty-one (21)|fa=بیست و یک
|بیست|bist|twenty|
|و|o|and|
|یک|yek|one|}}
After 20, Persian numbers use {{term-fa|و|o|and}} between digit, as shown in the example on the right.

== Simple past tense ==

In both English and Persian, verbs can be conjugated in the simple past tense to express that an event happened in the past or to comment about a past state of something.  For example, the English verb ''talk'' is conjugated into the simple past tense form ''talked'' by adding the suffix ''-ed''.

In colloquial speech, for example, the ending {{Persian/text|&amp;zwj;ید|-id}} is often pronounced as ‹-in›.  Other differences between spoken and written Persian will be given in the lessons that follow.&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained in [[Persian/Lesson 5|Lesson 5]], Persian verbs suffixes clearly indicate grammatical person and number.  For example, the table on the right shows the simple past tense of {{term-fa|بودن|budan|to be}}, consisting of the stem {{Persian/text|بود|bud-}} and suffixes to indicate the person and number:

The past stem is identical with the third person singular. Thus the past stem of the verb budan 'to be' is bud, the past stem of the verb guftan 'to say' is guft.

Unlike the simple present tense of {{Persian/text|بودن|budan}}, which has both a full and short forms, the simple past tense only has the forms above.

{{Persian/exercises-top|Conjugation
|show-answers=no}}
| Say each of the personal pronouns from the table above.  While saying each one, imagine and point to the people to whom the pronoun might refer.  For example, while saying {{term-fa|ما|mâ|we, us}}, imagine another person next to you and point to that person and yourself.
|-
| Repeat the personal pronouns as above, but after each one, say the corresponding simple past tense forms of {{Persian/text|بودن|budan}} from the table above.  For example, when saying {{term-fa|شما|šomâ|you (plural)}}, point to two imaginary addressees and then say {{Persian/text|بودید|budin}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt;
|}

To make the simple past tense form of any Persian verb, begin with the infinitive (the dictionary form), e.g. {{Persian/text|بودن|budan}}.  The infinitive of every Persian verb ends in the suffix {{Persian/text|ن|-an}}.   Remove the final {{Persian/text|ن|-an}} to get the past tense stem, e.g. {{Persian/text|بود|bud-}}.  Then add the appropriate past tense personal suffix from the table below to make the past tense verb form:

|-

|}
The same suffixes are used for '''all''' simple past tense verbs, so it is important to memorize them.

==Plurality and formality/deference==

plurality of verb with animate vs. inanimate subject

Plurality of subject reference, optional subject pronoun, and verb as it relates to formality and deference:
* Semantically plural human subject requires plural verb.
* 2nd person semantically singular addressee:
** Friendly, informal reference: (optional pronoun) تو /tow/, singular verb (ی ending)
** Semi-formal, respectful: (optional plural pronoun) شما /šomâ/, singular verb (ی ending)
** Formal, more respectful: plural verb, optional plural pronoun (شما), plural verb written with ید ending, pronounced colloquially as ین.
** Very formal conditions treating the addressee with deference: جناب عالی /jenâb âli/ (&quot;your excellency&quot;)

=== Third person ===
In the third person, the same pattern applies as with the second person.  The singular pronoun {{term-fa|او|u|he, he}} is the normal way to refer to an individual in the third person, but to show greater respect, the plural pronoun {{term-fa|ایشان|išân|they}} and/or a verb conjugated in the third person plural (i.e. with the personal suffix {{Persian/text|ند|-and}}, colloquially pronounced ‹-an›) may be used instead.

==Direct objects==
The word {{term-fa|را|râ}} marks definite direct objects in Persian.  That is, 

Colloquially, {{Persian/text|را}} is pronounced ‹ro› after a vowel or ‹o› after a consonant.

In written Persian, {{Persian/text|من را|man râ}} may contract to {{Persian/text|مارا|mârâ}}, but colloquially pronounced ‹mano›.  Similarly, written {{Persian/text|تو را|to râ}} can contract to {{Persian/text|تورا|torâ}} but colloquially pronounced ‹toro›.

==Direct objects==
Definite or human object enclitic {{term-fa|را|râ}}, colloquially pronounced or /o/ after consonant, /ro/ after vowel.

Persian doesn't have a direct article like “the”. In some situations {{Persian/text|را}} carries similar meaning, but is less used than &quot;the&quot;.

==Prepositions==
prepositions:
* {{term-fa|از|az|from, than, by}}
* {{term-fa|با|bâ|with}}
* {{term-fa|برای|barâye|for, in order to}}
* {{term-fa|بی|bi|without}}
* {{term-fa|بدون|bedun-e|without}}
* {{term-fa|به|be|to, in, at, on}}
* {{term-fa|دنبال|dombâl-e|behind}}
* {{term-fa|پشت|post-e|behind}}
* {{term-fa|نزدیک|nazdik-e|near}}
*‌ {{term-fa|پیش|pish-e|before, in front of}}
* {{term-fa|جلو|jelo-ye|before, in front of}}
* {{term-fa|روی|ruy-e|on, on the face of}}
* {{term-fa|تو|tu-ye|inside, into}}
* {{term-fa|در|dar|in}}
* {{term-fa|زیر|zir-e|under}}

Some Persian verbs often are accompanied by prepositional phrases that translate into English as transitive verbs with direct objects, especially common with {{Persian/text|از|az|from, than, by}} and {{Persian/text|بی|bi|without}}.

==Sentence structure==
(subject) (definite object را) (prep phrases) (adverbs) (predicate nominative/adjective) verb

In colloquial speech, for example, the ending {{Persian/text|&amp;zwj;ید|-id}} is often pronounced as ‹-in›.  Other differences between spoken and written Persian will be given in the lessons that follow.&lt;/ref&gt;

The table on the right shows the simple present tense forms of {{term-fa|گرفتن|gereftan|to get}}, consisting of the present/imperfect&lt;ref&gt;Persian used to have a truly simple present tense with no prefix, distinct from the present imperfect tense with the prefix {{Persian/text|می|mi}}.  In modern Persian, though, the present imperfect tense has replaced the simple present tense for all verbs but {{term-fa|داشتن|dâštan|to have}} and {{term-fa|بودن|budan|to be}}.&lt;/ref&gt; prefix {{Persian/text|می|mi}}, the present stem {{Persian/text|گیر|gir}} and suffixes to indicate the person and number.

To make a simple present tense form of a Persian verb, begin with the prefix {{Persian/text|می|mi}}.  Then add the present tense stem (which can be looked up in most dictionaries), e.g. {{Persian/text|گیر|gir}}.  Finally, add the appropriate present tense personal suffix from the table below to make the simple present tense verb form:
{| class=wikitable

|-
| present stem + ‹ad› || present stem + ‹an›&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt;
|-
| “he/she/it [does...]” || “they [do...]”
|}
As you can see, the present tense personal suffixes are the same as the past tense ones, except for the third person singular, which is {{Persian/text|د|ad}} in the present tense and nothing in the past.

Every Persian verb has two stems: the imperative/present stem and the past stem. In general, both stems of each verb must be learned because neither is not completely predictable from the other.  There are some common patterns, though.  For example, verbs whose infinitives end with {{Persian/text|تن|tan}}, {{Persian/text|دن|dan}}, or {{Persian/text|یدن|idan}} often form the present stem by dropping those endings:
{|
! Verb !! &amp;nbsp; !! Present stem
|-
| {{term-fa|کشتن|koštan|to kill}} || || {{Persian/text|کش|koš}}
|-
| {{term-fa|آوردن|âvardan|to bring}} || || {{Persian/text|آور|âvar}}
|-
| {{term-fa|رسیدن|residan|to arrive}} || || {{Persian/text|رس|res}}
|}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation|fa=فردا کر می‌کنم.|en=I work tomorrow.
|فردا|fardâ|tomorrow|
|کار|kar|work|
|می‌کنم|mikonam|I do}}
The simple present tense is also used to talk about a future event, as shown on the right.

The simple present tense can also be used to express that an event is occurring at the very moment that the speaker is speaking, but the present continuous tense is used more often for that purpose in both English and Persian.  The present continuous tense will be discussed in a later chapter.

== Personal clitics with noun phrases ==
Grammar: (bound) personal enclitics after (singular or plural) noun phrase:
* After consonant: /am/, /at/, /aš/, /emân/, /etân/, /ešân/
* After و or ا, /yam/, /yat/...
* After ه or ی, singular suffixes are spelled with leading zwnj+ا.

Often expresses possession /pedaram/ (&quot;my father&quot;), /dust-e xubam/ (&quot;my good friend&quot;)

alternative pronomial direct objects as enclitics

== Colloquial ==
Differences between spoken and written forms
* written را colloquially ‹o› or ‹ro›.  With possessive endings:
** {{Persian/text|کتابم را به او دادم|ketâbamow be u dâdam|I gave my book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابت را به او دادم|ketâbatow be u dâdam|I gave your book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابش را به او دادم|ketâbašow be u dâdam|I gave her book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابمان را به او دادم|ketâbemunow be u dâdam|I gave our book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابتان را به او دادم|ketâbetunow be u dâdam|I gave your book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابشان را به او دادم|ketâbašunow be u dâdam|I gave their book to him.}}
* colloquial ‹e›, ‹s› for است
* colloquial verb endings: ه ‹eh›
* written ان ‹ân› vs spoken ‹un›, but not in خانم ‹xânom›

Colloquially, when ‹â› comes before ‹a›, the latter elides:
* {{Persian/text|دست‌هایم|dasthâyam|my hands}} pronounced ‹dastâm›
* {{Persian/text|پایم|pâyam|my foot}} pronounced ‹pâm›

=Lesson 5: Measure words=

===Measure Words/量词(liàngcí)===
{| cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; rules=&quot;all&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px solid #000000;&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;white-space: wrap; background-color:#FFFFCC;&quot;| In Chinese, most specified or numbered nouns must be preceded by [[w:measure word|measure word]]s, also known as classifiers, according to the type of object. Consider the English phrase, &quot;two pairs of pants.&quot; Like the word &quot;pair,&quot; Chinese measure words are placed between the noun and the preceding number.
|}
1.  这本书里没有一个汉字。
:Zhè bĕn shū lǐ méi yŏu yí gè Hànzì.
:''This book doesn’t contain one Chinese character.''

2.  那间宿舍有六十个学生。
:Nà jiān sùshè yŏu liùshí ge xuésheng.
:''That dorm has sixty students.''

The phrase 一朵花 (yī duǒ huā) means &quot;one flower,&quot; but how would you say &quot;a pile of flowers?&quot; It's simple: just change the classifier. The phrase 一堆花 (yī duī huā) means &quot;a pile of flowers.&quot; You could also say 一把花 (yī bǎ huā; a handful of flowers), 一桶花 (yī tǒng huā; a bucket of flowers), or 一种花 (yī zhòng huā; a kind of flower). You can see that measure words act as adjectives.

In Chinese, like in English, you can omit the noun if it's already known, leaving only the classifier. 你看到那种（花）吗？ (Nǐ kàn dào nà zhǒng (huā) ma?) means &quot;Did you see that kind (of flower)?&quot; You can see that measure words also act as nouns.

Measure words are also used with [[w:demonstrative|demonstrative pronouns]] (this, that). For example, 这朵花 means &quot;this flower,&quot; and 那朵花 means &quot;that flower.&quot;

You might also encounter something like this: 书架上有书本。 (Shūjià shàng yǒu shūběn.) which means &quot;The bookshelf has books on it.&quot; Note that the classifier is after the noun. This signifies multiple books where the exact number is not important, here translated &quot;books.&quot; The sentence 书架上有书。, means the same as above, but is without the classifier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computer security has three main elements that can easily be remembered using the acronym CIA: '''C'''onfidentiality, '''I'''ntegrity, '''A'''vailability.

* '''Confidentiality''' is the task of ensuring that only those entities (persons or systems) cleared for access can read information.  Cryptography is a key element in ensuring confidentiality.

* '''Integrity''' is the task of ensuring that information is correct, and stays that way.

* '''Availability''' is the task of ensuring that systems responsible for delivering, storing and processing information are accessible when needed, by those who need them. This includes, for example, protection against denial of service (DoS) attacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sexual selection, a subcategory of natural selection, was first recognized by Charles Darwin and &quot;occurs when individuals differ in their ability to compete with others for mates or to attract members of the opposite sex&quot; (Alcock 493). By heavy courtship, fighting, or large territorial possession, males heavily compete for females. Eventhough a male may win a fierce competition for the mate of his choice, it is ultimately the female who decides on a partner that she wants. The female is often successful in her attempts to control reproduction by being choosy and having particular preferences for a male mate.

Females choose mates based on many factors. One important factor is male adornments, or ornaments. For example, Marion Petrie and Tim Halliday concluded that the removal of eyespots from a peacock's tail significantly reduces his attractiveness to females. &quot;After 20 eyespots had been cut from their tails, males averaged two fewer mates in the following breeding season compared with their performance in the previous year&quot; (Alcock 348). Thus, females are extremely conscious of the visual stimuli provided by males. Elaborate sensory cues alert the female that the male is reproductively superior to others. &quot;Male adornments may more readily elicit the mating responses of some females who will thus mate preferentially in favour of the adorned males&quot; (Bateson 53). Other factors involved in female preference in mate selection include body coloration or the &quot;gift&quot; that the male may present to the female before copulation. 

Four theories are used to explain mate choice in females. The good parent theory suggests that &quot;choosy individuals select partners on the basis of how well they will care for their offspring&quot; (Alcock 491). 
This theory focuses on the female's search of a paternal male. The healthy mate theory occurs when females prefer &quot;males healthy enough to produce and maintain elaborate ornaments&quot; (Alcock 491). A good example of this is in female house finches, who choose male mates based on their bright coloration. Bright coloration tells the female that the male is more resistant to pathogens and parasites. The good genes theory &quot;argues that females exhibit mate choice in order to provide their offspring with a partner's genes that will advance their offspring's chances of survival or reproductive success&quot; (Alcock 491). A mother always wants the best for her child, even if it is a future child. Females select mates with certain traits, because they want their children to be healthy, viable, and reproductively successful. &quot;Females that mate with attractive males are compensated for reduced fecundity by bearing &quot;sexy sons&quot; with higher than average mating success&quot; (Andersson 45). The least obvious theory is the runaway selection theory. It states that by being choosy, females &quot;create a positive feedback loop favoring both males with these attributes and females that prefer them&quot; (Alcock 493). 

A direct benefit of mate choice by females is the assurance of bearing offspring that will survive well and display high general fitness. This is a heritable benefit. Nongenetic benefits of mate choice include fecundity advantages, food, parental care, or a good territory. All of the benefits, both heritable and nonheritable, ultimately lead to the greater survival of a female's offspring.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Territoriality is a type of intraspecific or interspecific competition that results from the behavioral exclusion of others from a specific space that is defended as territory. This well-defined behavior is exhibited through songs and calls, intimidation behavior, attack and chase, and marking with scents. This form of defense proves to be very costly for animals. So one is forced to ask, Why do animals take part in such interspecific competition?

In order to understand this question one must take a cost-benefit approach to territoriality. The proximate reasons for such defense vary. For some animals the reason for participating in such elaborate protective behavior is to acquire and protect food sources, nesting sites, mating areas, or to simply attract a mate. The ultimate cause of this behavior may be attributed to the increased probability of survival and reproductive successes. In defending a territory an animal is ultimately securing that it will have an habitat in which to forage for food and to successfully reproduce, thus increasing the animal's overall fitness. This ultimate theory is strengthened when one considers the instances in which territoriality increases; in times of depleted resources the presence of territoriality increases. The presence of territoriality often forces less fit animals to live in sub optimal habitats, thus reducing their reproductive success.

Though territoriality offers immense reproductive and nutritional benefits, it also comes at a cost. Defending territory is not easy. Territoriality cost time and energy and can often interfere with other fundamental activities as parenting, feeding, courting, and mating. For these reasons territoriality may not be seen as a benefit in all animals. Animals must be able to reap the fruits of territoriality, while expending the least amount of energy. For these reasons if resources are abundant and predictable it would be disadvantageous to defend the territory. On the other hand, if resources are scarce and undependable it would be advantageous to exhibit territoriality. 

An animal chooses its territory by deciding what part of its home range it would like to defend. In selecting a territory the size and the quality play a crucial role in determining an animals habitat. Territory size generally tends to be no larger than the organism than requires to survive, because with an increase in territory comes an increased in energy expenditure. For some animals the territory size is not the most important aspect of territoriality, but rather the quality of defended territory. The quality is considered to be fundamentally important due to amount of food availability and superior nesting sights. Animals depend on these features to ensure their superior fitness. 

Animals invest a lot of time and energy in defending their territories, and for this reason they fight vigorously to defend their territory at all cost. Researchers suggest for this reason that when a rival challenges a territory holder, the owner almost always wins the contest. This phenomenon could be attributed to an evolutionary stable strategy which assets that rules for behavior is controlled by an inherited proximate mechanism such that the differences between individuals in their strategies are liked to differences in their genes. 
Territory plays an important role as a mechanism of population regulation, insuring the success of fit animals, and aiding in the eradication of less fit animals. Territorially also plays a fundamental role as an indicator of carrying capacity; it also serves as an indicator of how much habitat is necessary to support viable populations. For these reasons researchers continue to examine the well-developed behavior of territoriality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Question about Physics questions ==
I saw [[Physics questions]] a while ago and I would like to contribute. However, I'm not quite sure as to the goal of the page, and since you created the page, I thought you'd be the best person to ask: what was the original goal of creating the page? Was it for the purpose of having a collection of challenge problems for physics students, or was it for having a sort of &quot;Dr.Physics&quot; Q&amp;A thing? (i.e. Do you want the answers somewhere in the book? Or no? Or maybe in the talk page?) [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] 19:13, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Re: Question about Physics questions ==

This is an attempt to create a list of fun problems for everybody who likes 
to solve them himself or ask poor students to do this.
Every contribution is welcome. Some of content can be later moved to 
a Remedial Physics Course for MBA. Answers are fine with me but let's
try to obfuscate them a little. How about two passes of rot13 encryption ?
:Er... two passes? I think I know what ROT13 encryption is, but I'm not familiar with....wait, won't that give back the original text? ROT26? :) [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] 10:44, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reproduction is the sole method through which a species may continue, and reproduction manifests itself in numerous deviations throughout nature.  The ultimate goal of each species is to produce the maximum amount of offspring while exerting the least amount of energy.  Predation pressures, resource accessibility, and competition with the species for attracting mates greatly influence the likelihood of an individual within a species producing viable offspring and donating genes to subsequent generations.  Different fish species may be observed in order to learn the unique reproductive strategies employed throughout nature from fertilization tactics to parental care methods that have adapted these fish in continuing their species.

Females typically exert much more energy and time into reproduction than males, and therefore, females are usually more selective in choosing mates.  Females typically favor males that are larger in size, possess more elaborate physical traits than the other males, and display more energy in courtship activity &lt;ref&gt;[http://cetus.ucsd.edu/people/Ana/femalechoice.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, smaller and less desirable males must still be able to fertilize the eggs, or, according to natural selection, they would have been eliminated from the population.  Although slightly more unsettling, sexual coercion results in the fertilizing of eggs just as sexual courtship does.  The term “sneakers” refers to smaller males who opt to race into the nest more desired males and fertilize the eggs while the nesting male pursues the female &lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ipfw.edu/gillespi/BIOL%20598/Articles/Goncalves,%20et%20al.%202003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The term “satellites” describes cryptic males mimicking females in appearance and behavior so that they are able to fertilize the eggs while the unsuspecting couple spawn.

Although fish species exhibit both internal and external fertilization, fish also exemplify many unique strategies for parental care.  Most fish species utilize broadcast spawning, which is a method a releasing gametes into the water and providing no parental care.  The goal of this reproductive method is to produce the maximum amount of progeny in hopes that as many offspring as possible will survive.  Many fish species, however, opt to employ parental care in order to supply their smaller number of offspring a greater chance of survival.  Oral brooding and sex role reversal are two unique methods of parental care that have proved successful in certain fish species.

Oral brooding, although quite rare in nature, is a parenting method adopted by many fish in the Family Cichlidae &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cichlidae.com/articles/a133.php]&lt;/ref&gt;.  After the successful fertilization of the eggs, Cichlids, such as Tilapia, place the egg clutch into the mouth of the female.  The fecundity is significantly lower in oral brooders; however, the eggs tend to be larger and receive more nutrients.  By placing the eggs into the oral cavity, the female is able to provide protection for the eggs, and the churning ability of the female rotates the eggs so that each egg is exposed to oxygenated water.   

Similar to oral brooding, sex role reversal in fish is rare but is utilized in the Family Sygnathildae &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/seahorse/2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.  In sea horses, the female inseminates the male by inserting the oviduct into the male brooding pouch several times to ensure fertilization.  After fertilization is complete, the female departs, and the male attaches itself to a nearby object with its tail waiting for the eggs to mature.

Nature exhibits many alternatives that species have adapted in order to reproduce.  By utilizing these methods, these organisms are able to reproduce viable offspring and continue their kind.  Survival of the species is the ultimate goal for all organisms, and these organisms are constantly adapting to their environment in order to do so.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mimicry ==
A major concern of animals and other critters is to protect themselves from predators in order to survive and reproduce and pass their genes off to a new generation.  Many animals have evolved adaptations known as anti-predator devices such as camouflage and chemical toxins.  Animals use camouflage to blend in with their environments in an attempt to be unrecognizable by predators.  Other organisms such as the monarch butterfly contain chemical toxins that are secreted into the predator’s mouth when it attempts to eat the butterfly.  The monarch butterfly also has warning coloration that gives a warning sign to predators to remind them that the butterfly is toxic and should not be eaten.  

These anti-predator devices are so successful that other organisms have been known to mimic them.  The organism that is mimicked is known as the model and the third party that is deceived by the model and its mimic is known as the receiver.  The mimics have learned to take advantage of the color patterns and markings that predators have learned by experience to avoid.  The model is usually a species that has an abundant population and has successfully warded off predators with an anti-predator device.

Organisms have learned to mimic their surroundings or environment in an attempt to “hide” from predators.  For example, lizards have learned to mimic tree trunk color which proves to be very successful as predators will simply move past them as they believe that they are simply looking at a tree.  Another example of this type of mimicry can be seen with the Katydid who will mimic a leaf in both color and shape in an attempt to be hidden.  

Some prey animals have evolved certain patterns on their bodies that mimic other animals in an attempt to startle their predators.  The most common example of this type of mimicry can be found in some moths and butterflies who flash eye spots on their wings to predators.  These eye spots startle the predator who believes that the eyes belong to a much larger animal that may be a threat to them.

In one form of mimicry known as aggressive mimicry, an organism will mimic a signal that is either deceptive or attractive to its prey.  One example of this involves the praying mantis who will mimic flowers to attract insects that they can then capture and eat.  Organisms can also imitate the behaviors of other organisms.  Moth caterpillars, for example, will imitate the motion and body movements of a snake in order to scare off predators that are usually a prey item for snakes.

One of the most popular types of mimicry involves the warning coloration found on inedible or toxic organisms such as the monarch butterfly.  Once these toxic organisms have adapted this warning coloration which warns predators to stay away, other organisms may start to mimic this warning coloration in an attempt to stay alive.  Batesian mimics are those mimics that imitate unpalatable species even though they are palatable.  Therefore, one species is harmful while the other is harmless.  The wasp is a great example of Batesian mimicry.  The wasp is the model species in this example as it possesses a sting which enables it to escape from predators.  The bright warning coloration of the wasp has been mimicked by many other insects.  Even though the mimics are harmless, the predator will avoid them due to bad experiences with wasps with the same coloration.  With Müllerian mimicry, many unpalatable species share a similar color pattern.  Müllerian mimicry proves to be successful as the predator only has to be exposed to one of the species in order to learn to stay away from all the other species with the same warning color patterns.  The black and yellow striped bodies of social wasps, solitary digger wasps, and caterpillars of the cinnabar moths warn predators that the organism is inedible.  This is a great example of Müllerian mimicry as all of these unpalatable, unrelated species have a shared color pattern that keeps predators away.

Mimicry is a very successful anti-predator device that species have evolved over many generations. As one can see, organisms have come to mimic many different characteristics such as color patterns and behaviors.  However, selection only favors the mimics when they are less common than the model.  Therefore, the fitness of mimics is “negatively frequency-dependent.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the many ways in which organisms can communicate with each other is through the use of pheromones.  An organism generates and emits these hormonal chemicals in order to relay a message to another member of the same species.  Ants and bees demonstrate two prominent examples of pheromone usage, which acknowledges their incredible capability to organize the behaviors of the whole colony.

Ants produce numerous different pheromones, each with its own distinct purpose.  Ants secrete pheromones to attract mates, to signal danger to the colony, or to give directions about a location.  Other pheromones act as deterrents keeping out unwanted ants from foreign colonies or preying insectivores.  Still other pheromones communicate ants to congregate.  This explains how assiduous ants exercise remarkable cooperation in building a colony.  Pheromones maintain the cohesiveness and organization of the complex ant communities.
Certain types, such as alarm pheromones, produce a “releaser effect”, which induces a quick response and may be used to tell other ants to evacuate a dangerous area such as an approaching lawnmower.  For example, when a spider approaches an ant will release alarm pheromones that alert all the other ants.  Ants may also discharge alarm pheromones as a result from being diverted from their work, e.g. heavy human steps.  Releaser pheromones are also used to mark territory.  As the chemical deposited dries, it signals to other species members of the territory’s occupant.  

Other pheromones create a “primer effect” that entices other ants for actions.  Such pheromones are useful in mating rituals and only affect ants of the opposite sex.  Primer pheromones can send signals to the endocrine system, to make appropriate changes, for instance ovulation required for successful mating.  

Biologist E.O. Wilson discovered in the 1960’s that the organic chemical for each pheromone varies tremendously depending on what signal it entails.  Ants taste and smell a substance that evaporates off the chemical laid down by another ant.  Wilson observed in slow motion films that ants do this by moving their antennae from side to side.  For example, alarm pheromones are discharged into the air, and expand in a circle of smell.  Ants can determine the concentration of the pheromone, and thus determine the proximity of the source of danger.

Bees are also well known for communicating through the use of pheromones.  Like ants, bees have a variety of purposes associated with the pheromones, such as marking and behavior.  Honeybees release chemical signals for marking food sources, marking their hive, in scenting potential hive sites, and in assembling swarms for flight.  Although each hive has a particular scent, different colonies can be easily integrated during times when honey flow is heavy since the colony’s odor is inundated with the scent of nectar. Virgin queen bees emit a behavioral pheromone released with their feces.  When the new queen feels threatened by the workers she uses this pheromone as a repellent.  

Another widely identified chemical signal in bees is the Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP).  This pheromone ensures that the queen is the only reproductive female in the hive by compromising the reproductive systems of worker bees.  It also provides an attractant signal to the drones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Army Ants (Eciton burichelli)==

Army ant colony castes consist of queen ants, soldier ants, and multi-purpose worker ants.  In the army ant colony, the queen ant lays eggs, the soldiers focus their attention to the defense of the colony, and the worker ants are split between being foragers or tending to the queens brood. 

The Army ant is abundantly found in humid lowland forests or heavily forested areas of Central/South America.  The changes in temperature and precipitation have no affect on the life cycles or migration of these ants.

The social structure and life cycles of army ants have two distinct phases.  Army ant colonies go through a stationary phase and a migratory (nomadic) phase.  The phases are based on the ability of a queen to produce many eggs in a very short period of time (from 100 000 to 300 000 eggs in five to ten days); thus, the queen overpopulates a given area, which then triggers migration of the colony.

In the stationary phase, the army ant queen's abdomen swells to hold 55 000 to 66 000 eggs.  As the eggs develop into mature ants, tens of thousands of adult workers appear, triggering the nomadic phase:  colony activity increases exponentially, and &quot;swarm raids&quot; increase in size and intensity.  With a colony of this size, the army ant colony must emigrate daily.  The migration continues until &quot;larval pupation&quot; begins.  Once this occurs, the colony re-enters the stationary phase, and the cycle repeats. 

Due to their large colony sizes, army ants migrate in order to find food.  Most ants are &quot;column feeders.&quot;  Army ants are what are called &quot;swarm feeders.&quot;  The foraging workers form a fan-shaped swarm with a broad front.  Along with feeding, army ants also have a unique way of forming nests.  The army ant nest is made up of army ants themselves.  The ants form walls and fasten onto each other by using their mandibles.  The ant colony forms these walls almost anywhere in order to enclose the queen and her brood.  The nest is very structured, as it provides corridors within itself for transporting food and eggs throughout the many areas of the nest. 

Army ant colonies march and nest in different phases as well.  In the nomadic phase, army ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.  The colony begins a nomadic phase when available food has decreased.  During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that are changed everyday.  Each of these nomadic rampages or marches lasts for approximately 17 days. 

Army ants are notorious for eating anything that gets in their path.  They can kill and eat up to 100 000 animals in a day!  They normally consume lizards, snakes, chickens, pigs, goats, scorpions, tarantulas, beetles and other ants.  Army ants can also climb trees, and feed on animals within its canopy.

Army ants communication is completely dependent on chemical messaging and trail pheromones.  These methods of communication act as a stimuli for changing behavior patterns.  Unlike other ants, army ants do not have compound eyes, but instead have single eyes.  Army ants are also blind and have to use their antennae to sense smell and touch.  The army ants use these senses to communicate in nesting and raiding.

      <comment>/* Human Cognitive Development */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Human Cognitive Development==
Nature, Nurture, and Cognitive Development from 1 to 16 years: In a Parent-Offspring Adoption Study, Robert Plomin and his fellow researchers conclude that genetics, not environment, play a larger role in the development of the cognitive processes.  These researchers are interested in cognitive ability (the mental process of knowing, including aspects such as awareness, perception, reasoning, and judgment). Results for children aged 1-16 show that adoptees, although resembling their adoptive parents minimally at first, become more and more like their biological parents and less like their adoptive parents as they age. By adolescence, there is a strong resemblance to the cognitive functioning of the biological parents, to the same degree as in the control families, and no similarity to that of the adoptive parents. Despite the fact that the children do not spend any time with their biological parents, they are more similar, cognitively speaking. It suggests that the genes affecting cognitive ability are not all expressed until adolescence and, further, that whatever environmental factors may affect cognitive functioning are not at all correlated with the cognitive ability of the parents who raise the child. The research team conducted their 20-year longitudinal Colorado Adoption Project (CAP) in Denver, CO beginning in 1975. The CAP followed 245 adopted children and their biological and adoptive parents, as well as 245 matched nonadoptive children and their parents. They recruited pregnant mothers prior to labor.  A fifth of the biological fathers were tested, whereas previous studies had not tested the biological fathers.  The children were placed in homes at twenty-nine days, and in adopted homes at seven months. The researchers also had a control group of families. The children were matched to adopted families relatively similar to their own based on gender, the number of children in the family, age of the father, occupational status of the father, and father’s years of education. Also, the variability in socioeconomic status was representative of the U.S. population. The biological mothers were usually tested during their third trimester and the adoptive parents and control parents were usually tested during the child’s first year. Collectively, the thirteen tests lasted three hours long and tested the cognitive abilities of each individual. The tests were given periodically to the children throughout their development and maturation. CAP also presents a disclaimer stating that they do not believe that their examinations are fully accurate due to exceptions that they did not test, such as mental retardation.  They also only represent the middle ninety percent of the U.S. population at the time in which their study began (1975). This study shows that genetic effects on cognitive abilities are not manifested only in adulthood, but also to a considerable extent in adolescence to a lesser degree in childhood, and only slightly during infancy. The different degrees of manifestation attest to the fact that not all genes regarding cognitive ability come arise until the time of adolescence. It also shows that genetics, not environment, contribute to a individuals abilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Galapagos Islands finches have been used by Charles Darwin and many other scientist to study how “ random variation and natural selection can drive the production of organisms with novel features, adapted to new ways of life (Alberts 2004). The finches studied in the Galapagos Island are usually characterized by the great variance in beaks and the function of beaks. The finches beaks were first thought to change over many years because of local ecological condition, but many scientist devised a new hypothesis which stated, “As a consequence of beak evolution, there have been changes in the structure if finch vocal signals (Podos 2004).”
	This hypothesis was based the assumption that beaks have a direct correlation in effecting song production. The Galapagos Island finches displayed a wide variety phenotypes of beaks with different forms and functions caused by natural selection over many years. This phenotype variation was hypothesized by the Grants to be a result of natural selection because of ecological conditions. The new studies, however, tested to see if finch beaks have an affect on the acoustic structure of the songbird songs. The first experiment done to test this hypothesis involved first checking to see if beak movement indeed caused sound production, which in fact turned out to be true. Thus, one could imply that beak variations could cause a different song production. The goal of these researches is “ to show how research on the relationship between beaks and song is providing novel insights into the interplay of morphological adaptation and the evolution communication signals (Podos 2004).” The bird song is actually made in the birds syrinx, which is similar to the human larynx during speech production.  The scientist then addressed the question of how the birds are able to send pure tonal signals across such a long range and distance. The answer is that the birds are able to change their vocal tracts configurations, which in turn directly changes the frequency of their songs. The three generalizations, which these finches fall into describing their songs are, simple, variability, and cross-species overlap. If the beak is opened more wide then it creates a higher pitched sound.  So it could be hypothesized that a large beaked bird will have a large vocal tract and will in turn create a lower song frequency.  This hypothesis was backed up by the studies of Maria Palacious and Pablo Tubaro who tested the Neotropical Woodcreepers Pendrocolaptinae, which produced lower frequency songs with long beaks. These scientists tested, these highly protected finches, by video taping them and then determining the beak gapes for each song for the different finches. The two main reason male finches use their singing, like many other singing birds, is for territory defense and mate attraction, but the difference in beak size could affect both these characteristics, because some males with either small or large beaks could not produce the right song in other to perform these tasks.  This lead Nowick and colleagues to test to see if a beak changed its size for food collection, then would this have a direct affect on how fast or slow a finch could move its beak to produce its specific song. Nowick then concluded that there was a positive correlation between “divergences of beaks and its influence not only the feeding but also their singing behavior.” The scientist, however, plan to broaden their investigation by studying how wider beaks may influence songs and also study other birds with beak morphology such as the crossbills or the Hawaiian honeycreepers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Operant conditioning''', sometimes called instrumental conditioning or instrumental learning, was first extensively studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874-1949). Thorndike's most famous work investigated the behavior of cats trying to escape from various home-made puzzle boxes. When first constrained in the boxes the cats took a long time to escape from each. With experience however, ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more quickly enabling the cats to escape in less and less time over successive trials (Wikipedia). 

B.F. Skinner (1904-1990) extended the theories proposed by Thorndike about 40 years after Thorndike published his works. Skinner's ideas of animals operating on the environment led him to analyze how behavior is affected by its consequences. The contraption that became known as the Skinner box measured whether a task was completed and how long it took for the task to be completed. The Skinner box consisted of a bar that, when pressed, triggered the release of a food pellet. Skinner believed that rewarding an animal when an appropriate action occurred would increase the likelihood that the behavior would be repeated. When a rat accidentally tapped on the bar, a food pellet was released, and Skinner observed the amount of time it took the rat to find the pellet. As the rat learned that a pellet released each time he happened to step on the bar, the rat learned to press the bar and to immediately find the food. This training became known as operant conditioning (Alcock). 

Today Skinners operant conditioning is still used to train animals. All animals that are part of Sea World programs have been trained using positive reinforcement operant conditioning. When an animal performs a desired behavior the trainer will reward the animal to encourage the action to be performed when signaled for at a later time. Positive reinforcers are stimuli that strengthen a response if they follow that response (How Animals). Negative reinforcers can also be used to encourage a certain behavior. It is important to distinguish the difference between negative reinforcement and the punishment theory. Negative reinforcement is simply the removal of an unpleasant stimulant or pain (Bernstein). For example: a person who uses an alarm that plays a pleasant song may oftentimes hit the snooze or linger in bed. To condition himself to get out of bed as soon as the alarm goes off the person may switch the alarm sound to something obnoxiously loud and unpleasant. To remove the unpleasant stimulant the person will immediately get out of bed and turn the alarm off. Knowing how to remove the unpleasant sound increases the likelihood that the person will get out of bed immediately after the alarm plays. The Punishment theory, on the other hand, introduces an aversive stimulus to reduce the likelihood of a certain behavior.

Operant conditioning is seen in the learning behavior of many animals, including humans. Oftentimes it goes completely unnoticed, but it can also be used as a deliberate tool in training. As young children explore their world and learn how to eliminate unpleasant stimuli and satisfy desires through proper behavior, they are learning through operant conditioning.

To learn their language, humans and white crowned sparrows follow similar steps, recognition, practice, and clarity. The best time for a human to learn their language is from toddler to twelve years old (Macdonald) and the best time for a white crowned sparrow to learn its song is between 10-50 days from when they were born. Both genes and environment play roles in determining the way each communicate (Alcock 25). 

The first step for humans and white crowned species in learning their language can be considered recognition. White crowned sparrows and humans listen to a tutor before they begin to communicate their language. The tutor teaches the language and the particular dialect, according to the area. Just like humans, the sparrows also have a dialect depending on where they live. A white crowned sparrow has certain genes that only allow them to learn its own species’ songs. Experiments have been performed in which the sparrow was kept in isolation and played tapes of other song sparrows, the white crowned sparrow will not imitate the other species’ song, but will sing an odd song unlike either species’ song (Alcock 24-25). Humans also cannot communicate with each other using a different species’ language. A study was done in Avignon, France that observed children who were brought up by wolves. It was observed that the children spoke no language at all. Before studies of this kind were done it was thought that the children might learn to communicate with the wolves, just like the Tarzan story. This is not true, the children could not speak the human language nor the language of the wolves (Macdonald). It is a combination of environment and genes that tell white crowned sparrows and humans to learn their proper language. Genes tell the species to only learn the language of their own species and environment plays a factor in determining which dialect each will use. 

Once the white crowned sparrow or infant has recognized its species, song, they can begin to practice the language. Infants first communicate by making sounds. The sounds can range from grunts to sounds that mimic their surrounding environments. For example, before babies can say words, they might say moo- moo when looking at a cow. After sounds come words. By the time the infant reaches one year, they should be making sentences out of words (Macdonald). The white crowned sparrow also does not immediately master its song. The sparrow will first sing a short subsong derived from the tutor’s full song. The sparrows keep practicing their subsong just as infants practice their words. After the sparrow has mastered its subsong it can start to form a full song. In both species it is necessary for them to hear themselves in order to vocalize their language correctly (Alcock 26). 

In conclusion, both white crowned sparrows first listen and recognize their particular species’ language. A white crowned sparrow has a tutor to teach the song. Infants usually have parents that teach them their verbal language. Then they must practice the language, starting off slow with sounds and building up. Both species will continue to improve and clarify their language throughout their lives.

[[Image:Chef's Knife.jpg|thumb|right|A chef's knife]]

'''Chef's knife''' is a loose term for any very large general purpose knife used mainly for chopping and slicing food. 

A chef's knife is generally the most used and most versatile knife in the kitchen, used for all but the finest or most specialized tasks.  Selecting a chef's knife is therefore very important to comfortable and enjoyable cooking.  It should be the largest size which feels comfortable to use (typically 10 inches (254 mm) for reasonably tall cooks, 8 inches (200 mm) for shorter), as a smaller knife will not be able to accomplish as many tasks with ease (chopping large vegetables, halving tortillas, pizzas, and other large foods, and so forth).

Most high quality chef's knives are manufactured from high-gauge, (18/10), stainless steel. The stainless steel blade is either stamped or forged. A forged blade is heavier, usually hand-made, and will keep it's edge making it a popular choice for a professional chef. Stamped knives are cut from sheet metal by a machine, however, this process does not necessarily negate the quality.  Forged knives tend to be more expensive, and are seen by some as more reliable.  Regardless, a good chef's knife should consist of a single piece of steel, &quot;a full tang&quot;. In other words, the steel blade of the knife should extend through the entire length of the wood or plastic handle. A chef's knife containing a full tang is crucial for providing a balance point closer to the hand and a more durable product.

Keeping a knife sharp is very important. A dull knife requires more force from the user, thereby increasing the likelihood of injury. 
A [[Cookbook:Knife Sharpener|steel]] should be used to hone the edge of the blade. Honing with a steel before each use of the knife will keep the edge sharp. Occasionally a sharpening stone or high quality electric sharpener may be needed to bring a severely dulled blade back to life, followed by a few swipes on the steel.

The most important aspect of choosing a knife, however, is how it feels in your hand.  The best way to choose a knife is simply to go try the heft of several and see what suits you best. 

To purchase a high quality chef's knife, try a local restaurant equipment supplier, or a well known cooking enthusiast retailer. Stay away from the cheap imitations for sale at the grocery or chain discount stores.

[[Image:PearPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|A pear]]
A '''pear''' is a [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] similar to an apple but often softer in flesh and with a sweeter taste. Pears can be eaten raw or used in various recipes. The juice can be drunk. The ripening of pears can be troublesome; some cultivars are at their best for a brief period of full ripeness. 

== Cultivars of pear ==
=== Beth ===
Small round pear with a gold/green skin. An early variety (ripe in late summer), which is sweet and juicy.
===Beurre Hardy ===
A fairly large green/gold pear, harvested from autumn to early winter. Has a firm skin and soft, juicy flesh.
===Concorde===
A cross between Conference and Comice, this pear has some of the easy keeping qualities of Conference with a sweetness from the Comice. It is large and yellow/green in colour.
=== Conference === 
Usually thin with a green skin, sometimes flecked with brown. Can be eaten when the flesh is firm or when fully ripe and the flesh yields to the touch. Flavour closer to apple than many pears, with a touch of earthiness and very firm. Keeps well and usually available throughout the winter.

=== Doyenne du Comice ===
Large, heart-shaped pear with a gold and green flecked skin. Flesh remains firm even when fully ripe. Flavour is sweet.
=== Rocha ===
A small pear with a skin varying from light green to pale gold flecked with brown. Originally from Portugal, this pear can be eaten firm or soft and has a distinct undertone of honey in the taste.

[[Image:Pfanne (Edelstahl).jpg|thumb|right|A frying pan made of stainless steel]]
A '''frying pan''' or '''skillet''' is a shallow cooking utensil generally used on top of a [[Cookbook:Cooktop|cooktop]] for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] food.

As with all pans, a thicker bottom allows more even heat distribution while reducing responsiveness to desired heat changes. See the [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pots and pans]] article for a discussion of the different materials that may be used.

The '''lymphatic system''' includes lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and lymph. The lymph contains many lymphocytes, which are a type of leukocyte, white blood cell, or immune cell. The lymphatic system contributes greatly to ridding an organism of foreign invasion. The invader can be bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, or toxins. If an invasion gets out of control, it can lead to an infection, which the lymphatic system then plays a roll in subduing.

The lymph nodes will swell when combatting an infection, often being one of the confirming signs of illness due to a foreign organism.

Lymph drains through the lymph system in the direction of venous blood flow (towards the heart).  It is pumped by the gross muscular movement of the body as it squeezes the intercellular spaces where the lymph moves.

People who have had cancerous tissue removed will often have lymph nodes removed as well to check for spreading of the cancer.  After such removal the person must be careful to avoid injury to the body along that route of lymph as the immune response to infection is impaired (e.g. a mastectomy on the left side with removal of lymph nodes means that arm needs to be treated with caution).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PENGUIN LOVING ==
''Compared with other birds, emperor penguins have everything backwards.  They breed in winter, the females compete for the males, and they’re notoriously unfaithful. They’re the most bizarre birds I’ve ever met.''
:-Ann Bowles in the article “Emperors of the Ice”
	
Emperor penguins, ''Aptenodytes forsteri'', are the largest of the penguin family.  They live in harsh environments of the Antarctic, battered by extreme weather conditions and vicious predators, and are the only warm-blooded animal to winter on the open ice.  It is therefore no surprise that these birds present unique behaviors.  The mating and brooding habits of these penguins reflect how these penguins have adapted to overcome these formidable obstacles.
	
Unlike other cohabitants of the Antarctic Circle, emperor penguins mate in the winter months of April and May.  Males grow yellow tufts in the areas surrounding their ears, suspected of being an attraction factor for females.  Unlike other species’ males that compete for nesting space and attract the females through quaint rituals (e.g. Adele penguin males throw scarcely available rocks at the feet of females to “get their attention”), emperor penguins do not create nest and put on mating displays that last for weeks, during which the future parents learn each other’s call.  After copulation and, about 15 days later, the laying of a single, soft-ball sized egg, the female leaves to the sea where she embarks on a mission to feed well.  Meanwhile, the father cares for the egg.  To protect it from the frosty floor, for the next 6-8 weeks the father balances the egg on its two feet, under the protective blubbery flaps of its underbelly, to keep it warm.  During the whole incubation period the father does not eat and may lose a third to half of its body weight.  

The mother returns right before hatching (usually at the beginning of September), well-fed and with food for her offspring.  The two parents apparently find themselves through distinguishable calls.  Visual aids are useless in a crowd of 6000 penguins that all look similar.  The mother then feeds the chicks for the first time, regurgitating some of the spoils caught while she was away.  As the female broods the young, the father is free to replenish his energy, only to return to jointly rear the chick along with the mother.	

The newly hatched chicks are barely protected from the sub-zero temperatures by their downy coats.  Another important behavior, displayed similarly between adult penguins and chicks, is the formation of clustered groups called crèches. Within these groups the birds are able to maintain temperatures of about 96 degrees F, in contrast to the minus 30 degrees winds.  So much heat is created in these crèches that the group must constantly move from location to avoid falling into the melted holes in the ice created by the heat generated by these crowds.  This story ends when penguin chicks, huddled in groups at the edge of the sea, hop onto a recently broken-off chunk of ice and float towards the north to go on with their lives. 

“How” do these behaviors occur?  What are the proximate reasons of these behaviors? These breeding and brooding behaviors are influenced by many factors.  Studies have shown that anatomical preparation for copulation is not stimulated by the mating displays, as is seen in other species.  Penguins that reach the mating areas have seven times the normal amount of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (in males) and estrogen (in females) upon arrival, suggesting that geographical or environmental cues activate gonodal preparation, specifically corresponding to maximum size of the gonads (1).  Between copulation and egg-laying, levels of all hormones begin to fall, but LT remains slightly above average in incubating males, and in both males and females that are rearing their young.  This leads to the conclusion that LT is responsible for incubating, brooding and territorial behavior.  The hormone prolactin has also been linked to parental care (2). 

Next question should be why these behaviors happen?  What are the ultimate causes?  Why do penguins endure the harsh Antarctic winter and choose to have their young during this apparently dangerous time?  Speculation has lead to a few hypotheses.  One is the lack of predators.  These penguins are the only animals left during the winter’s cold.  There are no leopard seals to menace the young.  Another advantage of wintering the summer grounds is the first access to the abundance of food that the early warmer season brings.  The quantity of food and the climate is perfect for the chicks to learn to fend for themselves.  These two factors may have been enough evolutionary pressure to give rise to these vital behavioral traits in emperor penguins.

[[Image:Quince.jpg|thumb|right|A quince]]

A '''Quince''' is a pear-shaped golden-yellow [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] that is very loosely related to the [[Cookbook:Pear |pear]] and the [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]. It was a common element in medieval cooking, but is rarely used now. Its flavor is similar to that of the pear and apple, but much stronger and more sour. Because of its firm texture and sourness (even when ripe), it's not often eaten raw.

Quinces can be made into [[Cookbook:Jam|jams]], [[Cookbook:Jelly|jellies]], and [[Cookbook:Pudding|puddings]]. Since quince is very aromatic, it can be added to apple jams to increase their flavor. It can also be skinned and [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] or [[Cookbook:Poaching|poached]] in [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] and made into a [[Cookbook:Cobbler|cobbler]] or [[Cookbook:Tart|tart]].

'''Rice Pilaf'''.  Pilaf can be served as a side-dish or main dish.

==Ingredients==

*6 tablespoons butter or margarine
*1/2 cup uncooked orzo pasta or uncooked vermicelli pasta broken into small pieces
*2 cups uncooked long grain rice
*4 cups boiling hot chicken broth
*1/4 teaspoon salt
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 4 cloves
* 1 big onion, finely cut
* 2 carrots in fine cubes

==Procedure==

# Melt butter or margarine in heavy deep pan or Dutch oven over medium heat.
# Add vegetables and let them be lightly cooked without coloring, using the vegies would mean you omit the orzo pasta
# Add orzo pasta (or small broken pieces of vermicelli pasta) and cook, stirring constantly until pasta is golden brown.
# Add rice and stir until rice is well coated with butter. Allow rice to simmer in butter for a minute or two.
# Add boiling chicken broth and salt. 
# Lower heat to a simmer, cover pan and cook 25-minutes over low heat until liquid is absorbed.
# Gently fluff with a fork. Let stand for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. 

Makes 8 servings.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* Substitute an equal amount of vegetable broth for the chicken broth to create a vegetarian version of this recipe.
* Substitute orzo with pine nuts if desired; this is traditionally done in Lebanon.

'''OSA''' stands for ''oversampling'', also known as ''anti-aliasing''. If you look at the rendering below, you'll find that the one has a rugged edge. It looks like small steps! To stop this, Blender uses OSA to prevent &quot;jagged edges&quot; or &quot;aliasing&quot; as it's called.[[Image:Render_settings_OSA_row.png|thumb|right|Oversampling settings in render tab.]] 


This occurs when you have a diagonal change of colour, which results in rough edges. Remember drawing a diagonal line in Paint? To overcome this hindrance of square pixels, a technique called anti-aliasing or &quot;oversampling&quot; is used. It blends the colours around the rough edge to create a smooth, but defined edge. One way of doing this is to by creating the image twice as large, then scaling it down - oversampling. Blender can do this for you if you select an OSA rate. Remember this will take much longer, but results in better renders, so use this for the final product, not while testing. In some cases the scene can seem blurred due to oversampled textures; try changing the OSA setting, or oversampling yourself.

Here's a quick illustration of how OSA changes a render (look at the edges):

[[Image:OSA_comparison.png|thumb|650px|center|The image on the left has no OSA. The one on the right has 16x (the maximum amount allowed by Blender).]]

OSA settings can be manipulated in from the Render Settings panel.

== Section Overview ==

* Operating the Linux filesystem
* Maintaining a Linux filesystem
* Creating and configuring filesystem options

== Operating the Linux filesystem ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to properly configure and navigate the standard Linux filesystem. This objective includes configuring and mounting various filesystem types. Also included, is manipulating filesystems to adjust for disk space requirements or device additions.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:
 /etc/fstab
 /etc/mtab
 /proc/mounts
 mount and umount
 sync
 swapon
 swapoff

=== Mounting and unmounting partition ===

To access an existing partition you need to mount it first using the ''mount'' command. &lt;br&gt;
For example if you want to mount a ntfs partition on /mnt/windows you should issue the following command:
 mount -t ntfs /dev/hda3 /mnt/windows
Of course you need to change hda3 with your ntfs partition. &lt;br&gt;
To umount a partition you simply need to use ''umount''
 umount /mnt/windows
or
 umount /dev/hda3
If you use mount without arguments it will print the currently mounted devices, you can also see /proc/mounts and /etc/mtab to discover which partition are currently mounted.&lt;br&gt;

=== Fstab ===

If you want to use a more automatic method to mount filesystem you should edit /etc/fstab

 &lt;file system&gt; &lt;mount point&gt;   &lt;type&gt;  &lt;options&gt;       &lt;dump&gt;  &lt;pass&gt;
 proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
 /dev/hda2       /               ext3    defaults        0       1
 /dev/hda4       none            swap    defaults        0       0
 /dev/hda1       /boot           ext3    defaults        0       2
 /dev/hda3       /mnt/windows    ntfs    defaults        0       0
 /dev/hdb        /media/cdrom    iso9660 ro,user,noauto  0       0
 /dev/fd0        /media/floppy   auto    user,noauto     0       0

In the above example of /etc/fstab we have the ntfs partition mounted automatically during the system boot on /mnt/windows, while on the cdrom and floppy devices we have specified the noauto and user options, this means that they aren't mounted during boot but also that any user can mount it whenever they need. The sixth field should be 1 for root filesystem and 2 for other fs that need to be checked with fsck during boot.

=== Swap ===

The swap partition can be used as virtual memory, to create a swap partition you should use ''mkswap''

 mkswap /dev/hda4

and need to be activated with ''swapon''

 swapon /dev/hda4

you can also deactivate it with ''swapoff''

 swapoff /dev/hda4

=== Sync ===
The ''sync'' utility can be used to force the change onto the partition, modern filesystem like ext3 or reiserfs sync the partition every time that a change is made so you don't need to issue the command manually.

=== Exercises ===.

== Maintaining a Linux filesystem ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to properly maintain a Linux filesystem using system utilities. This objective includes manipulating a standard ext2 filesystem.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:
 fsck (fsck.ext2)
 badblocks
 mke2fs
 dumpe2fs
 debuge2fs
 tune2fs

=== Formatting a partition ===

Before you format a partition you need to choose the right filesystem for your needs. The most common filesystem on linux is ext3 which is a journaled filesystem based on ext2. To format a partition with a filesystem you need to use the ''mkfs.*'' commands

  #ext3
  mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda1
  #fat
  mkfs.vfat /dev/hda1
  #xfs 
  mkfs.xfs /dev/hda1
  #reiserfs
  mkfs.reiserfs /dev/hda1

to create an ext2/ext3 filesystem you can also use the mke2fs utility

 #ext2
 mke2fs /dev/hda1
 #ext3
 mke2fs -j /dev/hda1

=== Configuring and repair filesystem ===

''tune2fs'' it's an utility used to tune ext2/ext3 filesystem

 #add the journal to an ext2 filesystem(convert from ext2 to ext3)
 tune2fs -j /dev/hda1
 #set the max mount count before the filesystem is checked for errors to 30
 tune2fs -c 30 /dev/hda1 
 #set the max time before the filesystem is checked for errors to 10 days
 tune2fs -i 10d /dev/hda1

you can also tune a reiserfs partition using ''reiserfstune''

 #create a new journal for /dev/hda1 into /dev/hda2 
 reiserfstune --journal-new-device /dev/hda2 -f /dev/hda1

to check a filesystem for errors you can use ''fsck.*''

  #ext3
  fsck.ext3 /dev/hda1
  #fat
  fsck.vfat /dev/hda1
  #xfs 
  fsck.xfs /dev/hda1
  #reiserfs
  fsck.reiserfs /dev/hda1

you can also just run fsck /dev/hda1 directly and it will detect the filesystem
 

=== Exercises ===.

== Creating and configuring filesystem options ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to configure automount filesystems. This objective includes configuring automount for network and device filesystems. Also included is creating non ext2 filesystems for devices such as CD-ROMs.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:
 /etc/auto.master
 /etc/auto.[dir]
 mkisofs
 dd
 mke2fs

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The purpose of this experiment is to discover the effect of temperature upon the rising of bread dough. The process of dough rising is based on yeast. Yeast is a type of fungus which breaks sugar down into smaller components. The type of yeast used for these tests is ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', which was domesticated for wine, beer and bread production thousands of years ago. ''S. cerevisiae'' is commonly referred to as baker’s yeast or brewer’s yeast for this reason.

Yeasts used for leavening bread can be either caught from the environment or produced commercially. In the environment, yeast can easily be found in fruits and berries (such as apples, peaches, and grapes), as well as in plant exudates (such as sap).

When mixed with bread dough, the yeast converts sugar molecules into carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), alcohol and water. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; expands in the dough to produce gaseous bubbles. These bubbles cause the bread to rise - the more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present, the faster the bread will rise. If temperature is related to the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by yeast, then higher temperatures will result in increased production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Procedure==

Materials:
*1 [[w:Erlenmeyer Flask|Erlenmeyer Flask]]
*1 One-hole Rubber Stopper
*1 hir
*1 Striker
*1 600 ml Glass Beaker
*1 Glass Beaker of any size (large enough to contain flask)
*1 Thermometer
*Yeast Solution
*Petroleum Jelly
*ice andor snow
*Glass Tubing
*Hot Plate
*Table for the recording of data (Figure 2)
*Access to tap water and natural gas will also be necessary.


1. Using the bunsen burner, bend the glass tubing so that it will reach from the inside of the Erlenmeyer flask to the bottom of the glass beaker, leaving enough room for gas to escape while in the beaker. (See Figure 1)

2. Add 75 ml of yeast solution to the flask.

3. Add 500 ml of water to the beaker.

4. Place the rubber stopper in the flask and apply petroleum jelly around the hole of the stopper to stop gas from escaping.  Insert the glass tubing so that it will receive gas from the flask and carry it underneath the water in the beaker, and place the beaker and flask on a lab counter. (See Figure 3)

5. Observe the beaker for ten minutes and count the number of bubbles escaping into the water. Record this information and the current room temperature in a data table. (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig2.png|Figure 2]])

6. Find the average number of bubbles per minute and record this in the data table.

7. Remove the glass tubing from the apparatus.

8. Repeat steps 2-7 at a temperature of 83 degrees Celsius, placing the flask in a hot water bath prepared using the hot plate and waiting for five minutes to allow the yeast to reach the appropriate temperature before inserting the glass tubing. (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig4.png|Fig. 4]])

9. Repeat steps 2-7 at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, placing the flask in a container full of snow or a cold water bath and waiting for five minutes to allow the yeast to reach the appropriate temperature before inserting the glass tubing. (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig5.png|Fig. 5]])

10. Disconnect the materials, clean them and replace them in their proper locations.

==Conclusions==

The data collected (as seen in [[:Image:YeastLabFig10.png|Figure 10]]) shows an average of 0 carbon dioxide bubbles per minute at 0 degrees Celsius, an average of 11.5 bubbles per minute at 19 degrees Celsius, and an average of 76.8 bubbles per minute at 83 degrees Celsius. 

The test at 83 deg. C showed a near-constant decline in the amount of bubbles as time passed. This occurred because the sugar fueling the yeast is depleted, so the yeast has less fuel to produce carbon dioxide.  (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig6.png|Fig. 6]]).  The test at 0 degrees Celsius showed no production of carbon dioxide, presumably because the low temperatures killed the yeast.  (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig7.png|Fig. 7]]).  The room temperature test (19 deg. C) showed a fairly even level of carbon dioxide production, but not enough to be useful in the making of leavened bread.  (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig8.png|Fig. 8]])

We incurred two experimental errors in the first testing at 0 degrees Celsius. By beginning the testing immediately following the insertion of the yeast solution into the cold water bath, the warm air molecules in the flask were not given an opportunity to cool before being attached to the rest of the apparatus. This caused a vacuum to form in the glass tubing, pulling water up the tubing rather than pushing the gas out. Attempting to remedy the situation, we moved the flask into a slightly warmer area, skewing the results by raising the temperature enough to allow carbon dioxide production. Applying this knowledge to the second test eliminated these anomalies.

This experiment shows that carbon dioxide production from yeast increases with increased temperature, as the number of carbon dioxide bubbles increased as the temperature rose.  (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig9.png|Fig. 9]]).  However, yeast consumes sugar much faster at higher temperatures, causing dramatic growth for a short amount of time which quickly drops to very low levels.  Because the rising of bread dough is dependent on the amount of carbon dioxide produced, increased temperatures will result in bread rising farther than it would at room temperatures. It can also be concluded that bread will not rise at freezing temperatures, as the carbon dioxide necessary to make the bread do so is not present.

----

The present perfect (''el perfecto de indicativo'') is used to communicate events in the past for which there is a relationship to the present.  For example:

:''I have written'' three letters today.
::''He escrito'' tres cartas hoy.

It is formed by using the conjugated present indicative form of [[../Haber|Haber]] with the [[../Past Participle|past participle]] of the action. In the above example, ''He'' is the first person form of '''Haber''' and ''escrito'' is the past participle of '''Escribir'''.

Here are examples in different persons:
::Tú has comido el bocadillo. ''You have eaten the sandwich.''
::Él ha dicho la verdad. ''He has told the truth.''
::Nosotros hemos visto el cuadro. ''We have seen the picture.''
::Vosotros habéis hablado con el presidente. ''You (plural, familiar) have spoken with the president.''
::Uds. han vivido en California. ''You (plural, formal) have lived in California.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Would those who are working on this project mind putting exercises at the end of sections so that people like myself who are learning the language could practice implementing some programs? Thank you very much for your time, and the tutorial has taught me a lot already.

I once started a tutorial on Ruby.  It's right here:

http://www.math.umd.edu/~dcarrera/ruby/0.3/index.html

If any of this content is useful for this Ruby Wikibook feel free to take it.  I have alread released the tutorial as GNU FDL, so it should be compatible with this Wikibook.  But I'm happy to make it public domain if necessary.

I wish I had time to work on this project, but I'm already leading a large documentation project (oooauthors.org).

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

You might want to consider the [[WB:NP]]. You current naming convention is depreciated and has several disadvantages - like it has no navigational links. Also you worthy effort is neiter considered a book nor a section inside a book. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which implements an exstensive book and section detector.

== Ruby Prog? ==

Supriya, the name &quot;Ruby Prog&quot; is inconsistent with other programming books on Wikibooks. For example:

* [[Ada Programming]]
* [[C Programming]]
* [[C++ Programming]]
* [[C Sharp Programming]]
* [[Java Programming]]

I don't see the reason for the name change. Also, many of the links to the sections broke when you renamed the main page. I'm going to revert.

== Organization ==

The organization of the new material on strings is a mess.  Why the heck is it placed before the section on Basic Ruby?  Why are the sections on &quot;Alternate Quotes&quot;, &quot;Here Documents&quot;, and &quot;ASCII&quot; separate chapters rather than being subsections of the &quot;Strings&quot; chapter?

--[[User:OinkOink|OinkOink]] 23:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

:Exactly. I warned the user doing all this that some of his/her creations were a bad idea, but nothing stopped. It would be nice if some others came in and started correcting it all. I did once and was reverted, so this user may not take it easily. If such an edit war continues, bring it to my or another admin's attention and we will try to resolve it. This book is heading in a bad direction. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:41, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

I wonder if it isn't time to put in some additional structure to the &quot;Getting Started&quot; section.  There are really three or four big headings here:  

* &quot;Getting Started&quot; includes installing, writing scripts as files, running scripts
* &quot;Baby Steps&quot; (insert better name here) includes the &quot;hello world&quot; example and a whirlwind 2-3 chapter tour of what Ruby is about including some OO
* &quot;More Depth&quot; (again, insert better name here) is a more methodical one-chapter-per-topic coverage, enough for your average programming task.

Then the intermediate section is an alacarte of self-contained topics, and the language reference for more details.  Yes, I know this structure follows Pickaxe pretty closely.

The '''potato ricer''' can be visualized as a very large [[Cookbook:Garlic press|garlic press]].  It is used in the preparation of mashed [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]].  After the potatoes have been slightly overcooked and chopped up, pass them through the potato-ricer to reduce them to a smooth [[Cookbook:Puree|purée]].  After potatoes are &quot;riced,&quot; it is common to then mix butter, milk, or cream, according to preference.</text>

[[Image:Garlic Press and Garlic.jpg|thumb|right|Garlic being crushed using a garlic press.]]

A '''garlic press''' is a small kitchen tool designed to simplify the process of crushing a clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]. It is a hinged device. The garlic clove is put into a containing section and when the arms of the press are closed, the clove is crushed and the pulp is forced out through a grating. 

It may be useful if you have to crush a lot of cloves in a short time, but for one or two cloves, better results are obtained by crushing them between the blade of a knife and a chopping board.

A food processor may also be used to prepare garlic cloves.</text>

      <comment>/* MySQL */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==MySQL==
[[Programming:MySQL|MySQL]] is the most popular database used with PHP. PHP with MySQL is a powerful combination showing the real power of Server-Side scripting. PHP has a wide range of MySQL functions available with the help of a separate module. In PHP5, this module has been removed and must be downloaded separately.

MySQL allows users to create tables, where data can be stored much more efficiently than the way data is stored in arrays.

In order to use MySQL or databases in general effectively, you need to understand [[SQL|SQL]], or Structured Query Language.

Note that this page uses the mysqli functions and not the old mysql functions.

==How to - Step By Step==
===Connecting to the MySQL server===
PHP has the function '''mysqli_connect''' to connect to a MySQL server which handles all of the low level socket handling. We will supply 4 arguments; the first is the name of your MySQL server, the second a MySQL username, third a MySQL password and last a database name. In this example, it is assumed your server is localhost. If you are running a web server on one system, and MySQL on another system, you can replace localhost with the IP address or domain name of the system which MySQL resides on (ensure all firewalls are configured to open the appropriate ports).  '''mysqli_connect''' returns a link_identifier that we can now use for communicating with the database. We will store this link in a variable called ''$cxn''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $cxn = mysqli_connect (&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;your_user_name&quot;, &quot;your_password&quot;, &quot;database_name&quot;);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Running a Query===
We have connected to the mysql server and then selected the database we want to use, now we can run an SQL query over the database to select information, do an insert, update or delete. To do this we use '''mysqli_query'''. This takes two arguments: the first is our link_identifier and the second is an SQL query string.  If we are doing a select sql statement '''mysqli_query''' generates a resource or the Boolean false to say our query failed, and if we are doing a delete, insert or update it generates a Boolean, true or false, to say if that was successful or not.

The basic code for running a query is the php function &quot;mysqli_query($cxn, $query)&quot;.  The &quot;$query&quot; argument is a MySQL query.  The database argument is a database connection(here, the connection represented by $cxn).  For example, to return the query &quot;SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id ASC&quot;, you could write

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    mysqli_query($cxn, &quot;SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id ASC&quot;);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

However, this straightforward method will quickly become ungainly due to the length of MySQL queries and the common need to repeat the query when handling the return.  All (or almost all) queries are therefore made in two steps. First, the query is assigned a variable (conventionally, this variable is named &quot;$query&quot; or &quot;$sql_query&quot; for purposes of uniformity and easy recognition), which allows the program to call simply &quot;mysqli_query($cxn, $sql_query)&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$sql_query = &quot;SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id ASC&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Secondly, to handle the information returned from the query, practical considerations require that the information returned also be assigned to a variable.  Again by convention rather than necessity (i.e. you could name it anything you wanted), this information is often assigned to &quot;$result&quot;, and the function is called by the assignment of the variable.

It is important to understand that this code '''calls the function mysqli_query''', in addition to assigning the return to a variable &quot;$result&quot;.   ['''NOTE''': The queries that ask for information -- SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, and EXPLAIN -- return what is called a [[resource]].  Other types of queries, which manipulate the database, return TRUE if the operation is successful and FALSE if not, or if the user does not have permission to access the table referenced.]

To catch an error, for debugging purposes, we can write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
   $result = mysqli_query ($cxn, $sql_query)
     or die (mysqli_error () . &quot; The query was:&quot; . $sql_query);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
'''NOTE:''' The semi colon for the function before the die statment is omitted.

If the function '''mysqli_query''' returns false, PHP will terminate the script and print an error report from MySQL (such as &quot;you have an error in your SQL syntax&quot;) and the query.

Thus, our final code would be, assuming that there were a database connection named $cxn:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php 
$sql_query = &quot;SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id ASC&quot;;
$result = mysqli_query ($cxn, $sql_query)
    or die (mysqli_error () . &quot; The query was:&quot; . $sql_query);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Putting it all together===
In the previous sections we looked at 3 commands, but not at how to use them in conjunction with each other. So let's take a look at selecting information for a table in our mysql database called ''MyTable'', which is stored in a mysql database called ''MyDB''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
	 //Connect to the mysql server and get back our link_identifier
	 $link = mysql_connect (&quot;your_database_host&quot;, &quot;your_user_name&quot;, &quot;your_password&quot;)
                   or die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
 
	 //Now we select which database we would like to use
	 mysql_select_db (&quot;MyDB&quot;, $link) or die('could not select database'); 
 
 //Our SQL Query
 $sql_query = &quot;Select * From MyTable&quot;;
 
 //Run our sql query
 $result = mysql_query($sql_query)or die('query failed'. mysql_error());

 
	 //Close Database Connection
	 mysql_close ($link);
 ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
'''NOTE:''' If the link identifier is not specified, the last link opened by [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-connect.php mysql_connect()] is assumed.

===The Create Database Query ===
[By admin@technofranchise.com : We have used my_sqli connector which is the latest construct. There are some other tutorials which use my_sql construct to make the database connections (Don't confuse with it. Our constructor is the latest one)
The creation of the database is our first step when accessing the backend MySql Server with php script. This can be achieved by connecting with the server. After that, creating the database. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;your_username&quot;,&quot;my_password&quot;); 

//connecting the server
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Error in establisihng the connection:&quot; . mysqli_connect_error();
}
$sql_query=&quot;CREATE DATABASE  MyDB&quot;;
if (mysqli_query($cn,$query))
{
echo &quot;Database has been created&quot;;
}
else
{
echo &quot;Error while creating the database: ” . mysqli_error($cn);
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Create Table Query===
The process of creating the table is as easy as creating the database. We have to execute the create table query using the mysqli construct

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;my_username&quot;,&quot;my_password&quot;,&quot;MyTable&quot;);

if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Connection failed : &quot; . mysqli_connect_error();
}
$sql_query=&quot;CREATE TABLE  MyTable(firstName VARCHAR(18), lastName VARCHAR(18), salary DECIMAL(5,4) )&quot;;
if (mysqli_query($cn,$sql_query))
{
echo &quot;Table created successfully&quot;;
}
else
{
echo &quot;Error encountered  while creating the table : &quot; . mysqli_error($cn);
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Getting Select Query Information with older connector construct===
Well that doesn’t help, because what are we to do with ''$result''? Well when we do a select query we select out information from a database we get back what is known as a resource, and that is what is stored in ''$result'', our resource identifier. A resource is a special type of PHP variable, but lets look at how to access information in this resource.

We can use a function called '''mysql_fetch_assoc''' it takes one parameter, our resource identifier ''$result'', and generates an associative array corresponding to the fetched row. Each column in the table corresponds to an index with the same name. We can now extract out information and print it like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php 
 //Connect to the mysql server and get back our link_identifier
 $link = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;your_user_name&quot;, &quot;your_password&quot;)
         or die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());


 //Now we select which database we would like to use
 mysql_select_db(&quot;MyDB&quot;) or die('could not select database'); 

 //Our SQL Query
 $sql_query = &quot;Select * From MyTable&quot;;

 //Run our sql query
 $result = mysql_query($sql_query)or die('query failed'. mysql_error());

 //iterate through result
 while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result))
 {
     //Prints out information of that row
     print_r($row);
     echo $row['foo'];
     //Prints only the column foo.
 }
 
 // Free resultset (optional)
 mysql_free_result($result);


 //Close the MySQL Link
 mysql_close($link);
 ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;


===Inserting the records with latest connector construct===

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,”your_username&quot;,&quot;your_password&quot;,&quot;MyDB&quot;);
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Connection failed : &quot; . 
mysqli_connect_error();
}
mysqli_query($cn,&quot;INSERT INTO MyTable(firstName, lastName, salary) VALUES ('George','Smith' ,55000)&quot;);

mysqli_close($cn);

?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Updating the records with latest connector construct===
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;your_username&quot;,&quot;your_password&quot;,&quot;MyDB&quot;);
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Connection failed : &quot; . mysqli_connect_error();
}
mysqli_query($cn,”Update MyTable Set salary=6000 Where firstName='George' AND lastName='Smith' &quot;);
mysqli_close($cn);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Delete the records===
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;your_username&quot;,&quot;your_password&quot;,&quot;MyDB&quot;);
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Connection failed : &quot; . mysqli_connect_error();
}
mysqli_query($cn,&quot;Delete From MyTable Where firstName='George' AND lastName='Smith' “);
mysqli_close($cn);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== PHP + MySQL + Sphinx ==
Once you understand the basics of how MySQL functions with PHP you might want to start learning about full text search engines. Once your site gets large (millions of database records) MySQL queries will start to get painfully slow, especially if you use them to search for text with wildcards:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;WHERE content='%text%')&lt;/source&gt;

There are many free/paid solutions to stop this problem. A good open source full text search engine is [[Sphinx Search]]. There is a WikiBook on how to use it with PHP and MySQL that explains the concepts of how Indexing works. You might want to read it before reading the official documentation.

''From First Principles to Classical Mechanics to General Relativity''

&lt;!--Below is a tentative layout that is based on the treatment of the object-independent mathematical path followed by the treatment of the object itself.  Topics will be rearranged, fleshed-out, etc. as the sections progress.

The convention for sections are &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Theoretical Physics (Introduction)/section/subsection/sub-subsection/etc.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.--&gt;


Theoretical physics is the branch of physics that deals with developing and evolving theory to explain the fundamental nature of the universe.  It is possibly the most important branch of physics in that without it physics would stagnate and no new discoveries or ideas would develop.

Theoretical physics is the earliest form of science and our earliest written records show that it began over 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece.  The scholars of ancient Greece were the first we know of to attempt a thoroughgoing investigation of the universe.  They did this through a systematic gathering of knowledge through the activity of human reason alone which we call today ''philosophy''.  And for many centuries afterward, the term philosophy was used as the equivalent of the word science which is a recent invention.  

Greek natural philosophy was the first attempt to explain the universe without resorting to the supernatural.  The Greek word for &quot;natural&quot; is ''physikos'', which is where we get our modern word for the science of physics.

One of the first phenomena that the Greeks contemplated was ''motion''.  The Greek ideas on ''motion'' were put into sophisticated form by the philosopher Aristotle (384-322 B.C.).  In Aristotle's theory, objects or ''elements'' had a natural place.  He basically theorized that objects on earth made of earth, water, fire or air tended to return to their natural place.  So on earth, matter had a tendency to remain at rest and when matter was put in motion, it came to rest.  In the heavens, Aristotle's theory said that heavenly bodies were a fifth element where earthly laws did not apply.  In the heavens, therefore, the laws included a theory of perpetual motion.

From this small beginning, theoretical physics had its foundation upon which the greats in physics from Kepler and Galileo to Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein and other modern physicists would begin to build physics as we know it today.

Any treatment of theoretical physics describes not only the history of the development of physics, but also the fundamental ideas and notions of the natural world that inspired physicists to create new models of it.  Often new theories were based upon new facts coming to light, new methods of measurement and new observations made possible by the development of technology.  However just as often new theory was and is based upon existing theory and is many times simply a clarification or adjustment to existing theories making them a more accurate model of reality.  It is for this reason that Isaac Newton said: &quot;If I have seen farther than others, it has been by standing on the shoulders of giants.&quot;  Therefore, included in this discussion of theoretical physics are the prior theories that physicists built upon that led up to the mainstream theories that physics upholds today.

==Theory==
To understand theoretical physics, one must understand the concept of ''theory''.  Theories are simple models of complex systems.  The universe is a complex system.  In order to analyze the universe as the science of physics does, it must be broken down into simple principles and basic ideas that create a visualization or model.  A theory must be useful in that it should approximate reality and make it understandable, measurable, and predictable.

Aristotle realized, there must be propositions that do not need, for whatever reason, to be proven. Such propositions he called the first principles (archai, principia) of demonstration. 

To create a theory, one must begin with assumptions or postulates.  An assumption is something accepted without proof.  The assumptions are therefore the weak point of any theory.  Due to this fact, William of Ockham circa 1300 A.D., a medieval English philosopher, emphasized that the fewer the assumptions, the more useful the theory.  

The assumptions should then lead to a theory that contains explanations of reality and the observations of reality should be able to be explained and even predicted by the theory.  Therefore the predictions of the theory can be tested.

A theory can however be disproved if it can be shown that two contradictory conclusions can be drawn from it.  The scientific method used in modern times to test the viability of a theory is to draw a necessary conclusion from the theory and then check it against actual phenomena as rigorously as possible.  This is called experimentation.

When assumptions become universally accepted as an established rule, they are called axioms and sometimes universal laws.

==Mathematical Foundations==
The most ancient written records from every culture show forms of measurement and basic arithmetic.  Mathematics first arose out of the need to do calculations in commerce, to understand the relationships between numbers, to measure land, and to predict astronomical events. The history of mathematics ranges from Babylonian mathematics with its sexagesimal (base 60) system dating back 4,000 years, to Euclidean Geometry which dates to 300 B.C. and to modern calculus created by Isaac Newton and Leibniz in 1666. 

The development of physics has always been intertwined with mathematics and measurements.  Mathematics and measurement are the basic testing ground for determining the usefulness of a theory.

Mathematics can be broadly subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry and analysis).  Each of these broad fields of mathematics has branched out into more abstract and complex forms due to the nature of the complex systems they must explain.  Mathematical shorthand has been invented to create simple notations to denote not only simple values, but entire formulas, systems, or algorithms.  

The test of theory in theoretical physics relies strongly upon mathematics.  The necessary prerequisite mathematics include algebra, geometry, algebra 2, trigonometry, calculus (single variable and multivariable), analytic geometry, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, complex numbers, the complex plane and probability theory.  Today much of theoretical physics relies on vector calculus.  However, the mathematics itself is meaningless without the measurements that it represents, therefore, the international system of units must be understood as well which involve such measurements as the kilogram, second, metre, ampere, Kelvin, and mole.

In theoretical physics, if the mathematics of a theory is found to be inaccurate, the theory collapses.  Therefore, the importance of mathematical rigor in theoretical physics cannot be overstated.

===[[Introduction to Theoretical Physics/Mathematical Foundations/Arithmetic, Physics, and Mathematics|Arithmetic, Physics and Mathematics, or the Units of Measurement]]===

==Classical Mechanics==
:Where space is flat, h is zero, and c is infinite.

===Light===
The Greeks also had theories on light, its properties and its speed.  They thought light did not have movement or speed, because if it did, the speed would be too great to contemplate. They concluded that light must simply either be there or not be there.  Aristotle, the famous Greek natural philosopher, said that &quot;...light is neither fire nor any kind whatsoever of body nor an efflux from any kind of body ... It is certainly not a body, ... clearly therefore, light is just the presence of that [or light is simply the presence of light itself]. Empedocles (and with him all others who used the same forms of expression) was wrong in speaking of light as 'traveling' or being at a given moment between the earth and its envelope, its movement being unobservable by us; that view is contrary both to the clear evidence of argument and to the observed facts; if the distance traversed were short, the movement might have been unobservable, but where the distance is from extreme East to extreme West [i.e. at dawn light fills the entire sky which is a great distance therefore], the draught upon our powers of belief is too great.&quot; -- Aristotle &quot;On the Soul&quot; Book 2, Part 7. (Note: comments in brackets added for clarification.)

This indicates that the Greeks believed the speed of light to be infinite i.e. it was present in all places at once when it appeared.  This idea was not overturned even by Galileo who attempted to measure the speed of light in the 17th century and it continued to hold in Newton's day.

===The Euclidean Space===
Euclidean geometry mentioned earlier as a form of mathematics originating with the Greeks in about 300 B.C.E. is the mathematical abstraction and extension of ordinary three dimensional space. It can be described by the Cartesian system of coordinates.

In ''Euclid's Elements'', Euclidean space is &quot;flat&quot;. This flatness is obvious from Euclid's definition 23 which states: 'Parallel straight lines are straight lines which, being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in both directions, do not meet one another in either direction.'

===Motion of Objects===
Classical mechanics is generally classified as pre-20th century mechanics.  Aristotle's views of motion held sway for 2,000 years until an Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) developed such ingenious and conclusive experimentation that it not only began the destruction of Aristotelian physics but demonstrated the absolute necessity of experimentation in science.

Galileo studied the physics of motion by performing experiments in which he was able to calculate the speed and acceleration of falling bodies.  He developed new theories to explain motion based upon his experiments.  Galileo made advancements in theoretical physics by postulating a theory of inertia contrary to any previous assumptions.  Galileo asserted his theory of motion which is stated as his Principle of Inertia:  &quot;A body moving on a level surface will continue in the same direction at constant speed unless disturbed.&quot;

Isaac Newton (1642-1727) capitalized upon Galileo's observations and created theories based upon this notion that objects tend to maintain momentum.  Newton was an English scientist who systemized and generalized the assumptions made by Galileo, extended the predictions of the theory, and put them in a way that could be described by mathematical formulae that could be tested.

A direct translation from the Latin of Newton's first law of motion with Newton's own explanation is: 

&quot;LAW I: Every body continues ever in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. -- Projectiles continue ever in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity. A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, continue ever their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time.&quot;--end translation

Newton begins his Laws of Motion with Galileo's idea of inertia. Inertia in Newton's first law of motion is a concept and an assumption and therefore cannot be proven by experimentation or mathematics.  (Inertia has two meanings today, and later, under the heading &quot;inertia&quot;, the term ''inertia'' will be considered in its second definition which is measurable.)  But the idea of &quot;inertia&quot; that is present in Newton's first law is an imagined concept of Galileo that once you get something into momentum, it stays that way until a force affects it. In Newton's first law, ''rest'' is the state of zero momentum or zero movement, so that inertia can be simply stated as the tendency to maintain movement. The idea comes before the law and creates the law. Without the idea of inertia there are no Newtonian laws of motion. Working from Galileo's principle, Newton's reasoning was that Aristotle postulated continual circular movement in the heavens and that laws on earth were different for Aristotle because Aristotle believed the earth was at rest, a fixed motionless reference frame, and at the center of the universe. Newton knew the earth was not at rest since by Newton's time the Copernican system with the sun at the center was the generally accepted theory.  Therefore Newton realized that the same laws in the heavenly bodies had to apply for earthly bodies as well. Therefore the same maintenance of movement, inertia, that had been postulated to exist in celestial bodies had to exist on earth. It was  this reasoning that made Newton believe that something on earth was making things come to rest.  What Galileo called a disturbance, Newton called a ''force''.  Inertia was Newton's way of describing the &quot;default state&quot; of matter that we now consider a law of the universe. Aristotle had described the default state of earthly objects as &quot;rest&quot; (natural place). Newton contradicted or enlarged on the Aristotle default state and said that to the contrary the default state is &quot;inertia&quot; and upon that seminal idea built the laws of motion. Without the &quot;idea&quot;, the mental abstraction of &quot;inertia&quot;, Newton could have never formulated the Laws of Motion. 

Newton could then from his first law extrapolate how much force it would take to change the momentum of an object.  Newton therefore stated his Second Law of Motion thus:

&quot;LAW II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed. -- If a force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.&quot;

Newton here is basically saying that the change in the momentum of an object is proportional to the amount of force exerted upon the object.  He also states that the change in direction of momentum is determined by the angle from which the force is applied.  Interestly too, Newton is restating in his further explanation another prior idea of Galileo being what we call today the ''Galilean transformation'' or the addition of velocities.

An interesting fact when studying Newton's Laws of Motion from the Principia is that Newton himself does not explicitly write formulae for his laws which was common in scientific writings of that time period.  In fact, it is today commonly added when stating Newton's second law that Newton has said, &quot;and proportional to the mass of the object.&quot;  This however is not found in Newton's second law as directly translated above.  In fact, the idea of mass is not introduced until the third law.  However, it has been a common convention to describe law two of Newton in the mathematic formula '''F=ma''' where '''F''' is Force, '''a''' is acceleration and '''m''' is mass.  This is actually a combination of laws two and three of Newton expressed in a very useful form.  This formula in this form did not even begin to be used until the 18th century after Newton's death, but it is implicit in his laws.

Newton's Third Law of Motion states:  &quot;LAW III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. -- Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other. If a body impinge upon another, and by its force change the motion of the other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, toward the contrary part. The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of the bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. For, because the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next scholium.&quot;

The explanation of mass is expressed here for the first time in the words &quot;reciprocally proportional to the bodies&quot; which have now been traditionally added to Law 2 as &quot;mutually proportional to the mass of the object.&quot;  Thus we arrive at '''F=ma'''.

Newton's Third Law of Motion also expresses one of the fundamental symmetry principles of the universe.  The idea is that forces in nature always exist in pairs. Newton's third law is often restated as, &quot;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.&quot;

====Gravity====

&quot;I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve, and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth and found them to answer pretty nearly.&quot; -- Isaac Newton, 1666

Here Newton introduced a novel idea by imagining that the Earth's gravity influenced the moon, counter-balancing its orbital rotation about the earth. Newton deduces the inverse-square law. This inverse-square law had already been observed by Johannes Kepler in his book ''The Harmony of the World'' which contains what is now known as 'Kepler's Third Law', that for any two planets the ratio of the squares of their periods will be the same as the ratio of the cubes of the mean radii of their orbits. 

Kepler had merely made an observation from studying the data of astronomer Tycho Brahe for some twenty years.  Kepler did not understand why there was an inverse-square law, he merely stated this observation.  What Newton did was explain that the inverse-square law was caused by the force of gravity between two massive objects.

Newton wrote a full treatment of his new physics including his laws of motion and gravity and its application to astronomy which was published in 1687 and entitled ''Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica'' or commonly referred to as the ''Principia''. 

According to biographers J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, &quot;the Principia is recognised as the greatest scientific book ever written. Newton analysed the motion of bodies in resisting and non-resisting media under the action of centripetal forces. The results were applied to orbiting bodies, projectiles, pendulums, and free-fall near the Earth. He further demonstrated that the planets were attracted toward the Sun by a force varying as the inverse square of the distance and generalised that all heavenly bodies mutually attract one another. Further generalisation led Newton to the law of universal gravitation: &quot;... all matter attracts all other matter with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.&quot;

Newton had based much of his theory upon the observations of Galilieo.  Galileo had made a study of falling bodies and Galileo had observed that all bodies fall with the same acceleration.  The force of gravity was known before Newton's time, however, it had not been systematically explained.

What Galileo hadn't envisioned was that which was made clear in Newton's universal law of gravity, that the acceleration was proportional to the masses of the objects. In other words, Galileo would have never conceived of objects falling to earth at the same speed had the objects had masses comparable to the earth.  In other words, for objects on earth, the mass is so small compared to the mass of the earth that the mass of the object is negligible.
Therefore, for gravity measurements on Earth, acceleration is independent of the mass or weight of an object, and due to this all objects fall to the earth at 9.8 m/s^2.

This same negligible gravity of one object compared to another orbiting object helped Kepler in his third law to discover through observation the inverse-square law of the planetary orbits.  It is only due to the mass of the sun being so extraordinarily large compared to the masses of the planets that the mass of the planets becomes negligible in the formula.  Since Kepler did not understand the relation between mass and gravity, he would have never observed the inverse-square law had earth been comparable in mass to the sun.

So here we see in the development of theoretical physics the intertwining of observations with the development of theories of ''force'' and mathematics to explain the observations.  The theories advanced by Kepler and Galileo were correct on a simple level, but it was Newton who introduced ''force'' and the relation between force and ''mass'' in order to explain why these observations were accurate.  Obviously, the modern theories of physics and the description of universal laws did not develop in a vacuum.  Physicists built upon prior knowledge and prior ideas.  From these prior ideas, they produced new models of the natural world and made new inferences.  In their turn these new models made predictions and required new explanations so that sometimes the developing theories could only be explained by the introduction of a new force, or a new constant such as the gravitational constant, or a new universal law such as inertia.  Even Aristotle was working from prior notions that he systematically arranged into the first elements of theoretical physics.

====Constant Acceleration====
Galileo's third principle is summarized for falling bodies as: &quot;The distance fallen is proportional to the time squared '''&lt;math&gt;dt^2\,&lt;/math&gt;'''. &quot;

Galileo's third principle defines a constantly changing velocity.  When there is a change in velocity, it is called acceleration.  Therefore, bodies fall with a constant acceleration.

====Circular Motion====
To keep an object rotating in circular motion, it requires a centripetal force &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{mv^2} {r} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object,
&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the circle.

====Rotational Motion====

===Mechanics===
====Point Particles and the Center of Mass====
====Inertia====
The philosopher René Descartes (1596 - 1650) used the idea of a greater God and an infinite universe with no special or privileged place to articulate the concept of inertia: a body at rest remains at rest, and one moving in a straight line maintains a constant speed and same direction unless it is deflected by a 'force'. We can see this is borrowed from Galileo's principle of inertia and was later also incorporated into Newton's first law of motion.

Possibly the hardest difficulty for science to overcome has been the influence of religious and philosophical implications upon the theoretical science of physics.

Early researchers differed in their explanations of the fundamental nature of what we now call electromagnetic radiation. In 1690, Christian Huygens explained the laws of reflection and refraction on the basis of a wave theory. Sir Isaac Newton believed that light consists of particles which he designated corpuscles. In 1827 Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel made experiments on interference that showed that a corpuscular theory of light was inadequate.  Then in 1873 James Clerk Maxwell showed that by making an electrical circuit oscillate it should be possible to produce electromagnetic waves. His theory made it possible to compute the speed of electromagnetic radiation purely on the basis of electrical and magnetic measurements, and the computed value corresponded very closely to the empirically measured speed of light.  In 1888, Heinrich Hertz made an electrical device that actually produced what we would now call microwaves — essentially radiation at a lower frequency than visible light.  Everything up to that point suggested that Newton had been entirely wrong to regard light as corpuscular. Then it was discovered that when light strikes an electrical conductor it causes electrons to move away from their original positions. Greater intensities of light at one frequency can cause more electrons to move, but they will not move any faster. Higher frequencies of light can cause electrons to move faster. This appeared to raise a contradiction.  Light had been shown by earlier experiments to be a wave and now in other experiments it appeared to behave as a particle.

===Quantum Mechanics===

==== Old quantum theory====

Quantum mechanics developed from the study of electromagnetic waves, which means visible light seen in the colors of the rainbow, but also other waves including the more energetic waves like ultraviolet light, x-rays, and gamma rays plus the waves with longer wavelengths including infrared waves, microwaves and radio waves.  We are not, however,  speaking of sound waves, but only of the waves that travel at the speed of light.  Also, when the word &quot;particle&quot; is used, it refers to elementary or subatomic particles.

====Planck's constant====
Without knowing it, Max Planck discovered that there is a definite relation between the frequency of light and the energy that it carries.  Planck actually was studying how the radiation of a body was related to its temperature in an attempt to devise a new radiation law.  Planck's investigation ended up describing the energy of a wave in mathematical terms.  So he took a small segment of a wave or as he called it &quot;an oscillator&quot; to describe the wave's total energy.  What he found concerning radiation and oscillators was really a description of electromagnetic waves. Waves have crests and troughs.  A cycle is the return from one point such as the crest to the next crest. So Planck used the frequency of the wave, which means the number of cycles per second, to determine the energy of a wave.  What he discovered was that, given any wave, a single number when multiplied by the frequency gives the energy of the wave. He found that this single number was the same for waves of all frequencies.  This number is called Planck's constant and represented as the letter '''h''' in physics formulas. If you know '''h''' (Plank's constant), and you know the frequency of the light, then you can calculate the energy delivered over a certain period of time. For instance, if a beam of light illuminated a target for 3 seconds, and the light frequency was  540 × 10¹² hertz, then the energy delivered would be '''h''' × 3 × 540 × 10¹² joules. The value of '''h''' itself is exceedingly small, about 0.000000000000000000000000000000000662618 joule.seconds (or 6.62618 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; joule seconds in scientific notation).

However, when you investigate the energy of a wave in this manner, it seems that the wave is carrying its energy in a given number of little packets per second.  This discovery then seemed to particalize a wave. These packets of energy along the wave were called quanta by Planck. Quantum mechanics began with the discovery that energy is delivered in these packets whose size is related to the color or frequency of the light.   

There originally were two competing ways to describe light, either as a wave propagated through empty space, or as small particles traveling in a straight line. Because Planck showed that the energy of the wave is made up of packets, the particle analogy became useful to help understand how light delivers energy in multiples of certain set values. Light of one frequency delivers multiples of a certain unit amount designated as a quantum of energy. Nevertheless, the wave analogy is useful to help understand other phenomena. In 1905, Albert Einstein used Planck's constant to postulate that the energy in a beam of light occurs in concentrations that he called photons. A single photon is a single quantum of energy, but the energy associated with a photon varies  depending upon the frequency of the wave. Photons can deliver more or less energy, depending on their frequency. This description sounds like Newton's corpuscular account except that a photon was said to have a frequency, and the energy of the photon was accounted proportional to its frequency. This explained all previous seeming contradictions in experiments where light sometimes displayed wave-like behavior and other times displayed particle-like behavior.

Both the idea of a wave and the idea of a particle are derived from our everyday experience. We cannot see photons. We can only investigate their properties indirectly. We look at some phenomena, such as the rainbow of colors that we see when a thin film of oil rests on the surface of a puddle of water, and we can explain that phenomenon to ourselves by saying that light is like waves.  We look at other phenomena, such as the way a photoelectric meter in our camera works, and we explain it by analogy to particles colliding with the detection screen in the meter.  In both cases we take concepts from our everyday experience and apply them to a world we have never seen. Neither form of explanation is entirely satisfactory. To remind us that both &quot;wave&quot; and &quot;particle&quot; are concepts imported from our macro world to explain the world of atomic-scale phenomena, some physicists such as George Gamow have used the term &quot;wavicle&quot; to refer to whatever it is that is really there. In the following discussion, &quot;wave&quot; and &quot;particle&quot; may both be used depending on which aspect of quantum mechanical phenomena is under discussion.

====Reduced Planck's constant====
Planck's constant originally represented the energy that a light wave carries as a function of its frequency. However, in 1925 when Werner Heisenberg developed his full quantum theory, which is discussed below, calculations involving wave analysis called Fourier series were fundamental, and so another version of Planck's constant showed up in the mathematical formula.  This &quot;reduced&quot; version of Planck's constant includes a conversion factor to make calculations involving wave analysis easier to deal with. It showed up again in 1927 in the Uncertainty Principle, also discussed later in this article.  Finally, this reduced Planck's constant appeared in Dirac's equation and was then given an alternate designation, &quot;Dirac's constant.&quot; Therefore, it is appropriate to begin with an explanation of what this constant is, even though we haven't yet touched on the theories that made its use convenient.

As noted above, the energy of any wave is its frequency multiplied by Planck's constant. A wave is made up of crests and troughs.  In a wave, a cycle is defined by the return from a certain position to the same position such as from the top of one crest to the next crest.  A cycle actually is mathematically related to a circle, and both have 360 degrees. A degree is a unit of measure for the amount of turn needed to produce a certain arc at a given distance. A sine curve is generated by a point on the circumference of a circle as that circle rotates. (See a demonstration at:  [http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/bob/Rotation/sin12.swf Rotation Applet]) There are 2 pi radians per cycle in a wave, each having 180 degrees, which is similar to a circle where the radius times 2 times pi equals the circumference of the circle. Since one cycle is 2*pi*radian, when h is divided by 2pi this leaves radian. Therefore, dividing '''h''' by 2[[pi|&amp;pi;]] describes a constant that, when multiplied by the frequency of a wave, gives the energy in joules per radian per second.  And h/2pi is h-bar or &lt;math&gt; \hbar = \frac{h}{2 \pi} \ &lt;/math&gt;. 

The reduced Planck's constant is written in mathematical formulas as ''&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;'' and is simply called &quot;h-bar&quot;. So the reduced Planck's constant gives the energy of a wave in units per radian instead of units per cycle. However, the fundamental packet of energy is a photon derived from h describing a cycle of one quantum of energy.  The reduced Planck's constant merely divides the single quantum of energy into mathematically manageable parts.  

The two constants h and h-bar are merely conversion factors between energy units and frequency units. The reduced Planck's constant is used more often than ''h'' alone (Planck's constant) in quantum mechanical mathematical formulas for many reasons, one of which is that angular velocity or angular frequency is measured in radians per second. When equations relevant to those problems are written in terms of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;2 \pi \ &lt;/math&gt; factors in numerator and denominator can cancel out, saving a computation.

====Bohr atom====

[[Image:Bohr-planetary-atom-model.jpg|thumb|307px|The Bohr model of the atom&lt;br&gt;Showing electron quantum jumping to ground state n=1]] 

In 1897 the particle called the electron was discovered. By means of the gold foil experiment physicists discovered that the nucleus was at the center of the atom. So at first all scientists believed that the atom must be like a miniature solar system. But that simple analogy predicted that electrons would, within about one hundredth of a microsecond, crash into the nucleus of the atom. This is because the nucleus has a positive charge and the electron has a negative charge, and unlike charges attract.  The great question of the early 20th century was, &quot;Why do electrons normally maintain a stable orbit around the nucleus?&quot;

In 1913, Niels Bohr removed this substantial problem by applying the idea of discrete (non-continuous) quanta to the orbits of electrons.  This account became known as the Bohr model of the atom.  Bohr basically theorized that electrons can only inhabit certain orbits around the atom. These orbits could be derived even before the 1931 development of the electron microscope by looking at the [[Organic Chemistry/Spectroscopy|spectral lines]] produced by atoms.

The way that Bohr quantized the orbits of the electrons was by assuming that the angular momentum of each of the orbits was derived from the value of '''h''', Planck's constant. In 1913 Bohr considered the electron to be a small particle in a solar system type orbit. However, he took Planck's constant to be a fundamental division at the subatomic level.  Bohr argued that the orbits were circular and that the only allowed orbits had the angular momentum of some integral number times  '''h''' divided by 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  We know that h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Planck's constant.  Each orbit after the initial orbit has an angular momentum that is a multiple of h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Bohr's analysis of electron orbits as circular'''&lt;br&gt;A little math on circular orbits.  Bohr was very &lt;br&gt;familiar with the dynamics of simple circular &lt;br&gt;orbits in an inverse square field as described in &lt;br&gt;classical mechanics. &lt;br&gt;Simply explained: To find the acceleration of a &lt;br&gt;circle, place it inside the shape of a square &lt;br&gt;where tangents meet, then find the linear speed &lt;br&gt;along one side of the square, then square the &lt;br&gt;speed of one side to complete the speed of the &lt;br&gt;entire square, then divide by the radius of the &lt;br&gt;circle placed in the square to get the speed &lt;br&gt;around the circle.  Therefore, circular &lt;br&gt;(centripetal) acceleration is v squared over r &lt;br&gt;where v is speed and r is radius. The equation for &lt;br&gt;the centripetal acceleration is &lt;math&gt;a =v^2/r&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;br&gt;is, acceleration is inversely proportional to the &lt;br&gt;radius of the circle. If the radius is doubled, &lt;br&gt;then the acceleration is halved.&lt;br&gt;Also, Kepler's Third Law is that the radius cubed &lt;br&gt;equals the circumference of the orbit squared. &lt;br&gt;It immediately follows that the radius of any n &lt;br&gt;orbit is proportional to the orbit n squared, and &lt;br&gt;the speed in that orbit is proportional to 1/n. Speed&lt;br&gt; times radius gives angular momentum. That leaves &lt;br&gt;n-squared over n. It then follows that the angular &lt;br&gt;momentum for any orbit n is just proportional to &lt;br&gt;n. Bohr argued then that the angular momentum &lt;br&gt;in any orbit n was nKh, where h is Planck's &lt;br&gt;constant and K is some multiplying factor, the &lt;br&gt;same for all the orbits, which was later &lt;br&gt;determined to be 1/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;!--&amp;nbsp;  keeps booklike bottom margin --&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;

Bohr considered the circular orbit to be as one cycle in an oscillator (as in Planck's initial measurements to define the constant '''h''') which is similar to one cycle in a wave.  Therefore, the orbits per second of the electron around its nucleus would create a frequency. Multiplying the frequency of each orbit by Planck's constant '''h''' would give only certain allowed orbits, thus fixing the size of the orbits.   Through analysis (shown at [http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/Bohr_Atom/Bohr_Atom.html]) Bohr found that the first allowed orbit, called K, was equal to 1/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. This was the argument Bohr used to establish that angular momentum for his model is quantized in units h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. 

Bohr's theory showed electrons to be orbiting the nucleus of an atom in a way that was amazingly different from what we see in the world of our everyday experience.  He showed that when an electron changed orbits it did not move in a continuous trajectory from one orbit around the nucleus to another. Instead, it suddenly disappeared from its original orbit and reappeared in another orbit. Each distance at which an electron can orbit is a function of a quantized amount of energy.  The closer to the nucleus an electron orbits, the less energy it takes to remain in that orbital.  Electrons that absorb a photon gain a quantum of energy, so they jump to an orbit that is farther from the nucleus, while electrons that emit a photon lose a quantum of energy and so jump to an inner orbital. Electrons cannot gain or lose a fractional quantum of energy, and so, it is argued, they cannot have a position that is at a fractional distance between allowed orbitals. Allowed orbitals were designated as whole numbers using the letter '''n''' with the innermost orbital being designated n = 1, the next out being n = 2, and so on.  Any orbital with the same value of n is called an electron shell.

Bohr's model of the atom was essentially two-dimensional because it depicts electrons as particles in circular orbits.  In this context, two-dimensional means something that can be described on the surface of a plane.  One-dimensional means something that can be described by a line.  Because circles can be described by their radius, which is a line segment, sometimes Bohr's model of the atom is described as one-dimensional.

It was discussed between De Broglie, Schroedinger, Bore and Einstein what model of the atom was best suited to describe it and Bohr's model was universally accepted as the only viable solution.  Bohr however was making an assumption that since the first orbit K was found to have a value of 1/2r that all consecutive orbits should be multiplied by the first orbit, first by h, then 2h, then 3h, and so on.  This was assumed without proof.  The only circumstantial evidence was that the lines in the atomic spectrum only appeared in certain discrete places for each element, therefore, the orbits were in discrete places.  Bohr assumed they were multiples of ''h'' (Planck's constant) because ''h'' was how wave energy had been quantized.  The external link in the article [1], will show Bohr's model was made on unprovable assumptions as are most theories.  However, if Bohr's assumptions were true, then they would predict that the electron wouldn't fall into the nucleus of every atom.  So it was creating a theory to fit nature, not much different than when Aristotle said that all objects on earth come to rest in their own &quot;natural place&quot;.  In Bohr's time and even now, we still must believe that the orbits are quantized by h or else we have no other explanation for the electron not falling into the nucleus.   In the case of outer electrons, the dividing by 2pi is not a result of mathematical ease to arrive at the reduced Planck's constant, but rather the result of the first orbit being 1/2pi so all the other orbits were multiplied by integers of h and the first orbit of 1/2pi. There were other theories floating around in the early twentieth century.  After all, some force could be counter-balancing the electron away from the nucleus, but then electrons were also counter-balanced away from each other in their orbits, so there would have to be two new kinds of forces added for this type of theory.  Choosing Bohr's atom became a matter of Ockham's Razor i.e. the least amount of new assumptions as ''h'' was already known.

====Wave/Particle Duality====
Niels Bohr determined that it is impossible to describe light adequately either by sole use of the wave analogy or of the particle analogy. Therefore he enunciated the principle of complementarity which is a theory of pairs, such as, the pairing of wave and particle or the pairing of position and momentum. Louis de Broglie worked out the mathematical consequences of these findings. In quantum mechanics, it was found that electromagnetic waves could react in certain experiments as though they were particles and in other experiments as though they were waves.  It was also discovered that subatomic particles could sometimes be described as particles and sometimes as waves.  This discovery led to the theory of wave-particle duality by Louis-Victor de Broglie in 1924, which states that waves and particles have properties of both at the same time.

The Bohr atom model was enlarged upon with the discovery by de Broglie that the electron had wave-like properties. Therefore for Bohr's atom the orbit is only stable if it meets the condition for a standing wave. A standing wave can be made if a string is fixed on both ends and made to vibrate, then the only waves that can occur are those with zero amplitude at those fixed ends. The waves appear to oscillate in place simply changing crest for trough in an up-and-down motion. These vibrations are called standing waves.  If the string is made to form a circle in the same way that the wave of an electron forms a circle in its orbit in the Bohr atom, then a standing wave is formed when the wave fits the available space around the circle.  In other words, no partial fragments of wave crests or troughs are allowed.  The wave must be a continuous formation of crests and troughs all around the circle.

===Development of modern quantum mechanics===
====Full quantum mechanical theory====
Werner Heisenberg developed the full quantum mechanical theory in 1925 at the young age of 24.  Following his teacher, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg began to work out a theory for the quantum behavior of electron orbitals.  Because electron orbits could not be observed, Heisenberg went about creating a mathematical description of quantum mechanics built on what could be observed, that is, the light emitted from atoms in their atomic spectrum.  He used a form of mathematics related to the mathematics of arrays of numbers known as &quot;matrices.&quot; He worked from the observed atomic spectrum which only shows light emitted from electrons only at certain observed places.  Instead of trying to explain every possible orbit, he began with the assumption that electron orbitals that cannot be observed in the spectrum do not exist. By this time it was known that the electron orbital was three-dimensional, but trying to work out the mathematics for a three-dimensional atom proved too complicated, so he imagined the electron orbital flattened out to one dimension.  Heisenberg studied the electron orbital as a charged ball on a spring, an oscillator, whose motion was not quite regular called anharmonic. To see a picture of a charged ball on a spring see: [http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/waves_particles/wavpart4.html Vibrating Charges]. He used the laws of classical mechanics known in the macro world, then applied quantum properties which means discrete (non-continuous) properties to the motion which would leave the gaps between the orbitals so that the mathematics would represent only the observed electron orbitals.  The multiplication in his formula resulted in a type of mathematics that was used in special arrays of numbers called matrices.  This means in Heisenberg's quantum mechanical mathematics, the normal multiplication law of commutation where A x B = B X A didn't apply.  

Heisenberg was approaching quantum mechanics from the particle-like perspective of an oscillating charged electron.  Particles appeared to quantum jump due to Planck's constant which showed energy delivered in packets along the wave. Heisenberg was describing mathematically the intensity of a wave. The intensity is the energy per unit volume multiplied by the velocity at which the energy is moving. Amplitude is the maximum height of a wave crest or depth of a trough.
Amplitudes of position and momentum that have a period of 2 pi like a cycle in a wave are called Fourier series variables.  Heisenberg described the particle-like properties of the electron in a wave as having position and momentum in his matrix mechanics. When these amplitudes of position and momentum are measured and multiplied together, they give intensity. However, he found that when the position and momentum were multiplied together in that respective order, and then the momentum and position were multiplied together in that respective order, there was a difference or deviation in intensity between them of h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  As we have said earlier h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is h-bar and describes one cycle in the wave.  Heisenberg wouldn't understand the reason for this deviation for two more years, but for the time being he understood that the math worked and was an exact description of the quantum behavior of the electron.  Max Born reviewed Heisenberg's paper and recognized that this type of multiplication that couldn't be described by the property of commutation known in normal arithmetic was called matrix mathematics.

No one prior to this had applied this type of mathematics to quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's new matrix theory was able for the first time to fully calculate the quantum behavior of the electron and was later applied to all subatomic particles.

Because particles could be described as waves, later in 1925 Erwin Schroedinger analyzed what an electron would look like as a wave around the nucleus of the atom.  He came up with a wave equation that describes each electron as having a wavefunction.  He thus showed that the atom was not at all like a miniature solar system, but that the electron in a hydrogen atom was more like a wave that covered the entire sphere of its orbital all at once meaning it was three-dimensional. Each electron has its own unique wavefunction described in Schroedinger's equation by three properties (later Paul Dirac added a fourth).  The three properties were 1.) which orbital meaning closer to the nucleus with less energy or further from the nucleus with more energy, 2.) the shape of the orbital meaning that orbitals were not just spherical but changed shapes, and 3.) the magnetic moment of the orbital which is a type of energy caused by the charge of the electron as it rotates around the nucleus.

These three properties were called collectively the wavefunction of the electron and are said to describe the quantum state of the electron.  &quot;Quantum state&quot; means the collective properties of the electron describing what we can say about its condition at a given time. For the electron, the quantum state is described by its wavefunction which is designated in physics by the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; (psi pronounced &quot;sigh&quot;).  The three properties of Schroedinger's equation that describe the wavefunction of the electron and therefore also describe the quantum state of the electron as described in the previous paragraph are each called quantum numbers.  The first property which describes the orbital was numbered according to Bohr's model where ''n'' is the letter used to describe the energy of each orbital.  This is called the principal quantum number.  The next quantum number that describes the shape of the orbital is called the azimuthal quantum number and it is represented by the letter ''l'' (lower case L).  The shape is caused by the angular momentum of the orbital.  Angular momentum measures an object's tendency to continue to spin. The azimuthal quantum number ''&quot;l&quot;'' represents the orbital angular momentum of the electron around the nucleus. However the shape of each orbital has its own letter as well.  So for the letter ''&quot;l&quot;'' there are other letters to describe the shapes of ''&quot;l&quot;''.  The first shape is spherical and is described by the letter ''s''.  The next shape is like a dumbbell and is described by the letter ''p''.  The other shapes of orbitals become more complicated and are described by the letters ''d'', ''f'', and ''g''.  The third quantum number of Schroedinger's equation describes the magnetic moment of the electron and is designated by the letter ''m'' and sometimes as the letter ''m'' with a subscript ''l'' because the magnetic moment depends upon the second quantum number ''l''.

In May 1926 Schrödinger published a proof that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Shroedinger's wave mechanics gave equivalent results: mathematically they were the same theory.  Both men claimed to have the superior theory.  Heisenberg insisted on the existence of discontinuous quantum jumps in his particle-like examination of the oscillation of a charged electron giving more precise definitions and Schroedinger insisted that a theory based on continuous wave-like properties which he called &quot;matter-waves&quot; was better.

====Uncertainty Principle====

|}

In 1927, Heisenberg made a new discovery from his quantum theory that had further practical consequences of this new way of looking at matter and energy on the atomic scale. In Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formula, Heisenberg had encountered an error or difference of h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; between position and momentum.  This represented a deviation of one radian of a cycle when the particle-like aspects of the wave were examined.  Heisenberg analyzed this difference of one radian of a cycle and divided the difference or deviation of one radian equally between the measurement of position and momentum. This had the consequence of being able to describe the electron as a point particle in the center of one cycle of a wave so that its position would have a standard deviation of plus or minus one-half of one radian of the cycle (1/2 of h-bar). A standard deviation can be either plus or minus the measurement i.e. it can add to the measurement or subtract from it. In three-dimensions a standard deviation is a displacement in any direction. What this means is that when a moving particle is viewed as a wave it is less certain where the particle is.  In fact, the more certain the position of a particle is known, the less certain the momentum is known.  This conclusion came to be called &quot;Heisenberg's Indeterminacy Principle,&quot; or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  To understand the real idea behind the uncertainty principle imagine a wave with its undulations, its crests and troughs, moving along. A wave is also a moving stream of particles, so you have to superimpose a stream of particles moving in a straight line along the middle of the wave. An oscillating ball of charge creates a wave larger than its size depending upon the length of its oscillation. Therefore, the energy of a moving particle is as large as the cycle of the wave, but the particle itself has a location. Because the particle and the wave are the same thing, then the particle is really located somewhere in the width of the wave. Its position could be anywhere from the crest to the trough. The math for the uncertainty principle says that the measurement of uncertainty as to the position of a moving particle is one-half the width from the crest to the trough or one-half of one radian of a cycle in a wave.

For moving particles in quantum mechanics, there is simply a certain degree of exactness and precision that is missing. You can be precise when you take a measurement of position and you can be precise when you take a measurement of momentum, but there is an inverse imprecision when you try to measure both at the same time as in the case of a moving particle like the electron. In the most extreme case, absolute precision of one variable would entail absolute imprecision regarding the other. 

The consequences of the uncertainty principle were that the electron could no longer be considered as in an exact location in its orbital.  Rather the electron had to be described by every point where the electron could possibly inhabit.  By creating points of probable location for the electron in its known orbital, this created a cloud of points in a spherical shape for the orbital of a hydrogen atom which points gradually faded out nearer to the nucleus and farther from the nucleus.  This is called a probability distribution.  Therefore, the Bohr atom number ''n'' for each orbital became known as an ''n-sphere'' in the three dimensional atom and was pictured as a probability cloud where the electron surrounded the atom all at once.

This led to the further description by Heisenberg that if you were not making measurements of the electron that it could not be described in one particular location but was everywhere in the electron cloud at once. In other words, quantum mechanics cannot give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible results.  Heisenberg went further and said that the path of a moving particle only comes into existence once we observe it. However, strange and counter-intuitive this may seem, quantum mechanics however does tell us the location of the electron's orbital, its probability cloud.  Heisenberg was speaking of the particle itself, not its orbital which is in a known probability distribution. 

Classical physics had shown since Newton that if you know the position of stars and planets and details about their motions that you can predict where they will be in the future.  For subatomic particles, Heisenberg denied this notion showing that due to the uncertainty principle one cannot know the precise position and momentum of a particle at a given instant, so its future motion cannot be determined, but only a range of possibilities for the future motion of the particle can be described. 

These notions arising from the uncertainty principle only arise at the subatomic level and were a consequence of wave-particle duality.  As counter-intuitive as they may seem, quantum mechanical theory with its uncertainty principle has been responsible for major improvements in the world's technology from computer components to fluorescent lights to brain scanning techniques.

====Wavefunction collapse====
Schroedinger's wave equation with its unique wavefunction for a single electron is also spread out in a probability distribution like Heisenberg's quantized particle-like electron.  This is because a wave is naturally a widespread disturbance and not a point particle.  Therefore, Schroedinger's wave equation has the same predictions made by the uncertainty principle because uncertainty of location is built into the definition of a widespread disturbance like a wave.  Uncertainty only needed to be defined from Heisenberg's matrix mechanics because the treatment was from the particle-like aspects of the electron.  Schroedinger's wave equation shows that the electron is in the probability cloud at all times in its probability distribution as a wave that is spread out.  Therefore, in Schroedinger's equation when you measure the position of an electron, it ceases to have wave-like properties. Without wave-like properties, none of Schroedinger's definitions of the electron being wave-like make sense anymore.  The measurement of the position of the particle nullifies the wave-like properties and Schroedinger's equation then fails.  Because the electron can no longer be described by its wavefunction when measured due to it becoming particle-like, this is called wavefunction collapse.

====Eigenstates and eigenvalues====
The term eigenstate is derived from the German word ''&quot;eigen,&quot;'' which means &quot;inherent&quot; or &quot;characteristic.&quot; The word eigenstate is descriptive of the measured state of some entity that possesses quantifiable characteristics such as position, momentum, etc. The state being measured and described must be an &quot;observable&quot; (i.e. something that can be observed and measured like position or momentum), and must have a definite value. In the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything being in its own eigenstate. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite value of measure, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics affirms that it is impossible to pinpoint exact values for the momentum of a certain particle like an electron in a given location at a particular moment in time, or, alternatively, that it is impossible to give an exact location for such an object when the momentum has been measured. Due to the inevitable disturbance of the entity being measured by the very act of measurement, statements regarding both the position and momentum of particles can only be given in terms of a range of probabilities, a &quot;probability distribution.&quot; Eliminating uncertain in one term maximizes uncertainty in regard to the second parameter.  

Therefore it became necessary to have a way to clearly formulate the difference between the state of something that is uncertain in the way just described, such as an electron in a probability cloud, and effectively contrast it to the state of something that is not uncertain, something that has a definite value. When something is in the condition of being definitely &quot;pinned-down&quot; in some regard, it is said to possess an '''eigenstate'''. If the position of, e.g., an electron has been made definite, it is said to have an eigenstate of position.  

A definite value, such as the position of an electron that has been successfully located,  is called the '''eigenvalue''' of the eigenstate of position.  The German word ''&quot;eigen&quot;'' was first used in this context by the mathematician David Hilbert in 1904. Schroedinger's wave equation gives wavefunction solutions, meaning the possibilities where the electron might be, just as does Heisenberg's probability distribution. As stated above, when a wavefunction collapse occurs because something has been done to locate the position of an electron, the electron's state becomes an eigenstate of position, meaning that the position has a known value.

====Dirac wave equation====
In 1928, Paul Dirac worked out a variation of Schroedinger's equation that accounted for a fourth property of the electron in its orbital.  There was a doublet meaning a pair of lines in the spectrum of a hydrogen atom that was unaccounted for.  This meant that there was more energy in the electron orbital from magnetic moment than had previously been described. Wolfgang Pauli when studying alkali metals had introduced what he called a &quot;two-valued quantum degree of freedom&quot; associated with the electron in the outermost shell. This led to the Pauli Exclusion Principle that predicted that no more than two electrons can inhabit the same orbital.  It also predicted that any neutron, electron, or proton (types of fermions) could not exist in the same quantum state.  We learned in Schroedinger's equation that there were three quantum states of the electron, but if two electrons could be in the same orbital, there had to be another quantum number to distinguish those two electrons from each other and to describe the extra magnetic moment shown in the atomic spectrum. In early 1925, the young physicist Ralph Kronig had introduced a theory to Pauli that the electron rotates in space in the same way that the earth rotates on its axis.  This would account for the missing magnetic moment and allow for two electrons in the same orbital to be different if their spin was in opposite directions to each other thus satisfying the Exclusion Principle. So Paul Dirac introduced the fourth quantum number called the spin quantum number designated by the letter ''s'' to the new Dirac equation of the wavefunction of the electron.  In 1930, Dirac combined Heisenberg's matrix mechanics with Schroedinger's wave mechanics into a single quantum mechanical representation in his ''Principles of Quantum Mechanics''.  The quantum picture of the electron was now complete.

All of the above development of quantum theory was based mainly on the spectroscopy|atomic spectrum of the hydrogen atom.  This is due to the fact that each atom of each element produces a unique pattern of spectral lines when light from each different kind of element is passed through a prism.  Scientists could not study the electron and nucleus of the atom itself because they cannot be seen.  Even today with High-resolution Scanning Tunneling Electron Microscopes we can only get images of the atom as a blurry fuzzball. However, the spectral lines of the atom reveal the orbits of electrons and the energy that can be expected.  It was basically this study of the spectroscopic analysis of first the hydrogen atom and then the helium atom that led to quantum theory.  Therefore, the mathematical formula were made to fit the picture of the atomic spectrum.  That is why quantum mechanics is sometimes referred to as a form of mathematical physics.

====Quantum entanglement====
However, it took a great mind to challenge quantum mechanics and to further define a concept hidden in Heisenberg's quantum theory.  That mind was Albert Einstein who rejected Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  Collectively, Heisenberg's quantum mechanics based on Bohr's initial explanation became known as the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics by detractors.  Einstein, in trying to show that it was not a complete theory, recognized that the theory predicted that two or more particles which have interacted in the past exhibit surprisingly strong correlations when various measurements are made on them.  Einstein called this &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;.  In 1935, Schroedinger published a paper explaining the argument which had been denoted the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument.  Einstein showed that the Copenhagen Interpretation predicted quantum entanglement which he was trying to prove was incorrect in that it would defy physics.  Quantum entanglement means that when there is a change in one particle at a distance from another particle then the other particle automatically changes to counter-balance the system.  In quantum entanglement measuring one entangled particle defines its properties and seems to influence the properties of its partner or partners instantaneously no matter how far apart they are. Due to the fact that the two particles are entangled interaction on the one causes instantaneous effects on the other. Einstein had calculated that quantum theory would predict this, he saw it as a flaw and therefore challenged it. However, instead of showing a weakness in quantum mechanics, this forced quantum mechanics to acknowledge that quantum entanglement did in fact exist and it became another foundation theory of quantum mechanics.

There is a lot of controversy over quantum mechanics, historically, by physicists involved in the theory themselves. It is because the theory was sort of an ad hoc theory to make mathematics that fit the measurements of the atomic spectrum that it is so controversial and has been attacked by Albert Einstein, Erwin Shroedinger, Alfred Lande and many other physicists involved in its development. The theory itself was a shot in the dark similar to the Ptolemian earth-centered solar system. The system of Ptolemy was a great theory with the earth at the center. It worked very well to predict all the movements of the planets with great accuracy even including retrograde motion. In fact, when Copernicus came up with his sun-centered solar system model, it didn't predict the position of the planets nearly as well as the earth-centered system because Copernicus still used absolutely circular orbits. It wasn't until Galileo saw through the telescope that Venus went through all its phases that it could be proven beyond a doubt that the sun was at the center. Today Quantum Mechanics works like Ptolemy's earth-centered solar system. It may not be reality (even according to Niels Bohr), but it sure predicts things very well. Once a better microscope (analogous to Galileo's telescope) is invented that can actually see the atomic structure, quantum mechanics will probably be overturned. There is so much information on the controversy over quantum mechanics that it would make an interesting article just quoting the physicists who invented it and Einstein who rejected many of its principles. However, quantum mechanics is so extremely useful in predicting outcomes at the atomic level in our present state of technology that it probably won't be revised for some time to come.

'''Jalebi''' is a syrupy sweet that is shaped like a slightly large, chaotic pretzel and is traditionally prepared in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. Well-made jalebi has a tart element with a sweet taste.

==Ingredients==
===Jalebi batter===
* 3 cups all-purpose  [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Besan|gram flour]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 5 cups water

===Syrup===
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 cups of water
* ⅛ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
* red and yellow food coloring
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]]

3 cups of vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for deep frying

==Procedure==
# Mix up the batter ingredients until smooth.
# Let the batter sit unrefrigerated and uncovered overnight (about 12 hours).
# Mix the sugar, water, and cream of tartar for the syrup.
# Stir the syrup over moderate heat until the sugar is dissolved.
# Put on high heat and boil for 5 minutes. 
# Let the syrup cool, and stir in the rosewater and food coloring (color it to light orange).
# Put the vegetable oil in a wide [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]]-like dish, and heat to about 350°F (175°C).
# Put the batter into a pastry bag with about a ¼ inch opening. If it is too dry to squeeze out, mix in a bit of water.
# Squeeze the batter into the oil, making a couple of figure 8s and loops on top of each other. The shape should be about 3 inches on its longest side.
# Fry each jalebi until golden brown. Remove, let the oil drain off, then soak in syrup for a minute.

'Philosophical ethics could be called the study of what is good and bad'? - I would question this as being a definition of Ethics! That 'good' and 'bad' exist by themselves, I find a difficult assumption.

I think a better definition would be &quot;Ethics is the study of how one ought to live,&quot;&quot;Ethics is the study of what makes for the best life,&quot; or some more eloquently written equivalent.  In general I don't see how this page in it's current state is informative.  Would anyone object if I began to edit it?

Terrible. Simply too many flaws in the 'introduction' to list. 

== Introduction to Philosophy:  What is Ethics? ==

The heading here correctly says &quot;What is Ethics?&quot;

The link to it, however, says &quot;What are Ethics?&quot;

Also many of the subjects overlap, making it hard to distinguish between the three documents 
&quot;what is ethics?&quot;
&quot;what is ethics&quot;
and &quot;introduction to philosophy/what is ethics&quot;

all three of these should be combined or layed out in such a way that there is little or no overlap

      <text xml:space="preserve">Set theory is concerned with the concept of a set, essentially a collection of objects that we call elements. Because of its generality, set theory forms the foundation of nearly every other part of mathematics.

==Before you begin==
In order to make things easier for you as a reader, as well as for the writers, you will be expected to be familiar with a few topics before beginning.  (I hope to have some links to other Wikibooks here soon.)

* Mathematical Logic &amp; Proofs
** Mathematics is all about proofs.  One of the goals of this book is to improve your skills at making proofs, but you will not learn any of the basics here.
** Many constructions in set theory are simply generalizations of constructions in mathematical logic, and therefore [[logic]] is a necessity of learning set theory.

'''Shortening''' is a [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] used in cooking. Modern shortening is a vegetable-based product that is just barely solid at room temperature. Shortening has a higher [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] than [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] and [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] (it is less flammable), leading to its use in [[Cookbook:Deep_frying|deep-fat frying]] and as a pan coating to prevent baked goods from sticking. It is also sometimes used as an ingredient, when a recipe needs a flavorless fat thicker than oil but thinner than margarine. Shortening has 100% fat content, compared to 80% for butter and margarine.

Shortening is so called because it gives a &quot;short&quot; texture (as in [[Cookbook:Shortbread|shortbread]]). '''Crisco''', a popular brand, was first produced in 1911. Shortening was once made from animal fat ([[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]). 

Refrigeration is a good idea, because the [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]]-like foods commonly made with shortening will turn out best if everything ([[Cookbook:Ingredients|ingredients]], air, [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]], work surface, bowls, etc.) is kept cold until [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]].

Until recently, shortening was almost always made of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Partially hydrogenated oil contains ''trans-'' fats, which have been implicated in causing heart disease. Newer products avoid ''trans-'' fats by using a mixture of unhydrogenated oil and fully hydrogenated oil. All vegetable-based shortenings are cholesterol-free.

Butter or margarine, mixed with vegetable oil to thin it, can replace shortening used to prevent baked goods from sticking or used as an ingredient. One way is to use lard or bacon grease, as was tradition. Lard is a particularly good substitute, producing the very best pastry crusts while having less saturated fat than butter.

= Introduction =
This wikibook should try to accomplish two goals: it should provide an overview of the history of cinema in general (two versions: one brief and one comprehensive), and it should be a set of sub-projects covering individual topics in great depth.  There are links for a few basic topics, each of which I would expect to see come up periodically at most universities either as a film course or as a large section of a film course (e.g., you don't often see German Expressionism as a course itself, but it will always show up as a section of any course surveying film as a whole, or prewar European cinema, etc.).

There shouldn't be any limits as to what sort of topic a module should try to cover (it could be as small a subject as Italian Futurism), but if the number of modules becomes unwieldy, it might be prudent to group some together into a single link that would just be a landing page for a collection of modules (e.g., &quot;Modules on individual directors&quot;).

Additionally, each module should contain a list of films within the topic (or in the comprehensive modules, films mentioned as being particularly significant in the development of cinema) that are available on dvd, possibly grouped into two or more categories: particularly those that are necessary for fully understanding the topic, and those that merely contribute to understanding the topic.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Object orientation in Ada ==

Object oriented programming consists in building the software in terms of &quot;objects&quot;.  An &quot;object&quot; contains data and has a behavior.  The data, normally, consists in constants and variables as seen in the rest of this book but could also, conceivably, reside outside the program entirely, i.e. on disk or on the network.  The behavior consists in subprograms that operate on the data.  What makes Object Orientation unique, compared to procedural programming, is not a single feature but the combination of several features:

* ''encapsulation'', i.e. the ability to separate the implementation of an object from its interface; this in turn separates &quot;clients&quot; of the object, who can only use the object in certain predefined ways, from the internals of the object, which have no knowledge of the outside clients.

* ''inheritance'', the ability for one type of objects to inherit the data and behavior (subprograms) of another, without necessarily needing to break encapsulation;

* ''type extension'', the ability for an object to add new data components and new subprograms on top of the inherited ones and to ''replace'' some inherited subprograms with its own versions; this is called ''overriding''.

* ''polymorphism'', the ability for a &quot;client&quot; to use the services of an object without knowing the exact type of the object, i.e. in an abstract way.  The actual type of the object can indeed change at run time from one invocation to the next.

It is possible to do object-oriented programming in any language, even assembly.  However, type extension and polymorphism are very difficult to get right without language support.

In Ada, each of these concepts has a matching construct; this is why Ada supports object-oriented programming directly.

* Packages provide encapsulation;
* Derived types provide inheritance;
* Record extensions, described below, provide for type extension;
* Class-wide types, also described below, provide for polymorphism.

Ada has had encapsulation and derived types since the first version (MIL-STD-1815 in 1980), which led some to qualify the language as &quot;object-oriented&quot; in a very narrow sense.  Record extensions and class-wide types were added in Ada 95.  Ada 2005 further adds interfaces.  The rest of this chapter covers these aspects.

=== The simplest object: the Singleton ===

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Directory {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Present (Name_Pattern: String) {{Ada/kw|return}} Boolean;
   {{Ada/kw|generic}}
      {{Ada/kw|with procedure}} Visit (Full_Name, Phone_Number, Address: String;
                            Stop: {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean);
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Iterate (Name_Pattern: String);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Directory;

The Directory is an object consisting of data (the telephone numbers and addresses, presumably held in an external file or database) and behavior (it can look an entry up and traverse all the entries matching a Name_Pattern, calling Visit on each).

A simple package provides for encapsulation (the inner workings of the directory are hidden) and a pair of subprograms provide the behavior.

This pattern is appropriate when only one object of a certain type must exist; there is, therefore, no need for type extension or polymorphism.

=== Primitive operations ===

For the following, we need the definition of primitive operations:

The set of ''primitive operations of a type T'' consists of those subprograms that:

* are declared immediately within the same package as the type (not within a nested package nor a child package);
* take a parameter of the type or, for functions, ''return'' an object of the type;
* take an access parameter of the type or, for functions, ''return'' an access value of the type.

(Also predefined operators like equality &quot;=&quot; are primitive operations.)

An operation can be primitive on two or more types, but only on one tagged type. The following example would be illegal if also B were tagged.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} A {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|type}} B {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Proc (This: A; That: B); {{Ada/comment|primitive on A and B}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

=== Derived types ===

Type derivation has been part of Ada since the very start.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is private}};
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Create (Data: Boolean) {{Ada/kw|return}} T;  {{Ada/comment|primitive}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Work (Object : {{Ada/kw|in out}} T);        {{Ada/comment|primitive}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Work (Pointer: {{Ada/kw|access}} T);        {{Ada/comment|primitive}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Acc_T {{Ada/kw|is access}} T;
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Proc (Pointer: Acc_T);           {{Ada/comment|not primitive}}
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is record}}
     Data: Boolean;
   {{Ada/kw|end record}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

The above example creates a type T that contains data (here just a Boolean but it could be anything) and behavior consisting of some subprograms.  It also demonstrates encapsulation by placing the details of the type T in the private part of the package.

The primitive operations of T are the function Create, the overloaded procedures Work, and the predefined &quot;=&quot; operator; Proc is not primitive, since it has an ''access type'' on T as parameter — don't confuse this with an ''access parameter'', as used in the second procedure Work. When deriving from T, the primitive operations are inherited.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} P;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Q {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} P.T;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Q;

The type Q.Derived has the same data ''and the same behavior'' as P.T; it inherits both the data ''and the subprograms''.  Thus it is possible to write:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Q;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Object: Q.Derived := Q.Create (Data =&gt; False);
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Q.Work (Object);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

Admittedly, the reasons for writing this may seem obscure.
The purpose of this kind of code is to have objects of types P.T and Q.Derived, which are not compatible:

 Ob1: P.T;
 Ob2: Q.Derived;
 
 Ob1 := Ob2;        -- illegal
 Ob1 := P.T (Ob2);  -- but convertible

This feature is not used very often (it's used e.g. for declaring types reflecting physical dimensions) but I present it here to introduce the next step: type extension.

=== Type extensions ===

Type extensions are an Ada 95 amendment.

A tagged type provides support for dynamic polymorphism and type extension. A tagged type bears a hidden tag that identifies the type at run-time.  Apart from the tag, a tagged record is like any other record, so it can contain arbitrary data.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
      {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

As you can see, a &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; is an ''object'' in the sense that it has data and behavior (the procedure &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt;).  However, this object does not hide its data; any program unit that has a &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|with}} Person&lt;/code&gt; clause can read and write the data in a Person.Object directly.  This breaks encapsulation and also illustrates that Ada completely separates the concepts of ''encapsulation'' and ''type''.  Here is a version of Person.Object that encapsulates its data:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged private}};
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object);
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
      {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

Because the type Person.Object is tagged, it is possible to create a record extension, which is a derived type with additional data.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Person;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object {{Ada/kw|with private}};
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object {{Ada/kw|with}} 
      {{Ada/kw|record}}
         Skilled_In : Language_List;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;

The type &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; inherits the data and behavior, i.e. the type's primitive operations, from &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;; it is thus possible to write:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Programmer;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Me : Programmer.Object;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Programmer.Put (Me);
    Me.Put; {{Ada/comment|equivalent to the above, Ada 2005 only}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

So the declaration of the type &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;, as a record extension of &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;, implicitly declares a &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put&lt;/code&gt; that applies to a &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;.

Like in the case of untagged types, objects of type Person and Programmer are convertible. However, where untagged objects are convertible in either direction, conversion of tagged types only works in the direction to the root. (Conversion away from the root would have to add components out of the blue.) Such a conversion is called a ''view conversion'', because components are not lost, they only become invisible.

Extension aggregates have to be used if you go away from the root.

=== Overriding ===

Now that we have introduced tagged types, record extensions and primitive operations, it becomes possible to understand overriding.   In the examples above, we introduced a type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; with a primitive operation called &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt;.  Here is the body of the package:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 {{Ada/kw|package body}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object) {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       Ada.Text_IO.Put (O.Name);
       Ada.Text_IO.Put (&quot; is a &quot;);
       Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Gender_Type'Image (O.Gender));
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Put;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

As you can see, this simple operation prints both data components of the record type to standard output.  Now, remember that the record extension &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; has an additional data member.  If we write:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Programmer;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Me : Programmer.Object;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Programmer.Put (Me);
    Me.Put; {{Ada/comment|equivalent to the above, Ada 2005 only}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

then the program will call the inherited primitive operation &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt;, which will print the name and gender ''but not the additional data''.  In order to provide this extra behavior, we must ''override'' the inherited procedure &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; like this:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Person;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object {{Ada/kw|with private}};
    {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/comment|Optional keyword, new in Ada 2005}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object);
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object {{Ada/kw|with}} 
      {{Ada/kw|record}}
         Skilled_In : Language_List;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package body}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object) {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       Person.Put (Person.Object (O)); {{Ada/comment|view conversion to the ancestor type}}
       Put (O.Skilled_In); {{Ada/comment|presumably declared in the same package as Language_List}}
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Put;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;

&lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt; ''overrides'' &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt;; in other words it ''replaces'' it completely.  Since the intent is to extend the behavior rather than replace it, &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt; as part of its behavior.  It does this by converting its parameter from the type &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; to its ancestor type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;.  This construct is a ''view conversion''; contrary to a normal type conversion, it does ''not'' create a new object and does ''not'' incur any run-time cost.  Of course, it is optional that an overriding operation call its ancestor; there are cases where the intent is indeed to replace, not extend, the inherited behavior.

(Note that also for untagged types, overriding of inherited operations is possible. The reason why it's discussed here is that derivation of untagged types is done rather seldom.)

=== Polymorphism, class-wide programming and dynamic dispatching ===

The full power of object orientation is realized by polymorphism, class-wide programming and dynamic dispatching, which are different words for the same, single concept.  To explain this concept, let us extend the example from the previous sections, where we declared a base tagged type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; with a primitive operation &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; and a record extension &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; with additional data and an overriding primitive operation &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt;.

Now, let us imagine a collection of persons.  In the collection, some of the persons are programmers.  We want to traverse the collection and call &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; on each person.  When the person under consideration is a programmer, we want to call &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt;; when the person is not a programmer, we want to call &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt;.  This, in essence, is polymorphism, class-wide programming and dynamic dispatching.

Ada implements this concept by means of ''class-wide types''.

Each tagged type, such as &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;, has a corresponding ''class of types'' which is the set of types comprising the type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; itself and all types that extend &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;.  In our example, this class consists of two types:

* &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;

Ada 95 defines the &lt;code&gt;Person.Object'Class&lt;/code&gt; attribute to denote the corresponding class-wide type. In other words:

 {{ada/kw|declare}}
    Someone : Person.Object'Class := ...; {{ada/comment|to be expanded later}}
 {{ada/kw|begin}}
    Someone.Put; {{ada/comment|dynamic dispatching}}
 {{ada/kw|end}};

The declaration of Someone denotes an object that may be of ''either'' type, &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;.  Consequently, the call to the primitive operation &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; dispatches dynamically to either &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt;.

The only problem is that, since we don't know whether Someone is a programmer or not, we don't know how many data components Someone has, either, and therefore we don't know how many bytes Someone takes in memory.  For this reason, the class-wide type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object'Class&lt;/code&gt; is [[ada Programming/Subtypes#Indefinite_subtype|''indefinite'']].  It is impossible to declare an object of this type without giving some constraint.  It is, however, possible to:

* declare an object of a class-wide with an initial value (as above). The object is then constrained by its initial value.
* declare an ''access value'' to such an object (because the access value has a known size); 
* pass objects of a class-wide type as parameters to subprograms
* assign an object of a specific type (in particular, the result of a function call) to a variable of a class-wide type.

With this knowledge, we can now build a polymorphic collection of persons; in this example we will quite simply create an array of access values to persons:

 {{ada/kw|with}} Person;
 {{ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{ada/kw|is}}
    {{ada/kw|type}} Person_Access {{ada/kw|is access}} Person.Object'Class;
    {{ada/kw|type}} Array_Of_Persons  {{ada/kw|is array}} (Positive {{ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) of Person_Access;
 
    {{ada/kw|function}} Read_From_Disk {{ada/kw|return}} Array_Of_Persons {{ada/kw|is separate}};
 
    Everyone : {{ada/kw|constant}} Array_Of_Persons := Read_From_Disk;
 {{ada/kw|begin}} {{Ada/comment|Main}}
    {{ada/kw|for}} K {{Ada/kw|in}} Everyone'Range {{ada/kw|loop}}
       Everyone (K).{{Ada/kw|all}}.Put; {{Ada/comment|dereference followed by dynamic dispatching}}
    {{ada/kw|end loop}};
 {{ada/kw|end}} Main;

The above procedure achieves our desired goal: it traverses the array of Persons and calls the procedure &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; that is appropriate for each person.

==== Advanced topic: How dynamic dispatching works ====

You don't need to know how dynamic dispatching works in order to use it effectively but, in case you are curious, here is an explanation.

The first component of each object in memory is the ''tag''; this is why objects are of a ''tagged'' type rather than plain records.  The tag really is an access value to a table; there is one table for each specific type.
The table contains access values to each primitive operation of the type.
In our example, since there are two types &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;, there are two tables, each containing a single access value.
The table for &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; contains an access value to &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt; and the table for &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; contains an access value to &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt;.
When you compile your program, the compiler constructs both tables and places them in the program executable code.

Each time the program creates a new object of a specific type, it automatically sets its tag to point to the appropriate table.

Each time the program calls a primitive operation, the compiler inserts object code that:

* dereferences the tag to find the table of primitive operations for the specific type of the object at hand
* dereferences the access value to the primitive operation
* calls the primitive operation.

When you perform a view conversion to an ancestor type, the compiler performs these two dereferences at compile time rather than run time: this is ''static dispatching''; the compiler emits code that directly calls the primitive operation of the ancestor type specified in the view conversion.

==== Redispatching ====

Dispatching works on the (hidden) tag of the object. So what happens when a primitive operation Op1 calls another primitive operation Op2? Which operation will be called when Op1 is called by dispatching?

  {{ada/kw|type}} Root {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|private}};
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Root);
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op2 (This: Root);
 
  {{ada/kw|type}} Derived {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Root {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|private}};
  -- Derived inherits Op1
  {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op2 (This: Derived);
 
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Root) {{ada/kw|is}}
  {{ada/kw|begin}}
    ...
    Op2 (This);               -- not redispatching
    Op2 (Root'Class (This));  -- redispatching
    This.Op2                  -- not redispatching (new syntax since Ada 2005)
    (Root'Class (This)).Op2   -- redispatching (new syntax since Ada 2005)
    ...
  {{ada/kw|end}} Op1;
 
  D: Derived;
  C: Root'Class := D;
 
  Op1 (D);  -- static call
  Op1 (C);  -- dispatching call
  D.Op1;    -- static call (new syntax since Ada 2005)
  C.Op1;    -- dispatching call (new syntax since Ada 2005)

In this fragment, Op1 is not overridden, whereas Op2 is overridden. The body of Op1 calls Op2, thus which Op2 will be called for a call of Op1 with a parameter of type Derived?

The answer is: Ada gives complete control over dispatching and redispatching. If you want redispatching, it has to be required explicitly by converting the parameter to the class-wide type again. (Remember: View conversions never lose components, they just hide them. A conversion to the class-wide type makes them visible again.)

Thus the first call of Op1 (statically linked, i.e. not dispatching) calls the inherited Op1 — and within Op1, the first call to Op2 is therefore also a static call to the inherited Op2 (there is no redispatching). However the second call, since the parameter R is converted to the class-wide type, dispatches to the overriding Op2.

The second call of Op1 is a dispatching call to the inherited Op1 and behaves exactly as the first.
To understand what happens here, the implicitly defined inherited Op1 is just the parent operation called with a view conversion of the parameter:

  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Derived) {{ada/kw|is}}
  {{ada/kw|begin}}
    Op1 (Root (This));  -- view conversion
  {{ada/kw|end}} Op1;

''This is very different from how other OO languages behave.'' In other OO languages, a method is either dispatching or not. In Ada, a routine is either ''available'' for dispatching or not. Whether or not dispatching is actually ''used'' for a given call depends on the way that the object's type is specified at that call point. For programmers accustomed to other OO languages, it can come as quite a surprise that calls from a dispatchable routine to other routines on the same object are, by default, ''not'' dispatched.

Similarly surprising but less commonly encountered, calls from a non-dispatchable routine for a tagged type to other routines on the same object are, by default, ''dispatched'':

  {{ada/kw|type}} Root {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|private}};
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Root'Class);
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op2 (This: Root);
 
  {{ada/kw|type}} Derived {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Root {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|private}};
  -- Derived does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; inherit Op1, rather Op1 is applicable to Derived.
  {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op2 (This: Derived);
 
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Root'Class) {{ada/kw|is}}
  {{ada/kw|begin}}
    ...
    Op2 (This);               -- dispatching
    Op2 (Root (This));        -- static call
    This.Op2;                 -- dispatching (new syntax since Ada 2005)
    (Root (This)).Op2;        -- static call (new syntax since Ada 2005)
    ...
  {{ada/kw|end}} Op1;
 
  D: Derived;
  C: Root'Class := D;
 
  Op1 (D);  -- static call
  Op1 (C);  -- static call
  D.Op1;    -- static call (new syntax since Ada 2005)
  C.Op1;    -- static call (new syntax since Ada 2005)

Note that calls on Op1 are always static, since Op1 is ''not'' inherited. Its parameter type is classwide, so the operation is ''applicable'' to all types derived from Root. (Op2 has an entry for each type derived from Root in the dispatch table. There is no such dispatch table for Op1; rather there is only one such operation for all types in the class.)

==== Run-time type identification ====

Run-time type identification allows the program to (indirectly or directly) query the tag of an object at run time to determine which type the object belongs to.
This feature, obviously, makes sense only in the context of polymorphism and dynamic dispatching, so works only on tagged types.

You can determine whether an object belongs to a certain class of types, or to a specific type, by means of the membership test {{Ada/kw|in}}, like this:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Base    {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Base    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Leaf    {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Derived {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 
 ...
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Explicit_Dispatch (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Base'Class) {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|if}} This {{Ada/kw|in}} Leaf {{Ada/kw|then}} ... {{Ada/kw|end if}};
    {{Ada/kw|if}} This {{Ada/kw|in}} Derived'Class {{Ada/kw|then}} ... {{Ada/kw|end if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Explicit_Dispatch;

Thanks to the strong typing rules of Ada, run-time type identification is in fact rarely needed; the distinction between class-wide and specific types usually allows the programmer to ensure objects are of the appropriate type without resorting to this feature.

Additionally, the reference manual defines &lt;code&gt;package Ada.Tags&lt;/code&gt; (RM 3.9(6/2)), attribute &lt;code&gt;'Tag&lt;/code&gt; (RM 3.9(16,18)), and &lt;code&gt;function Ada.Tags.Generic_Dispatching_Constructor&lt;/code&gt; (RM 3.9(18.2/2)), which enable direct manipulation with tags.

=== Creating Objects ===

The Language Reference Manual's section on
{{Ada/RM|3|3|title=Objects and Named Numbers}} states when an object
is created, and destroyed again. This subsection illustrates
how objects are created.

The LRM section starts,
{{Quote|''Objects are created at run time and contain a value of a given type. An object can be created and initialized as part of elaborating a declaration, evaluating an allocator, aggregate, or function_call''.|}}

For example, assume a typical hierarchy of
object oriented types: a top-level type &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;,
a &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; type derived from &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;,
and possibly more kinds of persons. Each person has a name; assume &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;
objects to have a &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; component.
Likewise, each &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;Gender&lt;/code&gt; component.
The &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; type inherits the components and the operations
of the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type, so &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; objects
have a &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;Gender&lt;/code&gt; component, too.
&lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; objects may have additional components specific
to programmers.

Objects of a tagged type are created the same way 
as objects of any type.
The second LRM sentence says, for example, that an object will be created when you
declare a variable or a constant of a type.
For the tagged type &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;,

 {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
    P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
    Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Put_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}&quot;The name is &quot; {{Ada/operator|&amp;}} P{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Name{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Nothing special so far. Just like any ordinary variable declaration
this O-O one is elaborated. The result of elaboration is an object named &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;
of type &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;.  However, &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; has only default
name and gender value components. These are likely not useful ones.
One way of giving initial values to the object's components is
to assign an aggregate.

 {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
    P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} &quot;Scorsese&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Gender {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} Male{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
    Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Put_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}&quot;The name is &quot; {{Ada/operator|&amp;}} P{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Name{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

The parenthesized expression after := is called an ''aggregate''
({{Ada/RM|4|3|title=Aggregates}}).

Another way to create an object that is mentioned in the LRM
paragraph is to call a function. An object will be created as the
return value of a function call.
Therefore, instead of using an aggregate of initial values,
we might call a function returning an object.

Introducing proper O-O information
hiding, we change the package
containing the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type so that &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;
becomes a private type. To enable clients of the package to construct &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;
objects we declare a function that returns them. (The function may
do some interesting construction work on the objects. For instance, the aggregate above will most probably raise the exception Constraint_Error depending on the name string supplied; the function can mangle the name so that it matches the declaration of the component.) We also declare
a function that returns the name of &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; objects.

 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Persons {{Ada/keyword|is}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Person {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|tagged}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} Make {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name{{Ada/delimiter|:}} String{{Ada/delimiter|;}} Sex{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Gender_Type{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} Person{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} Name {{Ada/delimiter|(}}P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} String{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|private}}
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Person {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|tagged}}
       {{Ada/keyword|record}}
          Name   {{Ada/delimiter|:}} String {{Ada/delimiter|(}}1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
          Gender {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Gender_Type{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
       {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Persons{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Calling the &lt;code&gt;Make&lt;/code&gt; function results in an
object which can be used for initialization.
Since the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type is '''private''' we can no longer refer to the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt;
component of &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;.
But there is a corresponding function &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; declared
with type &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; making it a socalled primitive operation.
(The component and the function in this example are both named &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt;
However, we can choose a different name for either
if we want.)

 {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
    P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Make {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} &quot;Orwell&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Sex {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} Male{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
    Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Put_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}&quot;The name is &quot; {{Ada/operator|&amp;}} Name{{Ada/delimiter|(}}P{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Objects can be copied into another. The target object is first destroyed.
Then the component values of the source object are assigned to the
corresponding components of the target object. In the following example,
the default initialized &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; gets a copy of one of the objects
created by the &lt;code&gt;Make&lt;/code&gt; calls.

 {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
    P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} 2001 {{Ada/op|&gt;}} 1984 {{Ada/keyword|then}}
       P {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Make {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} &quot;Kubrick&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Sex {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} Male{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|else}}
       P {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Make {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} &quot;Orwell&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Sex {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} Male{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|if}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}} 
 
    Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Put_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}&quot;The name is &quot; {{Ada/operator|&amp;}} Name{{Ada/delimiter|(}}P{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}


So far there is no mention of the &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; type
derived from &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;.
There is no polymorphism yet, and likewise initialization
does not yet mention inheritance.
Before dealing with &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; objects and their initialization
a few words about class-wide types are in order.

=== More details on primitive operations ===

Remember what we said before about [[#Primitive_operations|&quot;Primitive Operations&quot;]].
Primitive operations are:
* subprograms taking a parameter of the tagged type;
* functions returning an object of the tagged type;
* subprograms taking a parameter of an ''anonymous access type'' to the tagged type;
* In Ada 2005 only, functions returning an ''anonymous access type'' to the tagged type;

Additionally, primitive operations must be declared before the type is ''frozen'' (the concept of freezing will be explained later):

Examples:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (That :    {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_3 (Me   : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_4 (Them : {{Ada/kw|access}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive_5 {{Ada/kw|return}} Object;
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive_6 (Everyone : Boolean) {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Object;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

All of these subprograms are primitive operations.

A primitive operation can also take parameters of the same or other types; also, the controlling operand does not have to be the first parameter:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Object; Number : {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (You  : {{Ada/kw|in}} Boolean; That : {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_3 (Me, Her : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

The definition of primitive operations specifically excludes named access types and class-wide types as well as operations not defined immediately in the same declarative region. Counter-examples:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Object;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object_Class_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Object'Class;
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Not_Primitive_1 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Object'Class);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Not_Primitive_2 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Object_Access);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Not_Primitive_3 (This :    {{Ada/kw|out}} Object_Class_Access);
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Not_Primitive_4 {{Ada/kw|return}} Object'Class;
  
    {{Ada/kw|package}} Inner {{Ada/kw|is}}
        {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Not_Primitive_5 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Inner;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

==== Advanced topic: Freezing rules ====

Freezing rules ([[http://www.adaic.com/standards/05rm/html/RM-13-14.html ARM 13.14]]) are perhaps the most complex part of the Ada language definition; this is because the standard tries to describe freezing as unambiguously as possible.
Also, that part of the language definition deals with freezing of all entities, including complicated situations like generics and objects reached by dereferencing access values.
You can, however, get an intuitive understanding of freezing of tagged types if you understand [[#Advanced_topic:_How_dynamic_dispatching_works|how dynamic dispatching works]].
In that section, we saw that the compiler emits a table of primitive operations for each tagged type.
The point in the program text where this happens is the point where the tagged type is ''frozen'', i.e. the point where the table becomes complete.
After the type is frozen, no more primitive operations can be added to it.

This point is the earliest of:
* the end of the package spec where the tagged type is declared
* the appearance of the first type derived from the tagged type

Example:

 {{ada/kw|package}} X {{ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{ada/kw|type}} Object {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|null}}{{ada/kw|record}};
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
   -- this declaration freezes Object
   {{ada/kw|type}} Derived {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Object {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|null}} {{ada/kw|record}};
 
   -- illegal: declared after Object is frozen
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
 {{ada/kw|end}} X;

Intuitively: at the point where Derived is declared, the compiler starts a new table of primitive operations for the derived type.  This new table, initially, is equal to the table of the primitive operations of the parent type, &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.  Hence, &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; must freeze.

* the declaration of a variable of the tagged type

Example:

 {{ada/kw|package}} X {{ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{ada/kw|type}} Object {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|null}} {{ada/kw|record}};
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
   V: Object; -- this declaration freezes Object
 
   -- illegal: declared after Object is frozen
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
 {{ada/kw|end}} X;

Intuitively: after the declaration of &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, it is possible to call any of the primitive operations of the type on &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;.  Therefore, the list of primitive operations must be known and complete, i.e. frozen.

* The completion (''not'' the declaration, if any) of a constant of the tagged type:

 {{ada/kw|package}} X {{ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{ada/kw|type}} Object {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|null}} {{ada/kw|record}};
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
   -- this declaration does NOT freeze Object
   Deferred_Constant: {{ada/kw|constant}} Object;
 
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (This : {{ada/kw|in}} Object); -- OK
 
 {{ada/kw|private}}
 
   -- only the completion freezes Object
   Deferred_Constant: {{ada/kw|constant}} Object := ({{ada/kw|null}} {{ada/kw|record}});
 
   -- illegal: declared after Object is frozen
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_3 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
  {{ada/kw|end}} X;

=== New features of Ada 2005 ===

{{Ada/2005}} 

Ada 2005 adds overriding indicators, allows anonymous access types in more places and offers the object.method notation.

==== Overriding indicators ====

The new keyword {{Ada/keyword|overriding}} can be used to indicate whether an operation overrides an inherited subprogram or not. Its use is optional because of upward-compatibility with Ada 95. For example:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Object; {{Ada/comment|new in Ada 2005}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived_Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Object {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|not overriding}} {{Ada/comment|new optional keywords in Ada 2005}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Derived_Object); {{Ada/comment|new primitive operation}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive {{Ada/kw|return access}} Derived_Object;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

The compiler will check the desired behaviour.

This is a good programming practice because it avoids some nasty bugs like not overriding an inherited subprogram because the programmer spelt the identifier incorrectly, or because a new parameter is added later in the parent type.

It can also be used with abstract operations, with renamings, or when instantiating a generic subprogram:

 {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_X (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Object) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}};
  
 {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
 {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive_Y {{Ada/kw|return}} Object {{Ada/kw|renames}} Some_Other_Subprogram;
 
 {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_Z (This : {{Ada/kw|out}} Object)
       {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Generic_Procedure (Element =&gt; Integer);

==== Object.Method notation ====

We have already seen this notation:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} Object; That: {{ada/kw|in}} Boolean);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

 {{Ada/kw|with}} X;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Obj : X.Object;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Obj.Primitive (That =&gt; True); {{Ada/comment|Ada 2005 object.method notation}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

This notation is only available for primitive operations where the controlling parameter is the ''first'' parameter.

=== Abstract types ===

A tagged type can also be abstract (and thus can have abstract operations):

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} &amp;hellip;;
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} One_Class_Member      (This : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Another_Class_Member  (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Abstract_Class_Member {{Ada/kw|return}} Object  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

An abstract operation cannot have any body, so derived types are forced to override it (unless those derived types are also abstract). See next section about interfaces for more information about this.

The difference with a non-abstract tagged type is that you cannot declare any variable of this type. However, you can declare an access to it, and use it as a parameter of a class-wide operation.

=== Multiple Inheritance via Interfaces ===

{{Ada/2005|OO}}

Interfaces allow for a limited form of multiple inheritance (taken from Java). On a semantic level they are similar to an &quot;abstract tagged null record&quot; as they may have primitive operations but cannot hold any data and thus these operations cannot have a body, they are either declared {{Ada/kw|abstract}} or {{Ada/kw|null}}. ''Abstract'' means the operation has to be overridden, ''null'' means the default implementation is a null body, i.e. one that does nothing.

An interface is declared with:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_1 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Object) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}};
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_2 (This :    {{Ada/kw|out}} Object) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|null}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Printable;

You implement an {{Ada/kw|interface}} by adding it to a concrete ''class'':

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Person;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object
                   {{Ada/kw|and}} Printable.Object
    {{Ada/kw|with}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Skilled_In : Language_List;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_1   (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
    {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} New_Class_Member (This : Object; That : String);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;

As usual, all inherited abstract operations must be overridden although ''null subprograms'' ones need not.

Such a type may implement a list of interfaces (called the ''progenitors''), but can have only one ''parent''. The parent may be a concrete type or also an interface.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Parent {{Ada/kw|and}} Progenitor_1 {{Ada/kw|and}} Progenitor_2 ... {{Ada/kw|with}} ...;

=== Multiple Inheritance via Mix-in ===

Ada supports multiple inheritance of ''interfaces'' (see above), but only single inheritance of ''implementation''.  This means that a tagged type can ''implement'' multiple interfaces but can only ''extend'' a single ancestor tagged type.

This can be problematic if you want to add behavior to a type that already extends another type; for example, suppose you have

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Base {{Ada/kw|is tagged private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} Base {{Ada/kw|with private}};

and you want to make &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; controlled, i.e. add the behavior that &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; controls its initialization, assignment and finalization.  Alas you cannot write:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} Base {{Ada/kw|and}} Ada.Finalization.Controlled {{Ada/kw|with private}}; {{Ada/comment|illegal}}

since &lt;code&gt;Ada.Finalization&lt;/code&gt; for historical reasons does not define interfaces &lt;code&gt;Controlled&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Limited_Controlled&lt;/code&gt;, but abstract types.

If your base type is not limited, there is no good solution for this; you have to go back to the root of the class and make it controlled. (The reason will become obvious presently.)

For limited types however, another solutions is the use of a mix-in:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Base {{Ada/kw|is tagged limited private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived;
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing: {{Ada/kw|access}} Derived) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled {{Ada/kw|with null record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In);
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} Base {{Ada/kw|with record}}
   Mix_In: Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing =&gt; Derived'Access); {{Ada/comment|special syntax here}}
   {{Ada/comment|other components here...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end record}};

This special kind of mix-in is an object with an access discriminant that references its enclosing object (also known as ''Rosen trick'').  In the declaration of the &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; type, we initialize this discriminant with a special syntax: &lt;code&gt;Derived'Access&lt;/code&gt; really refers to an a access value to the ''current instance'' of type &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt;. Thus the access discriminant allows the mix-in to see its enclosing object and all its components; therefore it can initialize and finalize its enclosing object:

 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Enclosing: Derived {{Ada/kw|renames}} This.Enclosing.{{Ada/kw|all}};
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/comment|initialize Enclosing...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;

and similarly for &lt;code&gt;Finalize&lt;/code&gt;.

The reason why this does not work for non-limited types is the self-referentiality via the discriminant. Imagine you have two variables of such a non-limited type and assign one to the other:

 X := Y;

In an assignment statement, &lt;code&gt;Adjust&lt;/code&gt; is called only ''after'' &lt;code&gt;Finalize&lt;/code&gt; of the target &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and so cannot provide the new value of the discriminant. Thus &lt;code&gt;X.Mixin_In.Enclosing&lt;/code&gt; will inevitably reference &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;.

Now let's further extend our hierarchy:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Further {{Ada/kw|is new}} Derived {{Ada/kw|with null record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Further);
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Further);

Oops, this does not work because there are no corresponding procedures for &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt;, yet - so let's quickly add them.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Base {{Ada/kw|is tagged limited private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived;
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing: {{Ada/kw|access}} Derived) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled {{Ada/kw|with null record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In);
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} Base {{Ada/kw|with record}}
   Mix_In: Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing =&gt; Derived'Access);  {{Ada/comment|special syntax here}}
   {{Ada/comment|other components here...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|not overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Derived);  {{Ada/comment|sic, they are new}}
 {{Ada/kw|not overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Derived);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Further {{Ada/kw|is new}} Derived {{Ada/kw|with null record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Further);
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Further);

We have of course to write &lt;code&gt;not overriding&lt;/code&gt; for the procedures on &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; because there is indeed nothing they could override. The bodies are

 {{Ada/kw|not overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Derived) {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/comment|initialize Derived...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Enclosing: Derived {{Ada/kw|renames}} This.Enclosing.{{Ada/kw|all}};
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Initialize (Enclosing);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;

To our dismay, we have to learn that &lt;code&gt;Initialize/Finalize&lt;/code&gt; for objects of type &lt;code&gt;Further&lt;/code&gt; will not be called, instead those for the parent &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt;. Why?

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
   X: Further;  -- Initialize (Derived (X)) is called here
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   null;
 {{Ada/kw|end}};  -- Finalize (Derived (X)) is called here

The reason is that the mix-in defines the local object &lt;code&gt;Enclosing&lt;/code&gt; to be of type &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; in the renames-statement above.
To cure this, we have necessarily to use the dreaded redispatch (shown in different but equivalent notations):

 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Enclosing: Derived {{Ada/kw|renames}} This.Enclosing.{{Ada/kw|all}};
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Initialize (Derived'Class (Enclosing));
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Enclosing: Derived'Class {{Ada/kw|renames}} Derived'Class (This.Enclosing.{{Ada/kw|all}});
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Enclosing.Finalize;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Finalize;
 
 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
   X: Further;  -- Initialize (X) is called here
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   null;
 {{Ada/kw|end}};  -- Finalize (X) is called here

Alternatively (and presumably better still) is to write

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing: {{Ada/kw|access}} Derived'Class) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled {{Ada/kw|with null record}};

Then we automatically get redispatch and can omit the type conversions on &lt;code&gt;Enclosing&lt;/code&gt;.

== Class names ==

Both the class package and the class record need a name. In theory they may have the same name, but in practice this leads to nasty &lt;small&gt;(because of unintutive error messages)&lt;/small&gt; name clashes when you use the &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|use}}&lt;/code&gt; clause. So over time three de facto naming standards have been commonly used.

=== Classes/Class ===

The package is named by a plural noun and the record is named by the corresponding singular form.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Persons {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Persons;

This convention is the usually used in Ada's built-in libraries.

Disadvantage: Some &quot;multiples&quot; are tricky to spell, especially for those of us who aren't native English speakers.

=== Class/Object ===

The package is named after the class, the record is just named Object.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

Most [[w:Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and [[w:Interface description language|IDL]] code generators use this technique.

Disadvantage: You can't use the &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|use}}&lt;/code&gt; clause on more than one such class packages at any one time. However you can always use the &quot;type&quot; instead of the package.

=== Class/Class_Type ===

The package is named after the class, the record is postfixed with ''_Type''.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Person_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

Disadvantage: lots of ugly &quot;_Type&quot; postfixes.

== Object-Oriented Ada for C++ programmers ==

In C++, the construct

 class C {
   virtual void v();
   void w();
   static void u();
 };

is strictly equivalent to the following in Ada:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} C {{Ada/kw|is tagged null record}};
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} V (This : {{Ada/kw|in out}} C);        {{Ada/comment|primitive operation, will be inherited upon derivation}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} W (This : {{Ada/kw|in out}} C'Class);  {{Ada/comment|not primitive, will not be inherited upon derivation}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} U;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

In C++, member functions implicitly take a parameter &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; which is of type &lt;code&gt;C*&lt;/code&gt;.  In Ada, all parameters are explicit.  As a consequence, the fact that &lt;code&gt;u()&lt;/code&gt; does ''not'' take a parameter is implicit in C++ but explicit in Ada.

In C++, &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer.  In Ada, the explicit &lt;code&gt;This&lt;/code&gt; parameter does not have to be a pointer; all parameters of a tagged type are implicitly passed by reference anyway.

=== Static dispatching ===

In C++, function calls dispatch statically in the following cases:

* the target of the call is an object type
* the member function is non-virtual

For example:

 C object;
 object.v();
 object.w();

both dispatch statically.  In particular, the static dispatch for v() may be confusing; this is because object is neither a pointer nor a reference. Ada behaves exactly the same in this respect, except that Ada calls this ''static binding'' rather than ''dispatching'':

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
    Object : P.C;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Object.V; {{Ada/comment|statically bound}}
    Object.W; {{Ada/comment|statically bound}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

=== Dynamic dispatching ===

In C++, a function call dispatches dynamically if the two following conditions are met simultaneously:

* the target of the call is a pointer or a reference
* the member function is virtual.

For example:

 C* object;
 object-&gt;v(); // dynamic dispatch
 object-&gt;w(); // static, non-virtual member function
 object-&gt;u(); // illegal: static member function
 C::u(); // static dispatch

In Ada, a primitive subprogram call dispatches (dynamically) if and only if:

* the target object is of a class-wide type;

Note: In Ada vernacular, the term ''dispatching'' always means ''dynamic''.

For example:

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
    Object : P.C'Class := ...;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    P.V (Object); {{Ada/comment|dispatching}}
    P.W (Object); {{Ada/comment|statically bound: not a primitive operation}}
    P.U; {{Ada/comment|statically bound}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

As can be seen ''there is no need for access types or pointers'' to do dispatching in Ada.  In Ada, ''tagged types are always passed by-reference to subprograms'' without the need for explicit access values.

Also note that in C++, the class serves as:

* the unit of encapsulation (Ada uses packages and visibility for this)
* the type, like in Ada.

As a consequence, you call C::u() in C++ because u() is encapsulated in C, but P.U in Ada since U is encapsulated in the ''package'' P, not the ''type'' C.

=== Class-wide and specific types ===

The most confusing part for C++ programmers is the concept of a &quot;class-wide type&quot;.  To help you understand:

* pointers and references in C++ are really, implicitly, class-wide;
* object types in C++ are really specific;
* C++ provides no way to declare the equivalent of:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} C_Specific_Access {{Ada/kw|is access}} C;

* C++ provides no way to declare the equivalent of:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} C_Specific_Access_One {{Ada/kw|is access}} C;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} C_Specific_Access_Two {{Ada/kw|is access}} C;

which, in Ada, are two different, ''incompatible'' types, possibly allocating their memory from different storage pools!

* In Ada, you do ''not'' need access values for dynamic dispatching.
* In Ada, you use access values for dynamic memory management (only) and class-wide types for dynamic dispatching (only).
* In C++, you use pointers and references both for dynamic memory management and for dynamic dispatching.
* In Ada, class-wide types are explicit (with &lt;code&gt;'Class&lt;/code&gt;).
* In C++, class-wide types are implicit (with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;).

=== Constructors ===

in C++, a special syntax declares a constructor:

 class C {
    C(/* optional parameters */); // constructor
 };

A constructor cannot be virtual.  A class can have as many constructors, differentiated by their parameters, as necessary.

Ada does not have such constructors. Perhaps they were not deemed necessary since in Ada, any function that returns an object of the tagged type can serve as a kind of constructor. This is however not the same as a real constructor like the C++ one; this difference is most striking in cases of derivation trees (see Finalization below). The Ada constructor subprograms do not have to have a special name and there can be as many constructors as necessary; each function can take parameters as appropriate.

 {{ada/kw|package}} P {{ada/kw|is}}
   {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|private}};
   {{ada/kw|function}} Make                 {{ada/kw|return}} T;  -- constructor
   {{ada/kw|function}} To_T (From: Integer) {{ada/kw|return}} T;  -- another constructor
   -- procedure Make (This: out T);         -- not a constructor
 {{ada/kw|private}}
   ...
 {{ada/kw|end}} P;

If an Ada constructor function is also a primitive operation (as in the example above), it becomes abstract upon derivation and has to be overridden if the derived type is not itself abstract. If you do not want this, declare such functions in a nested scope.

In C++, one idiom is the ''copy constructor'' and its cousin the ''assignment operator'':

 class C {
    C(const C&amp; that); // copies &quot;that&quot; into &quot;this&quot;
    C&amp; operator= (const C&amp; right); // assigns &quot;right&quot; to &quot;this&quot;, which is &quot;left&quot;
 };

This copy constructor is invoked implicitly on initialization, e.g.

 C a = b; // calls the copy constructor
 C c;
 a = c;   // calls the assignment operator

Ada provides a similar functionality by means of ''controlled types''.  A controlled type is one that extends the predefined type &lt;code&gt;Ada.Finalization.Controlled&lt;/code&gt;:

 {{ada/kw|with}} Ada.Finalization;
 {{ada/kw|package}} P {{ada/kw|is}}
   {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Controlled {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|private}};
   {{ada/kw|function}} Make {{ada/kw|return}} T;  -- constructor
 {{ada/kw|private}}
   {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} ... {{ada/kw|end}} {{ada/kw|record}};
   {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Initialize (This: {{ada/kw|in}} {{ada/kw|out}} T);
   {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Adjust     (This: {{ada/kw|in}} {{ada/kw|out}} T); -- copy contructor
 {{ada/kw|end}} P;

Note that Initialize is not a constructor; it resembles the C++ constructor in some way, but is also very different. Suppose you have a type T1 derived from T with an appropriate overriding of Initialize. A real constructor (like the C++ one) would automatically first construct the parent components (T), then the child components. In Ada, this is not automatic. In order to mimic this in Ada, we have to write:

 {{ada/kw|procedure}} Initialize (This: {{ada/kw|in}} {{ada/kw|out}} T1) {{ada/kw|is}}
 {{ada/kw|begin}}
   Initialize (T (This));  -- Don't forget this part!
   ...  -- handle the new components here
 {{ada/kw|end}} Initialize;

The compiler inserts a call to Initialize after each object of type T is allocated when no initial value is given. It also inserts a call to Adjust after each assignment to the object.  Thus, the declarations:

 A: T;
 B: T := X;

will:

* allocate memory for A
* call Initialize (A)
* allocate memory for B
* copy the contents of X to B
* call Adjust (B)

Initialize (B) will not be called because of the explicit initialization.

So, the equivalent of a copy constructor is an overriding of Adjust.

If you would like to provide this functionality to a type that extends another, non-controlled type, see [[#Multiple_Inheritance|&quot;Multiple Inheritance&quot;]].

=== Destructors ===

In C++, a destructor is a member function with only the implicit &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; parameter:

 class C {
    virtual ~C(); // destructor
 }

While a constructor ''cannot'' be virtual, a destructor ''must'' be virtual.  Unfortunately, the rules of the C++ language do not enforce this, so it is quite easy for a programmer to wreak havoc in their programs by simply forgetting the keyword &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt;.

In Ada, the equivalent functionality is again provided by controlled types, by overriding the procedure Finalize:

 {{ada/kw|with}} Ada.Finalization;
 {{ada/kw|package}} P {{ada/kw|is}}
    {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Controlled {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|private}};
    {{ada/kw|function}} Make {{ada/kw|return}} T;  -- constructor
 {{ada/kw|private}}
    {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} ... {{ada/kw|end}} {{ada/kw|record}};
    {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Finalize (This: {{ada/kw|in}} {{ada/kw|out}} T);  -- destructor
 {{ada/kw|end}} P;

Because Finalize is a primitive operation, it is automatically &quot;virtual&quot;; you cannot, in Ada, forget to make a destructor virtual.

=== Encapsulation: public, private and protected members ===

In C++, the unit of encapsulation is the class; in Ada, the unit of encapsulation is the package.  This has consequences on how an Ada programmer places the various components of an object type.

 class C {
 public:
    int a;
    void public_proc();
 protected:
    int b;
    int protected_func();
 private:
    bool c;
    void private_proc();
 };

A way to mimic this C++ class in Ada is to define a hierarchy of types, where the base type is the public part, which must be abstract so that no stand-alone objects of this base type can be defined. It looks like so:

 {{Ada/kw|private}} {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Finalization;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} CPP {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Public_Part {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|record}}  -- no objects of this type
     A: Integer;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Public_Proc (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Public_Part);
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Complete_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Public_Part {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 
   -- procedure Public_Proc (This: in out Complete_Type);  -- inherited, implicitly defined
 
 {{Ada/kw|private}}  -- visible for children
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Part;  -- declaration stub
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Part_Pointer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Private_Part;
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Component {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Controlled {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
     P: Private_Part_Pointer;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} record;
 
   {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Initialize (X: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Private_Component);
   {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Adjust     (X: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Private_Component);
   {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Finalize   (X: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Private_Component);
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Complete_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Public_Part {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
     B: Integer;
     P: Private_Component;  -- must be controlled to avoid storage leaks
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
   {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Protected_Proc (This: Complete_Type);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} CPP;

The private part is defined as a stub only, its completion is hidden in the body. In order to make it a component of the complete type, we have to use a pointer since the size of the component is still unknown (the size of a pointer is known to the compiler). With pointers, unfortunately, we incur the danger of memory leaks, so we have to make the private component controlled.

For a little test, this is the body, where the subprogram bodies are provided with identifying prints:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation;
 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} CPP {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Public_Proc (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Public_Part) {{Ada/kw|is}}  -- primitive

     X.P := new Private_Part'(C =&gt; True);

   {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;

   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Finalize &quot; &amp; Boolean'Image (X.P.C));
     Free (X.P);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Finalize;
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Private_Proc (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Complete_Type) {{Ada/kw|is}}  -- not primitive
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Private_Proc&quot; &amp; Integer'Image (This.A) &amp; Integer'Image (This.B) &amp; ' ' &amp; Boolean'Image (This.P.P.C));
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Private_Proc;
 
   {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Protected_Proc (This: Complete_Type) {{Ada/kw|is}}  -- primitive

     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Protected_Proc&quot; &amp; Integer'Image (This.A) &amp; Integer'Image (This.B));
     Private_Proc (X);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Protected_Proc;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} CPP;

We see that, due to the construction, the private procedure is not a primitive operation.

Let's define a child class so that the protected operation can be reached:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} CPP.Child {{Ada/kw|is}} 
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Do_It (X: Complete_Type);  -- not primitive
  
 {{Ada/kw|end}} CPP.Child;

A child can look inside the private part of the parent and thus can see the protected procedure:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} CPP.Child {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Do_It (X: Complete_Type) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Do_It&quot; &amp; Integer'Image (X.A) &amp; Integer'Image (X.B));
     Protected_Proc (X);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Do_It;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} CPP.Child;

This is a simple test program, its output is shown below.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} CPP.Child;
 {{Ada/kw|use}}  CPP.Child, CPP;
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Test_CPP {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   X, Y: Complete_Type;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   X.A := +1;
   Y.A := -1;
 
   Public_Proc (X);  Do_It (X);
   Public_Proc (Y);  Do_It (Y);
 
   X := Y;
 
   Public_Proc (X);  Do_It (X);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Test_CPP;

This is the commented output of the test program:

 Finalize TRUE                            and X

You see that a direct translation of the C++ behaviour into Ada is difficult, if feasible at all. Methinks, the primitive Ada subprograms corresponds more to virtual C++ methods (in the example, they are not). Each language has its own idiosyncrasies which have to be taken into account, so that attempts to directly translate code from one into the other may not be the best approach.

=== De-encapsulation: friends and stream input-output ===

In C++, a friend function or class can see all members of the class it is a friend of.
Friends break encapsulation and are therefore to be discouraged.
In Ada, since packages and not classes are the unit of encapsulation, a &quot;friend&quot; subprogram is simply one that is declared in the same package as the tagged type.

In C++, stream input and output are the particular case where friends are usually necessary:

 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 class C {
 public:
    C();
    friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; output, C&amp; arg);
 private:
    int a, b;
    bool c;
 };

 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 int main() {
    C object;
    cout &lt;&lt; object;
    return 0;
 };

Ada does not need this construct because it defines stream input and output operations by default:

 package P is
    pragma Elaborate_Body; -- explained below
    type C is tagged private;
 private
    type C is tagged record
       A, B : Integer;
       C : Boolean;
    end record;
 end P;

 with Ada.Text_IO.Text_Streams;
 with P;
 procedure Main is
    Object : P.C;
 begin
    P.C'Output (Stream =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Text_Streams.Stream (Ada.Text_IO.Default_Output),
                Item =&gt; Object);
 end Main;

By default, the &lt;code&gt;Output&lt;code&gt; attribute sends the tag of the object to the stream then calls the more basic &lt;code&gt;Write&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which sends the components to the stream in the same order as the declaration, i.e. A, B then C.  It is possible to override the default implementation of the &lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Write&lt;/code&gt; attributes like this:

 with Ada.Streams;
 package body P is
    procedure My_Write (Stream : not null access Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class;
                        Item : in C) is
    begin
       -- The default is to write A then B then C; here we change the ordering.
       Boolean'Write (Stream, Item.C);
       Integer'Write (Stream, Item.B);
       Integer'Write (Stream, Item.A);
    end My_Write;
 
    for C'Write use My_Write; -- override the default attribute
 end P;

In the above example, &lt;code&gt;P.C'output&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;P.C'Write&lt;/code&gt; which is overridden in the body of the package.  Since the specification of package &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; does not define any subprograms, it does not normally need a body, so a package body is forbidden.  The &lt;code&gt;pragma Elaborate_Body&lt;/code&gt; tells the compiler that this package does have a body that is needed for other reasons.

Note that the stream IO attributes are not primitive operations of the tagged type; this is also the case in C++ where the friend operators are not, in fact, member functions of the type.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now it is not expected that you'll be able to pronounce Quechua correctly just from reading the last lesson, however as you complete the next lessons it is suggested that you keep going back to the first lesson as a reference. This will hopefully help you internalise the rules.

== Conversation ==
Following is a possible basic conversation in Quechua:

: ''Antuku:'' Yaw! Wawqiy! Mayman richkanki?
: ''Joe:'' Wasiyman richkani.  Qanri?
: ''Antuku:'' Qhatuman richkani. Tupananchiskama!
: ''Joe:'' Ratukama.

Translation:

: ''Antuku:'' Hey! Brother!  Where are (you) going?
: ''Joe:'' (I) am going to my house.  And you?
: ''Antuku:'' (I) am going to the market.  'Till we meet again!
: ''Joe:'' See you later.

== Grammar ==
As you can see in the conversation, the verb form &quot;richka'''nki'''&quot; is for second-person singular and &quot;richka'''ni'''&quot; for first-person.

Here we will give an overview of all persons (yachachiy = to teach)

These are the personal pronouns.

I'm a software engineer who thinks that Wikibooks has a huge potential to do some good in this world.  There are a few thing that I know about that are not in &quot;common&quot; knowledge, and I intend to write some wikibooks to help people out that are trying to learn these subjects.

*[[/New Policies|Here are some opinions]] that I have regarding what some basic policies for Wikibooks ought to be like.
*[[/Sandbox|A little area]] I am using to experiment with various editing styles and minor projects.
*[[/Whole Book|An entire Wikibook at once]]  '''WARNING:''' this Wikibook takes a very long time to load on most browsers.
*[[/Watch List|Watch List]] - This is a list of Wikibooks that need some special attention.
*[[/Bookshelf Reorganization/]] - This is more my vision on how the bookshelves ought to be revised.  Feel free to discuss and rearrange as necessary, but this is only a proposal at the moment.

Because sometimes the stuff I write is quite POV, and perhaps heated, I've started a new blog about the open source textbook movement.  If you are interested in reading some of my opinions, please check it out here:

http://bookcraft.blogspot.com/

As this site is definitely not owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, it would be harder to remove content from this blog by the WMF or its board of trustees.  Still, I intend to mainly concentrate on Wikibooks and general open textbook issues with this forum.  If you want to join the &quot;team&quot; of fellow bloggers to add a post to this blog, please let me know.


Some Wikibooks that I'm currently working on:

*[[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] (something I've started)
*[[Wikijunior Solar System]]
*[[MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook]]
*[[AP Computer Science]]
*[[Wikibooks:State of the Project/2006]]
*[[History of Wikibooks]]
*[[GBA Development]]
*[[Scratch]]
*[[Colors]]

Here are some tools that I find useful:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Over the course of a turtle’s nesting season, a female sea turtle will leave her homing ground and migrate to nesting grounds to build a nest and lay eggs.  One species of turtle, ''Chelonia mydas'', the Green sea turtle, lives off the coasts of [[w:Brazil|Brazil]] but nests each year on the beaches of Ascension Island, a tiny island in the mid-Atlantic Ocean (Papi et al.).  These turtles typically make their way to the island between the months of December and March (Sims).

After migrating to a nesting ground, it is time for the female to choose a nesting site along the beach.  Many factors play into this decision and a female will scope out a site for a few days before she actually decides to build a nest.  However, once the decision of where to nest has been made, females will most likely nest at the same beach and site for the rest of their reproductive years (CCC&amp;STSL).

All species of sea turtles exhibit similar nesting behavior, possibly differing only in inter-nesting period length (the period of time between two nestings during the same nesting season).  On the night of nesting, a sea turtle will emerge from the sea and scope out her surroundings one more time before digging a nest.  If there seems to be any unnatural distractions (i.e. lighting or human presence), a female may return to the sea without building a nest (“false crawl”).  Most often, however, she will proceed to dig a nest on the beach.  To do this, the female turtle first digs a relatively shallow depression, known as a body pit, in the sand using her front flippers and body to push sand out of the way.  Then she will excavate a single egg chamber, a deeper cavity opening to the body pit, into which she will oviposit an entire clutch of eggs during nesting.  Finally, after constructing this egg chamber, she will begin ovipositing her eggs.  It is extremely rare that a sea turtle will stop nesting before laying is complete but will happen if the female senses extreme danger (CCC&amp;STSL).

After laying eggs, the female will camouflage her nest by filling in the body pit with sand and return to the sea only to nest at the same site at a later date in the nesting season.  After nesting a second time, the female sea turtle will return to the sea and migrate back to her homing ground (CCC&amp;STSL).

Many nesting grounds, such as that of the Green sea turtle, are extremely far from the species’ homing ground.  This migration of sea turtles during the nesting season has led to the development of many different hypotheses of ''how'' these adult female turtles continually find the common nesting ground and then how offspring navigate to the homing grounds.  First, it has been suggested that sea turtles may use the earth’s magnetic field to aid in navigation between homing grounds and nesting grounds.  There have, however, been experiments that have weakened this hypothesis in adult sea turtles.  One such experiment involved placing magnets on the back of experimental Green sea turtles in order to disrupt the magnetic field possibly detected by the sea turtles and the courses these turtles followed on the return journey from Ascension Island were tracked.  The results show that, although hatchlings may be able to navigate via earth’s magnetic field, it is very possible that this ability is absent in adults (Papi et al.).  However, another hypothesis has been suggested and states that turtles may use olfactory cues from the ocean currents and winds to navigate through the ocean to nesting grounds (Sims).

==California standards discussion==

Narythegreat,

Do you know what happened to the California standards that were up on the site? We have a bunch of professionals who will donate their work to the page if we use the California standards that were up originally. Can you help me find them and put them back up on the page? The person who started the page originally did so with that set of standards, then went off to get professional volunteers. Now that he has the volunteers, the standards are changed and he is understandable upset. We could maybe make two paralell projects, one using the originally specified California standard and another using the AP standard. What do you think. Can you help me out finding the California standard and getting it back online?

Thanks friend,
--[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:16, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)Karl


Narythegreat,

I found the California standards and reinstated them. Please do not be angry with me. I appreciate of course your efforts. I notice that you moved some of the pages from &quot;World History Project&quot; namespaces to &quot;World History&quot; namespaces. What do you think if you develop your contributions in a paralell space that uses the AP standards and uses the namespace of &quot;World History&quot;, and we reserve the &quot;World History Project&quot; namespace for the project that uses the California standards. What do you think of the idea? Assuming you come to be in aggreement ... my time to be on the Internet is very limited; would ou be willing and able to help me divide the work into two? 

Thank you kind person, --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 22:03, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Some quotes from the email they sent me: &quot;We'd been setting up the possibility of having a bunch of World History experts contribute to the California-frameworks-based World History project, gratis. ... I was very disturbed to hear that they had been to the Wiki site and seen the California Standards project that we had discussed replaced by something called the 'AP World History Standard'. These are now deciding to beg off the project!&quot; I hope you can understand where I am coming from on this ... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 22:10, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)

==California Standards==
Okay, here I go:

1.  I really have to say I'm not a fan of changing back the standards.  The California standard isn't very good.  The AP standard is approved by a much broader range of people.  The use of the California standard is a problem regionally also because newbies will think it's a regional project.  I don't mean to discourage contribution, but the AP standard is used elsewhere, such as in the European and U.S. history projects with success (also I changed the project out of the title for simplicity and I kind of kept the other ones as a kind of guiding hand -- see [[World History]], but honestly, I don't care if the project part is eliminated altogether).  And  furthermore, if there are so many willing contributors, where are they?  You are wasting my time by saying that these experts won't contribute under the AP World History standard (which I made the title up but it is the standard for AP World History) and anyway, ''what kind of &quot;experts&quot; don't know what AP is?  

2.  There have been no edits for almost 4 months by anyone but me.  It is ridiculous to demand that I bow to the demands of people who do not put forth any contribution for so long.  I will not simply start again from scratch.  I kept most the original articles and structure anyway, just changed the standard, and the California one isn't very good.  It's an overly simplistic and western-centered one.

3. I will be very surprised if we go with the California standard and  we see these &quot;expert's&quot; contributions pan out-you of all people must see that people lose focus after a while and abandon projects, like this one's former contributors.  I doubt very highly that you will see anyone doing anything substantial for free after such a reversion. (And also, anyone can just copy and paste their research paper into the project anyway).  I am avidly adding free material, and I welcome help, but what on earth is wrong with the AP standard anyway?  I don't know a soul who after even a casual glance at both would support the California (standard).  Also, since Wikibooks is so limited in its contributors anyway, we need to be accepting of other peoples ideas, and honestly the standards thing amounts to a bunch of bull anyway.  People are going to add what they want and ignore such things in the first place.  Very few of our projects have standards anyway.

4.  As for the parallel namespaces idea, there seems to be little point in such a duplication of effort and I oppose it even if I have to bow to these peoples' (whoever they are, it is not clear to me) wishes.  Also, I did come back and add to this comment, so I hope we don't cause misunderstandings with each other, and I apologize for the sloppy structure.  Yours, kindly--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 03:10, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Also, you'll note that I changed the standards on November 14, and actually it was a week before that, so you'll see that it took over a month for any of these &quot;contributors&quot; to notice the change anyway :(.  I hope you weigh this fact in your opinion of the merit of the statement that these people are just enthusiastically waiting to contribute.  My personal opinion is that it is a lie designed to get you on the side of reverting the standards, but I may be making a big error in judgement.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 03:29, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Narythegreat, of course I understand that you are upset. Please try to overcome your emotion and remain polite, as I am sure that we can come to a conclusion that is convenient to everyone involved. Thankfully the wiki system makes reverts and changes relatively painless ... One of the first people to offer his help to the Wikibooks project is someone who has worked in the textbook industry for almost twenty years and has started his own not-for-profit with the goal of bringing open-content textbooks to the community, beginning in his native California. He in fact aggrees with you that the AP standards are superior, but as the person who originally started the World History Project as a trial is understandably upset to feel that other people have come in and taken over the project and changed the rules that were governing it.

I don't accuse you of breaking any rule, of course you put up notice of the proposed change of standards and gave time for any objectives to be brought forward, and neither he nor I objected at the time. I didn't know what he had in mind and I am living in Mexico right now with limited Internet access and am less active on the site for the moment. 

What I am asking is for your understanding and help to divide the project into two distinct books, one that follows the line that this individual started, and another that follows the direction and the edits that you have contributed.

For the moment I have to act as the representative for this person, who is on the verge of leaving Wikibooks/Wikipedia permanently and advising all of his many high-level contacts of the very negative experience he has had trying to get a textbook together on Wikibooks. This would be a big blow to Wikibooks and I believe to open source textbooks in general. 

All he wants is a place for his team of paid, professional textbook-writing history experts to continue the stub of a book that was begun on the World History Project page time back. At the moment these people were so enraged at the abandonment of the original standard that they refuse to continue with the project. I hope to negotiate with them to convince them to continue.

Narythegreat, I need your help. You have the power in your hands to help make this project and the whole site a greater success that will be used in actual classrooms, or to make things more difficult and set the whole site back. You of course are free to choose your course of action. And helping me does not mean that any of your changes have to be lost, because my plan is to make two books, one for each standard.

Please let me know what you think.
Karl

===California vs AP standard===
Having taken both AP and regular California history classes, AP standards cover considerably more than what is required by the California standard.  For that reason, I support the AP standard.  I, however, don't understand how can both standards not overlap at least 75% of the way.  If there some parts that do not overlap, we should try to meet both standards.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 03:43, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== a bit lost ==

Hi, My name is James and I'm registered as totalthinker on normal wikipedia. I think this project is really exciting and would like to take part, time permitting. However, I would like to add a few constructive comments;

1. I'm British and have never heard of Californias or AP's; if this site is for lots of people worldwide then this terminology is a bit restrictive and confusing, although I whink using such a course as a foundation guide is a good idea. Just don't include these names as foundational, or if you do then rename the course; &quot;World History AP guide&quot;.

2. The contents summary is a bit cluttered and vague at points, for example combining medieval european and middle eastern cultures etc.

3. A very good site is HyperHistory which has a good but quite partisan history of the world; could provide some guidance.

4. The best overall intro to all this I have read was w.h. Mvneill's &quot;The rise of the West&quot;. Don't be put off by the title! This book is simply excellent. I think it should be our guide/model.

Thanks, hope it helps.

James

--[[User:Firebird000|Firebird000]] 03:25, 26 August 2005 (UTC)== Helping with World History book ==

Hi.  I just wanted to say that I'm glad you helped save the world history book.  It's definetly something I'd like to help with.  I'm not a history fanatic so I can't write essays on it, but I'd definetly would like to help with content and some graphics work. Definetly worth it.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 10:07, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Sure I'm helping.  Just point me in a direction right now.  I'm sure I can do that great a job right now, as I am busy with some other projects, but I should still be able to make a contribution.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 10:16, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I'll be proofreading mostly and I'll see what I can contribute.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 01:17, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I'll help out a bit.  I'm a world history buff, so I'm good with most things.  I wrote the Middle Eastern empires section (as of now, at least) so I did that.  I have pretty good all-around knowledge.  I could be an essayist or something, as well as continue working on chapters and what-not.--[[User:Constantijn|Constantijn]] 16:14, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Hi. I'm a former AP World History student myself, and I took the AP exam. I'd be happy to help write for the textbook. I already added an appendix on preping for the exam.
--[[User:Firebird000|Firebird000]] 03:25, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

== Nice job, and a suggestion ==

Hi there Naryathegreat. Great job you've done so far. It's a crying shame that this sort of project hasn't exploded, as it rightly should. If I could just make a couple of point

1. I would like to second the opinion offered above - I have never heard of either 'standard' or whatever pedants wish to call them. These 'professionals' clearly do not understand the meaning of Wikibooks as an open system, with communally decided standards etc. I would recommend a fairly loose system based around a constantly evolving and perfecting set of rules, as users discover errors, potential bias or faults and suchlike. I see the current set of standards as fairly good overall. If the individuals commented on above are so unbending, they are unlikely to be suited to the discussive method of editing that goes on around here!

2. This is ONLY a suggestion. Have you considered contacting individuals from Wikipedia who have written authoratative articles on topics such as History/World history/Ancient history/Modern history and so on? This could provide a method of crossover and crosslinking the two sites, and utilising the resources of both. Currently Wikibooks (mostly) is not sufficiently authoritative and peer-reviewed to be useful to Wikipedia, but the opposite could certainly provide the explosive growth you say you need and expect! If I were an historian, I would be very willing to commit myself to this project.

3. When the Project becomes large enough, it may be necessary to define certain areas necessary for various syllabii. Why not create a system of markers that can be added to the content, or even colour coding. If this book does start to grow rapidly, individuals will doubtless add content entirely surplus to the requirements of whichever standard is predominant.

Thanks --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 18:41, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC) (soon to be member Mark Lewis)

== C++ Top Note ==

Oi Naryathegreat, just to explain you why I reverted your change on Prog.:C++

Sorry about it, but I do think that the box is really not needed as there is no real need to call attention to the wikibooks limitations :).
The name of the page it is not yet set into stone, (that is why I used the spaces in the name) as you may know this is a fork from a prev. book also on wikibooks so the original name was taken and there shouldn´t be 2 books on the same subject so untill I solve the problem (by restructuring the work, merge etc... there is no solution for it).

{{wrongtitle|title=Programming:C++ (2)}}

Can you make a humm template, macro (cant remember the wiki name, or show me how, links
etc...) with no box and a merge of the structure of what you did and I
used so there is no loss of information (like that the limitation is due
to Wikibooks, that will provide more info if the work is accessed outside of the wikiworld, without the use of the box the size of the line doesn't
have so much importance, just the information provided by the notice),
txs

{{:Programming:_C_-/-_-/-_TopNote}}

PS: If you did not agree with my opinion, please move this post to the Talk section of the book, so we will debate and try to get more input on it, txs again

PPS: Herrr, rembered that I could look up what you did, so now I can TEMPLATE also :), I didn't change it (the template) before talking to you, did you use it on more books (that can be a problem, we can end up with lots of templates in place of local rewrites of the same wording) ?

Hello Narya!

I have been perusing your wikibook for the last few weeks and have noticed that you are in need of assistance.  I am a California Public High School Student enrolled in AP World and AP US History over two years and have recieved a 5 on both exams.  I also tutor other students in both subjects.  I was wondering if I could have the opportunity to join your staff as I love to contribute to others' understanding of this fabulous subject.  Thank you!

== Wish to Join World History ==

Hello. I was looking around at World History and I decided that it is a project that I would like to get involved in. I am a college student who happens to like history and World History is what I am currently studying. 

If you have no objections, I would like to start filling in Europe in the Middle Ages. Any suggestions you might have would, of course, be welcome. 

I look forward to working together.

==Maps World History==
I'd be glad to help with the maps on you World History Book. I've added a few recently. ([[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 15:22, 20 May 2008 (UTC))

== Joining world history ==

Hello, I'm very interested in the work being done to the history books, and I would love to join the team. I am currently studying world history, and hope to contribute as much as possible. If you don't have any objections, I would like to start adding content about the Ancient Middle East. Thanks!

==[[Saylor.org's Ancient Civilizations of the World]]==

Hi there, I noticed that you have made most of the contributions to the World History textbook. I'm currently working with the Saylor Foundation to create a textbook on ancient civilizations that we can host and use for our course on our website (which we offer for free and to anybody online). If you have time, we would love for you to check out [[Saylor.org's Ancient Civilizations of the World]] and give us some feedback or make some contributions! --[[User:Azin|Azin]] ([[User talk:Azin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Azin|contribs]]) 21:41, 6 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;BIG&gt; Text Output &lt;/BIG&gt;

==Print==
The text output command is PRINT. This is the command that we will be exploring through this section. PRINT takes a series of arguments. What that means is that in QBasic, after typing PRINT (note, for a short cut, just type a question mark '?') a programmer types the things he wants displayed and PRINT will display them. The first program will display the words &quot;Hello World&quot; on the screen.

PRINT [Text to screen]

==1HELLO.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 PRINT &quot;Hello World&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Understanding 1HELLO.BAS==
First, copy everything (in this case, one line, but later programs will be much longer) into a text editor or into QBasic itself and save it as '1HELLO.BAS'. Next open it in QBasic (if you are not already there) and press F5. This will run the program. A black screen with the words &quot;Hello World&quot; in white on your left hand side of the screen should appear. This is your first QBasic program. Now, Press F5 again. Now there should be 2 lines saying &quot;Hello World&quot;. This is because QBasic does not clear the screen every time a program is run. To change this we will use the command '''CLS''', which stands for '''CL'''ear '''S'''creen. We will be looking at some other new concepts in the next program as well.

==2HELLO.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 PRINT &quot;This line will be erased&quot;
 CLS
 PRINT &quot;Hello&quot;;
 PRINT &quot; World&quot;,
 PRINT &quot;Hello Jupiter&quot;
 PRINT &quot;Good Bye&quot;,,&quot;For&quot;;&quot; Now&quot;
 PRINT 1,2,3,4,5
&lt;/source&gt;

==Commas and Semicolons in PRINT and CLS==
Here is what the program output should look like:
&lt;source lang=text&gt;
Hello World   Hello Jupiter
Good Bye                    For Now
 1             2             3              4              5
&lt;/source&gt;
Addressing 2HELLO.BAS in line order, the first line prints &quot;This line will be erased.&quot; to the screen, but in the second line, the CLS command clears the screen immediately after, so it will not be seen (technically it flashes at the bottom form columns). &quot;Hello Jupiter&quot; should line up with '2' at the bottom. More than one comma can be used in a row. In this example, after &quot;Good Bye&quot; two commas are used to move &quot;For Now&quot; over two tab columns. &quot;For Now&quot; should line up with '3'.

My final statement on this topic is to play around with it. Try using commas and semicolons in a program.

==3HELLO.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 hello$ = &quot;Hello World&quot;
 number = 12
 PRINT hello$, number
&lt;/source&gt;

==Variables==
Variables are used to store information. They are like containers. You can put information in them and later change the information to something else. In this first example they may not seem very useful but in the next section (Input) they will become very useful.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
In this example we use two types of variables - string variables and numeric variables. A string variable holds words, a string of characters (a character is a number, letter or symbol). In this case the characters are letters. A string variable is denoted by ending the name of the variable with a dollar sign. The string variable in this program is hello$. What ever you set hello$ equal to will be displayed in the PRINT statement. The numeric variable is number. Numeric variables do not have a special ending like string variables.
&lt;br&gt;

==4FACE.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 LOCATE 14, 34     'position the left eye
 PRINT &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;       'draw the left eye
 LOCATE 14, 43     'position the right eye
 PRINT &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;       'draw the right eye
 LOCATE 16, 39     'position the nose
 PRINT &quot;o|o&quot;       'draw the nose
 LOCATE 18, 36     'position the mouth
 PRINT &quot;\_______/&quot; 'draw the mouth
 LOCATE 19, 42     'the bottom
 PRINT &quot;The Face by QBasic&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Locate statement==
Locate allows you to position the cursor for the next piece of text output. Contrary to cartesian coordinates which read (X,Y), the locate statement is LOCATE Y,X. In this case Y is the distance down from the top of the screen and X is the distance from the left side of the screen. The reason that LOCATE does not follow the standard coordinate system is that it is not necessary to include the X portion, you can use the format LOCATE Y which just specifies the line to start on.

==5FACE.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS

 LOCATE 14, 34
 COLOR 9
 PRINT &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;

 LOCATE 14, 43
 PRINT &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;

 COLOR 11
 LOCATE 16, 39
 PRINT &quot;o|o&quot;

 COLOR 4
 LOCATE 18, 36
 PRINT &quot;\_______/&quot;

 COLOR 20
 LOCATE 19, 42
 PRINT &quot;U&quot;

 LOCATE 1, 1
 COLOR 16, 1
 PRINT &quot;Hello World&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Colors==
The program 5FACE.BAS is broken into sections to make it easier to read. This is an example of a good programming habit. Each three line piece of code each piece of code specifies what color it's part of the face should be, where it should be and what it should look like. The order of the position and the color is unimportant. The new statement COLOR allows you to change the color of the text. Once changed, all output will be in the new color until COLOR or CLS is used. The format for the COLOR statement is:&lt;br&gt;
COLOR [foreground]&lt;br&gt;
or&lt;br&gt;
COLOR [foreground],[background]&lt;br&gt;
The colors are designated by numbers which will be discussed in the next section.

==Color by Number==
There are 16 colors, numbered from 0 to 15.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|0  || Black              ||8  || Dark  Grey (Light Black)
|-
|1  || Blue               ||9  || Light Blue
|-
|2  || Green              ||10 || Light Green
|-
|3  || Cyan               ||11 || Light Cyan
|-
|4  || Red                ||12 || Light Red
|-
|5  || Purple             ||13 || Light Purple
|-
|6  || Brown/Orange       ||14 || Yellow   (Light Orange)
|-
|7  || Light Grey (White) ||15 || White    (Light White)  
|}

If you look carefully at this chart you can see that there are 8 main colors (0 through 7) and then those colors repeat, each in a lighter shade.  You may also notice that the colours act as a combination of binary values (where blue=1, green=2, red=4, etc.)  This makes it much easier to memorize the color scheme. Blinking colors are also available: at 16, the colors start over again with blinking black and extend through 31 (blinking white). However, the blinking option is not available for the background, only for the text (foreground).

It is possible to switch the blinking foreground text with an intense background, but this task is beyond the scope of the QBasic textbook, and may not work when Windows displays the console in windowed mode.

==Summary==
In this section we looked at several methods to manipulate output. All centered around the PRINT statement. LOCATE and COLOR modified where the text was displayed and how it looked. We used CLS to clear the screen. There was also a basic introduction to variables which will be expanded upon in later sections.

So, you've read the tutorials on how to model, or you've used Blender before... Cool. Now what?
You've created a nice model, you know how to animate it, but you want your textures in a way that Blender won't let you use by default.

Well, don't despair. Blender's not out of resources for you just yet.

I'll take a simple model, and I'll assume you know how to set the camera, render settings to default and add an object.

I'm going to create a simple representation of our planet Earth. Images for that can be found on the web, and there's a finished blender file ready linked at the bottom of this tutorial which has the textures packed in it.

First you get rid of the cube from the default scene. Keep the light and the camera as is. 
Next add a sphere, go back to object mode and add an empty from the add menu (screenshot below).

[[Image:Add_empty.jpg]]

Once you added it, you want to add a material to the sphere. Look at another page on how to do that. Once you have the material added, add a texture to the material. Once added, select the type, image.

[[Image:Select_image.jpg]]

Load the image (in this case the image is packed within the example blender file) as the texture. Use whatever options you want for the image to appear correct in the preview window.

Once the texture applies to the material, go back to the materials tab (red sphere).
There, look for the Map Input tab, and open it.
Select Object, and enter the name of the empty object. In this case it will be &quot;Empty&quot; (it is case sensitive, so watch out).

[[Image:Object_input.jpg]]

Now try and animate a rotation on the empty, say 360 degrees in 360 frames. (See another tutorial to learn how to do that). Don't move the sphere, and render the animation.

TADA! The earth seems to rotate, but the object doesn't...
Now parent the empty to the sphere, so that when you grab the sphere you don't forget to move the empty accordingly. (alt-p after selecting first the empty then the sphere).
You can now create really cool animations, where the earth rotates around the sun and on itself, but you only need to worry about the revolution of the earth, not its own rotation.
I haven't done that part of the animation, but give it a try, and admire your skills at making earth go round around the sun... Or not!

All materials in this tutorial are just applied to a simple sphere in order to easily show the effect the textures have and don't have to worry about how the textures are applied for the most part. For a more complex object you will likely have to worry about uv mapping which is not covered in this tutorial. For more information on uv mapping look at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/UV Map Basics|UV Map Basics]]
	
To start select the sphere and bring up the materials panel 
(can be found by pressing F5 or the icon in the button bar).
It should look like this

[[Image:Blender3D_materials_and_textures_panel_button.png]]
[[Image:Blender3D_materials_panel_button.png]]
[[Image:mat-screen.png]]
	
Hit ''Add New'' to add a new material that will be associated with that object.  Once you are looking at the material you will notice under the ''Texture'' panel eight blank buttons. These are your texture slots. This means you can have 8 textures mapped to vary properties of your material. From Blender 2.36, you can use 10 slots. These slots are processed in sequence. Which means that if you have a texture that will be computed (for example, an environment map), and you have several texture slots used, you should put the computed slot at the end. A texture describes a design, either an image or one of blender's various different texture types.
	
[[Image:mat-tex-slots.png]]
	
First thing is to add a texture to the material.  Do this by selecting one of the blank texture slots and hit ''Add New'' button just to the right. The material now has a texture associated with it, you now have to describe that texture. Do this by selecting 
the brown brick like button on the header or by pressing F6. You will see the same texture slot list with the texture you have already added. From here you can change the various texture types. Basically just play with the various options and you can see the results for something you like. I am not going to cover how each one looks, its easy to figure out via experimentation by changing texture and modifying its parameters and watching the preview. You can apply images (from files) using the images texture type. Most serious 3D modelers have a large collection of textures.  
	
Now I will talk about what you can apply textures for. Go back to the material buttons (F5). Then bring up the ''Map To'' panel. Here is a screen shot of what you should be seeing.

[[Image:mat-tex-slots2.jpg]]
	
The top row of buttons you see there tells how the texture will be applied to the material. Multiple texture slots can be applied to the same attribute, and the same texture can apply to multiple attributes. Any buttons that are pressed down the texture will be applied to. Some buttons have two down states. For these buttons the second down state represents the inverse (if this doesn't make much sense don't worry examples will make it more clear). Its important to understand that when you're modifying the textures themselves in the texture buttons (F6) the preview will always show color. Just because it shows that way in the preview doesn't mean it will show that way when finally applied in the material.  It will depend on what you map that texture to and how it interacts with the other textures already on the material.
	
I am now going to describe some of the more common attributes you can map textures to as well as give some examples. To start this is the settings for the texture that I will be using if you want to follow along. To get this all I did was change ''Texture Type'' to DistortedNoise.  Everything else is at defaults.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:texture-setup.jpg]] --&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;th&gt;Button Label&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Images&lt;/th&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Col&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
		Color, this is the color of the object. The Col slider effects how much the texture will merge
		into the material.  Think of it as the transparency of the texture 0 is transparent 
		(no affect for the texture),
		1 is fully opaque (the texture totally overrides underlying color).	
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;[[Image:mapto-color.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Nor&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
		Normal Map.  This can be thought of as bumpiness.  The simplest way to conceptualize this is to
		think of white areas as dented in and black as dented out.  This is a simplification of what is really
		happening but is usually the way you want to think of this.  This differs from displacement in that the
		bumps are quicker but less accurate, especially when viewed at shallow angles.  The Nor slider effects
		how much the texture makes the material bumpy.  Higher values are more bumpy.  If you're not seeing bumps
		make sure it is not set to 0.
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;[[Image:mapto-normal.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;RayMir&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
		Ray Mirror.  This describes what areas are reflective and which areas are not.  White for areas that are
		reflective, black for areas with no reflection.  The ''Var'' slider will affect how much the texture affects
		reflections (0 for little, 1 for totally).  Some important things to note for this to work. You
		must have Ray checked in the display buttons (F10).  Also you should have ''Ray Mirror'' checked
		for the material.  As a final note the value for the RayMirror slider should stay at 0 or it alters your results.
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;[[Image:mapto-raymirror.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Disp&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
		Displacement.  This is similar to Nor but gives more accurate results at the cost of speed.  The other
		issue with displacement is that because it modifies actual geometry when creating bumps the object
		must be of a suitably high mesh resolution for this to work correctly.  Basically it moves the actual vertices
		around.  So if there is not enough vertices it looks very jagged.  To make it look reasonable you usually have to subdivide
		several times.  The &lt;i&gt;Disp&lt;/i&gt; slider affects how much displacement is applied.  If you're not 
		seeing any bumps make sure it is not set to 0.
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;[[Image:mapto-disp.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;	
	&lt;/table&gt;

Do we all go through a metamorphosis?
&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;
I believe that we are constantly metamorphosing as individuals as well as a society.  Our success as a culture is dependent on change.  One might argue that change and metamorphosis are completely different ideas.  I do not see them as such, but merely as different levels of the same thing.  [[wikt:Change|Change]] is defined by [[Wiktionary]] as &quot;the process of becoming different.&quot;  Metamorphosis is defined by The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition as &quot;A marked change in appearance, character, condition, or function.&quot;

==Light verbs==
Most verbs in Persian are light verbs.  There are relatively few simple verbs still in use.

* {{term-fa|یاد گرفتن|yâd gereftan|to learn}}
* {{term-fa|کار داشتن|kâr dâštan|to be busy}} (“to have work”), e.g. {{Persian/text|کار دارم|kâr dâram|I’m busy.}}
* {{term-fa|کار کردن|kâr kardan|to do work}}
* {{term-fa|پیدا شدن|peydâ šodan|to become found}}
* {{term-fa|گوش دادن|guš dâdan|to give ear (listen)}}
* {{term-fa|خوب بودن|xub budan|to be good}}

Some light verbs are active vs. passive in pairs with کردن vs. شدن (e.g. تلفن کردن, تمیر کردن, گریه کردن, فراموش کردن, فکر کردن)

* {{Persian/text|کلیدم را گم کردم.|kelidamow gom kardam|I lost my key.}}
* {{Persian/text|کلیدم را گم شد.|kelidamow gom šod|My key was lost.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Wheeled Robots =

Wheeled robots are robots that navigate around the ground using motorized wheels to propel themselves. This design is simpler than using treads or legs and by using wheels they are easier to design, build, and program for movement in flat, not-so-rugged terrain.  They are also more well controlled than other types of robots.  Disadvantages of wheeled robots are that they can not navigate well over obstacles, such as rocky terrain, sharp declines, or areas with low friction.  Wheeled robots are most popular among the consumer market, their differential steering provides low cost and simplicity.  Robots can have any number of wheels, but three wheels are sufficient for static and dynamic balance.  Additional wheels can add to balance; however, additional mechanisms will be required to keep all the wheels in the ground, when the terrain is not flat.

== Navigation ==
Most wheeled robots use differential steering, which uses separately driven wheels for movement.  They can change direction by rotating each wheel at a different speed.  There may be additional wheels that are not driven by a motor these extra wheels help keep it balanced.

== 2-wheeled robots ==
Two wheeled robots are harder to balance than other types because they must keeping moving to maintain upright. The center of gravity of the robot body is kept below the axle, usually this is accomplished by mounting the batteries below the body. They can have their wheels parallel to each other, these vehicles are called dicycles, or one wheel in front of the other, tandemly placed wheels. Two wheeled robots must keep moving to remain upright and they can do this by driving in the direction the robot is falling. To balance, the base of the robot must stay with under its center of gravity.  For a robot that has the left and right wheels, it needs at least two sensors. A tilt sensor that is used to determine tilt angle and wheel encoders which keep track of the position of the platform of the robot.  

[[File:Swing-type robot.png|center|thumb|288px|Swing-type robot]] 

=== Examples ===
==== Roomba ====
Roombas are two-wheeled vacuum cleaners that automatically moves around cleaning up a room.  They utilizes a contact sensor in the front and a infrared sensor on its top.

[[File:Roomba_original.jpg|center|thumb|288px|Roomba]] 

==== Segway ====
[http://www.segway.com/ Segways] are self-balancing dicycle electric vehicles.

 

==== Ghost Rider ====
[http://www.ghostriderrobot.com/ Ghost Rider] was the only two wheeled robot entered for the [http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge05/ Darpa Grand 2005 Challenge].  It was unique because of its motorcycle design, unlike the other two-wheeled robots, the wheel alignment is front and back, which makes it harder to balance as it turns.  This tandem design of the wheels is much less common than that of a dicycle.

== 3-wheeled vehicles ==
3-wheeled robots may be of two types: differentially steered (2 powered wheels with an additional free rotating wheel to keep the body in balance) or 2 wheels powered by a single source and a powered steering for the third wheel. In the case of differentially steered wheels, the robot direction may be changed by varying the relative rate of rotation of the two separately driven wheels. If both the wheels are driven in the same direction and speed, the robot will go straight. Otherwise, depending on the speed of rotation and its direction, the center of rotation may fall anywhere in the line joining the two wheels. 
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Tanklike.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;Differentially steered 3 wheeled vehicle&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

The center of gravity in this type of robot has to lay inside the triangle formed by the wheels. If too heavy of a mass is mounted to the side of the free rotating wheel, the robot will tip over.

== Omni Wheels ==
Another option for wheeled robots that makes it easier for robots with wheels not all mounted on the same axis to have Omni Wheels.  An omni wheel is like many smaller wheels making up a large one, the smaller ones have axis perpendicular to the axis of the core wheel.  This allows the wheels to move in two directions, and the ability to move holonomically, which means it can instantaneously move in any direction.  Unlike a car, which moves non-holnomicallly and has to be in motion to change heading. Omni-wheeled robots can move in at any angle in any direction, without rotating beforehand.  	 
Some omni wheel robots use a triangular platform, with the three wheels spaced at 60 degree angles.  Advantages of using 3 wheels and not 4 are that its cheaper, and 3 points are guaranteed to be on the same plane, so each wheel in contact with the ground, but only one wheel will be rotating in the direction of travel.  The disadvantages of using Omni wheels is that they have poor efficiency due to not all the wheels rotating in the direction of movement, which also causes loss from friction, and are more computationally complex because of the angle calculations of movement. 

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Omniwheel.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;A simple omni wheel. The free rotating rollers (dark gray) allow the wheel to slide laterally.&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;


== 4-wheeled vehicles ==

=== 2 powered, 2 free rotating wheels ===
Same as the Differentially steered ones above but with 2 free rotating wheels for extra balance.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:4wheel 2free.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;2 powered, 2 free rotating wheels&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

More stable than the three wheel version since the center of gravity has to remain inside the rectangle formed by the four wheels instead of a triangle. This leaves a larger useful space. Still it's advisable to keep the center of gravity to the middle of the rectangle as this is the most stable configuration, especially when taking sharp turns or moving over a non-level surface.

=== 2-by-2 powered wheels for tank-like movement ===
[[File:ActivMedia Pioneer 3-AT robot.jpg|thumb|The Pioneer 3-AT robot has four motors and four unsteered wheels; on each side a pair of motors drives a pair of wheels through a single belt.]]
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:4wheel 4drive.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;4 wheel drive&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

This kind of robot uses 2 pairs of powered wheels. Each pair (connected by a line) turn in the same direction. The tricky part of this kind of propulsion is getting all the wheels to turn with the same speed. If the wheels in a pair aren't running with the same speed, the slower one will slip (inefficient). If the pairs don't run at the same speed the robot won't be able to drive straight. A good design will have to incorporate some form of car-like steering.

=== Car-like steering ===
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Differential drive.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;Differential Steering&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

This method allows the robot to turn in the same way a car does. This is a far harder method to build and makes dead reckoning much harder as well. This system does have an advantage over previous methods when your robot is powered by a combustion engine: It only needs one motor (and a servo for steering of course). The previous methods would require either 2 motors or a very complicated gearbox, since they require 2 output axles with independent speed and direction of rotation.

=== Examples ===
The [http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/index.asp DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges] pit robotic cars against one another in a series of navigational tests.  These robots are fully automated and drive themselves along the test course.  The DOD sponsors the competition and it is used to facilitate robotic development.

&lt;center&gt;
 
&lt;/center&gt;

== 5 or more wheeled vehicles ==
For larger robots. Not always very practical.&lt;BR&gt;
Especially when more powered wheels are used the design becomes much more complex as each of the wheels have to turn with the same speed when the robot has to move forwards. Differences in speed between the left and right wheels in differentially steered robots cause the robot to move to the side instead of in a straight line. Difference in speed between wheel on the same side cause slipping of the slowest wheel.

Sometimes an extra free rotating wheel with odometry is added to the robot.  This measures more accurately how the robot moves. Odometry on the powered wheels excludes slip and other movements and thus could be erroneous.

=== Examples ===
[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/home/index.html The Mars Rovers] (Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity) are six wheeled robots that navigate across Martian terrain after landing.  They are used to examine territory, interesting landmarks and make observations about the surface of Mars.  They have a suspension system which keeps all six wheels in contact with the surface, and helps them traverse slopes ans sandy terrain.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Pathfinder01.jpg|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;The Sojourner Rover&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Mars_rovers_wheels_isometric.jpg|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;Mars rover wheels sizes: Mars Exploration Rover (MER), Sojourner (Mars Pathfinder mission) and Mars Science Laboratory (from left to right)&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:NASA_Mars_Rover.jpg|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;Artist's Concept of Rover on Mars&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

== One Wheel ==
One wheeled robots are extremely difficult to keep balanced due to the single point of contact with the ground.  There have been experimental designs and robots that do only have one wheel.  It is easier to use a spherical wheel rather than a typical disc wheel, as the robot can move in any direction along the sphere.
[http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/experiments/rosie/rosie-sketch.html An example sketch] shows the basic idea of using gyroscopes and counter-torque mechanisms to keep the robot upright.  The spinning flywheels stabilize and tilt it, allowing for non-holonomic movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Legged Robots =

“In the early days of air travel, detractors used to argue that, if God had meant us to fly, he would have given us wings.  Had he meant us to roll, he might also have given us wheels – but instead we, along with the great preponderance of land animals great and small, have wound up traveling on legs.”{{ref|McGeer92}}

== Legs v. Wheels ==

Most man-made vehicles today travel on wheels and for good reason: wheels are much easier to construct and control.  In today’s economy, they also tend to be much cheaper than their legged counterparts.  However legs have distinct advantages over wheels.  The biggest advantage is in transversability and efficiency.  Legged robots have a unique ability to:

* Isolate their body from terrain irregularities 
* Avoid undesirable footholds 
* Regulate their stability 
* Achieve energy efficiency{{ref|Gait}}

These advantages are very desirable in modern robotics, and therefore a lot of research is being put into creating robots that can walk.  The most challenging task in designing a legged robot is to create a system that can generate the proper gait. {{ref|Gait}}

== Dynamic v. Static ==

Locomotion techniques can be divided into two main categories: static and dynamic.

Robots that use static movement are always balanced; that is, their center of gravity is always within their ground contact base.  While this technique has been successfully used to create many robots (included wheeled ones), it is more akin to wheeled movement than true dynamic walking and as such retains fewer of the advantages.  While more adept at transversing uneven terrain than most wheeled robots, robots that use static walking are very inefficient as power is put into every movement.  However, robots that use static walking are much easier to control than their dynamic counterparts and thus often more viable.

Dynamic walking is characterized in that the robot is not always in balance.  Many robots that use dynamic walking are continually “falling” and thus much more energy efficient.  Dynamic walking requires much more complex control systems in order to not fall.  Robots utilizing dynamic walking cannot use the same motions at different speeds to attain different speeds of movement, but must use entirely different motions at different speeds.  However, dynamic walking can achieve many more advantages over wheeled locomotion.  Dynamic walking is found very abundantly in nature.

A subset of dynamic walking is called passive dynamic movement.  Most dynamic walking systems use active control to move the legs to the correct orientations for walking (hence active dynamic walking).  Passive dynamic walking is characterized by a system where “gravity and inertia alone generate the locomotion pattern.” {{ref|McGeer90}} Passive dynamic movement can be achieved with maximum efficiency, as the vehicle uses its own forward momentum to propagate its next movement.  Very little energy is lost from the system.  Most of the concepts of passive dynamic walking and research conducted in the field was done by aeronautical engineer Tad McGeer between 1988 and 1992.{{ref||HistToys}}

== More Than Four ==

Many different walking robots have been developed that use six or more legs.  This is due to the fact that a robot using this many legs can be controlled with static walking techniques rather than dynamic walking.  Most of the walking techniques can be demonstrated sufficiently using the six legged model:

# Six legged robot in neutral position
# Alternating legs move forward on either side
# All other legs move forward
# Body follows legs forward

Most robots using six or more legs use a variation of one of these two gait models.

== Four Legs ==

A system on four legs is another walking scheme found readily in nature.  Four legged robots have the advantage of being statically stable when not moving, but require dynamic walking control.  There are many different ways for a four legged robot to walk including alternating pairs and opposite pairs as in six legged robots.  However these techniques now cease to be statically stable and thus require dynamic control. 

Boston Dynamics has developed a four legged robot for DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) called “Big Dog,” that they claim is “the most advanced quadruped robot on earth.”{{ref|BigDog}} Big Dog can run at four miles per hour, climb thirty five degree slopes, and carry 340 pounds.  But the most impressive feature is its dynamic walking: Big Dog can recover from slipping and even being pushed.  Its behavior is such that it approaches the infamous “uncanny valley” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley).  The Boston Dynamics website (http://bostondynamics.com/content/sec.php?section=BigDog) features a video demonstration of Big Dog’s abilities.  

== Three Legs ==

Three legged robots are not very common, especially since they have no biological counterparts.  However, researchers at Virginia Tech’s RoMeLa lab have developed a three legged robot STriDER that uses a “revolutionary” passive dynamic walking technique.  STriDER is short for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.  STriDER sways until it can lift one leg, and using the other two as an A-frame, swing it in between the other two “stance” legs moving forward at a sixty degree angle. This patent pending “tripedal gait” is extremely energy efficient and requires minimal control.  It also allows STriDER to easily change directions by changing the sequence of its steps.  A video posted by the development team can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XsaJwKKBYo&amp;feature=related.

== Two Legs ==

Two legged robots have probably seen the most development dollars since humanoid robots have been envisioned since the very beginning of the field.  Much of the development in passive dynamic walking has been done in this area.  The design of a bipedal passive dynamic walker begins with the concept of a wheel with spokes.  If the wheel is divided into sections, and all but two removed, we have what appears to be a set of legs.  When the mass is properly distributed, the legs each act as inverted pendulums and the robots “rolls” through its steps.

| [[Image:Wheel_2.jpg‎ |150px]]
| [[Image:Wheel_3.jpg‎ |150px]]
| [[Image:Wheel_4.jpg |150px]]
|}

Further complexity can be added to the model by using knee joints to shorten the legs (allowing one to swing past the other without touching the ground) and ankle joints that can provide a “spring” to the step to add lost energy back into the system.  For a more in-depth explanation of passive dynamics walking visit http://www-personal.umich.edu/~artkuo/Passive_Walk/passive_walking.html.

There are several robots that have used these concepts to achieve firsts in the field of robotics.  “RunBot,” developed in Germany and Scotland, broke the speed record per size for a robot in April 2006 by walking at 3.5 leg-lengths per second.{{ref|robotRecord}} The Cornell Ranger, while not truly passive, is passive inspired and one of many robots that has more than two legs but is still classified as bipedal.  When viewed from the side, Ranger appears to have only two legs, but it actually has four legs.  These four legs act in pairs of two, qualifying it as bipedal but providing better lateral stability.  On April 3, 2008 Ranger walked 9.07 kilometers without stopping, an unofficial record at that time (it has since been surpassed, according to the Cornell team, by Boston Dynamic’s Big Dog).{{ref|Ranger}}

One of the most successful companies at building bipedal robots over the years has been Honda.  Their most recent model, ASIMO, is one of the few bipedal robots that appears humanoid, can climb stairs, and carries its own power supply. ASIMO can also change its gait in real time using Honda’s i-WALK technology.  This allows ASIMO to continuously change speeds and direction.  The robot can walk up stairs and run up to four miles per hour.{{ref|Asimo}}

== One Leg ==

1980 and 1993 there was a lot of research in making one legged robots at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The MIT lab turned out a series of “MIT hoppers” that could balance themselves and traverse a path.  The biggest challenge with the hoppers was that they could not stand still; they needed to continue hopping in order to maintain their balance. Researchers were able to build a 3-D One-Leg Hopper that “hopped in place, traveled at a specific rate, followed simple paths, and maintained balance when disturbed.”{{ref|MITLegs}}  They also constructed a hopper named Uniroo that used an actuated tail to maintain its balance.{{ref|MITLegs}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Arms are types of jointed robot manipulator that allow robots to interact with their environment.  Many have onboard controllers or translators to simplify communication, though they may be controlled directly or in any number of ways.  Due to this fact, standalone arms are often classified as full robots.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Types of Robotic Arms'''&lt;/center&gt;
There are many different types of robotic arms, but most can be characterized into one of six major categories by their mechanical structure.  Cartesian (also known as Gantry) robots have three joints that are coincident with the standard X-Y-Z Cartesian axes.  Cylindrical arms have any number of joints that operate on a cylindrical axis, normally rotating about one fixed rod.  Spherical (polar) arms are those with joints that allow it full rotation throughout a spherical range.  SCARA robots have two parallel rotary joints to allow full movement throughout a plane, typically for pick-and-place work.  Articulated robots are used for complex assembly operations, and consist of three or more rotary joints.  Parallel robots have three concurrent prismatic or rotary joints, and allow for tilting of heavy or sensitive platforms.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:MultiArm.jpg|none|thumb|507px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(Left to Right) Gantry Robot, Articulated Robot, SCARA Robot&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Applications'''&lt;/center&gt;
Robotic arms are typically used in industry.  Repetitive autonomous robots perform one task repeatedly based upon predetermined movements and specifically located objects.  Start and stop commands are determined by position, acceleration, deceleration, distance, and direction.  More complex actions are executed based upon sensor processing.  If object orientation or position is unknown, arms are often paired with machine vision and artificial intelligence to identify the object and subsequently control the arm.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:FactorySetup.jpg|none|thumb|333px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Standard Robotic Factory Setup&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Parameters'''&lt;/center&gt;
Arms are typically defined by fourteen different parameters.  

'''Number of Axes''' – Two axes are needed to reach any point in a plane.  Three are required to reach a point in space.  Roll, pitch, and yaw control are required for full control of the end manipulator.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Degrees of Freedom''' – Number of points a robot can be directionally controlled around.  A human arm has seven degrees; articulated arms typically have up to 6.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Working Envelope''' – Region of space a robot can encompass.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Working Space''' – The region in space a robot can fully interact with.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Kinematics''' – Arrangement and types of joints (Cartesian, Cylindrical, Spherical, SCARA, Articulated, Parallel)&lt;BR&gt;
'''Payload''' – Amount that can be lifted and carried&lt;BR&gt;
'''Speed''' – May be defined by individual or total angular or linear movement speed&lt;BR&gt;
'''Acceleration''' – Limits maximum speed over short distances.  Acceleration is given in terms of each degree of freedom or by axis.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Accuracy''' – Given as a best case with modifiers based upon movement speed and position from optimal within the envelope.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Repeatability''' – More closely related to precision than accuracy.  Robots with a low repeatability factor and high accuracy often need only to be recalibrated.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Motion Control''' – For certain applications, arms may only need to move to certain points in the working space.  They may also need to interact with all possible points.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Power Source''' – Electric motors or hydraulics are typically used, though new methods are emerging and being tested.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Drive''' – Motors may be hooked directly to segments for direct drive.  They may also be attached via gears or in a harmonic drive system&lt;BR&gt;
'''Compliance''' – Measure of the distance or angle a robot joint will move under a force.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''End Effectors'''&lt;/center&gt;
The arm itself is only responsible for positioning.  An end effector is necessary for actual environmental interaction.  Some common choices are grippers, sprayers, grinders, welders, and vacuums, though many other options are available.  There is a large variance in complexity, ranging from flush mounted, non-moving parts (magnets or sticky pads) to multi-jointed, multi-sensor parts with various inputs and outputs.  End effectors are typically chosen based upon the application, and many arms will fit multiple end effectors.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Distribution'''&lt;/center&gt;
A 2006 Japanese report shows that 60% of robotic arm installations were for articulated robots, 22% were for gantry, 13% were SCARA, and 4% were Cylindrical.  The automobile industry has the highest concentration of industrial robots with nearly 1 robot per 10 people.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Biological Modeling'''&lt;/center&gt;
Biological design of robotic components is becoming increasingly popular.  Currently, the Shadow Company (famous for the Shadow Hand) is working on a biomorphic arm that accurately models a human arm.  The arm has seven degrees of freedom like the human arm which greatly increases its efficiency.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:shadowhand.jpg|none|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;The Shadowhand&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

Researchers at Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA in Stuttgart have begun working on an arm that is modeled after an elephant’s trunk.  The arm uses a cord that is connected to a drive shaft at its midpoint.  When the shaft turns, the cord wraps around it both ways forming a double helix.  Their prototype arm uses ten of these cord systems with two motors attached to each (the second acts as a failsafe for increased safety).

Similarly, biologists at Hebrew University in Jerusalem are studying Octopi tentacles as a possible model for future robotic arm development.  An prototype has not yet been built, but arm design has recently begun.

Additionally, two monkeys learned to control robotic arms through sensors implanted on their brains in a study performed the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.  While not currently practical, the study confirms that brain-controlled prosthetics are feasible and has sparked interest in the area.&lt;BR&gt;

==Getting Firefox==
Firefox can be downloaded from [http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/ this page]. Pressing the large green button will download Firefox. To get a version of Firefox in another language, see [http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/all this page].

==Installing==
[[Image:Windows_Firefox_Installer.png|right|thumb|200px|Firefox Windows Installer]]
===Microsoft Windows===
Firefox supports various versions of Windows including 98, 98SE, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP,Server 2003,  Vista and Windows 7 although it is possible to run Firefox in Windows 95 [http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/windows_95/]. Builds for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition also exist [http://www.mozilla-x86-64.com/]. The Microsoft Windows version of Firefox is distributed as an executable installer.
However, starting in Firefox 3.0, there's only support for Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.

To install, double click on Firefox Setup &lt;version&gt;.exe (where &lt;version&gt; is a number) and follow the installation instructions. Choosing the standard installation is recommended for most new users. This will install Firefox under Program Files.


You can run Firefox from the Program Files entry or by double-clicking the Firefox icon on your desktop. The first run of Firefox will give you the  option of importing your settings from Internet Explorer (or any other browser installed on you computer). Choosing 'Yes' will import all your bookmarks (also known as favorites), saved passwords, history and browsing options. After it finishes importing all these settings, the Firefox browser will start up and a dialog box will pop-up alerting you that Firefox is not set as the default browser. Selecting 'Yes' will associate Firefox with web related files on your PC and Firefox will also open when links are selected from (most) external applications, such as from an instant messenger.

After setting Firefox as the default browser, it should automatically appear on the Windows XP new-style Start menu under the &quot;Internet&quot; option. However, if it doesn't, it can be manually set. Right click on the Start button and select &quot;Properties&quot;. From there, select &quot;Customize...&quot;, and select &quot;Mozilla Firefox&quot; next to the &quot;Internet&quot; checkbox.

[[Image:MacOSX_Firefox_Install_Window.png|right|thumb|200px|Firefox MacOSX Disc Image]]

===Mac OS X===
Double click on the compressed Disk Image to mount it. Drag the Firefox application icon to the &quot;Applications&quot; folder on your hard drive. Do not double-click the Firefox icon inside the Disk Image; doing so can cause a program hang. To make Firefox always appear in the dock, drag the icon from the &quot;Applications&quot; folder to the dock.

===Linux===
Many distributions now come with Firefox included. Check your distribution's documentation for details. There should be a Firefox icon in your desktop environment's program menu.

If your distribution does not come with Firefox pre-installed, you may download it from the official Firefox website. Once the download is complete, decompress the file, which can be done usually by opening the file in a file archiver (such as ark or file roller) and extract it to another folder. Alternatively, typing &lt;tt&gt;tar -xvzf firefox-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;tar -xvzf firefox*&lt;/tt&gt; at a command line will generate directory named &quot;firefox.&quot; This directory can be moved anywhere. Typing &lt;tt&gt;./firefox&lt;/tt&gt; in the shell from the install directory should run Firefox.

=== Other Operating Systems ===
Since the Mozilla Foundation makes the Firefox source code available, users can also compile and run Firefox on a variety of other architectures and operating systems. Operating systems not supported by Firefox, but known to run the browser include:

* Solaris (x86 and SPARC)
* OS/2
* AIX
* FreeBSD
* PC-BSD
* NetBSD
* BeOS
* SkyOS
* RISC OS (ARM)
* OpenBSD

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;&lt; [[Numerical Methods]]'''

Often, we need to find the integral of a function that may be difficult to integrate analytically (ie, as a definite integral) or impossible (the function only existing as a table of values).

Some methods of approximating said integral are listed below.

== Trapezoidal Rule ==
Consider some function, possibly unknown,  &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, with known values over the interval [a,b] at n+1 evenly spaced points x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of spacing &lt;math&gt;h={(b-a) \over n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_0=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n=b&lt;/math&gt;.  

Further, denote the function value at the ith mesh point as &lt;math&gt;f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the notion of integration as &quot;finding the area under the function curve&quot;, we can denote the integral over the ith segment of the interval, from &lt;math&gt;x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; as:

&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;  =  (1)

Since we may not know the antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we must approximate it.  Such approximation in the Trapezoidal Rule, unsurprisingly, involves approximating (1) with a trapezoid of width h, left height &lt;math&gt;f(x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;, right height &lt;math&gt;f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus,

(1) &lt;math&gt;\simeq {1 \over 2}h(f(x_{i-1}) + f(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;  =  (2)

(2) gives us an approximation to the area under one interval of the curve, and must be repeated to cover the entire interval.

For the case where n = 2,

&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_a}^{x_b} f(x)\, dx \simeq {1 \over 2}h(f(x_0) + f(x_1)) + {1 \over 2}h(f(x_{1}) + f(x_2))&lt;/math&gt;  = (3)


Collecting like terms on the right hand side of (3) gives us:

&lt;math&gt; {1 \over 2} h (f(x_0) + f(x_1) + f(x_1) + f(x_2)) &lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt; {1 \over 2} h (f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + f(x_2)) &lt;/math&gt;

Now, substituting in for h and cleaning up,

&lt;math&gt; {(b-a) \over 2\cdot2} (f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + f(x_2)) &lt;/math&gt;


To motivate the general version of the trapezoidal rule, now consider n = 4,

&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_a}^{x_b} f(x)\, dx \simeq {1 \over 2}h(f(x_0) + f(x_1)) + {1 \over 2}h(f(x_1) + f(x_2)) + {1 \over 2}h(f(x_2) + f(x_3)) + {1 \over 2}h(f(x_3) + f(x_4))&lt;/math&gt;

Following a similar process as for the case when n=2, we obtain

&lt;math&gt; {(b-a) \over 2\cdot4} (f(x_0) + 2(f(x_1) + f(x_2) + f(x_3)) + f(x_4)) &lt;/math&gt;

Proceeding to the general case where n = N,

&lt;math&gt; \int_{x_a}^{x_b} f(x)\, dx \simeq {(b-a) \over 2 \cdot n} (f(x_0) + 2(\sum_{k=1}^Nf(x_k)) + f(x_n)) &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Trapizoidruleexample.jpg]]
This is an example of what the trapezoidal rule would represent graphicly, here &lt;math&gt; y = -x^2 + 5 &lt;/math&gt;.


=== Example ===
Approximate &lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{1} x^3\, dx &lt;/math&gt; to within 5%.

First, since the function can be exactly integrated, let us do so, to provide a check on our answer.

&lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{1} x^3\, dx = \left [{x^4 \over 4}\right ]_0^1 = {1 \over 4} = 0.25 &lt;/math&gt; = (4)

We will start with an interval size of 1, only considering the end points.

&lt;math&gt; f(0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(1) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

(4) &lt;math&gt; \simeq {(1-0) \over (2\cdot1)} (f(0) + f(1)) = {1 \over 2.1} (0 + 1) = {1 \over 2} = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

Relative error = &lt;math&gt; \left |{ (0.5-0.25) \over 0.25}  \right | = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Hmm, a little high for our purposes.  So, we halve the interval size to 0.5 and add to the list

&lt;math&gt; f(0.5) = 0.125 &lt;/math&gt;

(4) &lt;math&gt; \simeq {(1-0) \over (2\cdot2)} (f(0) + 2f(0.5) +  f(1)) = {1 \over 2\cdot2} (0 + 2(0.125) + 1) = {1.25 \over 4} = 0.3125&lt;/math&gt;

Relative error = &lt;math&gt; \left |{ (0.3125-0.25) \over 0.25}  \right | = 0.25 &lt;/math&gt;

Still above 0.01, but vastly improved from the initial step.  We continue in the same fashion, calculating &lt;math&gt;f(0.25)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(0.75)&lt;/math&gt;, rounding off to four decimal places.

&lt;math&gt; f(0.25) = 0.0156 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(0.75) = 0.4219 &lt;/math&gt;

(4) &lt;math&gt; \simeq {(1-0) \over (2\cdot4)} ( 0 + 2(0.0156 + 0.125 + 0.4219) + 1) = {1 \over 8} (2.2150) = 0.2656 &lt;/math&gt;

Relative error = &lt;math&gt; \left |{ (0.2656-0.25) \over 0.25}  \right | = 0.0624 &lt;/math&gt;

We are well on our way.  Continuing, with interval size 0.125 and rounding as before,

&lt;math&gt; f(0.125) = 0.0020 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(0.375) = 0.0527 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(0.625) = 0.2441 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(0.875) = 0.6699 &lt;/math&gt;


(4) &lt;math&gt; \simeq {(1-0) \over (2\cdot8)} (0 + 2(0.0020 + 0.0156 + 0.0527 + 0.0125 + 0.2441 + 0.4219 + 0.6699) + 1) = {1 \over 16} (4.0624) = 0.2539 &lt;/math&gt;

Relative error = &lt;math&gt; \left |{ (0.2539-0.25) \over 0.25}  \right | = 0.0156 &lt;/math&gt;

Since our relative error is less than 5%, we stop.

=== Error Analysis ===
Let y=f(x) be continuous,well-behaved and have continuous derivatives in [x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]. We expand y in a Taylor series about x=x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,thus-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_0}^{x_1}y\, dx=\int_{x_0}^{x_1}[y_0+(x-x_0)y'_0+(x-x_0)^2y''_0/2!+......]\,dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Simpson's Rule ==
Consider some function &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; possibily unknown with known values over the interval [a,b] at n+1 evently spaced points then it defined as

&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_0}^{x_n} f(x)\, dx \simeq {1 \over 3}h \bigg\{f(x_0) + f(x_n) + 2\Big(f(x_2) + f(x_4) + ... + f(x_{n-2})\Big) + 4\Big(f(x_1) + f(x_3) + ... + f(x_{n-1})\Big)\bigg\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h={(b-a) \over n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_0=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n=b&lt;/math&gt;.  

=== Example ===
Evaluate &lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_0^{1.2} {x\left( {8 - x^3 } \right)^{\frac{1}
{2}} dx} &lt;/math&gt; by taking &lt;math&gt;n = 6&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; must be even)

Solution: Here &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x\left( {8 - x^3 } \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;b = 1.2&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{{b - a}}{n} = \frac{{1.2 - 0}}{6} = 0.2&lt;/math&gt;

Now when &lt;math&gt;a = x_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; f(x_0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And since &lt;math&gt;x_n  = x_{n - 1}  + h&lt;/math&gt;, therefore for &lt;math&gt;x_1 = 0.2&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_2 = 0.4&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_3 = 0.6&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_4 = 0.8&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_5 = 1&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_6 = b = 1.2&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding values are &lt;math&gt;f(x_1) = 0.7784&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_2) = 1.58721&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_3) = 1.6740&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_4) = 2.1891&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_5) = 2.6458&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_6) = 3.0053&lt;/math&gt;

== Simpson's 3/8 ==

== Description ==
Unsigned integers in Ada have a value range from 0 to some positive number (not necessarily 1 subtracted from some power of 2). They are defined using the {{Ada/kw|mod}} keyword because they implement a wrap-around arithmetic.

  {{Ada/kw|mod}} Modulus

where '{{Ada/attribute|First}} is 0 and '{{Ada/attribute|Last}} is Modulus - 1.

Wrap-around arithmetic means that 'Last + 1 = 0 = 'First, and 'First - 1 = 'Last. Additionally to the normal arithmetic operators, bitwise {{Ada/kw|and}}, {{Ada/kw|or}} and {{Ada/kw|xor}} are defined for the type (see below).

The predefined package {{Ada/package|Interfaces}} (RM {{Ada/RM2|B|2|}}) presents unsigned integers based on powers of 2

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Unsigned_''n'' {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 2**''n'';

for which also shift and rotate operations are defined. The values of ''n'' depend on compiler and target architecture.

You can use {{Ada/kw|range}} to sub-range a modular type:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Byte {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 256;
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Half_Byte {{Ada/kw|is}} Byte {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 127;

But beware: the Modulus of Half_Byte is still 256! Arithmetic with such a type is interesting to say the least.

== Bitwise Operations ==

Be very careful with bitwise operators {{Ada/kw|and}}, {{Ada/kw|or}}, {{Ada/kw|xor}}, {{Ada/kw|not}}, when the modulus is not a power of two.
An examply might exemplify the problem.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Unsigned {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 2**5;   -- modulus 32
 X: Unsigned := 2#10110#;     -- 22
 {{Ada/kw|not}} X        = 2#01001#      -- bit reversal: 9 ( = 31 - 22 ) as expected

The other operators work similarly.

Now take a modulus that is not a power of two. Naive expectations about the results may lead out of the value range.
As an example take again the {{Ada/kw|not}} operator (see  the RM for the others):

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Unsigned {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 5;
 X: Unsigned := 2#001#;  -- 1, bit reversal: 2#110# = 6 leads out of range

The definition of {{Ada/kw|not}} is therefore:

  {{Ada/kw|not}} X = Unsigned'Last – X  -- here: 4 – 1 = 2#011#

      <comment>/* Booleans as enumeration literals */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Ada/Navigation|Types|Enumeration}}
__TOC__
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
An '''enumeration''' type is defined as a list of possible values:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Primary_Color {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Green, Blue);

Like for numeric types, where e.g. 1 is an integer literal, Red, Green and Blue are called the literals of this type. There are no other values assignable to objects of this type.

== Operators and attributes ==

Apart from equality (&quot;=&quot;), the only operators on enumeration types are the ordering [[Ada Programming/Operators|operators]]: &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, &quot;/=&quot;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, where the order relation is given implicitly by the sequence of literals: Each literal has a position, starting with 0 for the first, incremented by one for each successor. This position can be queried via the 'Pos [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]]; the inverse is 'Val, which returns the corresponding literal. In our example:

 Primary_Color'{{Ada/attribute|Pos}} (Red) = 0
 Primary_Color'{{Ada/attribute|Val}} (0)   = Red

There are two other important attributes: {{Ada/attribute|Image}} and {{Ada/attribute|Value}} (don't confuse {{Ada/attribute|Val}} with {{Ada/attribute|Value}}). {{Ada/attribute|Image}} returns the string representation of the value (in capital letters), {{Ada/attribute|Value}} is the inverse:

 Primary_Color'{{Ada/attribute|Image}} ( Red ) = &quot;RED&quot;
 Primary_Color'{{Ada/attribute|Value}} (&quot;Red&quot;) =  Red

These attributes are important for simple [[Ada Programming/Input Output|IO]] (there are more elaborate IO facilities in {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}} for enumeration types). Note that, since Ada is case-insensitive, the string given to 'Value can be in any case.

== Enumeration literals ==
Literals are overloadable, i.e. you can have another type with the same literals.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);

Overload resolution within the context of use of a literal normally resolves which Red is meant. Only if you have an unresolvable overloading conflict, you can qualify with special syntax which Red is meant:

 Primary_Color'(Red)

Like many other declarative items, enumeration literals can be renamed. In fact, such a literal is a actually [[Ada Programming/Subprograms#Functions|function]], so it has to be renamed as such:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Red {{Ada/kw|return}} P.Primary_Color {{Ada/kw|renames}} P.Red;

Here, Primary_Color is assumed to be defined in package P, which is visible at the place of the renaming declaration. Renaming makes Red directly visible without necessity to resort the use-clause.

Note that redeclaration as a function does not affect the staticness of the literal.

=== Characters as enumeration literals ===
Rather unique to Ada is the use of character literals as enumeration literals:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} ABC {{Ada/kw|is}} ('A', 'B', 'C');

This literal 'A' has '''nothing''' in common with the literal 'A' of the predefined type Character (or Wide_Character).

Every type that has at least one character literal is a character type. For every character type, string literals and the concatenation [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/&amp;|operator &quot;&amp;&quot;]] are also implicitly defined.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Character {{Ada/kw|is}} (No_Character, 'a', Literal, 'z');
 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_String {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} My_Character;
 
 S: My_String := &quot;aa&quot; &amp; Literal &amp; &quot;za&quot; &amp; 'z';
 T: My_String := ('a', 'a', Literal, 'z', 'a', 'z');

In this example, S and T have the same value.

Ada's Character type is defined that way. See [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Standard]].

=== Booleans as enumeration literals ===

Also Booleans are defined as enumeration types:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Boolean {{Ada/kw|is}} (False, True);

There is special semantics implied with this declaration in that objects and expressions of this type can be used as conditions. Note that the literals False and True are not Ada keywords.

Thus it is not sufficient to declare a type with these literals and then hope objects of this type can be used like so:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Boolean {{Ada/kw|is}} (False, True);
  Condition: My_Boolean;
 
  {{Ada/kw|if}} Condition {{Ada/kw|then}}  -- wrong, won't compile

If you need your own Booleans (perhaps with special size requirements), you have to derive from the predefined Boolean:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Boolean {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Boolean;
  Condition: My_Boolean;
 
  {{Ada/kw|if}} Condition {{Ada/kw|then}}  -- OK

== Enumeration subtypes ==

You can use &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/kw|range}}&lt;/tt&gt; to subtype an enumeration type:

  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Capital_Letter {{Ada/kw|is}} Character {{Ada/kw|range}} 'A' .. 'Z';

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Week {{Ada/kw|is}} (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday);
  
  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Working_Day {{Ada/kw|is}} Day_Of_Week {{Ada/kw|range}} Monday .. Friday;

== Description ==
{{Wikipedia|Floating point}}

To define a floating point type, you only have to say how many '''[[Ada Programming/Keywords/digits|digits]]''' are needed, i.e. you define the relative precision:

 {{Ada/kw|digits}} Num_Digits

If you like, you can declare the minimum range needed as well:

 {{Ada/kw|digits}} Num_Digits '''[[Ada Programming/Keywords/range|range]]''' Low .. High

This facility is a great benefit of Ada over (most) other programming languages. In other languages, you just choose between &quot;float&quot; and &quot;long float&quot;, and what most people do is:
* choose float if they don't care about accuracy
* otherwise, choose long float, because it is the best you can get

In either case, you don't know what accuracy you get.

In Ada, you specify the accuracy you need, and the compiler will choose an appropriate floating point type with ''at least'' the accuracy you asked for. This way, your requirement is guaranteed. Moreover, if the computer has more than two floating point types available, the compiler can make use of all of them.

== Classes of problems ==
=== Embarrassingly parallel problems ===


== History of distributed computing ==
=== The Eighties and Nineties: PVM and MPI ===

=== Today: GFS, MapReduce, Hadoop ===

==Mathematics of parallel processing ==
Parallel processing is the simultaneous execution of the same task (split up and specially adapted) on multiple processors in order to obtain faster results. The parallel nature can come from a single machine with multiple processors or multiple machines connected together to form a cluster.

=== Amdahl's law ===
Amdahl's law is a demonstration of the [[w:Diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]]: while one could speed up part of a computer a hundred-fold or more, if the improvement only affects 12% of the overall task, the best the [[w:speedup|speedup]] could possibly be is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 - 0.12} = 1.136&lt;/math&gt; times faster.

More technically, the law is concerned with the [[w:speedup|speedup]] achievable from an improvement to a computation that affects a proportion ''P'' of that computation where the improvement has a speedup of ''S''. (For example, if an improvement can speedup 30% of the computation, ''P'' will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the portion affected twice as fast, ''S'' will be 2.) Amdahl's law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{S}}&lt;/math&gt;.

To see how this formula was derived, assume that the running time of the old computation was 1, for some unit of time. The running time of the new computation will be the length of time the unimproved fraction takes (which is 1 &amp;minus; ''P'') plus the length of time the improved fraction takes. The length of time for the improved part of the computation is the length of the improved part's former running time divided by the speedup, making the length of time of the improved part ''P''/''S''. The final speedup is computed by dividing the old running time by the new running time, which is what the above formula does.

==== Parallelization ====
In the special case of parallelization, Amdahl's law states that if ''F'' is the fraction of a calculation that is sequential (i.e. cannot benefit from parallelisation), and (1 &amp;minus; ''F'') is the fraction that can be parallelised, then the maximum speedup that can be achieved by using ''N'' processors is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{F + (1-F)/N}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the limit, as ''N'' tends to [[w:infinity|infinity]], the maximum speedup tends to 1/''F''. In practice, price/performance ratio falls rapidly as ''N'' is increased once (1 &amp;minus; ''F'')/''N'' is small compared to ''F''.

As an example, if ''F'' is only 10%, the problem can be sped up by only a maximum of a factor of 10, no matter how large the value of ''N'' used. For this reason, [[w:parallel computing|parallel computing]] is only useful for either small numbers of [[w:processor|processor]]s, or problems with very low values of ''F'': so-called [[w:embarrassingly parallel|embarrassingly parallel]] problems. A great part of the craft of [[w:parallel programming|parallel programming]] consists of attempting to reduce ''F'' to the smallest possible value.

__TOC__
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Description ==
{{Wikipedia|Fixed-point arithmetic}}
A fixed point type defines a set of values that are evenly spaced with a given absolute precision. In contrast, floating point values are all spaced according to a relative precision.

The absolute precision is given as the delta of the type. There are two kinds of fixed point types, ordinary and decimal.

For '''Ordinary Fixed Point''' types, the delta gives a hint to the compiler how to choose the small value if it is not specified: It can be ''any integer power of two'' not greater than delta. You may specify the small via an attribute clause to be ''any value'' not greater than delta. (If the compiler cannot conform to this small value, it has to reject the declaration.)

For '''Decimal Fixed Point''' types, the small is defined to be the delta, which in turn must be an integer power of ten. (Thus you cannot specify the small by an attribute clause.)

For example, if you define a decimal fixed point type with a delta of 0.1, you will be able to accurately store the values 0.1, 1.0, 2.2, 5.7, etc. You will not be able to accurately store the value 0.01. Instead, the value will be rounded down to 0.0.

If the compiler accepts your fixed point type definition, it guarantees that values represented by that type will have at least the degree of accuracy specified (or better). If the compiler cannot support the type definition (e.g. due to limited hardware) then a compile-time error will result.

== Ordinary Fixed Point ==

For an ordinary fixed point, you just define the delta and a range:

 {{Ada/kw|delta}} ''Delta'' {{Ada/kw|range}} ''Low'' .. ''High''

The delta can be any real value &amp;mdash; for example you may define a circle with one arcsecond resolution with:

 {{Ada/kw|delta}} 1 / (60 * 60) {{Ada/kw|range}} 0.0 .. 360.0

[There is one rather strange rule about fixed point types: Because of the way they are internally represented, the range might only go up to &lt;code&gt;'Last - Delta&lt;/code&gt;. This is a bit like a circle &amp;mdash; the 0° and 360° mark is also the same.]

It should be noted that in the example above the smallest possible value used is not &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{60^2} = \frac{1}{3600}&lt;/math&gt;. The compiler will choose a smaller value which, by default, is an integer power of 2 not greater than the delta. In our example this could be &lt;math&gt;2^{-12} = \frac{1}{4096}&lt;/math&gt;. In most cases this should render better performance but sacrifices precision for it.

If this is not what you wish and precision is indeed more important, you can choose your own small value via the attribute clause '{{Ada/attribute|Small}}.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Angle {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} Pi/2.0**31 {{Ada/kw|range}} -Pi .. Pi;
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Angle'Small {{Ada/kw|use}} Pi/2.0**31;

As internal representation, you will get a 32 bit signed integer type.

== Decimal Fixed Point ==

You define a decimal fixed point by defining the delta and the number of digits needed:

  {{Ada/kw|delta}} ''Delta'' {{Ada/kw|digits}} ''Num_Digits''

Delta must be a positive or negative integer power of 10 &amp;mdash; otherwise the declaration is illegal.

 {{Ada/kw|delta}} 10.0**(+2) {{Ada/kw|digits}} 12
 {{Ada/kw|delta}} 10.0**(-2) {{Ada/kw|digits}} 12

If you like, you can also define the range needed:

 {{Ada/kw|delta}} Delta_Value {{Ada/kw|digits}} Num_Digits {{Ada/kw|range}} Low .. High

== Differences between Ordinary and Decimal Fixed Point Types ==

There is an alternative way of declaring a &quot;decimal&quot; fixed point: You declare an ordinary fixed point and use an integer power of 10 as '{{Ada/attribute|Small}}. The following two declarations are equivalent with respect to the internal representation:

 -- decimal fixed point
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Duration {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} 10.0**(-9) {{Ada/kw|digits}} 9;

 -- ordinary fixed point
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Duration {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} 10.0**(-9) {{Ada/kw|range}} -1.0 .. 1.0;
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Duration'{{Ada/attribute|Small}} {{Ada/kw|use}} 10.0**(-9);

You might wonder what the difference then is between these two declarations. The answer is:

''None with respect to precision, addition, subtraction, multiplication with integer values.''

The following is an incomplete list of differences between ordinary and decimal fixed point types.

* Decimal fixed point types are intended to reflect typical '''COBOL''' declarations with a given number of digits.

* Truncation is required for decimal, not for ordinary, fixed point in multiplication and division (RM {{Ada/95/RM|4|5|5|title=(21)}}) and type conversions. Operations on decimal fixed point are fully specified, which is not true for ordinary fixed point.

* The following attributes are only defined for decimal fixed point: T'Digits (RM {{Ada/95/RM|3|5|10|title=(10)}}) corresponds to the number of decimal digits that are representable; T'Scale (RM {{Ada/95/RM|3|5|10|title=(11)}}, taken from '''COBOL''') indicates the position of the point relative to the rightmost significant digits; T'Round (RM {{Ada/95/RM|3|5|10|title=(12)}}) can be used to specify rounding on conversion.

* Package Decimal (RM {{Ada/95/RM|F|2|title=}}), which of course applies only to decimal fixed point, defines the decimal Divide generic procedure. If annex F is supported (GNAT does), at least 18 digits must be supported (there is no such rule for fixed point).

* Decimal_IO (RM {{Ada/95/RM|A|10|1|title=(73)}}) has semantics different from Fixed_IO (RM {{Ada/95/RM|A|10|1|title=(68)}}).

* Static expressions must be a multiple of the Small for decimal fixed point.

'''Conclusion:'''
For normal numeric use, an ordinary fixed point (probably with 'Small defined) should be defined. Only if you are interested in COBOL like use, i.e. well defined deterministic decimal semantics (especially for financial computations, but that might apply to cases other than money) should you take decimal fixed point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In encryption, the weakest link is almost always a person.

While you could spend many hours attempting to decipher an encrypted message, or intercept a password, you can easily trick a person into telling you this information.

Suppose Bob works for a large company and encrypts document ''E'' with key ''K''. Suppose Eve, wishing to decrypt document ''E'', calls Bob and pretends to work for the company's information security department. Eve would pretend a problem existed with the computers, servers, etc. and ask Bob for his key, ''K'', which she would use to decrypt ''E''.  This is an example of social engineering.

[http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png Randall Munroe in an xkcd comic] once presented a scenerio in which bad guys find it more convenient to hit Bob with a $5 wrench until he gives up his key rather than attempt to break the crypto system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The strength of your encryption method is based not only on your encryption method, but also on your ability to use it effectively. A perfect encryption method which is finicky to use and hard to get right is not likely to be useful in building a high quality security system.

For example, the [[../One time pads|One-Time Pad]] cypher is the only known provably unbreakable algorithm (in the very strong sense of a more effective than brute force search attack being impossible), but this proof applies ONLY if the key used is completely randomly chosen (there is currently no known method for making such a choice nor is there any known method for demonstrating that any particular choice is random), if the key is a long as the plaintext, if the key is never reused, and if the key never becomes known to the enemy. These conditions are so difficult to ensure that the One-Time Pad is almost never used in actual practice, whatever its theoretical advantages.  

Any use of the One-Time Pad violating those assumed requirements is insecure, sometimes trivially so. For instance, statistical analysis techniques may be immediately applicable, under certain kinds of misuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[Introduction to Philosophy]]

There may be no philosopher that has had more of an impact on society and politics than Karl Marx.  His theory, in essence, embraces radical and revolutionary change.

Marx argues that the working class, or ''proletariat'', are oppressed and alienated in the process of production (what Marx calls &quot;alienated labor&quot;). Unlike the skilled artisans of the past who could craft a product from start to finish,  industrialization has led to the division of labor into many smaller repetitve processes. For example, a worker might only pull a lever, or attach a rivet, instead of crafting an entire product. In this way, workers became alientated from their final product. Likewise, in the competition of workers to be more 'profitable' to their employers, they initiate a 'race to the bottom' of the wage pile, willing to work for less and less. In this way, workers create strife amongst themselves and must sell themselves to their employers. This alienates themselves from each other (undermining class solidarity) and from their humanity &amp;mdash; with a similar effect as prostitution.

According to Marx, the means of production must be appropriated by the workers and freed from the dehumanizing commodity form to meet the needs of society (production for the benefit of humankind, not for profit of the property-owning and ruling class, the ''bourgeois'').  Marx envisioned and projected a society free from social stratification, in which individual contribution and distribution of goods could be summarized: &quot;From each according to ability, to each according to need.&quot; ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm ''Critique of the Gotha Program''], 1875.)

The most influential book written by him was [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto the Communist Manifesto].

      <comment>/* Bottom two pair */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Texas Hold'em''' is played in the main event of the World Series of Poker, and is considered by many the most complex and strategic form of poker. In the game everyone tries to make the best 5 card hand they can out of five community cards and two personal cards. In modern games the blinds are then posted. The blinds are forced bets. The player to the left of the dealer puts in the small blind, and the player to the left of the small blind pays the big blind, which is typically twice the small blind. This represents the minimum bet once the action begins. Each player is dealt two cards face down called the hole cards, which they aim to keep secret. Then the first round of betting ensues, with the player to the left of the big blind acting first. After this, a card is discarded and three cards are dealt face up in the middle of the table. These cards are called the flop, and are the first three community cards. There is another round of betting, beginning this time with the small blind. One more card is discarded and one more community card is dealt, called the turn. There is another round of betting, again starting with the small blind, then a discard, and then the final card, called the river, is dealt.  There is one final round of betting and then the players who have not folded turn over their cards.

'''Basic Strategy of Texas Holdem'''

''Note this strategy guide is for playing no limit texas holdem.  Slightly different considerations apply when playing limit or pot limit holdem.  It is also heavily oriented towards tournament play, since this is the format where no-limit is most commonly played.''


==Position==

Position refers to how many players must act after your actions.  It is generally preferable to be the last player to act, since your opponents will often reveal some information about their hand by betting or checking (sometimes they may be trapping you by slowplaying or checkraising) before you act, because you have the choice of taking a free card if no-one else has bet, and for various other reasons.  Position is probably the single most important factor in no-limit hold'em.  The person acting as dealer (also called &quot;being on the button&quot;) will always be last to act (except in the first round), and is thus said to &quot;have position&quot; on all other players. Because the dealer can see what all the other players do it is the most desirable position to occupy post-flop.

The blinds, the button and the cutoff seat (one off the button) are normally referred to as late position; the next two or three seats are middle position; and everything else is early position.  One important thing for a beginner to realize is that the playability of a hand varies greatly according to their position.  Beginners should aim to play fewer than 10% of hands in early position (when you are one of the first to act) but might find 30% playable in late position in an unraised pot.

It is useful to have a shorthand for the pre-flop positions at the table.  For this guide, the big blind will be denoted by BB, the small blind by SB; other positions will be represented by a number, with 0 as the button, 1 as the seat next to the button, 2 being 2 places to the right of the button and so on.

==Principles of Starting Hand Selection==

The single most important thing in choosing which hands to play is to avoid being dominated.

A hand is dominated if it is a non-pair hand facing a higher hand with one card the same, or facing a pair of the same or higher value as one of its cards.  For example, AQ is dominated by AK, QQ, KK and AA.  QJ, which looks like a good hand to beginners, is dominated by AQ, AJ, KQ, KJ, AA, KK, QQ and JJ - that is, virtually any hand playable for a raise but AK and the medium pairs.  A pair is dominated by any higher pair.

This is important not just because the dominated hand is, at best, a 3 to 1 underdog.  The implied losses involved in holding AQ against AK are huge, since it can result in losing a large portion of your stack when an ace flops.  The legendary player Doyle Brunson once gave up playing AQ entirely, saying that it had lost him more money than any other hand.

This leads to the Gap Concept - you need a better hand to call with than to raise with, from any given position.  A player on the dealer button may raise with KJ after the action has been folded around, but should normally fold it to a raise which they judge may represent AK, AJ or KQ.  More on this later.

==Types of hands==

Hands can be divided into a number of types.  The value of the types changes depending on the number of players, the level of the blinds and the player's position on the table.

Some hands here are chosen for their ability to make a useful strong one-pair hand; others are chosen for the ability to make a straight, flush or set.  The latter are known as drawing hands.  A good general rule for drawing hands is: play them in later positions, perhaps the button and positions 1 and 2, and never call with them for more than 5% of the maximum possible return.  The maximum return is, roughly, the minimum of your stack and the opponents stack.  You might well invest more than that when raising, of course, if you have a stealing opportunity.

A few playable hands, which are not mentioned, fall somewhere in between these two - K9 suited, for example, has a value perhaps somewhere close to KJ off.  (But it should be noted that KJ off is not nearly such a strong hand as most beginners would tend to think.)

===Big pairs   (AA KK QQ)===

These cards are a favourite against any hand (except a higher big pair) and must be played aggressively preflop.  The general idea is to make as big a pot as possible with as few opponents as possible - which means that you should very rarely slowplay these hands, unless you are playing opponents who know your style, in which case occasional slowplaying has some value.  However, there are three general rules for these hands in small tournaments: raise, reraise and all in.

Post-flop, by contrast, pays to be careful.  If the pot is small relative to your stack, you are probably only going to find all of your chips in the middle when you are beaten - after all, all you normally have is a one pair hand.  The main worries are overcards, a high pair on the board, or a flop with three cards to a straight or flush, especially a high straight like Q-J-T.  Knowing when to push for maximum value against someone with top pair or a smaller overpair, when to make a player pay for a draw, and when to slow down or throw your hand away is a question of experience.

===High cards (AK AQ AJ KQ AT KJ QJ KT)===

Post flop, the hope with these hands is to make top pair, ideally with top kicker.  For example, if you play AJ and the flop comes J 8 4 of 3 different suits then you are leading against most hands, such as KJ and QJ.  By raising preflop you should eliminate hands such as J8 and 44, or at least make them pay exorbitantly to hit their hand, and so you only need to worry about a player holding 88, JJ or higher.  It is standard practice to bet strongly with top pair here, to make it unprofitable for an opponent with T9 to draw for a straight, and avoid someone hitting an overpair.  T.J. Cloutier has said that 'Hold'em is a game of top pair, top kicker.'

Ace-King should be regarded in a different category from the other hands, since every time it hits it makes top pair, top kicker with minimal possibility of an overpair.  The other hands should be played much more carefully, especially in a raised pot, and especially in a full ring game, where a dominating hand is present much more often than you might think.

===Small and medium suited connectors (JT T9 98 … 43; QT J9 … 53; Q9, all suited)===

Numerically adjacent cards of the same suit are less likely to make a playable hand on the flop than two big cards.  However, when they do make a hand it is usually a very strong one such as a flush, straight, two pair or trips.  While pot odds rarely favour these hands, no limit holdem is a game of implied odds, and making that type of hand can easily allow you to double through.  Against good players they have the additional advantage of making your play less predictable.

With suited connectors the main aim is to enter a pot cheaply against a number of opponents and from a good position, usually either on or one off the button.  With an open-ended straight or flush draw the player will often make a bet called a semi-bluff.  If they are called then they are probably behind, but on drawing the correct card it may be possible to force a player with a hand as weak as top pair-top kicker to move all in.

Suited connectors have the most value in full ring games and with low blinds.  The true connectors, with no gap between them, are more valuable because they are more likely to make a straight.  However the one-gap connectors sometimes gain value from being more deceptive.  The medium, offsuit connectors such as JT and T9 may also be playable in late position.  The smaller offsuit connectors are trash hands from any position.

The medium connectors are excellent hands to find in late position in an unraised pot, since many players are often holding lower connectors, small pairs, and (especially in online play) high-low combinations, where the medium connectors have a distinct edge.  In raised pots the small connectors may become more valuable than the medium ones, however.  For example, if a player raises with AQ and another calls with AK, then a 65 suited will be quite a playable hand in a showdown, since the AQ is such a big underdog.  (There are pathological cases where the 65 can actually be a favourite in a showdown over the AK here.)  Better yet, a flop like A-K-6 will not lose many chips for the player with 65... while a flop like K-6-5 could be quite expensive for the player with AK.  By contrast, a QT would be a very bad hand to have.

===Suited rag aces (Ax suited)===

The ace with a low suited kicker plays very similarly to suited connectors.  While pairing the ace is useful, it can easily cause problems when outkicked by a dominating premium ace, and should be played more like middle pair than top pair.  The idea, however, is to flop a flush draw.  While many inexperienced players will play any two suited cards in the hope of this happening, suited aces have unique advantages here.  

Most obviously, when making an ace-high flush you may have the nuts, and you will break any player with a lower flush.  Also, when the flop brings a flush draw there are two scenarios; there is no ace, in which case you have a flush draw and an overcard, or there is an ace, in which case you have top pair with a flush draw.  This means you have 12 cards to improve your hand above the current top pair by making a flush, pair of aces, or two pair.  This gives a very good chance of winning a showdown.  Unfortunately, the flush is so obvious that it will take very good play to extract maximum value from a solid, conservative player.

It is worth bearing in mind that an ace with a wheel card (2, 3, 4 or 5) is a stronger drawing hand than an A6 or A7.  You may flop a straight, or a flush draw with an inside straight draw, a genuine monster draw with 15 outs over a pair of kings.

===Small and medium pairs (JJ TT .. 22)===

The medium pairs, JJ through 88, are often the hardest hands to play.  For example, suppose a player raised in early position and you called with 99.  The flop comes 8-5-3, and the opponent bets.  It is clearly unlikely that they have paired the flop, since they raised; if they have a pocket pair of eights then they have a set; if they have a higher pair then you are a massive underdog.  All you can beat is a bluff, and even against two overcards you are only a 3-to-1 favourite.  So, the medium pairs require very careful handling after the flop unless you hit a set.  At the same time they are a little too good to throw away to a single raise, and certainly good enough to raise with.  In fact they may be re-raising hands against an aggressive player.

With lower pairs, 77 through 22, hitting an overpair is increasingly unlikely, and they are played more as drawing hands.  The standard plan is to enter the pot as cheaply as possible and with good position, try to make a set on the flop, and release the hand upon failing to hit.  The pair will make a set approximately 12% of the time, which is enough to pay off handsomely, especially since it is nearly impossible to tell whether or not someone has made a set from the cards on the board.

===Trash hands (Almost everything else)===

Trash hands are trash not because they cannot win - any two cards can win, especially in a game where you normally do not show down a hand - but because it is so difficult to make a hand which you can play strongly on the flop.  Take K7 off suit.  When pairing the king it cannot really be played as top pair because of the poor kicker.  When pairing the 7 it is unlikely to be top pair, and also unlikely to remain as top pair once the turn and river have been dealt.  Making two pair can be very profitable, but with only a few percent chance of flopping two pair even the implied odds cannot justify the play.

As a result, trash hands are only playable under certain circumstances.  One is a common scenario at the final table of tournaments.  The blinds are high, giving you little chance to select premium hands, and the table is shorthanded.  This forces gambling play.  By the time a tournament gets down to two players it may be normal to go all-in on being dealt a K7.  They are also playable for a call or check from the blinds in an unraised pot.

It is also possible to play them simply because your position at the table makes playing any two cards advantageous.  This normally occurs when you are the dealer and the players in front of you have passed.  If you are an experienced player or have weak or conservative opponents in the blinds then it can be profitable to play simply for the opportunity to bluff.

Outside the blinds, it is vital to raise when playing these hands preflop, not call.  By raising you give yourself the opportunity to steal the blinds as well as the best chance of finding yourself heads-up, where it is easiest to win with the worst hand. Also, limping in where you cannot call a raise is rarely a good strategy.  This approach  works for some of the best players in the modern game such as Daniel Negranu and Gus Hansen, but it is extremely difficult for inexperienced players, who should normally stick to more playable hands.

==Pre-Flop Tactics==

There is a wide range of pre-flop tactics aimed at winning the pot outright or at least narrowing the range of remaining players before the flop.

===The Button Steal===

While any raise preflop can be seen as an attempt to win the blinds, there is one scenario where it is especially profitable.  This is the previously mentioned situation of having every player before you pass when you are on the button.  If the small and big blind will both fold to a raise of twice the big blind two times out of three then the third time is effectively a freeroll, and a freeroll with good position.  Late game in high level tournaments is dominated by attempts to steal the blinds in this fashion.  Of course, it is possible to steal from positions other than the button, but having late position is very desirable.

===The Squeeze===

The squeeze is best demonstrated by example.  Suppose a player raised and was called in front of you.  A reraise here will place the original raiser in a difficult situation.  They have no way of knowing what the original caller will do, and any chips they place in the pot may have to be surrendered to an all-in by a large pair or similar.  As a result, a good player will not call without a huge hand.  This move almost always either wins the pot outright, or sweetens it and moves to heads-up.  Even some conservative players will make this move with marginal hands such as suited connectors and small pairs.

===The Limp-Reraise===

This tactic is exactly what it sounds like - you limp into the pot, an opponent raises, and you make a big reraise.  This tactic is somewhat frequently used by novice players when the are dealt AA or perhaps KK from an early position.  However, a thinking player could use this play in a variety of situations.  For example, let's say that you are dealt JT suited from a relatively early position, you limp in, another player limps in, and an aggressive player puts in a small to medium sized raise from the button.  If the blinds fold, you should occasionally raise in this spot.  If you do raise, the player who limped after you will almost always fold, and since the button is aggressive and has position, he could easily have a semi-strong hand that he is now forced to fold.  Even if he does call, you still have a disguised holding plus you will get first shot at the pot on the flop.  Three things to understand:  Only use this play on occasion; do not restrict this play to the times when you have a huge hand; try to use this play only against players who may raise with marginal holdings.

===Stealing from the Blinds=== 

This is another play that is best illustrated by example:  A few players limp into the pot; you put in a big raise from the small blind or big blind; everyone folds and you scoop the pot.  This play actually works more often than it sounds like it should.  The best circumstances are when two or three players who like to limp with many different hands enter the pot from middle position and late position, AND when you have a hand that is completely worthless.  The play is wasted when you have a hand that you would like to see a cheap flop with, which may develop into something big (like a suited connector or small pair).  Note that this play also disguises your raises with very good hands.  If the only time that you raise is when you have a big pair or a big A-high, you will be too easily read by your opponents.

==Post Flop Play==

=== Reasons to Bet, Check and Call ===

One of the main mistakes beginners make is acting without a reason.  Or rather, acting with a reason that has to do with their cards rather than with gaining chips.

The main reasons to bet and raise are:

* To gain value

This is the simplest reason.  You have a hand, and you think that your opponent may have a worse hand '''with which they can pay you off'''.  Value bets are the heart of poker.

* To force a better hand to fold

Bluffing, discussed in detail later.  Your chances of winning a showdown are slim, so avoid one.

* To protect a hand 

Almost any hand can be outdrawn, and it is often important to force your opponent to pay for the privilege.  How important this is depends on your hand, the board and your opponent's range of hands.

* To gain information

Betting and raising purely for information is a technical mistake - you are betting in a situation where the bet will not generate income.  However, it may be correct to make a small mistake to avoid a large one later.


The main reasons to check are to:

* Induce a bluff or misrepresent your hand

This might be slowplaying, or it might not in a normal sense; you might check a middle pair to induce a bluff.

* Keep the pot small

If it's not clear whether you are ahead or behind, or are 1 card away from making your hand, why actively build a bigger pot?  Checking a hand down might be a good option in this case because you can bow out if someone (or a few) raise.  Also, having more players in the hand means that your bets vs the total pot are less costly vs the odds of improving your hand.

* Take a free card

In position, especially against a tricky, trapsetting opponent, you might be better off seeing if the next card improves your hand when they check to you.  Out of position you cannot guarantee a free card, of course.

* Gain information

Sometimes, against certain opponents, you might gain more information by checking than by betting.  Be aware of these times.

The reasons for calling might be related to a number of the above - but generally, call when neither folding or raising seems like a good option.

These may seem like simple principles, but balancing them in the many different situations of hold'em is one of the keys to post-flop play.

=== Evaluating the Strength of a Hand ===

There are several factors which affect how strong a hand is besides its face value.

The more superior hands which can be made or drawn to from the flop, the weaker the hand.  Two black aces are excellent preflop, but on a flop of Q J T suited in hearts it becomes a very mediocre holding against the possible flush, straight, two-pair, set and straight flush combinations.

More players in a pot also weakens a hand.  Top pair jacks, ace kicker may be excellent heads-up, but it is far less likely to stand up with 5 players, and almost dead if those players are allowed to remain for the turn and river.

A hand becomes stronger when the amount in the pot is high in relation to the maximum you can lose.  All-in with top pair is normal when the pot is similar in size to your stack, but suicidal with a ratio of 20:1.

Also, in tournaments the size of the blinds in relation to your stack is an important factor.  A shortstack must judge whether it is worth waiting for a better opportunity to double through with a lower stack, or worth making a move now with a weaker hand.

===Evaluating the Strength of an Opponent's Hand===

The first thing to do on the flop is to evaluate whether the opponent has made a hand.  As a rule of thumb, remember this: against one opponent, you will be correct in assuming they missed the flop two times out of three.  If the flop has a pair, it is even more likely that the flop did not help their hand.  Against more than one opponent, you will be wrong two times out of three or more.

Position is the most useful tool in judging their strength.  If they are forced to act before you and check, and if they have no history of check-raising or slowplaying, then it is safe to assume that they hold no hand.  This is not necessarily true if the flop came A K Q -- they may be worried about your hand, or they may have flopped the nuts.

On the other hand, with a flop like 7 5 2, a bet may not mean much, especially if the opponent considers you a tight player.  This type of bluff on a rag flop is so common as to hardly be considered a bluff; they may be simply protecting an ace-high.  

===Bluffing===

The game of poker cannot be played correctly against rational opponents without bluffing.  Of course, not all opponents are rational.  If you find an opponent who invariably calls any reasonable bet on the flop and beyond, then only bet if you have a strong hand -- this sounds obvious, but it is something so alien to many players that world champions have been known to struggle in small stake, friendly games.

There are 3 ways in which bluffing pays off:

*The opponent folds.
*The opponent calls, and you then draw out to a stronger hand against them.
*The opponent calls with a stronger hand, sees the bluff, you lose, but the opponent is more inclined to call bets in future because of it.

Against good opponents it may be that the last of these is actually the most profitable.  

It is very difficult to establish how often you should bluff.  Mathematically, a bet of half the pot breaks even if the opponent(s) fold one time in three, and a pot-sized bet breaks even if they fold half the time, '''based only on the possibility of them folding'''.  Heads up against a conservative, inexperienced  player it may well be profitable to make the first bet on the flop regardless of your hand.  It certainly simplifies decision-making.

The main cost of bluffing on the flop is probably the opportunity cost of slowplaying.  Checking with a very strong hand is something of a tell if you have bet the last 40 flops.

===Slowplaying===
Slowplaying, or trapping, is one of the most dangerous moves in Hold'em.  The principle is to check after making a good hand, allowing the opponent to either bluff at the pot or improve their hand slightly on the next card.

The problem is that the opponent may find themselves drawing to a better hand than yours.  Unless you are able to make some painful laydowns it is important to only trap with hands which are quite unlikely to be outdrawn, given the texture of the flop.

== Flop strategy ==

=== Immediate winners ===

Immediate winners (also known as &quot;monsters&quot;) include nut hands that are impossible to beat (any four of a kind or better, any nut straight or better). With these hands, the imperative is to make as much money as possible. Betting big will scare most players out of the game with many of them guessing your hand, so slowplaying all the way to the showdown is advised. Call very often, but make middle-sized bets if nobody else is inclined to bet. Loose players will often follow you with draws and weaker made hands. You should almost never raise with immediate winners unless you're sure the opponents will call, since your goal is to maximize your winnings. These hands are virtual cheques for the pot and you should almost never fast-play them. Note: beware the nut straight, a connected card on the turn can re-position the nuts!

=== Non-nut winners ===

Non-nut winners include non-nut straight or better. These hands include:
* full houses with xxy-shaped flop and lower-ranking card making your trips &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: 99J, hand: J9 (nut: JJ)
* full houses with xxx-shaped flop and KK or lower in the hole &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: TTT, hand: QQ (nut: Tx)
* flushes where you don't have the highest card in the suit not on the table present in your hand &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: A72, hand: QJ (king is missing!)
* outside straights where you don't have the next two cards higher-ranked than three on the table &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: QJT, hand: K9 (nut: AK)
* gapped straights where you don't have the gap card and the higher next higher-ranked card &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: 986, hand: 75 (nut: T7)

With non-nut winners you have two strategies available: either scare the opponents outright by making large bets or delay that action until the turn. Should a player follow, be prepared to back your hand to the all-in. You should use the first strategy when there are plenty of scare cards possible on the turn and the possibility of completed bigger draws is higher. The second strategy is advisable if the turn doesn't pose a danger. In both cases you must know when to fold.

=== Trips ===

==== Sets ====

Sets are trips where you have the pair in you hand (a pocket pair). The top set is the set where your pocket pair pairs the highest card in the flop. Likewise, at the middle set the middle card is paired and at the lower set the lower card. All sets are very good hands, but seeing the turn is something you want to avoid, since you only have one nut out and many more cards will be scare cards. Nevertheless, a set can be a good hand at the showdown, but it's way more profitable to get out of trouble before the turn. Make large bets (even doubling the pot is okay) to push the opponents out of the pot. Alternatively, if the board doesn't have consecutive cards or cards of same color (unconnected), you can try slow-playing and make people with weaker but still good hands stay in. A set is a great hand, but a low set has to be protected. You should play more passively with top and middle sets, but don't let your betting become predictable.

==== Flopped trips ====

Flopped trips is trips where you have one card in the hole and two in the flop. It is similar to a set, but not as good. Trips are usually slow-played so as not to scare everyone out of the game. (Usually, if you encounter a paired flop, you should be suspicious of a full house or a four of a kind. In this case you should be looking for these hands in other players.) But if the board is connected, be aggressive.

=== Two pair ===

For the purpose of determining the flop strategy, a two pair requires that you have one card of each pair in the hand and one on the table. Two pair where you have a pocket pair and the board is paired is not a good hand and you should never count paired flops toward your two pair.

==== Top two pair and &quot;rags &amp; riches&quot; two pair ====

The top two pair has both top and middle flop card paired with the hole, while the &quot;rags &amp; riches&quot; two pair has the top and bottom card paired. Both are to be slow-played under ideal conditions (uncoordinated board, no hint about immediate winners available from other players). If you see a possible straight or a flush on the board, bet high and raise to scare off drawing hands. Two pair is good, but you're in fact drawing to a full house. You may stay to the showdown, but make sure in most cases you'll be beat by then.

==== Bottom two pair ====

Since the cards you play that are low enough to make the bottom two pair possible, are usually connected, you'll get dangerous flops. Make sure the drawers get out before the turn. There's also the possibility of top card being paired and thus making everyone a top pair and degrading your hand to the level of middle pair, low kicker. This advice is also valid for the &quot;rags &amp; riches&quot; two pair.

=== Pocket pairs ===

Pocket pairs are pairs where both cards are in the hole.

==== Overpair ====

Overpair is a pocket pair bigger than the top card in the flop. When you have the biggest overpairs (pocket aces or kings), slow-play and pretend you bluffed. If you're against multiple opponents, try to filter them out, since the value of an overpair decreases with each new community card. If the overpair isn't that big (usually TT-QQ), bet more aggressively since your overpair isn't that good anymore. Be wary of flops with straight and/or flush draws. If someone chases you persistently at such a flop, you'll probably end up against a made hand or an even-money draw.

==== 2nd pair ====

The 2nd pair is a pocket pair between the top card and the middle card. It is a usual bet/fold position. When in a late position and it's checked to you, take the free card. A strong player betting in front of you probably means he has something better than a 2nd pair. If you get raised after you've bet, fold unless you're absolutely sure it's a loose player drawing.

==== 3rd pair ====

3rd pair is below the middle flop card. Check/fold or make a position bet if it's checked to you and the pair is above the bottom flop card. Do not call any bets or raises. This is a hand where you're hoping to get to the turn for free and get two pair or an unlikely trips. 

=== Split pairs ===

Split pairs are pairs where you have one card in your hand and the other one in the flop. They aren't necessarily worse than pocket pairs, but the kicker is crucial.

==== Top pair ====

Top pair, top kicker (sometimes known as TPTK) is the best split pair possible. If you don't see imminent danger (such as a connected flop), slow-play. Else, bet big and try to force everyone out. The only thing is that you have to make sure you don't get carried away by a leading bettor who has obviously beaten you, but you're still holding on to the TPTK. TPTK is not a miracle hand and definitely not an immediate winner. Any overpair or even two pair is way better and you shouldn't hold on to the old pair to the showdown if you don't improve your hand in the meantime. Beware overpairs if you don't have additional outs in your hand (e.g. straight or flush draw).

==== Middle pair ====

A middle pair is a pair involving the middle flop card. If you get a middle pair, you should either bet or check/fold, depending on the playing conditions. It is a big advantage here to have an ace kicker. With an Ax hand, you can play more freely and usually take a free card when possible, since you want to get two pair, trips or a flush draw. If you get two pair, you can dominate the overcards, if you get trips, you can dominate the other player with the trips by your ace kicker, if you get a flush, your ace will guarantee you a win etc. However, if you have a worse kicker, play less aggressively and don't take much free cards. Should a tight opponent bet, fold.

==== Bottom pair ====

This is the worst split pair. Of course, the advice is to play very passively. If anyone bets, fold. In most cases you'll lose a bottom pair on the showdown, so your goal is to improve. You have only 5 outs to improve. If you decide to bluff and bet with a hand like this, do not make it a costly habit. If you're last to act and the table seems quiet, take a free card.

=== Draws ===

The opposite of made hands, draws are hands where you're aiming at a combination such as a straight or a flush, but you have only 4 cards necessary. You're aiming to get the fifth one either at turn or at river. If you have only 3 cards, you have a backdoor draw. The only feasible backdoor draw is a backdoor flush draw, getting you 1-2 outs. A backdoor straight draw is worthless. A nut draw is a draw to a nut hand.

Draws with 9 or more outs are generally good. Do not call here, make some action. 12 nut outs (ace-flush draw) are usually enough for a 50% turn &amp; river chance, making you an even-money bet against a random opponent. The more opponents you have, the higher your calling odds are. You should remember not to &quot;draw dead&quot; (i.e. when you're drawing to a straight and it seems obvious someone has already got a flush). Also, beware of dead outs (your own outs that also help your opponents).

You should be more careful if you're not drawing to a nut hand. In that case, you could often by showdown find yourself against a better hand, even if you complete your draw. If you have a mid-to-late position and a rather good draw, try to make a middle-sized bet to take the pot outright.

If you have less than 9 outs, the pot odds become the imperative here. Do not call scare bets, you'll be wasting your money.

=== Big overcards ===

Big overcards are strong preflop holdings (AKs, AQs, AK, KQs, AQ, AJs) against a flop with no face cards with no made hand and no 4-card draws in sight. Be careful when playing with these against strong players as they know this is one of your most frequent hands. Sometimes try to pass it off as an overpair, but don't do it too frequently. Don't play this hand against more than two opponents.

=== Other hands ===

Anything not mentioned here is usually not even worth a bluff. Check/fold as you'll usually lose with such bad hands. Playing something like this is OK only on a late stage of a tournament.

== [[/Components of a computer/]] ==

The following sections will introduce various concepts in computer programming.  There are some simplifications in the explanations below.  Don't take anything too literally.

== Programming Languages ==

The purpose of programming is to tell the computer what to do.  Computers are better at doing some things than you are, like a chef is better at cooking than you are.  It's easier to tell a chef to cook you a meal than to cook it yourself.  The more precise you are in your request, the more your meal will turn out how you like it.  In most scenarios like this in real life, small amounts of ambiguity and misinterpretation are acceptable. Perhaps the chef will boil your potato before mashing it instead of baking it.  With computers, however, ambiguity is rarely acceptable.  Programs are so complex that if the computer just guessed at the meaning of ambiguous or vague requests, it might cause problems so subtle that you'd never find them.  Programming languages, therefore, have been designed to accept only completely clear and unambiguous statements.  The program might still have problems, but the blame is then squarely on you, not on the computer's guess.  Much of the difficulty in programming comes from having to be perfectly precise and detailed about everything instead of just giving high-level instructions.

Some languages require total and complete detail about everything.  C and C++ are such languages, and are called '''''low-level languages'''''.  Other languages will make all sorts of assumptions, and this lets the programmer specify less detail.  Python and Basic are such languages, and are called '''''high-level languages'''''.  In general, high-level languages are easier to program but give you less control.  Control is sometimes important, for example if you want your program to run as quickly as possible.  Most of the time total control and speed aren't necessary, and as computers get faster high-level languages become more popular.  Here we will deal exclusively with high-level languages.  Low-level languages are generally similar except there's often more lines of code to write to accomplish the same thing.

== Statements ==

Most programming languages have the concept of a statement.  A '''''statement''''' is a command that the programmer gives to the computer.  For example:

    print &quot;Hi there!&quot;

This command has a verb (&quot;print&quot;) and other details (what to print).  In this case, the command &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;show on the screen,&quot; not &quot;print on the printer.&quot;  The programmer either gives the statement directly to the computer (by typing it while running a special program), or creates a text file with the command in it.  You could create a file called &quot;hi.txt&quot; using a program like Notepad, put the above command in it, and give the file to the computer.  (The details of how to do all this are language- and system-specific, so they won't be covered here.  This is just an introduction to the concepts.)

If you have more than one command in the file, each will be performed in order, top to bottom.  So the file could contain:

    print &quot;Hi there!&quot;
    print &quot;Strange things are afoot...&quot;

The computer will perform each of these commands sequentially.  It's invaluable to be able to &quot;play computer&quot; when programming.  Ask yourself, &quot;If I were the computer, what would I do with these statements?&quot;  If you're not sure what the answer is, then you are very likely to write incorrect programs.  Stop and check the manual for the programming language you're using.

In the above case, the computer will look at the first statement, determine that it's a &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; statement, look at what needs to be printed, and display that text on the computer screen.  It'll look like this:

    Hi there!

Note that the quotation marks aren't there.  Their purpose in the program is to tell the computer where the text begins and ends, just like in English prose.  The computer will then continue to the next statement, perform its command, and the screen will look like this:

    Hi there!
    Strange things are afoot...

When the computer gets to the end of the text file, it stops and waits for further instructions. There are many different kinds of statements, depending on which programming language is being used.  For example, there could be a &lt;tt&gt;beep&lt;/tt&gt; statement that causes the computer to output a beep on its speaker, or a &lt;tt&gt;window&lt;/tt&gt; statement that causes a new window to pop up.

Also, the way statements are written will vary depending on the programming language.  The programming language Python uses statements that look like the above.  In C you would write:

    puts(&quot;Hi there!&quot;);
    puts(&quot;Strange things are afoot...&quot;);

Note a few differences:
# The parameters (the text in quotation marks that &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; uses to determine what to display) are surrounded by parentheses.
# Each statement is terminated by a semicolon.
# The verb &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; is called &lt;tt&gt;puts&lt;/tt&gt;, for &quot;put string&quot;.  The word '''''string''''' is the computer term for some text.  It comes from &quot;a string of letters.&quot;  The &quot;put&quot; means &quot;put on the screen.&quot;
These differences are fairly superficial.  The set of rules like the first two is called a programming language's '''''syntax'''''.  The set of verbs is called its '''''library'''''.

== Syntax ==

All computer languages have syntax, rules to create proper statements, just like natural languages do.  For example, most sentences are ended with a full stop or a period.  Likewise it is common for statements in source code to be ended with a semicolon, but many languages do not have this requirement so it is important to know the syntax of the language you are programming in.  For example, if you wanted the computer to display two different things you could write:

    print &quot;I have a dog.  His name is Bort.&quot;

or you could write:

    print &quot;I have a dog.  &quot; + &quot;His name is Bort.&quot;

The second example has two strings, each enclosed in quotation marks.  There's a plus (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;) sign in between them, which means, &quot;Attach the two strings together, turning them into a single string.&quot;  (Attaching two strings is called '''''concatenation'''''.)  The two above statements will display the same thing:

    I have a dog.  His name is Bort.

In the above examples there's no reason why you'd use a &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; and two strings when you could just use a single string, as in the first example, but below there will be cases where concatenation of strings is necessary.  The languages Python and Java use plus (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;) for string concatenation, Perl and PHP use the period (&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;), and Visual Basic uses ampersand (&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;).  Again, these differences are superficial; what's important is the concept of string concatenation and of language syntax to do things like concatenation.  Separate in your mind an underlying concept and a particular language's way of expressing that concept.

When programs are compiled, or converted into an executable program, they are analyzed by a parser, the equivalent of a proofreader, to determine if the syntax is correct.  Assuming the program's source code is syntactically correct, the compiler will continue to analyze the source code to determine if there are any semantical errors.

Semantics refers to the meaning or logic of a computer program.  Two syntactically correct statements can make perfect sense by themselves, but they may not make sense when placed next to each other.  Sometimes these flaws in logic can be detected by the compiler, what is known as a compile-time error, but typically these errors surface when the program is executed, known as run-time errors.

Observe the following conversation:
 Alice: Terrible news.  Carl's wife was in a car accident.
 Bob: Oh, that is terrible.  Send some nice flowers and get everyone to sign a card.
 Alice: Sure.  Oh, and Dan called in sick again.
 Bob: Not again.  Send him a pink slip.
The conversation makes perfect, logical sense.  This conversation shows a good, consistent use of semantics.

Now observe this conversation:
 Alice: Terrible news.  Carl's wife was in a car accident.
 Bob: Not again.  Send him a pink slip.
 Alice: Sure.  Oh, and Dan called in sick again.
 Bob: Oh, that is terrible.  Send some nice flowers and get everyone to sign a card.
Although this conversation contains the exact same sentences as the previous one, it has a very different meaning.  A human may be able to bend the rules of grammar and structure to determine the intended meaning of a conversation, but computers are not as flexible.  Therefore, it is important to use proper syntax and use good semantics in order to properly convey to the computer what you want it to do.  Understand though, that the first conversation could have been rearranged and still have the same meaning or different sentences could have been used to convey the same idea.  In that sense there can be many different ways to write the same program.

== Variables ==

Say you had a program that talked about your dog.  It might look like this:

    print &quot;I have a dog.  It is called Bort.&quot;
    print &quot;Bort likes to eat dog food.&quot;
    print &quot;My children and Bort get along very well.&quot;
    print &quot;My dog Bort barks at my neighbor, whose name is also Bort.&quot;

You might go on like this for a while, asking the computer to display many such interesting things about your dog.  If, one day, you changed your dog's name, or instead wanted to talk about your other dog, or gave this program to a friend and they wanted to change it to refer to their own dog, you'd have to go through the whole program and change every occurrence of &quot;Bort&quot; to the new name.  You could use your text editor's search-and-replace feature to do this, but doing so is tedious and you might make mistakes.  For example, you might accidentally replace the neighbor's name when you only intended to change the dog's name.

Programming languages solve this problem by allowing you to write the dog's name only once and then refer to it using a label.  This is a bit like using pronouns in natural languages.  So you could write:

    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;

If you're &quot;playing computer&quot; and get to the above statement, you'll think, &quot;Remember the string &quot;Bort&quot;, and whenever the word ''dog'' is used, substitute the word &quot;Bort&quot;.&quot;  This is called an '''''assignment statement''''' because you're assigning meaning to the word ''dog''.  A subsequent statement could say:

    print dog

Note that there are no quotation marks here.  You don't literally want to print the word &quot;dog&quot;, you want the computer to remember the string it had previously associated with that word.  It's a bit like the distinction between saying &quot;He said his age&quot; and &quot;He said, 'his age'.&quot;  In the first case it's a number and in the second it's the words &quot;his age&quot;.  The word ''dog'' is a '''''variable'''''.  It's a symbol that the computer associates with something else, in this case the word &quot;Bort&quot;.  Our original program can now be written as:

    print &quot;I have a dog.  It is called &quot; + dog + &quot;.&quot;
    print dog + &quot; likes to eat dog food.&quot;
    print &quot;My children and &quot; + dog + &quot; get along very well.&quot;
    print &quot;My dog &quot; + dog + &quot; barks at my neighbor, whose name is Bort.&quot;

Note that string concatenation (using the plus sign) was necessary here, since sometimes we wanted to use quotation marks (to mean literal text) and sometimes we didn't (to refer to the variable).  The computer will see a statement like:

    print dog + &quot; likes to eat dog food.&quot;

and first substitute the word ''dog'' with the string &quot;Bort&quot;:

    print &quot;Bort&quot; + &quot; likes to eat dog food.&quot;

then concatenate the strings:

    print &quot;Bort likes to eat dog food.&quot;

then perform the statement, displaying this on the screen:

    Bort likes to eat dog food.

Note also that the name of the neighbor was not replaced by a reference to ''dog''.  The variable ''dog'' refers to the name of the dog.  That's the whole point of using the variable: to keep track of a specific concept.  You could have a different variable to keep track of the neighbor's name:

    neighbor = &quot;Bort&quot;

and change the last line of our program to:

    print &quot;My dog &quot; + dog + &quot; barks at my neighbor, whose name is &quot; + neighbor + &quot;.&quot;

That way you can change the name of your dog or your neighbor easily at the top of the file and the rest of the program will run correctly.  I removed the word &quot;also&quot; from the line since, now that we're using variables, I can no longer be sure that the two names are the same.  I wouldn't want to change one of the two and have my program still display the word &quot;also&quot; there.  Later we'll see a way of displaying the word &quot;also&quot; only if the two names are the same.

It's important to remember two things about variables.  Firstly, a variable must be set before it is used.  So you must write:

    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;
    print dog

and not:

    print dog                             (Wrong!)
    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;

Remember when &quot;playing computer&quot; that you must look at each statement individually and in order from top to bottom.  In the second example above you would first get to the &quot;print dog&quot; statement and have no idea what the variable ''dog'' was referring to.  Different languages react differently when they run into this problem.  Some just assume the variable is an empty string (&quot;&quot;), but most stop the program and report the error.

Secondly, when you're &quot;playing computer&quot; and see the second line of the correct program:

    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;
    print dog

it's very important that you don't &quot;go back up&quot; to the first line to see what ''dog'' refers to.  The first line is long gone.  You can only look at one line at a time, and always sequentially.  The first line makes a note somewhere (in memory) that ''dog'' refers to &quot;Bort&quot;, but then the line itself is left behind and forgotten.  The second line checks memory and gets the variable's meaning there, not from the first line directly.  This may seem like a trivial distinction, but we'll use variables in more sophisticated ways later and it won't work to &quot;go back up&quot; to find where a variable was set; you'll need to think of the variable and its value as being stored in memory.

The word ''variable'' implies that variables can change, and indeed they can.  You could write the following program:

    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;
    print &quot;My first dog was called &quot; + dog + &quot;.&quot;
    dog = &quot;Milou&quot;
    print &quot;And my second dog was called &quot; + dog + &quot;.&quot;

The computer will see the first line, associate the string &quot;Bort&quot; with the variable ''dog'', use that string in the second line, change the association of the variable ''dog'' to &quot;Milou&quot; in the third line, and use the new association in the fourth.  In memory the variable ''dog'' can only be associated with one string.  The third line above replaces the old association with the new.  The second and fourth lines look into memory to see what that association is, and at each statement the value is different because the value in memory is different at that point in the program's execution.  You'll see:

    My first dog was called Bort.
    And my second dog was called Milou.

== Math ==

When the computer sees a mathematical expression, it performs the arithmetic automatically.  For example, you can write:

    print 5 + 6

Note again that there are no quotation marks.  If there were, the computer would take that literally and print &quot;5 + 6&quot;.  The plus sign is called an '''''operator''''' because it performs operations on other values.  When the computer sees the above line, it will perform the arithmetic and get:

    print 11

Executing the statement will just print the number:

    11

Note that the following two statements will display the same thing:

    print 11
    print &quot;11&quot;

except that in the first case the computer knows it's a number, whereas in the second case it's just a string.  Sometimes that distinction matters, but we can ignore it for now.  The math can get pretty complicated:

    print (5 + 12) * 9 / 14

The computer would perform the arithmetic step by step, just like you would in your head.  It would first do the addition, since it's in parentheses:

    print 17 * 9 / 14

Then the multiplication, since it's on the left:

    print 153 / 14

Then the division:

    print 10

And you'd see this if you ran the original line:

    10

Note that 153 divided by 14 is actually something like 10.928, but the computer printed the round number below the real value.  That's because there are two kinds of numbers most languages deal with: integers and reals.  '''''Integers''''' are round numbers, like the ones above.  '''''Reals''''' are numbers with a decimal point, like 10.928.  When the computer sees an expression using entirely integers, it keeps using integers to do the math, even if the result really should be a real.  Had we written:

    print (5.0 + 12.0) * 9.0 / 14.0

then the computer would have performed the math using reals and we would have seen something like this printed:

    10.9285714286

This is a quirky result of the historical development of computers.  It can lead to bizarre results, like this line:

    print 1 / 2

displaying &quot;0&quot; instead of the expected &quot;0.5&quot;.  There are times when the current behavior is desirable, but often it's not and you should keep the distinction between integers and reals in mind.  Also note that the above rules about integers and reals apply to most commonly-used programming languages, but each language is free to make up its own rules for dealing with numbers, and you may one day use a language that does things differently, such as making &quot;1 / 2&quot; result in &quot;0.5&quot;.

Variables can be used to refer to numbers as well as strings.  You could write:

    x = 5
    print x

to print &quot;5&quot;.  Or you could write:

    age = 33
    print age * 2

to find out twice your age.  Again here the first line creates in memory an association between the variable whose name is ''age'' with the number 33.  The second line looks into memory, grabs the number associated with ''age'', and performs the arithmetic.  Note that the first line is not algebra.  It's not an equation that makes ''age'' and the number 33 the same.  It's an ''assignment'' of the value 33 to the variable ''age''.  The distinction is important when you see a line like:

    x = x + 5

The above line is impossible in algebra.  The value of ''x'' cannot be equal to the value of ''x'' plus five.  But in a programming language, the line reads as, &quot;Find the value of the variable ''x'' in memory, add 5 to it, then associate the result with the variable ''x''.&quot;  The fact that ''x'' is used both in the math expression on the right of the equal sign and as the place to store the results is irrelevant.  Its value is used in the math expression ''before'' the result is stored back into the variable.  Here's another example:

    x = 5
    y = x + 2
    print x
    print y

You'll get:

    5
    7

But now if you write:

    x = 5
    y = x + 2
    x = 10
    print x
    print y

You'll get:

    10
    7

Go through each line and &quot;play computer&quot; to convince yourself of why the above would behave this way.  Use a piece of paper to keep track of the ''x'' and ''y'' variables if you need to.  If the above isn't clear, stop and re-read this section or the one on variables.  This is a very common stumbling block for new programmers.

You might have noticed that we use the plus (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;) symbol to mean both &quot;string concatenation&quot; and &quot;numerical addition&quot;.  This is fine and usually clear, but what should the computer do with a statement like this:

    print &quot;5&quot; + 6

Should the numbers 5 and 6 be added to yield 11?  Should the string &quot;5&quot; be concatenated with the string &quot;6&quot; to yield &quot;56&quot;?  Should the computer stop and report an error?  Each language deals with this ambiguity in different ways.  In Python, the above line would be an error.  You'd have to explicitly tell the computer which interpretation you wanted.  In Java the &quot;6&quot; would be turned into a string, resulting in the string &quot;56&quot;.  In Perl, PHP, and Visual Basic the string concatenation operator is not plus, it's period for Perl and PHP and ampersand in Visual Basic, so it's always clear what needs to be done based on which operator is used.

== Conditionals ==

Say we had a simple program that displayed your age:

    age = 25
    print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;

If you ran this program it would display:

    You are 25 years old.

Next year you could change the first line to &quot;age = 26&quot; and the program's output would update appropriately.  In fact you could give this program to anyone and they could modify the first line so that the second line would print the right age.  Once you turned 30 you might want to modify it like this:

    age = 30
    print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;
    print &quot;Your warranty has expired!&quot;

That would work fine, except that if you now gave it to someone who was 25 they would not only have to modify the first line but remember to remove the third line.  But why force a human to remove the third line?  The computer should be able to automatically display or not display the third line depending on the value of ''age''.  We can use an &quot;if&quot; statement to tell the computer to do just that:

    age = 30
    print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;
    if age &amp;gt; 29:
        print &quot;Your warranty has expired!&quot;

Again let's &quot;play computer&quot;: when you get to the third line, you look at the word ''age'', realize it's a variable, and get its value (30) from memory (it was stored there on line 1):

    if 30 &amp;gt; 29:

This line says, &quot;If 30 is greater than 29, perform the statements that are indented.  If not, skip the indented statements.&quot;  Since 30 is greater than 29, the indented statements are performed and the joke is displayed on the screen.  If a friend changes the first line to &quot;age = 25&quot;, the third line will compare 25 to 29, and since 25 is not greater than 29, the fourth line will be skipped.

This is a '''''conditional'''''.  Whether the fourth line is run is conditional on the math expression on the third line.  That expression could be more complex, such as:

    if age &amp;gt;= 40 and age &amp;lt; 50:
        print &quot;You are in your forties.&quot;

The &lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; symbol means &quot;greater than or equal to&quot;.  Here the &quot;print&quot; line won't get run unless the age is between 40 and 49.  You can also put more than one indented statement:

    if age &amp;gt;= 50 and age &amp;lt; 60:
        print &quot;You are in your fifties.&quot;
        print &quot;Mid-life crisis yet?&quot;

If the person's age is between 50 and 59, both lines will be displayed; otherwise neither will.  Now notice that if the age of the user is 1, the second line of our original program will display a grammatical error:

    You are 1 years old.

That should be &quot;year&quot;, not &quot;years&quot;.  We can use a conditional to fix this bug:

    age = 25
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
    if age != 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;

The &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;is equal to&quot;.  There are two equal signs in order to differentiate it from an assignment statement, which uses a single equal sign (as in the first line of our program).  This is related to what we wrote above about computer languages always wanting to be perfectly clear about what's intended.  The &lt;tt&gt;!=&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;not equal to&quot;.  Think of the math symbol of the equal sign with a slash through it, then imagine the exclamation mark being that slash.  Now if you set ''age'' to 1 you'll get this:

    You are 1 year old.

Which is correct.  If the ''age'' is not 1, then the first &quot;print&quot; will be skipped and the second will run, displaying the version of the text with a plural &quot;years&quot;.  It's fairly common to want to do one thing if a condition is true (such as &quot;age == 1&quot;) and another if that condition is not true (&quot;age != 1&quot;).  So computer languages have a shortcut to save you from having to retype a whole &quot;if&quot; statement with the inverse condition.  You simply write this:

    age = 25
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;

That means, &quot;If age is 1, run the first print statement.  If not (else), run the second print statement.&quot;  Again you can have multiple statements in either the first section or the second:

    age = 25
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
        print &quot;You're an infant!&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;
        print &quot;You're not an infant.&quot;

Now you can give this program to someone else and they only need to change the first line to get a few lines of accurate text displayed about them.  You can imagine that this can get arbitrarily complex, with very sophisticated conditions being tested.  Consider this:

    age = 25
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
        print &quot;You're an infant!&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;
    
        if age &amp;lt; 25:
            print &quot;You're young.&quot;
        else:
            print &quot;You're mature!&quot;

This is called a &quot;nested ''if''&quot;.  The second &quot;if&quot; (the one that compares ''age'' with 25) is ''nested'' (within) the first &quot;if&quot;.  Since it's indented, the second &quot;if&quot; will itself only be run if the first condition (&quot;age == 1&quot;) is not true.  If ''age'' is in fact 1, the first &quot;print&quot; will be run and the entire second section, including the second &quot;if&quot;, will be skipped.  So the program will display only one of &quot;You're an infant!&quot; or &quot;You're young.&quot; or &quot;You're mature!&quot;.  You should &quot;play computer&quot; through this program with various values of ''age'', such as 1, 5, 25, and 30.

Conditionals are extremely useful.  In our example, it would have been possible (though inconvenient) for each person to add or remove &quot;print&quot; statements as they modified the age in the first line, but in reality the value for ''age'' would have come from elsewhere, such as a form or a database, and the program would have to run as-is, unmodified, and display the correct text for any value of ''age'' that it might get.

We can look at conditionals in C, again to show that basic concepts are available in different programming languages with only superficial differences:

    if (age &amp;gt; 29)
        puts(&quot;Your warranty has expired!&quot;);

Note these differences: there are parenthese around the condition; &quot;print&quot; was replaced with &quot;puts&quot;, as before; the text to display is surrounded by parentheses; and there's a terminating semicolon at the end of the &quot;puts&quot; statement.  If you wanted to display more than one line, you'd have to write it like this:

    if (age &amp;gt;= 50 &amp;&amp; age &amp;lt; 60) {
        puts(&quot;You are in your fifties.&quot;);
        puts(&quot;Mid-life crisis yet?&quot;);
    }

Note these two additional differences: the &quot;and&quot; has been replaced with &quot;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&quot; in the condition; and there are braces around the pair of &quot;puts&quot; statements.  In C (and languages derived from C, such as C++, Java, and C#), indentation is ignored, so the &quot;if&quot; statement will assume that only the very next statement will be conditionally run.  If you want more than one statement, you have to group them with braces to tell the language that all of these are conditionally run.  In our Python-like language above, indentation is used to tell which statements are under the control of the &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; lines.

== Input ==

In the above examples, the age was placed right in the source code,
on line 1:

    age = 25

This is called '''''hard-coding''''' the age.  The ''hard'' comes from the
fact that once the program is written that way, the age is always
25.  If the user wants to run the program with a different age,
they need to change the source code.  But that assumes that they
understand programming.  Since most users don't understand programming,
we'd really like to simply ask the user their age so that they
never need to see the source code at all.

We can use a line like this:

    age = input()

To ''input'' something means to put it into the computer.  ''Output''
is the reverse, like the ''print'' statements we've been using.

So our program now looks something like:

    print &quot;What is your age?&quot;
    age = input()
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;

When the user runs the program, instead of immediately seeing
the &quot;You are ...&quot; text, they'll first see this:

    What is your age?

and the system will appear to stop.  The user will then be able
to enter their age, press Enter, and the program will continue
as it did before, with the variable ''age'' set to whatever
number the user entered.

You may be curious about the set of parentheses after the word
''input''.  If you didn't have those, like this:

    age = input

the word ''input'' would look a lot like a variable.  Since computers
always want to be completely clear about what needs to be done, we
add parentheses to mean, &quot;This isn't a variable, it's a command.
Do something clever.&quot;  &lt;tt&gt;input()&lt;/tt&gt; is actually a '''''function'''''.
We'll cover functions later, but for now you can think of them
as bits of code that do interesting things (like getting a number
from the keyboard) and making some value available as a result
(for assignment to ''age'' in this case).  When the computer sees this
line:

    age = input()

It first sees the function &lt;tt&gt;input()&lt;/tt&gt;, does the clever thing
(gets a number from the keyboard), and replaces the function with
the value that it got:

    age = 25

(if the user typed ''25'').  Then the assignment continues as it
did before, storing the value 25 into memory and associating it with
the word ''age''.

== Loops ==

Say we wanted to write a program that asked the user how many times
they wanted a phrase repeated.  (Yes, it really is necessary to have
these silly examples.  More realistic examples are often too complex
to demonstate a single new concept.)

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    if count == 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count == 2:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count == 3:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count == 4:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;

If you run this program, the user will be asked &quot;How many times?&quot; and the
computer will wait for an answer.  The user can then type a number
between 1 and 4 and the phrase &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; will be displayed
that many times.  There are several problems with this program.
Firstly, it can at most handle a count of 4.  If the user wants
it displayed 5 times, the program must be extended to handle that
case.  Secondly, as the number of cases grows, it will be difficult
to make sure that the program is correct.  If you extend it all
the way to, say, 20 times, it's difficult to check using your text
editor that the case for 17 really has 17 lines in it.  Perhaps
you made an error and only cut-and-pasted the line 16 times.  We could
be clever and rewrite it like this:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count &amp;gt;= 2:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count &amp;gt;= 3:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count &amp;gt;= 4:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;

This is somewhat tricky, so it's important to follow the logic
carefully, as the computer would.  Let's say ''count'' is 3.
The first &quot;if&quot; statement will check if 3 is greater than or
equal to 1, and since it is, print the first phrase.  The
next &quot;if&quot; will compare count to 2, and print the second phrase.
The same thing will happen when &lt;tt&gt;count &amp;gt;= 3&lt;/tt&gt; is tested,
since 3 is greater than or equal to 3.  But the fourth test
will not work, since 3 is not greater than or equal to 4.
So the fourth phrase will not be displayed.  The phrase will
have been displayed 3 times (once for each of the first three
&quot;if&quot; statements), which is what we wanted since ''count'' is 3.

This new way of writing the program is simpler to verify for
correctness.  We just need to make sure that each number in
successive &quot;if&quot; statements is one more than the previous number.
Since each &quot;if&quot; statement only prints a single line, we don't
risk mis-counting the number of &quot;print&quot; lines as in the first
example.  But it's still somewhat tedious to extend the program
to handle higher values of ''count''.  You have to cut-and-paste
two lines and remember to increase the number in the &quot;if&quot; statement.

We could make that a little easier with this new version:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1

Now the program is more complicated, but each &quot;if&quot; statement is
identical.  That makes cutting and pasting much easier&amp;mdash;we can
simply hold down the Ctrl-V key and have a program that handles
very large values of ''count''.  Here's how the new program works.
The first &quot;if&quot; statement, as before, compares ''count'' to 1
and prints the phrase if ''count'' is greater than or equal to 1.
But it also does something else: it decreases the value of
''count'' by one.  This statement:

    count = count - 1

does three things: it finds the value of ''count'' in memory, subtracts
1 from it, and puts the result back into memory, replacing the old
value of ''count''.  So if ''count'' is 3, the ''count'' on the
right side is replaced with its value:

    count = 3 - 1

then the arithmetic is done:

    count = 2

and the new value is stored into memory as before, replacing the 3
that was there.  You may wonder why only the ''count'' on the
right side of the equal sign gets replaced with its value, and
not the left.  Why doesn't the computer replace both words with
the value 3, like this:

    3 = 3 - 1

Obviously this wouldn't be very useful.  The assignment statement
only looks up the existing value of variables when they appear
on the right of the equal (assignment) sign.  The single variable
on the left of the equal sign is used as-is to know what name
to associate with the result of the arithmetic on the right.

So after the first phrase is displayed, ''count'' is decreased
by one, and the next &quot;if&quot; is tested.  It's the same test, comparing
''count'' with 1.  Say that ''count'' is 3 initially.  At
the first &quot;if&quot; we'll see the phrase displayed and ''count'' will become
2.  At the second &quot;if&quot; we'll see the phrase and ''count'' will become
1.  At the third &quot;if&quot; we'll see the phrase and ''count'' will become
0.  At the fourth &quot;if&quot; the test &quot;0 &gt;= 1&quot; will not be true, so the
phrase won't get displayed and ''count'' won't be decreased.  No
matter how many more &quot;if&quot; statements you have after that, the
value of ''count'' will stay 0 and none of the &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt;
statements will run.  You'll see the phrase three times, which is
what we wanted since ''count'' was 3 originally.

Our program now has one final problem: no matter how many times
we cut-and-paste these three lines, the user could always enter
a number that's higher than that.  You could have pasted the
&quot;if&quot; statement 500 times, and if the user enters &quot;510&quot;, your program
will only display the phrase 500 times, once for each &quot;if&quot;.  The
program will end with the variable &quot;count&quot; set to 10, since there are
10 more phrases to go, but the last 10 &quot;if&quot; statements won't be there.

We can fix this last problem with a '''''loop''''', like this:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    while count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1

That's the entire program.  Specifically, this is a '''''while loop''''',
because there are several different kinds.  We removed all the &quot;if&quot;
statements except one, and replaced the word ''if'' with the word
''while''.  It almost reads like an English sentence: &quot;While
''count'' is greater than or equal to 1, print this phrase and
decrease ''count'' by one.&quot;  Let's &quot;play computer&quot; with ''count''
initially set to 3.  The computer will get to the &quot;while&quot; statement,
compare 3 to 1, see that 3 is greater than or equal to 1, display
the phrase, decrease ''count'' by 1 (to 2), and ''loop'' back up
to the ''while'' statement.  Again the computer will compare ''count''
to 1, and since 2 is greater than or equal to 1, it will print the
statement, decrease count to 1, loop back up, compare ''count'' with 1,
and since 1 is greater than or equal to 1, display the phrase and
decrease the variable ''count'' to zero.  It will then loop back up
to the &quot;while&quot; statement, compare ''count'' to 1, and since 0 is ''not''
greater than or equal to 1, the indented statement will not be
run and the &quot;while&quot; loop will finish, moving on to the statements
that follow.  In this program there are no statements that follow,
so the program will end.  Each time through the loop is called
an '''''iteration'''''.

There are several different types of loops.  Which one to use depends
both on what's available in the programming language you're using and
which makes the most sense for what you're trying to do.  For example,
in the example above, we could print the value of ''count'' in each
iteration, like this:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    while count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        '''print count'''
        count = count - 1

Running the program would look something like this (if the user
typed &quot;3&quot; when asked):

    How many times?
    '''3'''                     (what the user types in)
    Are we there yet?
    3
    Are we there yet?
    2
    Are we there yet?
    1

The numbers 3, 2, 1 are the values of ''count'' at each iteration.
What if, instead, just wanted to count upwards?  Or what if you
didn't want to modify ''count'', because you wanted to use it
later on in the program?  You could use a '''''for loop''''', like this:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    '''for i = 1 to count:'''
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print count

(''Note:'' So far the language we've used for examples has been
similar to the popular programming language Python.  But Python
has no such ''for'' loop.  The above syntax is based on the
language Basic.)

This ''for'' loop means, &quot;Run the indented statements once for
each value between 1 and ''count'', and set the variable ''i''
to that value.&quot;  If the user enters 3 you'll see this:

    How many times?
    '''3'''                     (what the user types in)
    Are we there yet?
    1
    Are we there yet?
    2
    Are we there yet?
    3

The 1, 2, 3 are the values of ''i'' at each iteration.  Note
that we no longer need to decrease the value of ''count'' in
each iteration.  The computer automatically increases ''i'' by
1 each iteration until it reaches ''count''.  In fact, ''count''
is unchanged after the loop finishes.  This loop:

    for i = 1 to count:
        print i

is essentially identical to this version:

    i = 1
    while i &lt;= count:
        print count
        i = i + 1

The ''for'' loop is generally preferable to ''while'' loops
when you want to cover a range of numbers.  It's shorter and
easier to read.  The ''while'' loop, though, is more flexible
since you're doing all the work yourself.  You could increment
''i'' by 2 at each iteration to see only the odd numbers, or
you could double the value of ''i'' to see all the powers of
two:

    print &quot;What is the maximum?&quot;
    maximum = input()
    i = 1
    while i &lt;= maximum:
        print i
        i = i * 2

    What is the maximum?
    '''128'''                     (what the user types in)
    1
    2
    4
    8
    16
    32
    64
    128

You can't do that with a simple ''for'' loop.  Incidentally, in a ''for'' loop
the starting and ending values (1 and ''count'' in our example) can actually be
any pair of numbers.  You could do:

    for i = 20 to 24:
        print i

to display the values 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24.  The variable ''i''
is used here, but any variable could be used.  ''i'' is a commonly-used
variable for ''for'' loops; it stands for ''index''.  You could
also use a variable name that makes more sense in your particular
context, such as:

    for year = 1992 to 2004:
        print &quot;The year is &quot; + year

Another type of loop is the '''''foreach loop'''''.  That's
similar to the ''for'' loop except that the variable doesn't
just go through a numerical range, it's actually set to each
element in a set of numbers:

    foreach year in [1992, 1996, 2000, 2004]:
        print &quot;The &quot; + year + &quot; Olympic Games.&quot;

That also reads almost like an English sentence: &quot;For each
year in the set 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, print this statement.&quot;
(''Note:'' Python does have such a ''for'' loop, except the
word ''for'' is used instead of ''foreach''.)

There are a few other types of loops, but they're usually
variations on the above three types.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Infinite Sets and Cardinality==
'''The Size of a Finite Set'''

When deciding how large finite sets are, we generally count the number of elements in the set, and say two sets are the same size if they have the same number of elements.  This approach doesn't work too well if the sets are infinite, however, because we can't count the number of elements in an infinite set.

However, there is another way to define when two sets have the same size that works equally well for finite and infinite sets.  We say that two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have the same size if we can define a function &lt;math&gt;f: A\to B&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the following properties:

*&lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for every &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\forall b\in B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists a\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f(a)=b&lt;/math&gt;.  We say that f is ''onto'' or ''surjective''.
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a_1, a_2\in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(a_1)=f(a_2) \implies a_1=a_2&lt;/math&gt;.  We say that f is ''one-to-one'' or ''injective''.

Functions which satisfy these properties are called ''bijections''.

'''Examples'''

The sets &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{4,5,6\}&lt;/math&gt; both have three elements.  We can define a bijection between them like this: &lt;math&gt;f(1)=6, f(2)=4, f(3)=5&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of all positive integers, &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,...\}&lt;/math&gt; is the same size as the set of nonnegative integers, &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2,...\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;f(1)=0, f(2)=1&lt;/math&gt;, and more generally &lt;math&gt;f(n)=n-1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise'''

Prove that the above function is a bijection.

Often it is difficult to construct an explicit bijection between two sets of the same cardinality, so the following theorem can come in handy:

'''Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem'''

''See proof at [[w:Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem|Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]]''

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are two sets and there exist injective functions &lt;math&gt;f:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:B\to A&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a bijection between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

      <comment>in the &quot;classify by environments&quot;, mention the &quot;hazardous environments&quot; section of this book</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In general, robots are classified based on their capabilities.
Some standard classifications of robots include their [[#Domain of operation|domain of operation]], [[#Degree of autonomy|degree of autonomy]], and the [[#Goal|goal]] they are designed to fulfill.

===Domain of Operation===
Robots can be designed and built for any environment imaginable.
One popular way of classifying robots is by what environments they're designed to operate in.
Some typical examples include:
; Stationary
: These robots are fixed in one place and cannot move.  This category includes robotic [[/Arms|arms]], computerized machine tools, and most other Industrial Robots.
: Industrial Robots are robots used in mass production e.g. welding robots, CNC plate cutters or CNC drills. The large majority of these robots are stationary and tethered to a computer.
; Ground
: These robots are designed to operate on the surface of the earth or other planet, and are usually sub categorized by their drive train:
;*[[/Wheeled|Wheels]]
;*[[/Tracked|Tracks]]
;*[[/Walkers|Legs]]
; Underwater
: Also known as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, these are designed to operate underwater, possibly at great depth.
; Aerial
: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are various kinds of robotic flying machines, including planes and helicopters.
; Microgravity
: Robots that have been designed to operate in low-gravity environments, such as earth orbit.
; other specific [[Robotics/Exotic Robots/Hazardous Environment Robots|Hazardous Environments]]

===Degree of Autonomy===
'''Autonomy''' is the quality of being self-controlled.
One measure of autonomy is the amount of human control that is required for the robot's operation.  An autonomous robot can operate properly without intervention indefinitely and can deal with unexpected problems gracefully.
Teleoperated robots constantly require humans to send the robot control signals.
These are only the endpoints; there is a continuum of possibilities between them.

A robot can also be classified by how self-contained it is.
Power, logic circuitry, and other things may be located either on the main chassis or connected via a cable tether or wireless link from another location.

===Goal===
Robots are also routinely categorized by the goals they are designed to achieve.  These include [[/Contest Robot|contests]], personal enrichment, manufacturing, and [[/Entertainment Robot|entertainment]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Contests=

Here are a few examples of contests with robots:&lt;BR&gt;
([http://robots.net/rcfaq.html Here's] a list of different contests)
==Fire fighter==

In a fire fighter contest the robot has to find the flame of a candle and extinguish it.

See [http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot/ this site] for an example.

==Maze or obstacle course navigator==

===Maze===
Find the way through the maze as fast as possible.

For example: [http://imd.eng.kagawa-u.ac.jp/maze/index_j.html see this site.]

For a video examples: 
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L9rkLAskWU video 1]
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1&amp;v=ZtOtrVB_r0w video 2]
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1&amp;v=ZtOtrVB_r0w video 3] (multiple contestants--both successful and not)

===Obstacle Course===
There are many different obstacle course to build for a robot contest.
The Melexis Safety Trophy has tin cans with small candles inside and concrete bricks as obstacles and tennis balls (which the robot had to touch) for extra points.
Another contest uses traffic signs with arrows to direct the way.

See [http://www.trophy.melexis.com/en/home.htm this site] for an example.

==Soccer robot==

Robots playing soccer. The goal of this type of contest is to build a team of robots that can work together.

See [http://www.newtonlabs.com/soccer/ this site] for an example.

==Sumo Robot==

In this type of contest 2 robots are placed on a playground within a large circle. The goal is to push the other robot out of this circle.

See [http://www.botlanta.org/MonthlyContest/sumo/mini-sumo.html here] for an example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These are robots that have no real ''useful'' application. They're build for fun and practice but little else more. Most homebuilt robots would fall in this category.

They can be simple robots that use simple sensors (light sensor, sound, bumper switches) and have simple behavior, but they could as well have complex sensors and extensive programming.

One other category of robots that's very close related to this category are robot build as &quot;tech-demos&quot;. For example the Asimo robot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Electronics==
For basic electronics you may want to consult [[Electronics|this wikibook]] and [[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: Microcontrollers|this section]] on Microcontrollers.

[http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=making+Pcb%27s+at+home&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;meta= google] has some links on PCB fabrication.

== Special Electronic Components ==
There are many electronic components that aren't described in most electronic textbooks, but are very useful in robotics. Most of these components are covered in other section in this book (e.g Sensors and Motors).

A typical robot needs a [[Power Electronics#heatsink|heat sink]] on the power transistors connected to its motors and other [[Robotics/Components/Actuation Devices|actuators]], but often does not need a heatsink connected to its CPU.

{{Ada/Navigation|Types|record}}
__TOC__
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A '''record''' is a [[ada Programming/Types#List of types|composite type]] that groups one or more fields. A field can be of any type, even a record.

== Basic record ==

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Basic_Record {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        A : Integer;
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

== Null record ==

The null record is when a type without data is needed. There are two ways to declare a null record:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Null_Record {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       {{Ada/kw|null}};
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}}; 

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Null_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

For the compiler they are the same. However, programmers often use the first variant if the type is not finished yet to show that they are planning to expand the type later, or they usually use the second if the (tagged) record is a base class in object oriented programming.

== Record Values ==

Values of a record type can be specified using a record aggregate, giving a list of named components thus

   A_Basic_Record       {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Basic_Record         {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Basic_Record{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/delimiter|(}}A {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   Another_Basic_Record {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Basic_Record         {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}A {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   Nix                  {{Ada/delimiter|:}} {{Ada/keyword|constant}} Null_Record {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}{{Ada/keyword|null}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Given a somewhat larger record type,

   {{Ada/keyword|type}} Car {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}
      Identity       {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Long_Long_Integer{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Number_Wheels  {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Positive {{Ada/keyword|range}} 1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Paint          {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Color{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Horse_Power_kW {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Float {{Ada/keyword|range}} 0{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 2_000{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Consumption    {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Float {{Ada/keyword|range}} 0{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 100{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

a value ''may'' be specified using ''positional'' notation, that is, specifying a value for each record component in declaration order

   BMW {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Car {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}2007_752_83992434{{Ada/delimiter|,}} 5{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Blue{{Ada/delimiter|,}} 190{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|,}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}1{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

However, naming the components of a &lt;tt&gt;Car&lt;/tt&gt; aggregate offers a number of advantages.
# Easy identification of which value is used for which component. (After all, named components are the raison d'être of records.)
# Reordering the components is allowed—you only have to remember the component names, not their position.
# Improved compiler diagnostic messages.

Reordering components is possible because component names will inform the compiler (and the human reader!) of the intended value associations.
Improved compiler messages are also in consequence of this additional information passed to the compiler.
While an omitted component will always be reported due to Ada's [http://www.adacore.com/2007/05/14/gem-1/ coverage rules],
messages can be much more specific when there are named associations. 
Considering the &lt;tt&gt;Car&lt;/tt&gt; type from above, suppose a
programmer by mistake specifies only one of the two floating point values for &lt;tt&gt;BMW&lt;/tt&gt; in positional notation.
The compiler, in search of another component value,
will then not be able to decide whether the specified value is intended for &lt;tt&gt;Horse_Power_kW&lt;/tt&gt;
or for &lt;tt&gt;Consumption&lt;/tt&gt;.
If the programmer instead uses named association, say 
Horse_Power_kW {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 190{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
it will be clear which other component is missing.

   BMW {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Car {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}}
     {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Identity       {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 2007_752_83992434{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
      Number_Wheels  {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 5{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
      Horse_Power_kW {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 190{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
      Consumption    {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}1{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
      Paint          {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} Blue{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

In order to access a component of a record instance, use the dot delimiter ({{Ada/delimiter|.}}), as in &lt;tt&gt;BMW{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Number_Wheels&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Discriminated record ==

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Discriminated_Record (Size : Natural) {{Ada/kw|is}} 
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        A : String (1 .. Size);
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

== Variant record ==

The variant record is a special type of discriminated record where the presence of some components depend on the value of the discriminant.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);
 
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Variant_Record (Option : Traffic_Light) {{Ada/kw|is}} 
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        {{Ada/--|common components}}
        
        {{Ada/kw|case}} Option {{Ada/kw|is}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Red =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for red}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Yellow =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for yellow}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Green =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for green}}
        {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

=== Mutable and immutable variant records ===

You can declare variant record types such that its discriminant, and thus its variant structure, can be changed during the lifetime of the variable.  Such a record is said to be ''mutable''.  When &quot;mutating&quot; a record, you must assign '''all''' components of the variant structure which you are mutating at once, replacing the record with a complete variant structure.  Although a variant record declaration may allow objects of its type to be mutable, there are certain restrictions on whether the objects will be mutable.  Reasons restricting an object from being mutable include:

* the object is declared with a discriminant (see Immutable_Traffic_Light below)
* the object is aliased (either by use of {{Ada/kw|aliased}} in the object declaration, or by allocation on the heap using {{Ada/kw|new}})


  {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);
 
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Mutable_Variant_Record (Option : Traffic_Light := Red) {{Ada/kw|is}}      {{Ada/--|the discriminant must have a default value}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        {{Ada/--|common components}}
        Location : Natural;
        {{Ada/kw|case}} Option {{Ada/kw|is}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Red =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for red}}
              Flashing : Boolean := True;
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Yellow =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for yellow}}
              Timeout    : Duration := 0.0;
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Green =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for green}}
              Whatever : Positive := 1;
        {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 ...
 Mutable_Traffic_Light   : Mutable_Variant_Record;                    {{Ada/--|not declaring a discriminant makes this record mutable}}
                                                                      {{Ada/--|it has the default discriminant/variant}}
                                                                      {{Ada/--|structure and values}}
 
 Immutable_Traffic_Light : Mutable_Variant_Record (Option =&gt; Yellow); {{Ada/--|this record is immutable, the discriminant cannot be changed}}
                                                                      {{Ada/--|even though the type declaration allows for mutable objects}}
                                                                      {{Ada/--|with different discriminant values}}
 ...
 Mutable_Traffic_Light   := (Option =&gt; Yellow,                        {{Ada/--|mutation requires assignment of all components}}
                             Location =&gt; 54,                          {{Ada/--|for the given variant structure}}
                             Timeout =&gt; 2.3);
 ...
 {{Ada/--|restrictions on objects, causing them to be immutable}}
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Mutable_Variant_Record;
 Any_Traffic_Light       : Traffic_Light_Access :=
                            {{Ada/kw|new}} Mutable_Variant_Record;
 Aliased_Traffic_Light   : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Mutable_Variant_Record;


Conversely, you can declare record types so that the discriminant along with the structure of the variant record may not be changed.  To make a record type declaration ''immutable'', the discriminant must '''not''' have a default value.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);
 
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Immutable_Variant_Record (Option : Traffic_Light) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/--|no default value makes the record type immutable}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        {{Ada/--|common components}}
        Location : Natural := 0;
        {{Ada/kw|case}} Option {{Ada/kw|is}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Red =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for red}}
              Flashing : Boolean := True;
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Yellow =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for yellow}}
              Timeout    : Duration;
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Green =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for green}}
              Whatever : Positive := 1;
        {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 ...
 Default_Traffic_Light   : Immutable_Variant_Record;                    {{Ada/--|ILLEGAL!}}
 Immutable_Traffic_Light : Immutable_Variant_Record (Option =&gt; Yellow); {{Ada/--|this record is immutable, since the type declaration is immutable}}

== Union ==

{{Ada/2005|Record}}

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);
 
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Union (Option : Traffic_Light := Traffic_Light'First) {{Ada/kw|is}} 
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        {{Ada/--|common components}}
        
        {{Ada/kw|case}} Option {{Ada/kw|is}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Red =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for red}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Yellow =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for yellow}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Green =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for green}}
        {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
  {{Ada/pragma|Unchecked_Union}} (Union);
  {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (C, Union);    {{Ada/--|optional}}

The difference to a variant record is such that &lt;var&gt;Option&lt;/var&gt; is not actually stored inside the record and never checked for correctness - it's just a dummy.

This kind of record is usually used for interfacing with C but can be used for other purposes as well (then without &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (C, Union);&lt;/code&gt;).

== Tagged record ==

The tagged record is one part of what in other languages is called a class. It is the basic foundation of [[ada Programming/Object Orientation|object orientated programming in Ada]]. The other two parts a class in Ada needs is a [[ada Programming/Object Orientation#The_package|package]] and [[ada Programming/Object Orientation#Primitive_operations|primitive operations]].

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       Name   : String (1 .. 10);
       Gender : Gender_Type;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person {{Ada/kw|with}}
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       Skilled_In : Language_List;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

Ada 2005 only:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person 
                    {{Ada/kw|and}} Printable 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} 
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       Skilled_In : Language_List;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

== Abstract tagged record ==

An abstract type has at least an abstract primitive operation, i.e. one of its operations is not defined and then its derivative types has to provide an implementation.

== With aliased elements ==

If you come from [[C Programming|C]]/[[C++ Programming|C++]], you are probably used to the fact that every element of a record - which is not part of a bitset - has an address. In Ada, this is not true because records, just like arrays, can be packed. And just like arrays you can use {{Ada/kw|aliased}} to ensure that an element can be accessed via an access type.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Basic_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} 
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       A : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Integer;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}} ;

Please note: each element needs its own {{Ada/kw|aliased}}.

== Limited Records ==

In addition to being variant, tagged, and abstract,
records may also be limited (no assignment, and no predefined
equality operation for [[Ada_Programming/Types/limited|Limited Types]]).
In object oriented programming, when tagged objects are
handled by references instead of copying them, this blends
well with making objects limited.

==C Structure and Style==
This is a basic introduction to good code style in the C Programming Language. It is designed to provide information on how to effectively use indentation, comments, and other elements that will make your C code more readable. It is not a tutorial on actually programming in C.

As a beginning programmer, the point of creating structure in the programs' code might not be clear, as the compiler doesn't care about the difference. However, as programs become complex, chances are that writing the program has become a joint effort. (Or others might want to see how it was accomplished.) Therefore, the code is no longer designed purely for a compiler to read.

In the following sections, we will attempt to explain good programming practices that will in turn make your programs clearer and more effective.

== Introduction ==
In C, programs are composed of statements. These statements are terminated with a semi-colon, and are collected in sections known as functions.  By convention, a statement should be kept on its own line, as shown in the example below: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  
 int main(void)
 {
 	printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);
 	return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The following block of code is essentially the same: while it contains exactly the same code, and will compile and execute with the same result, the removal of spacing causes an essential difference making it harder to read:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int main(void) {printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);return 0;}
&lt;/source&gt;

The simple use of indents and line breaks can greatly improve the readability of the code; without making any impact whatsoever on how the code performs. By having readable code, it is much easier to see where functions and procedures end, and which lines are part of which loops and procedures.

This book is going to focus on the above piece of code, and how to improve it.  Please note that during the course of the tutorial, there will be many (apparently) redundant pieces of code added.  These are only added to provide examples of techniques that we will be explaining, without breaking the overall flow of code that the program achieves.

== Line Breaks and Indentation ==
The addition of white space inside your code is arguably the most important part of good code structure.  Effective use of white space can create a visual scale of how your code flows, which can be very important when returning to your code when you want to maintain it.

=== Line Breaks ===
{{Warning|Note that we have used line numbers here; they are not a part of the actual code.  They are only there for reference in this book.}}
With minimal line breaks, code is barely readable by humans, and may be hard to debug or understand:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void){ int i=0; printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++){ printf(&quot;\n&quot;); break; } return 0; }
&lt;/source&gt;

Rather than putting everything on one line, it is much more readable to break up long lines so that each statement and declaration goes on its own line.  After inserting line breaks, the code will look like this: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void)
{
int i=0;
printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); 
for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++)
{ 
printf(&quot;\n&quot;); 
break;
}
return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Blank Lines ===

Blank lines should be used to offset the main components of your code.  Use them 
*After precompiler declarations.
*After new variables are declared.

Based on these two rules, there should now be two line breaks added.
*After line 1, because line 1 has a preprocessor directive
*After line 4, because line 4 contains a variable declaration
This will make the code much more readable than it was before:

The following lines of code have line breaks between functions, but without indentation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
int i=0;

printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++)
{
printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
break;
}
return 0;
}
 
&lt;/source&gt;
  
But this still isn't as readable as it can be.

=== Indentation ===

{{Side note|side=right|&lt;small&gt;Many text editors automatically indent appropriately when you hit the enter/return key.&lt;/small&gt;}}
Although adding simple line breaks between key blocks of code can make code  easier to read, it provides no information about the block structure of the program.  Using the tab key can be very helpful now: indentation visually separates paths of execution by moving their starting points to a new column in the line.  This simple practice will make it much easier to read and understand code.  Indentation follows a fairly simple rule:

*All code inside a new block should be indented by one tab&lt;ref&gt;

Several programmers recommend &quot;use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code. You should set your editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab key.&quot; [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml] [http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html]  

Other programmers disagree. [http://web.archive.org/20080118165124/diagrammes-modernes.blogspot.com/2006/04/tab-versus-spaces.html] [http://www.derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html]

Regardless of whether you prefer spaces or tabs, make sure you keep it consistent with projects you are working on, because mixing tabs and spaces can cause code to become unreadable.
&lt;/ref&gt; more than the code in the previous path.

Based on the code from the previous section, there are two blocks requiring indentation:

*Lines 5 to 13
*Lines 10 and 11

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int i=0;

    printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
    for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++)
    {
        printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
        break;
    }
    return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

It is now fairly obvious as to which parts of the program fit inside which blocks.  You can tell which parts of the program the coder has intended to loop, and which ones he or she has not.  Although it might not be immediately noticeable, once many nested loops and paths get added to the structure of the program, the use of indentation can be very important.  This indentation makes the structure of your program clear. 

Indentation was originally one tab character, or the equivalent of 8 spaces.  Research since the original indent size has shown that indents between 2 to 4 characters are easier to read&lt;ref name=&quot;rice&quot;&gt;[http://www.oualline.com/vim-cook.html#drawing]&lt;/ref&gt;, resulting in such tab sizes being used as default in modern IDEs. However, an indent of 8 characters may still be in use for some systems&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxkernel&quot;&gt;[http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.31/Documentation/CodingStyle Linux Kernel coding standard&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Comments ==

Comments in code can be useful for a variety of purposes.  They provide the easiest way to set off specific parts of code (and their purpose); as well as providing a visual &quot;split&quot; between various parts of your code.  Having good comments throughout your code will make it much easier to remember what specific parts of your code do.

Comments in modern flavors of C (and many other languages) can come in two forms:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;//Single Line Comments  (added by C99 standard, famously known as c++ style of comments)&lt;/source&gt;
and
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*Multi-Line
Comments*/ (only form of comments supported by C89 standard)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that Single line comments are a fairly recent addition to C, so some compilers may not support them.  A recent version of [[Wikipedia:GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] will have no problems supporting them.

This section is going to focus on the various uses of each form of commentary.

=== Single-line Comments ===

Single-line comments are most useful for simple 'side' notes that explain what certain parts of the code do.  The best places to put these comments are next to variable declarations, and next to pieces of code that may need explanation.

Based on our previous program, there are two good places to place comments
*Line 5, to explain what 'int i' is going to do
*Line 11, to explain why there is a 'break' keyword.

This will make our program look something like

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int i=0;                // loop variable.

    printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
 
    for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++) {
        printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
        break;               //Exits 'for' loop.
    }
    
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Multi-line Comments ===

{{Side note|side=right|&lt;small&gt;Single-line comments are a new feature, so many C programmers only use multi-line comments.&lt;/small&gt;}}
Multi-line comments are most useful for long explanations of code.  They can be used as copyright/licensing notices, and they can also be used to explain the purpose of a block of code.  This can be useful for two reasons: They make your functions easier to understand, and they make it easier to spot errors in code.  If you know what a block is ''supposed'' to do, then it is much easier to find the piece of code that is responsible if an error occurs.

As an example, suppose we had a program that was designed to print &quot;Hello, World! &quot; a certain number of lines, a specified number of times.  There would be many for loops in this program.  For this example, we shall call the number of lines ''i'', and the number of strings per line as ''j''.

A good example of a multi-line comment that describes 'for' loop ''i'''s purpose would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* For Loop (int i)
    Loops the following procedure i times (for number of lines).  Performs 'for' loop j on each loop,
    and prints a new line at end of each loop.
 */
&lt;/source&gt;

This provides a good explanation of what ''i'''s purpose is, whilst not going into detail of what ''j'' does.  By going into detail over what the specific path does (and not ones inside it), it will be easier to troubleshoot the path.

Similarly, you should always include a multi-line comment before each function, to explain the role, preconditions and postconditions of each function.    Always leave the technical details to the individual blocks inside your program - this makes it easier to troubleshoot.

A function descriptor should look something like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Function : int hworld (int i,int j)
    Input    : int i (Number of lines), int j (Number of instances per line)
    Output   : 0 (on success)
    Procedure: Prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot; j times, and a new line to standard output over i lines.
 */
&lt;/source&gt;
This system allows for an at-a-glance explanation of what the function should do.  You can then go into detail over how each aspect of the program is achieved later on in the program.

Finally, if you like to have aesthetically-pleasing source code, the multi-line comment system allows for the easy addition of comment  boxes.  These make the comments stand out much more than they would without otherwise.  They look like this.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /***************************************
  *  This is a multi line comment
  *  That is nearly surrounded by a
  *  Cool, starry border!
  ***************************************/
&lt;/source&gt;

Applied to our original program, we can now include a much more descriptive and readable source code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    /************************************************************************************
     * Function: int main(void)
     * Input   : none
     * Output  : Returns 0 on success
     * Procedure: Prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot; and a new line to standard output then exits.
     ************************************************************************************/
    int i=0;                //Temporary variable used for 'for' loop.
 
    printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
 
    /* FOR LOOP (int i)
       Prints a new line to standard output, and exits */
    for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++)
    {
        printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
        break;               //Exits 'for' loop.
    }
    
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This will allow any outside users of the program an easy way to comprehend what the code functions are and how they operate.  It also inhibits uncertainty with other like-named functions.

A few programmers add a column of stars on the right side of a block comment:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /***************************************
  *  This is a multi line comment       *
  *  that is completely surrounded by a *
  *  cool, starry border!               *
  ***************************************/
&lt;/source&gt;
But most programmers don't put any stars on the right side of a block comment.
They feel that aligning the right side is a waste of time.

Comments written in source files can be used for documenting source code automatically by using popular tools like Doxygen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macadamian.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=37 &quot;Coding Conventions for C++ and Java&quot;] &quot;all the block comments illustrated in this document have no pretty stars on the right side of the block comment. This deliberate choice was made because aligning those pretty stars is a large waste of time and discourages the maintenance of in-line comments.&quot;,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[c2:BigBlocksOfAsterisks]],[http://books.google.com/books?id=i4zCzpkrt4sC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=programming+comment+block+waste+time+lining+up&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TUpTMIHBnh&amp;sig=NeZm23WPmvnw2aKMnIRUeQoHmJg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pri3SevGIYGyNMn9jd4K&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result &quot;Code craft&quot;] by Pete Goodliffe page 82,[http://www.falvotech.com/content/publications/conventions/c/ Falvotech &quot;C Programming Style Guide&quot;],

'''Typography'''. The art and professional practice of communication in visual language.

==Introduction==
Broadly typography consists of the choice and application of:
*[[/Fonts/]], the software used to generate typefaces.
*[[/Typefaces/]], their style size and weight.
*[[/Spacing/]] of these letterforms, in words, paragraphs and lines.
*[[/Arrangement/]] of these blocks of information appropriately for the media on which they are to be distributed and read.
Typography can be broadly divided into:
*'''Display typography''' which aims to communicate visually as well as literally. It is often allusive and evocative in its visual form as well as the strict meaning of the language used. The history and associations of particular letterforms are carefully chosen to reinforce the message. Letter forms can be considered to be comparable to different ‘tones of voice’ or the full range of dramatic forms of speech.
**Examples include: Advertising Hoardings, Posters, Book Jackets.
*'''Text typography''' is primarily for continuous reading. It aims to unobtrusively convey the intentions of the author with as little informational ‘noise’ as possible. Letterforms or typefaces for continuous reading tend to be relatively conservative and displayed in a range of layout conventions appropriate to their use, to aid readability. There is often a complex heirarchy of information design to ensure that the relative importance of elements and optimal flow of information is implicit in the design.
**Examples include: Book and magazine design. Fiction and non-fiction texts.
*Website design is currently an interesting mixture of the two approaches, with the addition of new means of user interaction and animation.
*Typography also includes the highly specialised field of [[Typography/Type Design|type design]] but excludes the autographic craft traditions of lettering and calligraphy which are usually not considered part of this discipline unless they result in a full [[/Fonts|font]] or reusable [[/Typefaces/|typeface]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word processor analogy is a bit, hard for a beginner to grasp here. I understand it, but a new programmer may not, or at the very least will likely have a hard time understanding the relationship. In &quot;''Programming in Objective-C''&quot; by Stephen G. Kochan he uses a car analogy. Might we strive for something a little easier and more simple to understand. 

A car is developed from a blue print, or a concept car. Each car that you can buy is an instance of this blue print or concept car. Each instance of this car is an '''Object''' Something along those lines?

Or possibly we can relate it to the human body which most people who can read out to understand at this point in their lives. 

The human body is an object. The human body is created from a blueprint (our genes). Each person is an &quot;instance&quot; of the human body. I can see this might be more difficult, but I'd almost try to find something like a Car or what have you that you can then break down, a car has an engine, a gas tank, a stereo, etc. This way the example can be used again when describing inheritance later on.</text>

Color is fundamental to many forms of art.  Its relevance, use and function in a given work depend on the medium of that work.  While some concepts dealing with color are broadly applicable across media, others are not.

The full spectrum of colors is contained in white light. Humans perceive colors from the light reflected off objects. A red object, for example, looks red because it reflects the red part of the spectrum. It would be a different color under a different light.

Light can be split up into a spectrum by sending it through a prism. This was discovered by Isaac Newton, who is the creator of color theory.

==Color Theory==
The study of color in art and design often starts with ''color theory''. Color theory splits up colors into three categories: primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries.

The basic tool used is a color wheel, developed by Isaac Newton in 1666. Another model, the color tree, was created by Albert Munsell. It has a spectrum made up of sets of tints and shades on connected planes.

===Theory Variations===
There are a number of approaches to organizing colors into meaningful relationships.  Most systems differ in structure only.  Among these, three systems are consistently used in the contemporary art world.

====Traditional Model==== 
Traditional color theory is a qualitative attempt to organize colors and their relationships.  It is based on Newton's color wheel, and continues to be the most common system used by painters and printmakers.
[[image:Byrcolorwheel.png|right|thumb|A color wheel]]

:'''Traditional color theory''' uses the same principles as subtractive color mixing (see below) but prefers different primary colors.  

:* The Primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These are the &quot;elemental&quot; colors, because they cannot be produced by mixing other colors together, and all other colors are derived from some combination of these three.

:* The Secondary colors are orange (mix of red and yellow), green (mix of blue and yellow), and purple (mix of blue and red).

:* The Tertiary colors are obtained by mixing one primary color and one secondary color. Depending on amount of color used, different hues can be obtained such as red-orange or yellow-green. Neutrals (browns and grays) can be made by mixing all three primaries together.

:* White and black lie outside of these categories. They are used to lighten or darken a color. A lighter color (made by adding white to it) is called a ''tint'', while a darker color (made by adding black) is called a ''shade''.

====Color Mixing==== 
A more quantifiable approach to color theory is to think about color as the result of light reflecting off a surface.  Understood in this way, color can be represented as a ratio of amounts of primary color mixed together.  In this system, primary colors are chosen by dividing up the visible spectrum into thirds and making each third a primary.

Whether a color is being determined by the light source being reflected or the surface reflecting it makes a significant difference in the way colors interact with one another.  This distinction is blurred when working with digital technology where production environments and product often move fluidly between these media types.

:'''Additive color theory''' is used when different colored lights are being projected on top of each other.  Projected media produce color by projecting light onto a reflective surface.  Where subtractive mixing creates the impression of color by selectively absorbing part of the spectrum, additive mixing produces color by selective projection of part of the spectrum.  Common applications of additive color theory are theater lighting and television screens.  RGB color is based on additive color theory.
 
:* The Primary colors are red, blue, and green.

:* The Secondary colors are yellow (mix of red and green), cyan (mix of blue and green), and magenta (mix of blue and red).

:* The Tertiary colors are obtained by mixing the above colors at different intensities.

:* White is created by mixing the three primary colors while black represents the absence of all colors.  The lightness or darkness of a color is determined by the intensity/density of its various parts.  For instance: a middle-toned gray could be produced by projecting a red, a blue and a green light at the same point with 50% intensity.

:'''Subtractive color theory''' (&quot;process color&quot;) is used when a single light source is being reflected by different colors laid one on top of the other.  Color is produced when parts of the external light source's spectrum are absorbed by the material and not reflected back to the viewer's eye.  Subtractive color works as the reverse of additive color theory.  Common applications of subtractive color theory are color printing and photographic positives and negatives. The CMYK color model uses subtractive color theory. It was developed by Herbert Ives for printing.
 
:* The Primary colors are yellow, cyan, and magenta.

:* The Secondary colors are red (mix of magenta and yellow), blue (mix of cyan and magenta), and green (mix of cyan and yellow).

:* The Tertiary colors are obtained by mixing the above colors at different intensities.

:* Black is created by mixing the three primary colors while white represents the absence of all colors. (However, since it is impossible to mix a perfect black, devices using process colors add black as a fourth &quot;color.&quot; CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK.) Similar to additive color theory, lightness/darkness is determined by color intensity/density.

===Color Interactions===
Beyond creating a mixing hierarchy, color theory also provides tools for understanding how colors work together.

====Analogous Colors==== 
[[image:Aura_in_trees.jpg|right|thumb|450px]] Analogous colors are similar to one another.  As their name implies, analogous colors can be found next to one another on any 12 part color wheel.

:'''Common analogous colors''' can be found by taking one tertiary color and one of the secondary colors used by it when creating that tertiary color.  ''note: examples using traditional color theory''

:* purple/blue-purple.

:* green/yellow-green.

:* orange/red-orange.

A '''warm/cool''' scheme uses two pairs of analogous colors; one warm pair and one cool pair. (Intermixing should only be done within the pairs.)

====Complementary Colors==== 
Complementary colors are pairs of colors which, if added, would produce complete color saturation—white or black depending on the type of mixing you're doing.  Complementary colors are found directly opposite one another on a color wheel.

:'''Common complementary colors''' can be found by taking one secondary color and the primary color not used when creating that secondary color.  ''note: examples using traditional color theory''

:* violet/yellow.

:* green/red.

:* orange/blue.

:* white/black.  Though they are not represented on the color wheel, adding white to black will always result in complete color saturation regardless of mixing method.

A '''double complementary''' scheme is made up of two complementary color pairs. (Intermixing may be done, but only within the pairs.)

A '''split complementary''' uses three hues, one color, and two others which are on each side of that hue's complement on the color wheel.

===Attributes===
The three attributes of color are hue, saturation, and value.

====Hue====
A '''hue''' is a pure, spectral color. Black and white are not hues.

====Values====
Color values range from low key (very dark) to high key (very light). 1 is absolute black, and 10 is pure white. Yellow is the hue with the lightest value, while violet is the darkest.

The value of a color can make a difference in how it is perceived. A color on a dark background will appear lighter, while that same color on a light background will appear darker.

===Other Considerations===
Other factors that affect how a piece looks are perception, and local color. Under what conditions will the piece be viewed? Since most art and design is looked at under ordinary (white) light, designers often buy bulbs that recreate that light.

Color quality is another concern. This can be affected by opacity or texture of media, or glossiness of surface.
====Color Subtraction====
A visual phenomenon where the appearance of one color will lessen its presence in a nearby color. For instance, orange (red + yellow) on a red background will appear more like yellow (RY − R = Y).

====Simultaneous Contrast====
Neutrals on a colored background will appear tinted toward that color's complement, because the eye attempts to create a balance. (Grey on a red background will appear more greenish, for example.) In other words, the color will shift ''away'' from the surrounding color.

Also, non-dominant colors will appear tinted towards the complement of the dominant color.

Color interaction affect values, as well. Colors appear darker on or near lighter colors, and lighter on or near darker colors. Complementaries will look more intense on or near each other than they will on or near grays.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Full declaration of a type can be deferred to the unit's body ==

Often, you'll want to make changes to the internals of a private type.  This, in turn, will require the algorithms that act on it to be modified.  If the type is completed in the unit specification, it is a pain to edit and recompile both files, even with an [[Wikipedia:Integrated development environment|IDE]], but it's something some programmers learn to live with.

It turns out you don't have to.  Nonchalantly mentioned in the [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TTL.html ARM], and generally skipped over in tutorials, is the fact that private types can be completed in the unit's body itself, making them much closer to the relevant code, and saving a recompile of the specification, as well as every unit depending on it.  This may seem like a small thing, and, for small projects, it is.  However, if you have one of those uncooperative types that requires dozens of tweaks, or if your dependence graph has much depth, the time and annoyance saved add up quickly.

Also, this construction is very useful when coding a shared library, because it permits to change the implementation of the type while still providing a compatible [[w:Application_binary_interface|ABI]].

Code sample:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Private_And_Body {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 
   {{Ada/--|Operations...}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Body_Type;   {{Ada/--|incomplete type declaration completed in the body}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Body_Type;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Private_And_Body;

The type in the public part is an [[Ada Programming/Types/access|access]] to the hidden type. This has the drawback that memory management has to be provided by the package implementation. That is the reason why &lt;tt&gt;Private_Type&lt;/tt&gt; is a limited type, the client will not be allowed to copy the access values, in order to prevent dangling references.

Normally, the full type definition has to be given in the specification because the compiler has to know how much place to allocate to objects in order to produce code using this type. And the astute reader will note that also in this case the full type definition is given for Private_Type: it is an access to some other (albeit incomplete) type, and the size of an access value is known. This is why the full type definition of Body_Type can be moved to the body.

The construction centering around &lt;tt&gt;Private_Type&lt;/tt&gt; is sometimes called an [[w:opaque pointer|opaque pointer]].

== Lambda calculus through generics ==

Suppose you've decided to roll your own [[Wikipedia:Set (computer science)|set]] type. You can add things to it, remove things from it, and you want to let a user apply some arbitrary function to all of its members. But the scoping rules seem to conspire against you, forcing nearly everything to be global.

The mental stumbling block is that most examples given of [[../Generics|generics]] are packages, and the Set package is already generic. In this case, the solution is to make the Apply_To_All procedure generic as well; that is, to nest the generics. Generic procedures inside packages exist in a strange scoping limbo, where anything in scope at the instantiation can be used by the instantiation, and anything normally in scope at the formal can be accessed by the formal. The end result is that the relevant scoping roadblocks no longer apply. It isn't the full lambda calculus, just one of the most useful parts.

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Sets {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Set {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    ''[..]''
   {{Ada/kw|generic}}
     {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Apply_To_One (The_Element : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Element);
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Apply_To_All (The_Set : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Set);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Sets;

For a view of Functional Programming in Ada see &lt;ref&gt;[http://okasaki.blogspot.com/2008/07/functional-programming-inada.html Functional Programming in...Ada?], by Chris Okasaki&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Compiler Messages ==

Different compilers can diagnose different things differently, or the same thing using different messages, etc..
Having two compilers at hand can be useful.

; &lt;code&gt;selected component&lt;/code&gt;: When a source program contains a construct such as &lt;code&gt;Foo.Bar&lt;/code&gt;, you may see messages saying something like &amp;laquo;selected component &quot;Bar&quot;&amp;raquo; or maybe like &amp;laquo;selected component &quot;Foo&quot;&amp;raquo;. The phrases may seem confusing, because one refers to &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;, while the other refers to &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt;. But they are both right. The reason is that &lt;tt&gt;selected_component&lt;/tt&gt; is an item from Ada's grammar ({{Ada/RM3|4|1|3|Selected Components}}). It denotes all of: a prefix, a dot, and a selector_name. In the &lt;code&gt;Foo.Bar&lt;/code&gt; example these correspond to &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;, '&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;', and &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt;. Look for more grammar words in the compiler messages, e.g. &amp;laquo;prefix&amp;raquo;, and associate them with identifiers quoted in the messages.

: For example, if you submit the following code to the compiler,

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} ''Pak''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Foo {{Ada/keyword|is}}
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} T {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|new}} ''Pak''{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Bar{{Ada/delimiter|;}}  {{Ada/comment| Oops, Pak is generic!}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Foo{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

: the compiler may print a diagnostic message about a prefixed component: &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;'s author thought that &lt;code&gt;Pak&lt;/code&gt; denotes a package, but actually it is the name of a ''generic'' package. (Which needs to be instantiated first; and then the ''instance'' name is a suitable prefix.)

== Universal integers ==

All integer literals and also some attributes like &lt;code&gt;'Length&lt;/code&gt; are of the anonymous type ''universal_integer'', which comprises the infinite set of mathematical integers. Named numbers are of this type and are evaluated exactly (no overflow except for machine storage limitations), e.g.

  Very_Big: {{Ada/keyword|constant}} := 10**1_000_000 - 1;

Since ''universal_integer'' has no operators, its values are converted in this example to ''root_integer'', another anonymous type, the calcuation is performed and the result again converted back in ''universal_integer''.

Generally values of ''universal_integer'' are implicitly converted to the appropriate type when used in some expression. So the expression &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}&lt;/code&gt; is fine; the value of &lt;code&gt;A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as a modular integer since {{Ada/keyword|not}} can only be applied to modular integers (of course a context is needed to decide which modular integer type is meant). This feature can lead to pitfalls. Consider

    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|range}} 1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 6{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Mod_6 {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|mod}} 6{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

and then

    {{Ada/comment| 1}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 2}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} {{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| not OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
    {{Ada/comment| this is the same as}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} ({{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}) {{Ada/keyword|in}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| not OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 3}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} 1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 4}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} {{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} 1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| not OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 5}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Mod_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK?}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 6}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} {{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Mod_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK?}}
       &amp;hellip;

:The second conditional cannot be compiled because the expressions to the left of &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|in}}&lt;/code&gt; is incompatible to the type at the right. Note that &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|not}}&lt;/code&gt; has precedence over &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|in}}&lt;/code&gt;. It does not negate the entire membership test but only &lt;code&gt;A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}&lt;/code&gt;.

: The fourth conditional fails in various ways.

: The sixth conditional might be fine because &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|not}}&lt;/code&gt; turns &lt;code&gt;A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}&lt;/code&gt; into a modular value which is OK if the value is covered by modular type &lt;code&gt;Mod_6&lt;/code&gt;. 

: GNAT GPL 2009 gives these diagnoses respectively:

 error: incompatible types
 error: operand of not must be enclosed in parentheses
 warning: not expression should be parenthesized here

: A way to ''avoid'' these problems is to use &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|not}} {{Ada/keyword|in}}&lt;/code&gt; for the membership test (which, btw., is the language-intended form),

    {{Ada/keyword|if}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|not}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK}}
       &amp;hellip;

== I/O ==

=== Text_IO Issues ===

A canonical method of reading a sequence of lines from a text file uses the standard procedure {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}.''Get_Line''.
When the end of input is reached, ''Get_Line'' will fail, and exception ''End_Error'' is raised. Some programs will use another function
from {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}} to prevent this and test for ''End_of_File''. However, this isn't always the best choice, as has been explained
for example in a Get_Line news group discussion on
[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ada/browse_thread/thread/5afe598156615c8b# comp.lang.ada].

A working solution uses an exception handler instead:

   {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
      The_Line{{Ada/delimiter|:}} String{{Ada/delimiter|(}}1{{Ada/delimiter|..}}100{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Last{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Natural{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
      {{Ada/keyword|loop}}
         Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Get_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}The_Line{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Last{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
         {{Ada/comment| do something with The_Line ...}}
      {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|loop}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|exception}}
      {{Ada/keyword|when}} Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}End_Error {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}}
         {{Ada/keyword|null}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

The function End_of_File RM A.10.1(34) works fine as long as the file follows the canonical form of text files presumed by Ada, which is always the case when the file has been written by {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}. This canonical form requires an End_of_Line marker followed by an End_of_Page marker at the very end before the End_of_File.

If the file was produced by another any other means, it will generally not have this canonical form, so a test for End_of_File will fail. That's why the exception End_Error has to be used in those cases (which always works).

== Quirks ==

Using GNAT on Windows, calls to subprograms from {{Ada/package|Ada|Real_Time}} might need special attention. (For example, the &lt;code&gt;Real_Time.Clock&lt;/code&gt; function might seem to return values indicating that no time has passed between two invocations when certainly some time has passed.) The cause is reported to be a missing initialization of the run-time support when no other real-time features are present in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ada/Cite cla

 {{Ada/keyword|delay}} 0{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

before any use of &lt;code&gt;Real_Time&lt;/code&gt; services.

=== Stack Size ===

With some implementations, notably GNAT, knowledge of stack size manipulation will be to your advantage. Executables produced with GNAT tools and standard settings can hit the stack size limit. If so, the operating system might allow setting higher limits. Using GNU/Linux and the Bash command shell, try

 $ ulimit -s [some number]

The current value is printed when only &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; is given to ''ulimit''.

== New book conversion more or less finished, Current LMOS ==
The conversion form Jim Heffron's book to wikibooks is now more or less complete.  There are still a number of pages from the old book which can be found at [[Linear Algebra/OLD/TOC]].  These pages should either be merged, or (I think) could be used as a seed for a more advanced book on linear algebra for Mathematics majors.  In terms of a local MOS, all mathematics is contained between &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, regardless of inline or displayed.  Theorems, lemmas, remarks, examples, exercises, etc. should be in a {{tlx|TextBox}}.  The book is written in American English.

== Duplicate page ==

There is both a page&lt;br&gt;
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linear_Algebra/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors (no capital letter)&lt;br&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linear_Algebra/Eigenvalues_and_Eigenvectors (with capital letter)&lt;br&gt;
But these are different pages. The table of contents of this book links to the latter, which seems to be the most maintained. But the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue,_eigenvector_and_eigenspace wikipedia article about eigenvalues/vectors] links to the former. Maybe the former should be removed and the wikipedia article changed?

==Suggested points of discussion from failed [[WB:Featured books/Nominations]]==
I think what happens next is discussion continues in the book's discussion pages by book contributors and those with issues with the book. Things to consider discussing more in the book's discussion pages might be:
# Does the book need a new name?
# Does the scope and audience of the book need to be better defined?
# Do parts need to be rewritten to be easier to follow and understand?
# Can missing material be added to reduce or eliminate a need to depend on Wikipedia links?
# How can this book be made better?

== Outdated ==

This is a great wikibook and I am very impressed by the work done on it; however, [http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/ the book it is based off] is updated very regularly, while this one is not. I question whether it might be better to just redirect readers to the original. [[User:InverseHypercube|InverseHypercube]] ([[User talk:InverseHypercube|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/InverseHypercube|contribs]]) 23:00, 4 October 2012 (UTC)
:How much has changed in the area of linear algebra? Is it just some of the applications sections? Or is it reorganization of the sections? [[User:Rgrasmus|Rgrasmus]] ([[User talk:Rgrasmus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rgrasmus|contribs]]) 15:36, 24 April 2013 (UTC)
:*Agree, this is more a unsophisticated &quot;young-Wikipedian&quot; attitude I wouldn't expect to see much here on Wikibooks&amp;mdash;it is a fallacy that all fields of knowledge are progressing at an breakneck pace rather than a recognition that things like mathematical theory or even physics fundamentals are rather stable and updating is hardly ever needed. A lot of the inflation of the cost of education could be eliminated by holding down the switching of texts for standard courses. For example, I have a physics text published in 1911, and 98% of it is still spot on, most of the rest is new theory-but for understanding fundamental mechanics and non-relativistic physics, Newtonian physics, the book is perfectly well suited. 
:: Secondarily, if Mathematicians were good at having applications sections people would actually understand the topics. As an engineer, imho, the whole pedagogy mindset sucks. They do really poorly at relating math to the real world. 
:: Next time, when tagging like these, please put the template in the edit summary. Finding when it was hung and by who would save others time, and have brought me to this note sooner. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 15:15, 31 July 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Programmable devices==
===Microcontrollers===
These days using programmable components is easy. In the early days you had to write code in assembly, burn it in an EPROM, plug the EPROM in its socket and hope you didn't make any mistake. Because if you did, you had to hunt down the error in hundreds of lines of cryptic assembly code and had to use a new EPROM. These days you've got flash memory which can be reprogrammed in circuit. You've got C and Basic compilers to write your code. Most µcontrollers have a whole lot of hardware on chip (UART, Watchdog, Real Time Clock, RAM, ROM, EEPROM,...) and libraries are available for different programming languages which make coding LC-displays or Servos very easy. Not to mention you've got emulators (A special connector plugged into the µcontroller socket which allows a PC to pretend to be the µcontroller) and simulators (simulates the µcontroller on a PC and allows to run its code) to hunt down the bugs.

==== AVR ====
A good µcontroller to start with is the AVR [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=3229 ATtiny2313] (previously: AT90S2313) or [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=2008 ATMEGA8535] (previously: AT90S8535) (Atmel). It's cheap, has all the essentials on chip and has a whole lot of websites dedicated to it. The 8535 is more expensive, but has more memory and has an on board ADC. An AVR combined with [http://www.mcselec.com/bascom-avr.htm Bascom-AVR] is pretty much the easiest way to start with µcontrollers.

''See [[Embedded Systems/Atmel AVR|Atmel AVR]] for details.''

''See [[Robotics/Computer Control/The Interface/Microcontrollers]] for other popular microcontrollers.''

===PC===
The PC has many advantages over µcontrollers when it comes to controlling a robot. However it has 2 flaws that make it nearly impossible to use in small robot-projects:
* First: it's large and heavy.
* Secondly: A modern pc consumes enormous amounts of power.
This means that PCs are limited to tethered or large robots. If power isn't a problem the PC offers enormous amounts of RAM and HD space and plenty of CPU power. Plus a very handy user interface. Also network capabilities can be very useful for some applications. Providing your robot with a wireless connection (IR, radio, WiFi, bluetooth,...) and a similar interface on the PC reduces the wire-problem to a limited-distance (or in the case of IR a line-of-sight) problem.{{{{{{{BookCat}}}}}}}

If you intend to use a PC in your project, you might want to use one of the flavors of linux as the OS, as it allows easy access to any of the parts of the computer. Another choice for an OS is the older MS-DOS, although MS-DOS lacks multithreading (but those can be added in your software) and has ugly memory management (remember the 640Kb limit?).

===Laptop===
The laptop has only its size against it. A laptop provides the benefits of a PC without the enormous power consumption. The downside to laptops is their limited battery life.

===PDA===
The &lt;b&gt;PDA&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;ersonal &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;igital &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;ssistant) is nothing more than a hand held &lt;b&gt;PC&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;ersonal &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;omputer).  Most of the time these units used scaled down &lt;b&gt;RISC&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;educed &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;nstruction &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;et &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;hip) processors to allow for fast execution times and also allow the unit to remain smaller and lighter than your average laptop. Some PDA's even have built-in GPS which makes it very interesting for outdoor robot applications. The downside is their price. The PDA is useful for play, but also serves as a great business tool especially when they are equipped with a stylus.

===Gameboy===
The Gameboy (the classic, advance, color and DS) can be a very powerful device. These have been used in many projects (see google). The only drawback is constructing the special PCB to act as a connector.

===Gameboy Advance (GBA) ===

The Gameboy Advance is also excellent as a robotics platform. There are a few complete open-source development suites available (GCC based C/C++ plus ARM assember). There is also a good kit (Charmed Labs) available to interface Lego robotics motors/sensors and give much more control compared to the Lego RCX. With 4MB of FLASH and a few hundred K of RAM the kit has huge potential. The kit is not really for the complete beginner though as setting up the GNU tools can be quite complicated although the development environment is consequently very rich.

===Programmable Logic Controllers===
Programmable logic controllers, PLCs, are special purpose industrial computers, made to be easy to interface with electrical circuits. Most PLC are expandable but there are some compact &quot;all-in-one&quot; solutions as well. They have excellent bit-manipulating possibilities, and add-on-cards for several special signals as high-speed counters, analog I/O, networks and fieldbuses (RS-232, RS422, RS-485, Ethernet, DeviceNet, Profibus...), pulse output, servo control, etc. Increasingly, special inputs are included in the PLC CPU unit. PLCs are traditionally used to control automated factories, possibly several machines per PLC. They normally use special-purpose programming languages, most commonly ladder or SFC.

PLCs are available in sizes from approximately 5x5x5 cm (there is a PLC IC available as well, but for the purposes of this book we choose to ignore that fact). The smallest ones are very limited though, with only a few I/Os and very limited memory, and also very limited instruction set with regards to data processing and calculations. PLCs are especially suitable if you have a lot of experience of electric systems, but feel intimidated by designing and soldering PCBs and programming computers (i.e., you are an electrician). They also shine in very large system with many special purpose sensors and outputs, as mostly there will be a standard solution from the manufacturer that is possible to use.

The downside with PLCs are their price - They can be quite costly, normally at least an order of magnitude higher than microcontrollers. They also draw more current than a microcontroller, however less than a computer. On the other hand, compared to a computer, they are computationally weak. They aren't suited for heavy signal-processing work.

PLC:s are best suited for large robots, but could be usable in medium-sized projects as well.

===Combinations===
It's common to use both a computer/laptop/PDA and (a) microcontroller(s) as those 2 complement each others limitations. e.g. The first has the advantage of large amounts of memory and processing power, however lacks specific outputs that are very handy in robotics, like PWM. Microcontrollers commonly have PWM channels that operate independently of the rest of the microcontroller, but are limited in their processing speed and memory.&lt;BR&gt; Linking those 2 devices provides the best of both worlds.

==Programming languages==
[[Robotics: Design Basics: Design software#Programming Languages|This]] page discusses some of the available programming languages and provides links to download compilers for those languages.

===Which language to pick?===
The choice of language depends on a few points:

*previous experience. If you're already comfortable with a particular programming language, you'll probably want to use that language for programming your robot.

*How much time and effort you intend to invest. Not every language is equally hard/easy to use. Most of the complexity of a language comes from allowing more low-level access. Basically the more control a language gives to the user, the harder it is to use, but also the more powerful it is. In theory Assembly would allow a programmer to write the fastest and smallest code. However this is only true for an experienced programmer. Modern compilers can generate code that comes near to hand written Assembly. In most cases, using Assembly needlessly complicates a program, with the exception of using inline assembly in a C or Basic program. Usually these are a few lines of code which work directly with memory, or have to execute in a known time. For many if not most projects, a language such as Basic or C suffices. Only if you intend to push a microcontroller or PC to the limits of its capabilities is it worth the trouble of writing Assembly code.
*your goals. If you want a simple robot, you wouldn't need Assembly code at all. With modern microcontroller you can easily write sloppy Basic code and still have sufficient speed and memory. If you intend to build a cutting edge robot with a few dozen sensors, image recognition and speech recognition you'll need to write perfect code and will need Assembly for some of the components in order to have enough speed and be able to fit the code in the limited memory of the microcontroller(s). Most projects will fall in between these two extremes and good written Basic or C code would be more than sufficient. Knowing (some) Assembly can be useful as it'll give some insight on how processors work. Such insights make you a better programmer.
*Availability. Not all languages are available for all microcontrollers. Urbi is open source, C and Basic and Forth are common, often as freeware, other languages might be available commercially, or not at all.

==Writing your software==
This section doesn't intend to teach the basics of programming, just those points that aren't addressed in most programming tutorials and beginners books.

*Style. &quot;Style&quot; is how you indent your lines, how you pick your variable and function names. Pick one and stick with it throughout your program. Especially for functions and variables you should decide when to use capital letters, underscores and when to stick words together. Doing this the same everywhere makes it easier not to miss-spell names.
*Use informative names. Functions, procedures and variables should have informative names. Their purpose should be clear.
*Plan before coding. In software development there are two important steps before coding: requirement analysis and software architecture. The first is about finding out what the program is expected to do, what inputs to expect, which output it should generate and what the limitations of its environment are going to be. The latter involves working out how the program is going to be structured, which data types to use, which algorithms, how the input is going to enter the program and how to make sure it's valid and how to format the output. Using a lite version of these steps will make it much easier to write a decent program. If you intend to build a more complicated robot, you'll going to need to invest more time in planning out your software. Have all your software requirements written out first. Then pick a few of the most critical requirements and refine them. Implement those first. After you're done with those (this includes throughfully testing them), pick a new set and refine and implement those. By doing it in small steps you avoid having to write out everything at the start (and making many assumptions) and get to use the insights you get by coding parts of it.
*Use PDL (Program Development Language) PDL is a method to write functions. It involves writing down the individual steps of a function in plain English without referring to language-specific things, then refining these steps into smaller steps, until it's easier to write the code than to split the steps further. Afterward leave the PDL lines in as comments.
*Simulation and Debugging Learn to use the simulator. It's easier to find errors there than in the hardware. Also learn to use the debugger. It's your best friend for finding errors.
*If your software runs on a PC a log-file can be useful. But be picky with what you let the software log. If you intend to run it for a long time those log-files can become massive. If you want to log sensor data over time, know that these can be imported in Excel by saving the data with spaces between them to separate columns and newlines to separate rows. ''See [[w:Comma-separated values]].''

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== What's an Access Type? ==

Access types in Ada are what other languages call pointers. They point to objects located at certain addresses. So normally one can think of access types as simple addresses (there are exceptions from this simplified view). Ada instead of saying ''points to'' talks of ''granting access to'' or ''designating'' an object.

Objects of access types are implicitly initialized with {{Ada/kw|null}}, i.e. they point to nothing when not explicitly initialized.

Access types should be used rarely in Ada. In a lot of circumstances where pointers are used in other languages, there are other ways without pointers. If you need dynamic data structures, first check whether you can use the Ada Container library. Especially for indefinite record or array components, the Ada 2012 package Indefinite_Holders (RM {{Ada/RM|A|18|18}}) can be used instead of pointers.

There are four kinds of access types in Ada: Pool access types - General access types - Anonymous access types - Access to subprogram types.

== Pool access ==

A ''pool access type'' handles accesses to objects which were created on some specific heap (or storage pool as it is called in Ada). A pointer of these types cannot point to a stack or library level (static) object or an object in a different storage pool. Therefore, conversion between pool access types is illegal. (Unchecked_Conversion may be used, but note that deallocation via an access object with a storage pool different from the one it was allocated with is erroneous.)

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   First_Name : String (1..30);
   Last_Name  : String (1..20);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Person_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Person;

A size clause may be used to limit the corresponding (implementation defined anonymous) storage pool. A size clause of 0 disables calls of an allocator.

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Person_Access'{{Ada/kw|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} 0;

The storage pool is implementation defined if not specified. Ada supports user defined storage pools, so you can define the storage pool with

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Person_Access'{{Ada/attribute|Storage_Pool}} {{Ada/kw|use}} Pool_Name;

Objects in a storage pool are created with the keyword {{Ada/kw|new}}:

 Father: Person_Access := {{Ada/kw|new}} Person;                                          -- uninitialized
 Mother: Person_Access := {{Ada/kw|new}} Person'(Mothers_First_Name, Mothers_Last_Name);  -- initialized

You access the object in the storage pool by appending &lt;code&gt;.{{Ada/kw|all}}&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Mother.{{Ada/kw|all}}&lt;/code&gt; is the complete record; components are denoted as usual with the dot notation: &lt;code&gt;Mother.{{Ada/kw|all}}.First_Name&lt;/code&gt;. When accessing components, ''implicit dereferencing'' (i.e. omitting {{Ada/kw|all}}) can serve as a convenient shorthand:

 Mother.{{Ada/kw|all}} := (Last_Name =&gt; Father.Last_Name, First_Name =&gt; Mother.First_Name);  -- marriage

Implicit dereferencing also applies to arrays:

   {{Ada/kw|type}} Vector {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. 3) {{Ada/kw|of}} Complex;
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Vector_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Vector;
 
   VA: Vector_Access := {{Ada/kw|new}} Vector;
   VB: {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. 3) {{Ada/kw|of}} Vector_Access := ({{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt; {{Ada/kw|new}} Vector);
 
   C1: Complex := VA (3);    -- a shorter equivalent for VA   .{{Ada/kw|all}} (3)
   C2: Complex := VB (3)(1); -- a shorter equivalent for VB(3).{{Ada/kw|all}} (1)

Be careful to discriminate between deep and shallow copies when copying with access objects:

 Obj1.{{Ada/kw|all}} := Obj2.{{Ada/kw|all}};  -- Deep copy: Obj1 still refers to an object
                        -- different from Obj2, but it has the same content
 Obj1 := Obj2;          -- Shallow copy: Obj1 now refers to the same object as Obj2

=== Deleting objects from a storage pool ===

Although the Ada standard mentions a garbage collector, which would automatically remove all unneeded objects that have been created on the heap (when no storage pool has been defined), only Ada compilers targeting a virtual machine like Java or .NET actually have garbage collectors. &lt;s&gt;There is also a &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|pragma}} Controlled&lt;/code&gt;, which, when applied to such an access type, prevents automatic garbage collection of objects created with it.&lt;/s&gt; Note that &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|pragma}} Controlled&lt;/code&gt; will be dropped from Ada 2012, subpools for storage management replacing it. See RM 2012 {{Ada/2012/RM|13|11|3}} and {{Ada/2012/RM|13|11|4}}.

Therefore in order to delete an object from the heap, you need the generic unit {{Ada/package|Ada|Unchecked_Deallocation}}. Apply utmost care to not create dangling pointers when deallocating objects as is shown in the example below. (And note that deallocating objects with a different access type than the one with which they were created is erroneous when the corresponding storage pools are different.)

 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Unchecked_Deallocation}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Deallocation_Sample {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Vector     {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Float;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Vector_Ref {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Vector;
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Free_Vector {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Unchecked_Deallocation}}
       (Object =&gt; Vector, Name =&gt; Vector_Ref);
   
    VA, VB: Vector_Ref;
    V     : Vector;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
    VA     := {{Ada/kw|new}} Vector (1 .. 10);
    VB     := VA;  -- points to the same location as VA
 
    VA.{{Ada/kw|all}} := ({{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt; 0.0);
 
    --  ... Do whatever you need to do with the vector
 
    Free_Vector (VA); -- The memory is deallocated and VA is now null
 
    V := VB.all;  -- VB is not null, access to a dangling pointer is erroneous
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Deallocation_Sample;

It is exactly because of this problem with dangling pointers that the deallocation operation is called '''unchecked'''. It is the chore of the programmer to take care that this does not happen.

Since Ada allows for user defined storage pools, you could also try a [[Ada Programming/Libraries/MultiPurpose/AdaCL#Garbage_Collector|garbage collector library]].

=== Constructing Reference Counting Pointers ===

You can find some implementations of reference counting pointers, called ''Safe'' or ''Smart Pointers'', on the net. Using such a type prevents caring about deallocation, since this will automatically be done when there are no more pointers to an object. But be careful - most of those implementations do not prevent deliberate deallocation, thus undermining the alledged safety attained with their use.

A nice tutorial how to construct such a type can be found in a series of Gems on the AdaCore web site.

[http://www.adacore.com/2011/01/17/gem-97-reference-counting-in-ada-part-1/ Gem #97: Reference Counting in Ada – Part 1] This little gem constructs a simple reference counted pointer that does not prevent deallocation, i.e. is inherently unsafe.

[http://www.adacore.com/2011/06/06/gem-107-preventing-deallocation-for-reference-counted-types/ Gem #107: Preventing Deallocation for Reference-counted Types] This further gem describes how to arrive at a pointer type whose safety cannot be compromised (tasking issues aside). The cost of this improved safety is awkward syntax.

[http://www.adacore.com/adaanswers/gems/gem-123-implicit-dereferencing-in-ada-2012/ Gem #123: Implicit Dereferencing in Ada 2012] This gem shows how to simplify the syntax with the new Ada 2012 generation. (Admittedly, this gem is a bit unrelated to reference counting since the new language feature can be applied to any kind of container.)

== General access ==

''General access types'' grant access to objects created on any storage pool, on the stack or at library level (static). They come in two versions, granting either read-write access or read-only access. Conversions between general access types are allowed, but subject to certain access level checks.

Dereferencing is like for pool access types. Objects (other than pool objects) to be referenced have to be declared {{Ada/kw|aliased}}, and references to them are created with the attribute &lt;code&gt;'Access&lt;/code&gt;. Access level restrictions prevent accesses to objects from outliving the accessed object, which would make the program erroneous. The attribute &lt;code&gt;'Unchecked_Access&lt;/code&gt; omits the corresponding checks.

=== Access to Variable ===

When the keyword {{Ada/kw|all}} is used in their definition, they grant read-write access.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}} Day_Of_Month;

=== Access to Constant ===

General access types granting read-only access to the referenced object use the keyword {{Ada/kw|constant}} in their definition. The referenced object may be a constant or a variable.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Day_Of_Month;

=== Some examples ===

  {{Ada/kw|type}} General_Pointer  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}}      Integer;
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Constant_Pointer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer;
 
  I1: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := 10;
  I2: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Integer;
 
  P1: General_Pointer  := I1'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};  -- illegal
  P2: Constant_Pointer := I1'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};  -- OK, read only
  P3: General_Pointer  := I2'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};  -- OK, read and write
  P4: Constant_Pointer := I2'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};  -- OK, read only
 
  P5: {{Ada/kw|constant}} General_Pointer := I2'Access;  -- read and write only to I2

== Anonymous access ==

Also ''Anonymous access types'' come in two versions like general access types, granting either read-write access or read-only access depending on whether the keyword {{Ada/kw|constant}} appears.

An anonymous access can be used as a parameter to a subprogram or as a discriminant. Here are some examples:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Modify (Some_Day: {{Ada/kw|access}}          Day_Of_Month);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Test   (Some_Day: {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Day_Of_Month);  -- Ada 2005 only

 {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|type}} Thread (Execute_For_Day: {{Ada/kw|access}} Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|is}}
    ...
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Thread;

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Data (Store_For_Day: {{Ada/kw|access}} Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
    --  components
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

Before using an anonymous access, you should consider a named access type or, even better, consider if the &quot;{{Ada/kw|out}}&quot; or &quot;{{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}}&quot; modifier is not more appropriate.

{{Ada/2005|Access}}

In Ada 2005, anonymous accesses are allowed in more circumstances:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   M   : Integer;
   Next: {{Ada/kw|access}} Object;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 X: {{Ada/kw|access}} Integer;
 
 {{Ada/kw|function}} F {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float;
== Implicit Dereference ==
Ada 2012 will simplify accesses to objects via pointers with new syntax.

Imagine you have a container holding some kind of elements.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Container   {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Ptr {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Element;
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (X: Element; Into: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Container);

Now how do you access elements stored in the container. Of course you can retrieve them by

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get (From: Container) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element;

This will however copy the element, which is unfortunate if the element is big. You get direct access with

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get (From: Container) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_Ptr;

Now pointers are dangerous since you might easily create dangling pointers like so:

 P: Element_Ptr := Get (Cont);
 P.{{Ada/kw|all}} := E;
 Free (P);
 ... Get (Cont) -- this is now a dangling pointer

Use of an accessor object instead of an access type can prevent inadvertant deallocation (this is still Ada 2005):

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Accessor (Data: {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Element) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};  -- read/write access
 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get (From: Container) {{Ada/kw|return}} Accessor;

(For the null exclusion {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} in the declaration of the discriminant, see below). Access via such an accessor is safe: The discriminant can only be used for dereferencing, it cannot be copied to an object of type Element_Ptr because its accessibility level is deeper. In the form above, the accessor provides read and write access. If the keyword {{Ada/kw|constant}} is added, only read access is possible.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Accessor (Data: {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Element) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};  -- only read access

Access to the container object now looks like so:

 Get (Cont).{{Ada/kw|all}}      := E;  -- via access type: dangerous
 Get (Cont).Data.{{Ada/kw|all}} := E;  -- via accessor: safe, but ugly

Here the new Ada 2012 feature of ''aspects'' comes along handy; for the case at hand, the aspect ''Implicit_Dereference'' is the one we need:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Accessor (Data: {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Element) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} Implicit_Dereference =&gt; Data;

Now rather than writing the long and ugly function call of above, we can just omit the discriminant and its dereference like so:

 Get (Cont).Data.{{Ada/kw|all}} := E;  -- Ada 2005 via accessor: safe, but ugly
 Get (Cont)          := E;  -- Ada 2012 implicit dereference

Note that the call &lt;code&gt;Get (Cont)&lt;/code&gt; is overloaded — it can denote the accessor object or the element, the compiler will select the correct interpretation depending on context.

== Null exclusions ==

{{Ada/2005|Access}}

All access subtypes can be modified with {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}}, objects of such a subtype can then never have the value null, so initializations are compulsory.

 {{Ada/kw|type}}    Day_Of_Month_Access          {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}}   Day_Of_Month;
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Day_Of_Month_Not_Null_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} Day_Of_Month_Access;

The language also allows to declare ''the first subtype'' directly with a null exclusion:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Day_Of_Month;

However, in nearly all cases this is not a good idea because it renders objects of this type nearly unusable (for example, you are unable to free the allocated memory). Not null accesses are intended for access ''subtypes'', object ''declarations'', and subprogram ''parameters''.[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ada/msg/13a41ced7af75192]

== Access to Subprogram ==

An access to subprogram allows to call a [[Ada Programming/Subprograms|subprogram]] without knowing its name nor its declaration location. One of the uses of this kind of access is the well known callbacks.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Callback_Procedure {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} (Id  : Integer;
                                              Text: String);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Callback_Function {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|function}} (The_Alarm: Alarm) {{Ada/kw|return}} Natural;

For getting an access to a subprogram, the attribute {{Ada/attribute|Access}} is applied to a subprogram name with the proper parameter and result profile.

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Process_Event (Id  : Integer;
                          Text: String);
 
 My_Callback: Callback_Procedure := Process_Event'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};

=== Anonymous access to Subprogram ===

{{Ada/2005|Access}}

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Test (Call_Back: {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} (Id: Integer; Text: String));

There is now no limit on the number of keyword in a sequence:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} F {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|function}} {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|function}} {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Some_Type;

This is a function that returns the access to a function that in turn returns an access to a function returning an access to some type.

== Access FAQ ==

A few &quot;Frequently Asked Question&quot; and &quot;Frequently Encountered Problems&quot; (mostly from [[Programming:C|C]] users) regarding Ada's access types.

=== Access vs. access all ===

An {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}} can do anything a simple {{Ada/kw|access}} can do. So one might ask: &quot;Why use simple {{Ada/kw|access}} at all?&quot; - And indeed some programmers never use simple {{Ada/kw|access}}.

Unchecked_Deallocation is always dangerous if misused. It is just as easy to deallocate a pool-specific object twice, and just as dangerous as deallocating a stack object. The advantage of &quot;access all&quot; is that you may not need to use Unchecked_Deallocation at all.

Moral: if you have (or may have) a valid reason to store an 'Access or 'Unchecked_Access into an access object, then use &quot;access all&quot; and don't worry about it. If not, the mantra of &quot;least privilege&quot; suggests that the &quot;all&quot; should be left out (don't enable capabilities that you are not going to use).

The following (perhaps disastrous) example will try to deallocate a stack object:

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}} Day_Of_Month;
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Free {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation
       (Object =&gt; Day_Of_Month
        Name   =&gt; Day_Of_Month_Access);
 
   A  : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Day_Of_Month;
   Ptr: Day_Of_Month_Access := A'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
    Free(Ptr);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

With a simple {{Ada/kw|access}} you know at least that you won't try to deallocate a stack object.

=== Access vs. System.Address ===

An access can be something different from a mere memory address, it may be something more. For example, an &quot;access to String&quot; often needs some way of storing the string size as well. If you need a simple address and are not concerned about strong typing, use the System.Address type.

=== C compatible pointer === 

The correct way to create a C compatible access is to use {{Ada/pragma|Convention}}:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;
 {{Ada/kw|for}}  Day_Of_Month'{{Ada/attribute|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} Interfaces.C.int'{{Ada/attribute|Size}};
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (Convention =&gt; C,
                    Entity     =&gt; Day_Of_Month);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Day_Of_Month;
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (Convention =&gt; C,
                    Entity     =&gt; Day_Of_Month_Access);

{{Ada/pragma|Convention}} should be used on any type you want to use in C. The compiler will warn you if the type cannot be made C compatible.

You may also consider the following - shorter - alternative when declaring Day_Of_Month:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Interfaces.C.int {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;

Before you use access types in C, you should consider using the normal &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot; and &quot;in out&quot; modifiers. {{Ada/pragma|Export}} and {{Ada/pragma|Import}} know how parameters are usually passed in C and will use a pointer to pass a parameter automatically where C would have used them as well. Of course the RM contains precise rules on when to use a pointer for &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot;, and &quot;in out&quot; - see &quot;{{Ada/RM|B|3|title=Interfacing with C}}&quot;.

=== Where is void*? ===

While actually a problem for &quot;interfacing with C&quot;, here are some possible solutions:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Test {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Pvoid {{Ada/kw|is}} System.Address;
 
   -- the declaration in C looks like this:
   -- int C_fun(int *)
   {{Ada/kw|function}} C_fun (pv: Pvoid) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer;
   {{Ada/pragma|Import}} (Convention    =&gt; C,
                  Entity        =&gt; C_fun,     -- any Ada name
                  External_Name =&gt; &quot;C_fun&quot;);  -- the C name
 
   Pointer: Pvoid;
 
   Input_Parameter: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Integer := 32;
   Return_Value   : Integer;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   Pointer      := Input_Parameter'{{Ada/attribute|Address}};
   Return_Value := C_fun (Pointer);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Test;

Less portable but perhaps more usable &lt;small&gt;(for 32 bit CPUs)&lt;/small&gt;:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} void {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 2 ** 32;
 {{Ada/kw|for}} void'{{Ada/attribute|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} 32;

With GNAT you can get 32/64 bit portability by using:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} void {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} System.Memory_Size;
 {{Ada/kw|for}} void'{{Ada/attribute|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} System.Word_Size;

Closer to the true nature of void - pointing to an element of zero size is a pointer to a null record. This also has the advantage of having a representation for &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt;:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Void {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (C, Void);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Void_Ptr {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}} Void;
 {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (C, Void_Ptr);

== Thin and Fat Access Types ==

The difference between an access type and an address will be detailed in the following. The term ''pointer'' is used because this is usual terminology.

There is a predefined unit &lt;code&gt;System.Address_to_Access_Conversion&lt;/code&gt; converting back and forth between access values and addresses. Use these conversions with care, as is explained below.

=== Thin Pointers ===

Thin pointers grant access to constrained subtypes.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Int     {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -100 .. +500;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Acc_Int {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Int;
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Arr     {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. 80) {{Ada/kw|of}} Character;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Acc_Arr {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Arr;

Objects of subtypes like these have a static size, so a simple address suffices to access them. In the case of arrays, this is generally the address of the first element.

For pointers of this kind, use of &lt;code&gt;System.Address_to_Access_Conversion&lt;/code&gt; is safe.

=== Fat Pointers ===

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Unc     {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Character;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Acc_Unc {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Unc;

Objects of subtype &lt;code&gt;Unc&lt;/code&gt; need a constraint, i.e. a start and a stop index, thus pointers to them need also to include those. So a simple address like the one of the first component is not sufficient. Note that A'Address is the same as A(A'First)'Address for any array object.

For pointers of this kind, &lt;code&gt;System.Address_to_Access_Conversion&lt;/code&gt; will probably not work satisfactorily.

=== Example ===

 CO: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Unc (-1 .. +1) := (-1 .. +1 =&gt; ' ');
 UO: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Unc            := (-1 .. +1 =&gt; ' ');

Here, CO is a ''nominally constrained'' object, a pointer to it need not store the constraint, i.e. a thin pointer suffices. In contrast, UO is an object of a ''nominally unconstrained'' subtype, its ''actual subtype'' is constrained by the initial value.

 A: Acc_Unc            := CO'Access;  -- illegal
 B: Acc_Unc            := UO'Access;  -- OK
 C: Acc_Unc (CO'Range) := CO'Access;  -- also illegal

The relevant paragraphs in the RM are difficult to understand. In short words:

An access type's target type is called the ''designated subtype'', in our example &lt;code&gt;Unc&lt;/code&gt;. RM {{Ada/RM|3|10|2}}(27.1/2) requires that &lt;code&gt;Unc_Acc&lt;/code&gt;'s designated subtype statically match the ''nominal subtype'' of the object.

Now the nominal subtype of &lt;code&gt;CO&lt;/code&gt; is the constrained anonymous subtype &lt;code&gt;Unc (-1 .. +1)&lt;/code&gt;, the nominal subtype of &lt;code&gt;UO&lt;/code&gt; is the unconstrained subtype &lt;code&gt;Unc&lt;/code&gt;. In the illegal cases, the designated and nominal subtypes do not statically match.

__TOC__

== Description ==
R&lt;b&gt;'Size&lt;/b&gt; is a [[:Category:Ada Programming/Representation attributes|representation attribute]] used to get the number of bits of an object or type:
* When applied to an object, 'Size yields the actual number of bits allocated to store the object. 
* When applied to types, 'Size yields the ''minimum'' number of bits required to store an object of that type. 

Thus, the 'Size of a type might be lower than the 'Size of its objects. This is especially important to note for '''[[Ada Programming/Types/record#Variant_record|variant records]]''', where a particular instance of the record may be much larger than the smallest possible record instance.

The 'Size attribute may also be used to set the minimum size in bits used to store a type.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|attributes_size.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Attributes_Size {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
    {{Ada/kw|package}} I_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO (Integer);
 
    A_Boolean : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Boolean := True;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Size of Boolean type   = &quot;); {{Ada/--|An enumeration with}}
    I_IO.Put (Boolean'Size);                {{Ada/--|2 values fits into}}
    T_IO.New_Line;                          {{Ada/--|1 bit.}}
 
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Size of Boolean Object = &quot;); {{Ada/--|it is more efficient}}
    I_IO.Put (A_Boolean'Size);              {{Ada/--|to store a boolean}}
    T_IO.New_Line;                          {{Ada/--|as an entire byte}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Attributes_Size;

The output with GNAT 3.4.1 will be:

 Size of Boolean type   =           1
 Size of Boolean Object =           8

Try it yourself and see how your compiler does.

==World History, Culture, and Geography: The Modern World==

Students in grade ten study '''major turning points''' that shaped the modern world, from the '''late eighteenth century through the present''', including the cause and course of the two world wars. They trace the rise of '''democratic ideas''' and develop an understanding of the '''historical roots of current world issues''', especially as they pertain to '''international relations'''. They extrapolate from the American experience that '''democratic ideals are often achieved at a high price, remain vulnerable, and are not practiced everywhere in the world'''. Students develop an understanding of current '''world issues''' and relate them to their '''historical, geographic, political, economic, and cultural contexts'''. Students consider '''multiple accounts of events''' in order to understand international relations from a '''variety of perspectives'''. 

====10.1 Students relate the '''moral and ethical principles''' in ancient '''Greek and Roman philosophy''', in '''Judaism''', and in '''Christianity''' to the development of '''Western political thought'''. ====

1. Analyze the similarities and differences in Judeo-Christian and Greco-Roman views of law, reason and faith, and duties of the individual.

2. Trace the development of the Western political ideas of the rule of law and illegiti-macy of tyranny, using selections from Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics.

3. Consider the influence of the U.S. Constitution on political systems in the contempo-rary world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a starter page for our major push to create an open content  
textbook that meets the California content standards for
10th grade World History.

'''[[COSTP World History Project|Go to contents of the California Open Source Textbook Project's K-12 World History Project]]'''

[[COSTP World History Project/California Content Standards|California Content Standards]]

----
[http://www.opensourcetext.org/ California Open Source Textbook Project] (COSTP)
COSTP began as a public/private undertaking; it was the first organization created to address the high cost, content range, and consistent shortages of K-12 textbooks in California.  The latter goal is currently  well on its way to being accomplished. COSTP has evolved over recent years to establish and spread the Open Textbook, Open Educational Resource (OER),  Open Courseware, and Open Education memes to K-12 and postsecondary educational institutions, worldwide. Many Open source textbook and courseware projects have started up since COSTP’s inception.   

COSTP's aim is to use California State K-12 Standards to develop open-licensed eBooks and printed textbooks that will be approved for adoption by California's State Board of Education for use in California public schools at far less cost than current commercial textbook offerings, thus helping the State of California save money (more than $200M per year) while providing more robust content for its public schools. 

In order for open source books to pass peer review (and thus approval for public school adoption) at the California State Board level (this is also true in most other states), textbook content must conform to the written state K-12 education framework standard, or it can be specially submitted to the Governor for approval.  This is a sine qua non for adoption; no exceptions are made.

The COSTP World History Project on Wikipedia was used a placeholder pilot that helped to prove the open source concept in the K-12 textbook sector. The COSTP World History Project was successful in helping California education officials understand - even in its current basic beginnings - the value of the open source content approach applied to K-12 textbooks.

      <comment>/* 6INPUT.BAS */ age is supposed to be a numerical variable, not a string variable! Erased $ from age$ making it only age. Corrected a few spelling mistakes.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''INPUT''' command is used to gather input from the user.  This section will attempt to teach you how to gather input upon request from the user.  For real-time input, see [[QBasic/Advanced Input]].

Here is the syntax of the input command:
:&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;INPUT &quot;[text to user]&quot;; [variable] ' Prints questionmark before prompt&lt;/source&gt;
: or
:&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;INPUT &quot;[text to user]&quot;, [variable] ' No additional question mark &lt;/source&gt;

Example:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
INPUT &quot;What is your name&quot;; name$
INPUT &quot;What is your age&quot;; age
&lt;/source&gt;

When an semicolon (;) is used between the text to the user and the variable, a question mark and a space are added to the output. When a comma (,) is used no question mark is added.

If a string is specified (eg 'name$'), anything the user enters before pressing the 'return' key will be accepted. 
If a numeric variable (eg 'age') is specified, the user must enter a number (if any non-numeric key is entered, the error message &quot;Redo from start&quot; will be output and the INPUT command rerun)

== 6INPUT.BAS ==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
CLS
INPUT &quot;What is your name&quot;; name$
PRINT &quot;Hello, &quot;; name$; &quot;! &quot;;
INPUT &quot;How old are you&quot;; age
PRINT &quot;The user, &quot;; name$; &quot; is &quot;; age; &quot; years old&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Please note:''' In the PRINT command, the ';' function 'concatenates' (joins) the contents of the string variables with the text between the quotes (&quot; &quot;). Note the use of spaces so that the final printed text reads properly.

If a numerical variables is specified within the PRINT command, an additional space is automatically added both before and after the number.

'''See also''' &lt;code&gt;LINE INPUT&lt;/code&gt; command to read a line of text from a file (and place the result in a string variable) or to input a series of variables (in which case any commas found will be treated as delimiters between fields).

Used to declare an '''interface'''. Interfaces are the most important innovation in Ada 2005. The basic semantic has been taken from the interface concept of the [[Wikipedia:Java programming language|Java programming language]]. Interface inheritance is a reduced form of [[Wikipedia:Multiple inheritance|multiple inheritance]].

== Interface types ==

There are various forms of interfaces available:

=== Normal interface ===

The normal interface is declared as:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

=== Limited interface ===

Can be used as interface to limited tagged type.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

=== Synchronized interface ===

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|synchronized}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

All synchronized interfaces are also limited.

=== Task interface ===

Can be used as an interface to a task type.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

All task interfaces are also synchronized.

=== Protected interface ===

Can be used as an interface to a protected type.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|protected}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

All protected interfaces are also synchronized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">G'day, thanks heaps for your edits to the quechua book. You seem to understand either quechua or phonetics (or both) far better than i. I would just like to know what happened to the bit on dipthongs, and how the table you put in relates to the oficial spelling changes approved by the Peruvian government in 1985 (which legilates 5 written vowels)? Another note, i started this book because i thought it was in desperate need of being written, not because i knew about anything on the subject. My main source (other than the wikipedia article) is a the lonley planet phrasebook, so please excuse my stupid questions, and bad phrasing of ideas. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 12:07, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:I haven't entered the Wikibooks site for ages, so sorry for being so late to answer. Quechua (unlike English) has no phonemic diphthongs (the phonetic diphthongs are phonemically merely semivocalic consonants juxtaposed to simple vowels; e.g., /aw/ = vowel /a/ followed by consontant /w/, while the English diphthong /aU/ as in &quot;how&quot; is a single, undecomposable phoneme). That's why they do not belong in a description of Quechua's phonemes (they would belong in a description of Quechua's phonotactics, i.e. syllable structure and such, which would also include the description of consonant clusters). As for the former practice of spelling with five vowels, that's due to the misinterpretation that Spanish speakers tend to make about Quechua's vowel phonology. Quechua has only three vowel phonemes, while Spanish has five. As in other languages with only 3 vowels (such as Arabic and Inuktitut), these feature a wide range of allophonic variation, meaning that phonetically one can actually hear sounds similar to [e] and [o] in Quechua, but that phonemically these are merely contextual and predictable realizations of /i/ and /u/ (basically, when they are next to an uvular consonant such as /q/). But to a Spanish speaker, used to thinking of the sounds [i] and [e] as belonging to what in Spanish are completely different phonemes /i/ and /e/, it is frequently difficult to grasp the idea that in some other language they may be considered as mere variants of &quot;the same sound&quot; (as they are for a native Quechua speaker). That is why in former orthographies devised by the educated elite in Peru (who were native speakers of Spanish), the Spanish distinction of /i/ vs. /e/ and /u/ vs. /o/ was artificially forced into Quechua orthography according to how the contextual allophone of /i/ and /u/ sounded to a Spanish ear. Imagine that English orthography had been devised by Quechua speakers; if so, then English consonant /k/ would be spelled differently in the words &quot;key&quot; and &quot;ski&quot;, because even though for a native English speaker it is clear that they have the same /k/ sound, to a Quechua speaker's ear they sound totally different (the former is aspirated like Quechua &quot;kh&quot; and the latter is unaspirated like Quechua &quot;k&quot;), so they would insist in spelling the two allophones of English /k/ differently according to what phoneme the sound would correspond to in Quechua, just like Spanish speakers insisted in spelling the two sounds of Quechua /i/ and of Quechua /u/ differently according to what phoneme the sound would correspond to in Spanish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Setting Up Audacity ==

Before we can use Audacity, we need to install it.

=== Installation of Audacity ===

{{stub}}

=== MP3s and Audacity ===

To make MP3s, Audacity needs the LAME library installed. First we need to create LAME, then tell Audacity where it is. You can list all compatible files in /usr with the command
 find /usr |grep -E 'lib[^*]*lame[^*]*.so'
or your whole computer with
 find / | grep -E 'lib[^*]*lame[^*]*.so'
If you find a libmp3lame.so file (using Debian Sarge 3.1r1), just tell Audacity were it is (below).

Otherwise, you will need to make LAME first:

==== Install LAME ====

* Make sure that [[w:GNU|GNU]] [[w:make|make]] and [[w:gcc|gcc]] are installed. To do this, you can type '''make -v''' and '''gcc -v''' and make sure you don't get a &quot;command not found&quot; error. The -v option just prints the version.

* The LAME library is available from [http://lame.sourceforge.net]. Download the latest version from the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=290&amp;package_id=309  file releases].

* The download is a [[w:tgz|.tar.gz]], you can use [[w:ark]] to extract the files into a folder.

* Go to the console
** In the Linspire menu this is ''L &gt; Programs &gt; Utilities &gt; Console''
** In Konquer press F4

* In the Console, type
 cd &quot;''&lt;directory&gt;''&quot;
replacing ''&lt;directory&gt;'' with the directoy LAME was extracted to; and press enter.
eg: ''' cd &quot;/home/user/lame&quot;

* Now type
 cd &quot;lame*&quot;
to go into a directory called something like &quot;lame-3.96.1&quot;. You can use '''cd &quot;lame-3.96.1&quot;''' instead. You may need to go deeper into the DIR,...so once again;

&lt;pre&gt;
cd lame*
&lt;/pre&gt;

such that you may end up here (or similar); ''/LAME/lame-3.96.1/lame-3.96.1''

Once you are able to type in;

&lt;pre&gt;
./configure --help
&lt;/pre&gt;

and get back an output of useful info, instead of a bash/shell error you know then you are in the correct DIR.
 

* LAME configures itself automatically - type dot slash configure and press enter:
 ./configure

* However; Please read either the INSTALL file, the README file, or review the ''./configure --help'' output (if more advanced) to determine your build options. I chose to include these ''--enable-mp3x'' and ''--enable-debug=norm''. Notice many options are defaulted to yes.

* When it returns to the command prompt you would type
 make
and press enter.

* LAME is now made in that directory, we'd like it installed into the system. This installation requires you to be root (super-user). If you are root (the prompt will be root@something# ) then type:
 make install
and press enter. If you aren't root, type:
 su -c &quot;make install&quot;
and press enter. Type the root password when asked (it will be invisible) and press enter.

==== Install to Audacity ====

When LAME is installed, we need to tell Audacity about it. The first time you go to export to an MP3 Audacity will ask you where libmp3lame.so is located. You can
simply point it to the libmp3lame.so file, normally in the '''/usr/local/lib''' folder, and click OK and you should be all set.

== Using Audacity ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

== Starting point ==
We must remember that these guides were created to help people pass the JLPT level 4 test. Work on the JLPT 4 test first, and then if you wish, go to level 3,2, and then 1.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:209.7.140.15|209.7.140.15]] ([[User talk:209.7.140.15|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/209.7.140.15|contribs]]) 09:56, 17 December 2004&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: I'll have to disagree here. Not everyone comes to this book looking for basic stuff. Aside from that, this is a volunteer-based collaborative project. Just work on whatever you like and think is best. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:41, 11 April 2009 (UTC)

: Like Swift said, I think we should work on what we think is best.  These guides are not limited to the beginner level, but cover (or can cover) all levels. --[[Special:Contributions/211.120.119.94|211.120.119.94]] ([[User talk:211.120.119.94|talk]]) 01:41, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

== Categorization ==

I put this into [[:Category:Standard curricula]] because many other college admissions tests reside there as well and [[:Category:Standardized tests]] is pretty much empty and not worthy of a top-level category.  On [[JLPT Guide/About JLPT]] it states this test was a requirement for admission into Japanese colleges until 2003.  Thus, I feel [[:Category:Standard curricula]] is acceptable.  If there were an easy way to refile everything in Standard curricula in Standardized tests and then rename [[Subject:Standard curricula]] to [[Subject:Standardized tests]], it might be that the latter would be preferable. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:19, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

: There is a difference between a test and a curriculum. While JLPT certification is often used as a requirement for school and work, there is no openly published curriculum. There is even no official list of things to study. Only the test itself is standardised in the sense that scores should accurately reflect abilities,  and the evaluation is consistent over time.
: I see a use for both subjects. Both SATs and GREs are standardised tests, but there are also some books here on Wikibooks that are designed specifically to fit standard curricula (e.g. the South African Home Economics ... can't remember an actual example, but I can try to dig it up if you like). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:42, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

== Use of Japanese in describing test contents ==

On many of the pages, grammar terms and table headers are written in Japanese.  The focus of the test is learning Japanese, so this is understandable.  However, for N5 and N4 test takers, the focus of the test is on test contents -- not on learning more complicated kanji in order to learn what the test contents are.  Is it reasonable to use table headers like &quot;meaning&quot; instead of &quot;意味&quot;, particularly on N5 and N4 pages? [[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 23:48, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

== Using ruby on kanji lists ==

In the kanji lists, I think we should use the following formatting
: {{furi|食べ物|たべもの}}
The following formatting is common for longer texts, but not so good for lists of kanji that already show the onyomi and kunyomi.
: {{furi|食|た}}べ{{furi|物|もの}}

The answer to how much someone would weigh on Saturn is incorrect.  A person would weigh more than 1.066 times their Earth weight on Saturn. [[User:207.191.200.118|207.191.200.118]] 02:20, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Saturn's mass is not the only factor involved. A factor of one over the square of Saturn's radius is also involved. The equation for the gravitional acceleration is g = M / r^2. The ratio between the gravitional accelerations for Earth and the cloud tops of Saturn is close to one. I also figured that the 1.066 figure would work if you were at Saturn's equator.

:Mount Everest is 8.8 km high, so the ridge is 1.5 times higher than 13 km (or just 2.3 times higher compared with 20 km) [[User:Knightowld|Knightowld]] 10:35, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

# It would be nice in the end of this section, wherein each of the techniques are described, to show pictures for each technique. For example, the backtracking discussion can show a tree, while the DP discussion can show a tree with colored branches where the same color represents redundantly solved subproblems. Similarly, DnC can be show in its own division tree. I think it's helpful to descirbe semantics with pictures, and it would just be another way to drive these points home.

===What You Will Learn===
:[NOTE: This is a final section of Chapter 1, to be placed in after the book has evolved enough to make the claim true.]
The primary aim of this book is to help you separate the wheat from the chaff from the large field of algorithms. The book is short enough so that it could be read over the course of one semester, primarily to encourage you to be aware of all of the topics we cover, and how they relate to each other. The comprehensive texts that we recommend in the preamble are useful when you encounter specific problems in software development or research, but often the key points can be lost in such a large treatment. Through the guidance of our own teachers we have beter learned what's important and what's not. This book is dedicated to those teachers.

:On note to massage into this: &quot;The books by (Knuth) and (CLRS) also separate the wheat from the chaff, but in another sense. These authors will literally review all of the technical literature available to find the best and most useful results and present them all in the same notational framework. Thus, part of the purpose they serve is to filter out unimportant results. While we whole-heartedly recommend these books as references it is a rare person who can read so fast or have enough spare time to read them cover-to-cover.&quot; [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:32, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC) (I'd like the end of chapter one to have the dedication, and not the qualification of &quot;Knuth is good... but&quot;, but it's an important point, I believe.)

''A routine for converting a single character to lower case is required''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not really true, and in fact most real-world ASCII tolower routines are written without a separate routine.  Here, the author is abstracting the character routine ahead of time, so that he can reuse the routine in a future function; a beginning programmer may think that they are expected to anticipate such abstractions before writing their code.  It may be more instructive to either explain the abstraction ahead of time (and not implying that it is obvious), or to leave the character routine within the string tolower function and refactor it out only after observing that the character comparision function shares the same functionality.  There should also probably be a note that these routines only apply to lower 128-bit ASCII encodings.

[[User:Jclee|Joe Lee]] 21:03, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:There's no reason at all that these apply to only 7-bit ASCII (for starters, it applies to many other encodings). The text itself allows for unicode (the comment &quot;These techniques depend upon the character encoding&quot; covers this quite well). Also, I think the quotes around &quot;obvious&quot; make it clear that it's not expected for someone to think of it immediately. But this is an advanced text and we should limit hand holding. If a programmer cannot reflect that an entire string needs to be read by a string handling routine, this book is probably too advanced for them. If anything, there is already too much hand holding, covering such a basic concept suitable to introductory programming students.

:I have cleaned up the text to address your concerns. Thanks! [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 21:56, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Precomputing string lengths==
The book currently states &quot;''Note that for a pair of strings, it is also possible to have the length precomputed to avoid the second pass, but that can have its own drawbacks at times.''&quot;; however as far as I can tell, C and C++ are essentially the only programming languages that usually ''don't'' carry around string length data with the string, so I think that statement is misleading at best. -- [[User:Intgr|intgr]] 13:20, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A person can not be said to be fully mastering a language without being able to understand what other people are saying in that language. Listing ability of foreign language is a very important skill in learning a foreign language. Since there are a lot of contributors from all over the world in wiki, it’s possible to gather everyone’s effort to set up a Multilanguage Listening Tank for language learners. 

==How to help?==

It’s very easy to help if you are interested in this project. What you need to do is 1) find an appropriate material in that language, 2) record your voice when you read that. Since everyone speaks at least one language, everyone can make contribution. You don’t have to be a native speaker to make contribution to certain language. For example, if you are a native French speaker, you can still make effort in making English listening material. A master language learner should be able to understand when this language is spoken by non-native speakers.

==Material==

You can find articles in a certain language release in any copyleft license.

==Approaches==

There is a lot of forms of listening test for learners. You can simply make it as “multiplied choices”, “dictation”, “answer the question”.

==Record your voice==

Find appropriate software to record your voice.

==Level==

If you are a native speaker, mark that at the very first beginning of the listening material; if you are not a native speaker, mark that too, so that learner can decide what level it is.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I erased canned food, because of its weight and bulk. Also the tube tent..if you ever tried to spend the night in one,in the rain, you won't need to ask why...As for the surplus mess kit, they are very heavy, and hard to clean.

I concur on the cans, not so much the tent though i would go for a small bivy style one but its all just preference.  A spare mess kit, if it were to consist of a spare cooking pot/mess tin which could be used as a bowl, etc then i would be very much for that however if your suggesting taking two lots of cooking gear then again i concur that it could prove burdensome

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Kennedy and His Advisers=
As a Democrat, John F. Kennedy inherited the New Deal Commitment to America’s Social Welfare System. He generally cast liberal votes in line with the pro-labor sentiments of his low-income, blue collar constituents. Kennedy’s rhetoric and style captured the imagination of many Americans. Another attribute that made him more appealing was the fact that his advisers were mostly young and intellectual as well. Unfortunately though, Kennedy avoided controversial issues such as civil rights and the censure of Joseph McCarthy. 
From the beginning, Kennedy gave top priority to waging the Cold War. In the campaign he had criticized Eisenhower’s foreign policy as unimaginative, accusing him of missing chances to reduce the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union and of weakening America’s standing in the Third World. Kennedy’s advisers had one thing going for them, and that was confidence. Kennedy, along with his advisers were firm in the sense that they were going to change things, and by doing so, they developed a multi-million dollar Alliance for Progress in 1961 to spur economic development in Latin America. In that same year the Peace Corps was also created. Critics later dismissed the Alliance and Peace Corps as Cold War tools by which Kennedy sought to counter anti-Americanism and defeat communism in the developing world. The programs didn’t have those aims, but both were recognized as being born of genuine humanitarianism. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The Tumultuous Sixties; 1960-1968,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=Kennedy and Soviet-American Tensions=
Kennedy had little if any success in establishing relations with the Soviet Union. He met with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in June 1961. The meeting went poorly with both leaders; due to the fact that they were disagreeing over the preconditions for peace and stability in the world. Consequently, the administration’s first year witnessed little movement on controlling the nuclear arms race of even getting a superpower ban on testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere or underground. Instead, both superpowers continued testing and accelerated their arms production. In 1961, the U.S. military budget shot up 15%; by mid-1964, U.S. nuclear weapons had increased by 150%. Government advice to citizens was to build fallout shelters in their backyards and this only resulted in intensified public fear of devastating war. 
If war occurred, many believed it would be over the persistent problem of Berlin. In mid-1961, Khrushchev ratcheted up the tension by demanding an end to Western occupation of West Berlin and the reunification of East and West Germany. Kennedy stood his ground and remained committed to West Berlin and West Germany. In August the Soviets, at the urging of the East German Regime, erected a concrete and barbed wire barricade across the divided city to halt the exodus of East Germans into more prosperous and politically free West Berlin. 
The Berlin Wall inspired protests throughout the non-communist world, but Kennedy proclaimed that, “a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.” The ugly barrier shut off the flow of refugees, and crisis passed. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The Tumultuous Sixites:1960-1968,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis==
[[Image:John F Kennedy.jpg|thumb|right|John F. Kennedy]]
On April 17, 1961, President John F. Kennedy launched an attack on Cuba, using 1,500 CIA-trained Cuban exiles. The exiles were to invade Cuba through the Bay of Pigs in southwestern Cuba. The forces made many mistakes, and at the last moment, Kennedy was advised not to send air support, and he did not. The invasion was a complete failure and within days, Cuban forces crushed the U.S. troops. Kennedy never trusted military or intelligence advice again, and the Soviet Union concluded that Kennedy was a weak leader. The invasion also angered many Latin-American nations.

In 1962, the Soviet Union was desperately behind the United States in the arms race. Soviet missiles were only powerful enough to be launched against Europe but U.S. missiles were capable of striking the entire Soviet Union (missiles were located in Turkey).  In late April 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev conceived the idea of placing intermediate-range missiles in Cuba. A deployment in Cuba would double the Soviet strategic arsenal and provide a real deterrent to a potential U.S. attack against the Soviet Union.

Meanwhile, Fidel Castro was looking for a way to defend his island nation from an attack by the U.S. Ever since the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Castro felt a second attack was inevitable. Consequently, he approved of Khrushchev's plan to place missiles on the island. In the summer of 1962 the Soviet Union worked quickly and secretly to build its missile installations in Cuba.

The crisis began on October 15, 1962 when U-2 reconnaissance photographs revealed Soviet missiles under construction in Cuba. The next morning, Kennedy was informed of the missile installations.  Immediately the executive committee (EX-COMM) made up of twelve of his most important advisers was formed to handle the crisis. After seven days of guarded and intense debate, EX-COMM concluded that it had to impose a naval quarantine around Cuba, which would prevent the arrival of more Soviet offensive weapons on the island.

On October 22, Kennedy announced the discovery of the missile installations to the public and his decision to quarantine the island. He also proclaimed that any nuclear missile launched from Cuba would be regarded as an attack on the United States by the Soviet Union and demanded that the Soviets remove all of their offensive weapons from Cuba. It was at this time that the United States had warships that were on the Caribbean Sea and also had B-52's that were ready to with nuclear bombs flying in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 25th Kennedy pulled the quarantine line back and raised military readiness to DEFCON 2.

On the 26th EX-COMM heard from Khrushchev in an impassioned letter. He proposed the removing of Soviet missiles and personnel if the U.S. would guarantee not to invade Cuba.

October 27 was the worst day of the crisis. A U-2 was shot down over Cuba and EX-COMM received a second letter from Khrushchev demanding the removal of U.S. missiles in Turkey in exchange for Soviet missiles in Cuba. Attorney General Robert Kennedy suggested ignoring the second letter and contacted Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin to tell him of the U.S. agreement with the first.

Tensions finally began to ease on October 28 when Khrushchev announced that he would dismantle the installations and return the missiles to the Soviet Union, expressing his trust that the United States would not invade Cuba. Further negotiations were held to implement the October 28 agreement, including a United States demand that Soviet light bombers be removed from Cuba, and specifying the exact form and conditions of United States assurances not to invade Cuba.

==NASA==
NASA is a branch of the United States government, established by the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Act|National Aeronautics and Space Act]] on July 29, 1958, during the Cold War, as a replacement of its predecessor, the [[w:National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), as an instrument of geopolitics, responsible for the nation's civilian [[w:list of space agencies|space program]] and for aeronautics and aerospace research.

The USSR was ahead of the United States in the space race, in presence and technology.  After the launch of Sputnik and the success of Yuri Gagarin, America was behind in the Space Race. The United States would not allow this, and decided to implement their own space program. Eventually the United States became successful and landed two men on the moon. In May 1961, Alan Shepard Jr. became the first American to make a space flight. Kennedy lobbied for increased funding for space research. In an address to congress on May 25, 1961, Kennedy said, &quot;I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.&quot;

NASA's first high-profile human spaceflight program was Project Mercury, an effort to learn if humans could survive the rigors of spaceflight. On May 5, 1961, Alan B. Shepard, Jr. became the first American to fly into space, when he rode his Mercury capsule on a 15-minute suborbital mission. He launched from Complex 5 at Cape Canaveral aboard a Redstone rocket. His Freedom 7 capsule reached an altitude of 116 miles during this suborbital flight and splashed down some 304 miles out into the Atlantic. The six flights in the Mercury program concluded with Gordon Cooper's launch on May 15, 1963. John H. Glenn, Jr. became the first U.S. astronaut to orbit the Earth on February 20, 1962. With six flights, Project Mercury achieved its goal of putting piloted spacecraft into Earth orbit and retrieving the astronauts safely.

August 12, 1961, NASA announced that it intends to expand the Cape Canaveral facilities for manned lunar flight and other missions requiring advanced Saturn and Nova boosters by acquiring 80,000 acres of land north and west of the Air Force Missile Test Center facilities at the Cape. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was designated to act as real estate acquisition agent for NASA, and the Lands Division of the Justice Department was designated to handle the legal aspects.

July 1, 1962,  Dr. Kurt H. Debus was named director of the Launch Operations Center which later became the John F. Kennedy Space Center. Having supervised the development and construction of launch facilities at Cape Canaveral from 1952 to 1960 for the U.S. Army, he was the natural choice to direct the design, development and construction of NASA's Apollo/Saturn V facilities at KSC. He retired in November 1974, having been responsible for the launches conducted during the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs.
With the American space race against the Soviets came a lot of funding which then later brought jobs. America was in high pursuit to be the first country to reach the moon. Billions of dollars were spent on hiring many research workers and engineers to be able to put a man on the moon. The NASA program not necessarily helped the lower class people find work but for those who where educated it was quite a beneficial program.

==American Tragedy==

On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was at a campaign rally in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy and his wife rode through the streets in an open car, turning into Dealy Plaza at Houston and Elm, and suddenly several shots rang out. Kennedy fell against his wife. The car sped to the nearest hospital, Parkland Memorial, but it was too late; the beloved President was dead. Tears ran down the cheeks of CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite as he told the nation their president was dead. The word spread quickly, in whispered messages to classroom teachers, by  somber announcements in factories and offices. The nation was stunned. Shortly after, while on Air Force One, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office as President.

Although many &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; exist concerning this assassination, the rough consensus is that Kennedy's assailant, a young drifter and loner named Lee Harvey Oswald with left-wing sympathies, shot the President acting alone.
Lee Harvey Oswald was charged for the murders of Kennedy and Roy Truly a Dallas police officer. Owsald was first spotted three miles from the plaza in which he was called to the squad car of officer Trully, where he then panicked and shot Trully four times. Oswald was later arrested forty minutes later in a near by theater, and just two days later Oswald was shot dead in full view of millions of TV viewers.  Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1 pm.

==Americans in Vietnam==

Like Eisenhower, Kennedy had viewed Vietnam as a crucial battle in the fight against communism. He sent many special forces troops to South Vietnam to train South Vietnamese troops. Kennedy also put pressure on South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem to make political and economic reforms that would prevent communism from taking root in South Vietnam. After Diem refused to comply and restricted the rights of Buddhists (the majority religion in South Vietnam), he lost support, and a political coup ensued. Diem was assassinated on November 1, 1963.

In the month of February 1965, President Johnson ordered Operation Rolling Thunder to take place. It was ordered due to the Vietcong Attacks on American installations in South Vietnam which was responsible for the deaths of thirty-two Americans.  Operation Rolling Thunder was a bombing program that started in 1965 and continued on until October 1968.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the end of November, the United States had almost 15,000 troops in Vietnam as advisers. The U.S. sent the Secretary of Defense on a fact-finding mission to find if involvement was still needed in Vietnam. He concluded that the South Vietnamese could not hold off the Vietcong, or Vietnamese communists, without more American backing. In 1964, Johnson claimed that North Vietnamese patrol ships attacked American ships in the Gulf of Tonkin, and Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave the President broad control over troops in Vietnam.

In 1965, Johnson gradually built up the involvement of America in Vietnam. At the end of 1965, about 180,000 troops were in Vietnam. By 1967, there were over 500,000. The U.S. also began a bombing campaign in North Vietnam, and by 1968, more bombs had been dropped than the U.S. had dropped in World War II.

The Vietnam War became “Americanized” and the troop increase and Operation Rolling Thunder played part in doing so. Instead of the war being a civil war between North and South Vietnam it ended up becoming an American war against the communist government in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt; 


As Americans fought the war, frustration mounted. Soldiers had to fight through dense jungles and muddy land. It also seemed that for every Vietcong or North Vietnamese killed, many more would be replacements. The bombing campaign in the North actually heightened the morale of the North Vietnamese rather than lowering it, and the United States' losses increased. By the end of the decade, many outraged American citizens angrily opposed and protested the war. Opposition to the war was growing in the capital, too. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara no longer believed that the war could be won.

At home, protesters, especially college students, became increasingly bitter about the war. Others who tended to be older and more conservative, defended the war and sought to suppress the &quot;traitors.&quot;  This division between the young and the old became known as the '''generation gap'''. Officials at the University of California tried to limit recruiting efforts of protesters, and students were outraged. They held a protest that stopped the school for days. This type of protest spread across the nation, and many related ideas and activists became known collectively as the '''New Left'''.

Many of those who made up the New Left also made up the '''counterculture''', a movement that questioned basic American values and social customs. Parents found themselves increasingly disagreeing with their children. The counterculture was also expressed in pop culture, with many icons expressing the need for peace and reform.

Eventually, some adults came to resent the war. As adults began to disagree about the war more, they were called doves (those who wanted peace) and hawks (those who supported the war). Students also had a major gripe about the war: if the legal age to be drafted to go to war was eighteen, why was the legal voting age as high as twenty-one? Eventually, the twenty sixth amendment was passed in 1971, which met the demands of the students and lowered the legal voting age to 18.

Division in the country about the war became increasingly harsh and bitter. In October 1967, 50,000 people opposed to the war marched to the Pentagon in Washington D.C. to protest. Many students stuck flowers or other symbols of peace in the barrels of the guns held by those who guarded the pentagon. By the beginning of 1969, well over fifty percent of the nation opposed the war.

== President John F. Kennedy 1961-1963 ==
 
John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States. Of Irish descent, John was born May 29, 1917 in Brookline Massachusetts. John was married to Jacqueline Lee Kennedy. They had four children Arabella, Caroline, John Jr., and Patrick. President Kennedy took office January 20, 1961 and served till he was assassinated in November 22, 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald. He was 46 when he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy is the only Catholic President we have ever had in the United States. President Kennedy was a Democratic and served in the United States House of Representatives before becoming President.
Graduating from Harvard in 1940, before becoming elected into the House of Representatives John Kennedy served in World War Two in the Navy. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety. After serving in the House of Representatives where he served three terms as a representative for Boston, Kennedy then became elected into the Senate in 1952. In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history. In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eight Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Before President Kennedy left to fight in WWII he studied at Harvard University. He wrote a thesis in 1940 called Why England Slept which became a best seller. President Kennedy wrote again in 1956 and the piece was called Profiles in Courage which won the Pulitzer Prize.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kennedy, John F(itzgerald), (29 May 1917 – 22 Nov 1963).&quot; The Crystal Reference Encyclopedia. West Chiltington: Crystal Semantics, 2005. Credo Reference. Web. 16 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lyndon B. Johnson ==
Lyndon Baines Johnson (August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973), often referred to as LBJ, was a US politician who served as the 36th President of the United States (1963-1969) after his service as the 37th Vice President of the United States (1961-1963). He is one of four people who served in all four elected federal offices of the United States: Representative, Senator, Vice President and President.
Johnson, a Democrat, served as a United States Representative from Texas, from 1937–1949 and as United States Senator from 1949–1961, including six years as United States Senate Majority Leader, two as Senate Minority Leader and two as Senate Majority Whip. After campaigning unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1960, Johnson was asked by John F. Kennedy to be his running mate for the 1960 presidential election.

==The &quot;Great Society&quot; and Civil Rights Under Lyndon B. Johnson==

In January 1964, the new President Johnson made a series of proposals which he called the &quot;Great Society&quot; and began a &quot;war on poverty.&quot; He signed many programs into law that helped Americans in poverty, that is, those who do not make enough money to survive. During this time two of the most important programs signed into law were Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare provided cheap health insurance to senior citizens and Medicaid provided health insurance for the poor.The War on Poverty made much difference to the poor people living in America. It helped change and improve the way poor people were living in homes as well as changing and improving the health care that was being offered to them.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;   Cities and school also received boosts with the creation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the signing of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.  

President Johnson's “Great Society” really helped change things in America during the 1960's. During his presidency Johnson took 45 domestic social programs and transformed that number to 435 programs. “The Great Society” was designed to help the people in America and it did just that; the poverty number in America changed from 22 percent of the population to 13 percent. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Great Society.&quot; The American Economy: A Historical Encyclopedia.

===Equal Rights===

Protests were growing in the 1960s. Blacks and whites in high schools and colleges in the South and the North staged sit-ins, protests that are accomplished by sitting down and not being productive or letting people pass. 

Another kind of protest was growing in the South. In 1961, groups of African Americans began riding buses from Washington D.C. that were bound for New Orleans to make sure that the Rosa Parks Supreme Court decision was being enforced. These bus riders were known as freedom riders. The rides went smoothly until the buses reached Alabama, where the freedom riders would be greeted with violence from angry whites. 

In the spring of 1963, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Martin Luther King Jr. targeted Birmingham, Alabama for segregation protests. Birmingham, a city in the deep South, was a hotbed for racism and segregation. City police arrested hundreds of protesters, as well as King himself, but protests continued. National television showed snarling dogs being set on the unarmed protesters and children being washed away on the impact of the water from fire hoses. As the nation watched in horror, President Kennedy announced a civil rights bill that would outlaw segregation nationwide.

On August 28, 1963, nationwide support for the civil rights bill boiled over. Over 200,000 people of all races and colors came to Washington D.C. to participate in a massive march organized by the SCLC and Mr. King. There, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, King read the words that would become one of history's greatest speeches:

&quot; '''I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.'...I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character...When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing...'Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!' '''&quot;

After Kennedy's death, Johnson, a firm believer in equal rights, promised that the bill would be signed into law. In the first July of Johnson's term, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law made discrimination illegal against African Americans in employment, public accommodations, and voting. The act not only protected African Americans, but it also prohibited discrimination by sex, religion, and ethnicity. It was followed in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act. The Voting Rights Act eliminated poll tax which is the 24th Amendment to the constitution, and literacy tests, therefore helping not just blacks, but all Americans gain equal rights. A very big tragedy stood out during the sixties. On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was killed.  Malcolm, who had to deal with watching his house burn to the ground as a child, later spoke out against the inequality against the blacks of this nation. He soon appealed to both black and white, as he continued to speak out against racial inequality. He continued to speak out until he was shot and killed, but no one knew who killed him, It may have possibly been the work of other black Muslims.

Martin Luther King Jr. was a very influential person during the sixties, maybe the most influential. He had preached on non-violent protest and had developed many followers, both black and white. He was put in jail several times, but managed to continue his preaching by writing a book. Martin Luther King Jr. was president of the Southern Christian Leadership Council. He and his followers organized numerous marches, rallies, and strikes to call attention to the systematic discrimination against minorities that was endemic in American society. His belief was in nonviolent confrontation with the authorities and a prodding of the conscience of the white majority to effect social change. He convinced President John F. Kennedy and later President Lyndon B. Johnson to push for legislation to end discrimination and was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 1964. Although the deaths of Kennedy and Malcolm X were a huge deal, there was another huge tragedy in the sixties. On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. He was shot on the balcony of his motel room that he was staying at in Memphis, Tennessee.

===The Nation of Islam===
The Nation of Islam (&quot;NOI&quot;) was founded in Detroit, Michigan, by Wallace D. Fard Muhammad in July 1930. He set out to improve the spiritual, mental, social, and economic condition of the Black men and women of America. From 1934-1975, the NOI was led by Elijah Muhammad, who established businesses, large real estate holdings, armed forces and schools.[1] the Nation of Islam made lasting effects on blacks in the 1950’s and beyond. The Nation of Islam rose to prominence between 1953 and 1963 when founded in Detroit, Michigan, by Wallace D. Fard Muhammad in July 1930. He set out to improve the spiritual, mental, social, and economic condition of the Black men and women of America. From 1934-1975, the NOI was led by Elijah Muhammad, who established businesses, large real estate holdings, armed forces and schools. Their outspoken activist, Malcolm X,became a prominent minister and leader in the NOI. Before his assassination in 1965, he had moved to non-separatism and orthodox Sunni Islam after his experience of having made Hajj to Mecca. The Nation of Islam, referred to as Black Muslims, took factors of orthodox Islam to form a new sect. Originally the Nation preached segregation and hate towards white people. They said that the white man was cursed for eternity by Allah. Malcolm X often suggested complete separation of blacks and whites and thought that blacks should have their own land to live on separate from all whites. Under Malcolm X’s leadership the Nation grew from 500 members to as many as 30,000 to over 100,000 members in the early 60’s. They converted many famous black figures, most notably Muhammad Ali. The Nation offered a much more radical and less subservient message to oppressed blacks than Martin Luther King, Jr. did. Malcolm X’s most infamous words were “By any means necessary.” Just as the Nation of Islam had risen with the help of Malcolm X, so did they fall. In 1963, when Malcolm X found out about the morality problems of his prophet and idol, Elijah Muhammad, they began to separate. Malcolm X took notice of Elijah’s sexual relations with as many as six females of the Nation, an act which the Koran directly forbids. After Malcolm X made a highly criticized statement about John Kennedy’s death, Elijah took his opportunity to silence X. After this Malcolm X converted to orthodox Islam and parted ties with the Nation of Islam, crippling the amount of influence the Nation had on the world.

===A Second Tragedy===

On the morning of April 4, 1968, King was preparing to lead a march from the balcony of a hotel when shots rang out. Friends inside rushed outside to find King shot in the jaw.  The shooter was a sniper. Martin Luther King, Jr. was pronounced dead a few hours later. The nation was in complete shock.  There were many riots that happened throughout the country.  There were at least 110 cities throughout the United States that had violence the following day.  The worst riots happened in Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington D.C.  This was the largest domestic civil disturbance that has happened in the United States.  About 22,000 federal troops and 34,000 national guards were sent out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jofreeman.com/photos/Kingfuneral.html&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, rioting plagued America's streets as a profound sadness and anger gripped the nation. This would be one of many assassinations that would befall the country, including those of, Dr. Martin Luther King, Robert F. Kennedy, and Malcolm X.

Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21st, 1965 in Manhattans Audubon Ballroom.  It all started when a man ran up to Malcolm and shot him with a sawed off shotgun.  After that two other men charged Malcolm and shot him with pistols about sixteen times.  All three men were eventually caught and charged with murder.

===Pop Culture in the '60s===
While wars were being fought over race and democracy, a group of people in America stayed relatively unaffected by it: the rich.  The 1960’s provided a peak in American culture with movies, music, art and literature.  Possibly the climax of pop culture in the 1960’s was author Truman Capote’s Black and White Masquerade Party.  

Truman Capote was a critically acclaimed author and good friend to all the stars and socialites of the time.  Capote kept enough friends to fill an entire phone book, and almost all of them were rich, famous, and intriguing.  In 1966, coming off the success of his book, In Cold Blood, about a Kansas murder, Capote decided to throw a masquerade party.  Capote planned the party for over a year and developed one of the most select and exclusive guest lists.  With everyone wanting an invitation, Capote only handed out 500 invites to guests.  Guests were not allowed to bring uninvited escorts, so only the “who’s who” of people were allowed to attend.  Many stars felt spurned when they did not receive invitations.

On November 28th, 1966 the ball took place.  The guest list included Frank Sinatra, Andy Warhol, and Norman Mailer.  The party was a complete success.  The publicity that the ball received before the event was somehow exceeded by the publicity it received after.  It was immediately declared the party of the century, and all the stars raved about it.  In the years that followed the ball Capote’s popularity disintegrated, and posthumously he is remembered as much for the Black and White Ball itself as he is his writing career.
===The Stonewall Riots===
Perhaps aided by the Civil Rights Movement, or at least motivated by it, the Gay Rights Movement largely got its start in the early 1970s.  The first sign of gay people fighting for their rights as human beings started with the Stonewall Riots of 1969.  In New York City, after a gay bar was raided by the police, over a thousand gay people took a stand and began to revolt against the police.  It is not clear how the riot first started.  According to a veteran gay activist, the incident just involved a lot of people who all got angry at the same time.  The cops went into the bars and asked everyone for their identification.  Many people were being pushed out of the bars and into a paddy wagon.  Not sure how it started, the stonewall riot worked like a domino effect.  However it started, it ignited many others to fight for their rights against the police.&lt;ref&gt;http://socialistalternative.org/literature/stonewall.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Like many racial humans, the gays would go around and chant “gay power” throughout the streets.&lt;ref&gt;http://socialistalternative.org/literature/stonewall.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Throwing rocks and bottles at the police officers, the crowd chanted for gay rights.  After news of the riot spread, riots began happening across the nation for three days.  The Stonewall Riots are known as one of the most significant moments at the start of the Gay Rights Movement.

===Fact's and Figure in the '60s===

The sixties were an age of youth, as 70 million children from the baby boom became teenagers and young adults.  Trends shifted away from the conservative fifties and resulted in revolutionary ways of thinking and real changes in the cultural foundation of American life. Young people wanted change and the changes affected education, values, lifestyles, laws, and entertainment. All of the changes mentioned above were a major factor in the figures below.

* Population 177,830,000
* Unemployment 3,852,000
* National Debt 286.3 Billion
* Average Salary $4,743
* Teacher's Salary $5,174
* Minimum Wage $1.00
* Life Expectancy:  Males 66.6 years, Females 73.1 years
* Auto deaths 21.3 per 100,000

An estimated 850,000 &quot;war baby&quot; freshmen enter college; emergency living quarters are set up in dorm lounges, hotels and trailer camps.

In the 1960’s several music songs came into popularity like: “Cathy’s Clown,” “Spanish Harlem,” “Only the Lonely,” “Moon River,” “I Fall to Pieces,” “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” “Louie Louie,” “Hello Dolly,” “Satisfaction,” “Stop in the Name of Love,” “California Dreamin,” “Respect,” “Mrs. Robinson,” and “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In.”


Also, as times advanced throughout the 1960’s so did technology and numerous TV Shows: The Super Bowls, Star Trek, Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In, Sesame Street (premieres on PBS in 1969), The Smothers Brothers, and The Dick Van Dyke Show.


In the 1960s in the post war era automobiles production was increased a great deal. Of the cars that were produced among the most popular during the decade: Volkswagen bug, ’64 Ford Mustang, ’63 Corvette Sting Ray, Chevy Bel Air, ’64 Plymouth Barracuda, and ‘64 Pontiac GTO.


Also, during the 1960’s the society as a whole had a very free spirit way of thinking, and several fads broke in that included: face painting, wearing flowers in one’s hair, the Twist (hair-do), the jerk (dance), lava lamps, waterbeds, Day-Glo and black light, posters, and flashing the peace sign.

== Elections of the 1960s ==

The presidential election of 1960 featured a race of John F. Kennedy (Democrat) vs. Richard M. Nixon (Republican). Both candidates had similar political stances in believing they wanted a strong military front and both supported funding numerous welfare programs for the poor. Kennedy promised to lead Americans to a New Frontier. Kennedy ultimately won the election over Nixon by a narrow margin of electoral votes 303 to 219.

The presidential election of 1964 featured a race of Lyndon B. Johnson (Democrat) and Barry Goldwater (Arizona). Goldwater's brand of politics scared many Americans. He opposed civil rights, legislation, wanted to make Social Security voluntary, and proposed deep cuts in social programs. Johnson's slogan for the campaign was &quot;All the way with LBJ.&quot; Johnson won in a landslide of votes 486-52.

== The Women's Movement ==

In the year 1963, Betty Friedan fueled the fire for women's rights when she wrote her book called &quot;The Feminine Mystique.&quot; This book became unexpectedly popular among women. Friedan was a housewife and mother who decided to tackle the problem that she called &quot;the problem with no name.&quot; This problem was the lack of education that middle-class wives and mothers received. These women looked at their homes and their lives and wondered if that was all life had to offer. Women across the country became more and more dissatisfied with their stay-at-home life. Friedan's approach was different than the typical argument for a women's movement, however, because she blamed the women for being unable to adjust to their role in the home rather than blaming society for creating that role for women.

The women's movement began an organized liberal group in 1966 called National Organization for Women, also known as NOW. This group was mainly comprised of educated and professional women. Since the EEOC was more focused on racial rights and discrimination, they did not pay much attention to gender discrimination. Because the rights of women was being ignored, NOW made it one of their main purposes to pressure the EEOC into hearing them out and enforcing their rights that were given to them in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Unfortunately, the EEOC basically considered NOW and the idea of women's rights to be a joke and even went as far as laughing at the idea when asked about it by a reporter. This made women in the work force that had to deal with discrimination, very angry. By 1970, NOW had more than 3,000 members across the nation. 

Women at this time craved social change and justice and became more radical. More and more women were noticing and getting fed up with being treated as second-class citizens. These women began to look beyond the roles that they were being forced into and looked at the roles that they willingly put themselves into. In 1968, a large group of women went to protest the Miss America Pageant that was being held in Atlantic City.  These women were against “degrading mindless-boob girlie symbol” that the beauty pageant represents and promotes. The women would take “enslavement” items such as: girdles, bras, high heels, and curlers, into the “Freedom Trashcan.” Even though nothing was actually burned, feminists of this time were consequently received the demeaning nickname “bra-burners.” 

The women who firmly believed in feminism and fought for women’s rights never really had a firm set of beliefs and many times used arguments on the opposite side of the board. On one side they argued that women were more sensitive than men and that this sensitivity would greatly improve every aspect of America including foreign diplomacy, government, businesses, and alike. They argued that men could not bring this quality to the table. However, on the other side, women argued that women and men were equal and therefore deserved equal treatment and that socially imposed roles were unfair. Charlotte Bunch, a feminist author, writes that “there is no private domain of a person’s life that is not political, and there is no political issue that is not ultimately personal.” They called this “personal politics” and many radical feminists jumped onboard with this idea very quickly. Women began “consciousness-raising” groups in order to discuss the fact that in their everyday lives, at work, and in the home, they were subordinated by men and how they lived in a highly patriarchal society. Women all across the country began these groups everywhere, in college dorms, churches, and suburban kitchens to discuss the topics of male dominance in work, healthcare, romance, marriage, sexuality, abortion, and family. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton, et al, &quot;A People and A Nation:Eighth Edition&quot;, 901-902&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">CORBA stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture. The original idea was to create a single universal standard for how objects across different platforms, programming languages, network protocols can communicate with each other in a seamless manner. For example, an application developed on say a Sun Workstation running Unix under the programming language C needs to communicate by virtue of some well defined standard interface (the accepted contract) to a Intel based PC running Windows-2000 developed under Pascal. Without such a standard both sides need to negotiate all the details including the transport protocols.

The CORBA standard defines general interface standards that can be supported by different programming languages. In addition it also defines the quality and robustness of the communication, error handling, and recovery. The Standard does not cover implementation details, but only specifies the general interface language (IDL) used across all supported languages, exception handling specification, a special transport protocol called IOP that sits on top of TCP/IP, as well as the specific programming language mappings. Using the IDL, an implementation for the specific platform dependent object is generated which can be compiled using the supported language.

Since the Simplified Chinese is the domaint Chinese script in the world now, and not to make the learners confused, I think we should intial the Simplified Chinese lesson textbook first. Of course, a Traditional Chinese textbook is very necessary, but it's very easy to convert simpilified Chinese into traditional Chinese by softwares like Nanjixing or Miscosoft Office. I don't how many sentense patterns need to be taught. maybe we can find some other textbook as reference. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 12:38, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== hi...some questions ==

wow...this seems like an awesome undertaking...so all my comments are not designed to offend but rather to knowledgeify myself and hopefully raise some valid points:P

*what is the end goal of this project...i.e. how far do you guys (and me hopefully) plan to expand the lessons until? fluency? or just enough that one could get around in china w/out too much trouble? or are you guys going for 言文言. 

*the formating of the lessons...as most of them are incomplete atm. i just looked at lesson 1. it's quite good i might add :)... but from my experience teaching non-native speakers, it's VERY helpful to have the pin ying above the corresponding characters. now...for the tests i made for my students i had to do some funky spacing in ms word...is there a way to do that on wiki? or through a program? because most of the standard textbooks (whether for non-native speakers or for young children) have the pin ying above the characters to aid in pronounciation. for example, if a student sees 老师 enough times with lǎo shī above it, when the time comes for them to read w/out pin ying, they see 老师 and associate it with lǎo shī and thus are able to pronounce it. whereas if there is not the constant association, they have trouble recalling the pronounciation.

*the lessons (at least the ones i looked at 1, 2, and 7) seem a little fast paced. students like it when they can work through a lesson and they are left with a sense of accomplishment. from a non-native speaker's point of view, lesson 1 is a bit on the long and hard side...is it possible to restructure the lessons so we have more lessons but less content in each?

thanks for taking the time to read my points...i know i sound like an insufferable twit talking about &quot;my experiences&quot; and stuff...but i just want to help :) 
the answers to my queries may already be somewhere on the talks pages of the project...but i have trouble keeping track of 1 talk page...let alone dozens...so if the answers are already somewhere...could someone redirect me or fill me in? please and thank you...so for now...i await your replies...:)

[[User:ZeChinaman|ZeChinaman]] 17:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)



Edit: by hard lessons i meant the vocabulary...the conversations are fine...but the vocabulary is hard to take in one go...repetition in the lessons wouldn't hurt either. is it possible/practical to make the text bigger? i find that non-native speakers/readers have a hard time reading Unicode typed chinese. i can record/upload some sound files too...reading the sound upload guide atm....cheers :)

== Roadmap? ==

The roadmap on the main page is somewhat behind considering the lessons have already reached 8. Is there an updated, more current plan to the direction this book is going? [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 13:35, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Acca sellowiana Fruit MHNT Fronton.jpg|right|thumb|Feijoa.]]

The '''Feijoa''' or '''pineapple guava''' is an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]-shaped [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] with a thin [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]-green skin. The flesh inside is [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]-colored and encases a [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]]-like center. The texture is [[Cookbook:Grits|gritty]], close to that of a [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]]. The flesh tastes like a combination of several other fruits, usually described as [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], [[Cookbook:Guava|guava]], and [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberry]]. Some people report a taste similar to that of a [[Cookbook:Quince|quince]] or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]. Feijoa is native to [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South America]], but is now commercially grown in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]].

==Selection==
Select fruit that is fragrant and gives slightly to gentle pressure. Ripe feijoas are delicate, so take caution not to bruise the fruit. Imported feijoas are available from late March to June; while domestic ones reach the market in the fall. Feijoas are gaining in popularity and are becoming easier to find in supermarkets. They are already easy to find in speciality markets and can often be ordered out-of-season through several online merchants.

==Storage==
Ripe feijoas may be refrigerated, but they don’t have to be. Ripen feijoas in a paper bag at room temperature; to ripen quicker add an [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]] to the bag. Ripe feijoas normally last about 3 to 5 days. Feijoas may be frozen, but only if peeled and cooked into a [[Cookbook:Puree|purée]].

==Preparation==
Feijoas are most often eaten raw. The fruit is ripe when it is slightly soft and the jellied inner section is clear. The fruit is unripe when the jelly is white and is spoiled when the jelly is brown. Unfortunately, this test of ripeness may only be determined once the fruit is opened. Peel the fruit before preparing, as the skin is bitter.</text>

The term '''skate''' is used in Britain to describe almost any member of the ray family or Rajidae; especially the genus Raja. They have flat pectoral fins continuous with their head, two dorsal fins and a short, spineless tail.

In the kitchen, two parts of the skate are cooked as food. '''Skate wings''' are the pectoral fins. When skinned, they take the form of a sheet of cartilage separating two layers of fibred flesh. The wings can be cooked in a variety of ways. The simplest is to dust the wing on both sides with [[Cookbook:Seasoned flour|seasoned flour]] and shallow [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] fairly quickly. They can also be [[Cookbook:Poaching|poached]] in a [[Cookbook:Court-bouillon|court-bouillon]]. To eat, scrape the flesh off the cartilage with a knife and fork. Skate wings are often served with a [[Cookbook:Caper|caper]] sauce.

Less commonly seen are '''skate knobs'''. Stop giggling. These are balls of flesh from the cheeks of the fish. They are easily and quickly cooked by shallow frying. You can also coat them in [[Cookbook:Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] before cooking. Overcome any qualms you have, because they are very tasty.

'''Seasoned flour''' is [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] that has been flavoured with a small amount of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], and sometimes other ingredients like grated lemon peel, or other spices. It is generally used as a light coating for meat and fish that is intended to be [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Albania|Albanian Cuisine]]

'''Albanian vegetable pie''', '''''Byrek Shqipëtar me perime''''', is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Albania|Albania]]n recipe for cooking pies. Albanian pies are generally made of thin pastry leaves which can be rolled out at home or bought as [[Cookbook:Filo Dough|filo dough]] at a supermarket. Most of the pies prepared by Albanian cooks are not sweet; instead, pie fillings are almost always savory. Thus, a piece of such a pie may well serve as the main dish of a meal.

== Ingredients ==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]], preferably [[Cookbook:Olive_Oil|olive oil]]
*1½ packets (or about 30) pastry leaves (filo dough)
*1½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] (680 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) spinach, chopped
*1 cup (240 mL) diced [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|feta cheese]]
*½ cup (120 mL) chopped green [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*2-3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] (7.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==
A medium-sized, round baking pan is recommended because it's more authentic, but any medium-sized baking pan will do.

Brush the baking pan with some of the oil, and start laying the pastry leaves inside. First, lay two leaves, sprinkle or brush with oil, then lay two more leaves, and repeat the procedure until half of the leaves are in place. Make sure that they cover the pan by hanging them about one inch over the edges of the pan.

Sprinkle spinach with salt, then mix well by hand. Add the feta cheese, oil, onions, eggs and salt, and spread this mixture over the already laid pastry leaves. Finish by covering the spinach with the rest of the pastry leaves, repeating the first-half procedure and then roll the hanging edges of the bottom leaves over the pie (think of a [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] crust), sprinkle top with oil and bake moderately at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|350°F (175°C)]] for about 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve hot, accompanied with [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]], or beaten [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]], thinned down in cold water or with chilled [[Cookbook:Stewed Prunes|stewed prunes]]. Sometimes a green [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]] adds to the meal!

Serves 4-6.

[[Image:ElectoralCollege1988-Large.png|420px|right|thumb|Electoral College 1988]]
Having been badly defeated in the 1984 presidential election, the Democrats were eager to find a new approach to win the presidency. They felt more optimistic this time due to the large gains in the 1986 mid-term election which resulted in the Democrats taking back control of the Senate after 6 years of Republican rule. Among the field of candidates were the following:

* [[w:Bruce E. Babbitt|Bruce E. Babbitt]], former governor of Arizona
* [[w:Joseph Biden Jr.|Joseph R. Biden Jr.]], U.S. senator from Delaware
* [[w:Michael Dukakis|Michael S. Dukakis]], governor of Massachusetts
* [[w:Dick Gephardt|Richard A. &quot;Dick&quot; Gephardt]], U.S. representative from Missouri
* [[w:Al Gore|Albert A. Gore Jr.]], U.S. senator from Tennessee
* [[w:Gary W. Hart|Gary W. Hart]], former U.S. senator from Colorado
* [[w:Rev. Jesse Jackson|Rev. Jesse L. Jackson]], civil rights activist
* [[w:Paul M. Simon|Paul M. Simon]], U.S. senator from Illinois
* [[w:Patricia Schroeder|Patricia Schroeder]], Senator from Colorado



[[Image:George H. W. Bush, President of the United States, official portrait.jpg|thumb|left|150px|George H. W. Bush]]

Reagan's Vice President, George Herbert Walker Bush, easily defeated Senator [[w:Bob Dole|Bob Dole]] of Kansas and televangelist [[w:Pat Robertson|Pat Robertson]] for the Republican presidential nomination.  Dole, at first, had a significant lead in polls.  Bush selected Senator [[w:Dan Quayle|James Danforth (Dan) Quayle]] of Indiana to be his running mate.  The Democrats, after an exhausting primary season, selected Governor [[w:Michael Dukakis|Michael Dukakis]] of Massachusetts as their nominee.  The 1988 election was the first time television was used as the primary method of voter mobilization.

During his acceptance speech for the Republican party nomination, Bush said, famously, &quot;[[w:Read my lips: no new taxes|Read my lips: no new taxes]].&quot;  Bush assailed his opponent for being soft on crime and insinuated that he lacked patriotism.  Specifically, he criticized his unconditional opposition to the death penalty, and his opposition to the proposed law that would require students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.  He also blamed Dukakis for the pollution in Boston harbor.  Dukakis lacked experience in national politics and failed to effectively counter Bush's assaults.

Bush won the election with 48.9 million votes (53.4%) against Dukakis's 41.8 million.  He carried 40 states and won in the Electoral College 426 votes to 112.

The campaign's harsh tone repelled voters. It was described as the nastiest election in modern times. Voter turnout was the lowest since 1924.

== Social Changes of the 1990s ==

The population continued to grow to over 250 million by 1990.  The total had nearly quadrupled in a century and was more than double the population during the first election of Franklin Roosevelt.  Medical advances brought the life expectancy to a record high.  The Hispanic population grew five times as fast as the rest of the population and began to emerge as a political force.

Left-over changes from the countercultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s were apparent.  &quot;Laid-back&quot; attitudes toward dress, language, and sexual freedom were among these left-over changes.  A new tolerance was especially prevalent in what had been historically the most sensitive of all problems for Americans - sex.  Ninety-five percent of males and over 80 percent of females between 18 and 24 acknowledged premarital intercourse.

Drugs remained popular as well.  While LSD fell out of fashion, marijuana remained popular.  &quot;Crack,&quot; a cheap and powerful derivative of cocaine, displaced heroin.

The rise of the Moral Majority continued - dismay over crimes, drugs, and drinking was widespread.  States raised the drinking age and cracked down on drunk driving.  The people revolted against cigarette smoking, and many states and communities began to ban smoking in public places.

The campaign against sexual promiscuity received unexpected support due to the discovery of AIDS.Most politicians were slow to devote resources to combating AIDS, in part because it was initially  perceived as a &quot;gay mans disease&quot; which did not threaten other Americans.

Generation X is the name given to people born between the 1960’s up to 1982.  The term was penned by author Douglas Coupland in 1991 when he released his era defining Generation X.  Coupland wrote of mid-twenty characters who were going through “quarter-life crisis.”  In the book Coupland discussed how his generation faced looming threats of nuclear war which made forming meaningful relationships meaningless.  He also discussed how major corporations such as McDonald’s provided a shared state of consumerism which formed a new zone of comfort.  By pointing out major social problems such as AIDS, depression, and sexuality Coupland helped define an entire generation.

== The World Changes ==

The universal oppression in Communist nations and the failure of Communist economies led to growing disenchantment with Communism.  Communist regimes began collapsing across the world.  Under Mikhail Gorbachev, head of the Communist Party and later President of the USSR, the Soviet Union began to crumble.  He was unable to prevent the secession of the Baltic states, and communist hard-liners led an unsuccessful coup that nonetheless demonstrated the loss of most of Gorbachev's stature. Boris Yeltsin, a leader in the resistance against the coup, later became president of the Russian Federation. The Soviet parliament soon adjourned forever, and Gorbachev resigned.  The world was at last free of the Cold War.

With the Soviet Union out of Central America and the neutralization of Castro due to the Union's demise, Bush was slowly able to advance American objectives in that region.

The decline of the Soviet Union also left the United States with increased influence in the Middle East.  Bush was eager to serve peace by persuading Israel to return the Arab lands it seized in 1967.  The Administration was also committed to sustaining the flow of inexpensive oil from the Persian Gulf.

===Desert Shield===

Under Saddam Hussein, Iraqi forces invaded and quickly gained control of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.  Bush immediately denounced the invasion as &quot;naked aggression&quot; and banned trade with Iraq, froze all Iraqi assets within the United States, and dispatched an aircraft-carrier group to the Persian Gulf.  The UN Security Council unanimously condemned the invasion and demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  On August 15, with the first American soldiers on their way to the Persian Gulf, Bush told Americans that Operation Desert Shield was under way to protect &quot;access to energy resources&quot; and thus &quot;our jobs, our way of life.&quot;  Most Americans supported the war.  American troops began to build up in Saudi Arabia.  On November 29 the Security Council authorized the use of &quot;all necessary means&quot; to expel Iraqi troops if they had not left Kuwait by January 15, 1991.  Bush was assailed by the media and Democrats for sending 400,000 troops to the Persian Gulf without consulting Congress, for making war seem unavoidable, and for creating crisis in order to draw attention from the faltering economy.

On January 12, 1991, in a largely partisan vote, both chambers - the House 250 to 183, the Senate 53 to 46 - authorized Bush &quot;to use United States armed forces&quot; pursuant to the UN Security Council resolution.

===Operation Desert Storm===

The U.S. and its coalition overwhelmed its enemy.  From the start, the coalition had total command of the air.  Within days, Iraqi communication systems, air bases, and antiaircraft defenses were obliterated by aircraft.  Americans were quickly attacking strategic targets - power plants, bridges, and chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons facilities.  From day eight, coalitions planes devastated the Iraqi army.  On the second day, Hussein fired Scud missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia, but none caused major damage.  In late January the Iraqi release of thousands of gallons of Kuwaiti oil into the Persian Gulf polluted the waters of that area.

[[Image:USAF_F-16A_F-15C_F-15E_Desert_Storm_pic.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Bombers fly over burning oil wells during Desert Storm]]
Bush warned Hussein that the coalition would force him out if he had not begun withdrawal by February 24.  Coalition forces placed Iraqi forces in a squeeze they could not escape.  After 100 hours of ground warfare, Kuwait had been liberated, and the Baghdad area was besieged.  The coalition had destroyed some 4,000 Iraqi tanks, more than 1,000 armored vehicles, and about 3,000 artillery pieces.  In comparison, the coalition had lost only 4 tanks, 9 other vehicles, and 1 cannon.  About 100,000 Iraqi troops were killed, and the coalition had suffered less than 200 deaths.

However, Saddam was still in control.  Soon after the cease-fire, the Iraqi army put down a Shiite rebellion and forced Kurds in Iraq to flee to Iran and Turkey.  United Nations inspections began.  The media did little to inform Americans about the destruction of the Iraqi infrastructure, the foundation of a modernizing society, or about the millions of people left without electricity, running water, or sewage.
Another concern was Hussein might also have wanted to invade Saudi Arabia.  This was a huge concern because of the rich oil in Saudi Arabia.  This would have given Hussein a huge and valuable resource for his army.  The collaboration with Saudi Arabia and the United States made Hussein very angry.  He thought it as cowardly.

===Back to Usual Politics===

Bush was closely aligned to Ronald Reagan in regard to social issues after his two terms as vice-president. As a Republican congressman from Texas, he was pro-choice, but when he ran for president, he opposed abortion, and he endorsed Supreme Court decisions weakening affirmative action in hiring and promotion.  He consistently tried to make appointments to federal courts of judges that shared his own views about the First Amendment, abortion, and affirmative action.  Bush named David Souter to replace Justice William Brennan on the Supreme Court, and he named Clarence Thomas to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall.

Bush called himself &quot;the education president&quot; and &quot;the environment president.&quot;  Bush called for a controversial program that would allow public money to follow children to public schools but it was not acted upon.  Bush appointed performed and committed conservationists to the Environmental Protection Agency.  At times he would take the side of business, and at other times he would take the side of ecologists.  In 1989 he signed a law to ease the effects of acid rain, mandating a gradual 50 percent reduction in sulfur emissions from power plants burning coal, and it also required the automobile industry to increase gradually the production of cars using fuels other than gasoline or diesel oil.  In 1991, Bush put forward an energy plan to open for exploration the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, some other Alaskan areas, and the continental shelf off the coasts of California and the Gulf of Mexico.

During 1989, economic growth in the United States slowed, and by the second half of 1990, most economists considered the economy in recession.  Bush again proposed, as he had in 1989, lowering the capital gains tax, but Congressional Democrats balked.  During talks, the White House backed down on capital gains and the two sides agreed on a budget package that included a steep increase in excise taxes, a small increase in Medicare charges, and a cut in Medicare spending.  However, members of both parties in Congress rejected the solution.  Finally, on October 29, 1991, the Congress at last approved an acceptable compromise.  It lifted the top surtax rate from 28 to 31 percent, gradually phased out income-tax exemptions for upper-income taxpayers, and raised the tax on gasoline, cigarettes, and beer.  It also imposed a luxury tax on expensive automobiles, boats, furs, and jewelry, and raised Medicare premiums.  The Democrats committed Congress for five years to reduce expenditures both for the military and domestically.  After the quick victory in the Persian Gulf, the administration anticipated a quick return of national growth, but the GNP did not pick up.  Unemployment reached a four year high.

== The Election of 1992 ==

As the election campaign of 1992 began, the incumbent President, George Bush, held a commanding lead in the polls, over any and all potential rivals. Bush had been the Commander- In -Chief presiding over the most decisive American military victory since World War II, the Gulf War. Most of the leading democratic candidates declined to run. After a long primary process Bill Clinton, the then governor of Arkansas, was selected as the Democratic candidate.

Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas became the apparent leader among the Democratic candidates for the 1992 election.  By late April, Clinton had a commanding lead and delegates and was running evenly with Bush in public opinion polls.  Rioting in central Los Angeles arose following the verdict of a suburban jury that found Los Angeles policemen not guilty of using undue force in beating a black motorist they had arrested.

From the time of the Democratic convention, Governor Clinton obtained a commanding lead in the polls over Bush. Bush's campaign was hobbled by troubled economy. The campaign revolved primarily around economic issues. The end of the cold war, which the Republicans took credit for, perversely worked against them. No longer could they use the issue of &quot;Do you trust the Democrats to stand up to the Russians&quot; against them. The third party candidacy of Ross Perot was a true wild card in the campaign. 

[[Image:ElectoralCollege1992-Large.png|thumb|400px]]
The polls showed extreme disenchantment with both candidates, and [[w:H. Ross Perot|H. Ross Perot]], a Texas billionaire, organized a run as a Reform Party nominee.  Perot appealed to conservatives by speaking out against taxes, deficits, and adultery, but he was pro-choice and had a tolerant attitude toward homosexuality.  He also appealed to traditionally Democratic voters by being an outspoken opponent of [[w:NAFTA|NAFTA]] (a free-trade agreement). He remained evasive about his economic and social agenda, and becoming uncomfortable with the probings of the media, he withdrew from the election, only to return in October.  Perot's entrance into the race reflected the impatience of the electorate with politics and their dissatisfaction with the major parties. Perot was also able to gain such a level of support because he was allowed to participate in all three Presidential debates. Incumbents at every level were worried, and an unprecedented number of members of Congress chose not to seek reelection.  Bush and Quayle stressed &quot;family values.&quot;  Bush called for across-the-board tax cuts, and public opinion polls revealed the closeness of the race.

The Clinton camp began to use the famous slogan &quot;It's the economy, stupid!&quot; and he was successful in presenting his theme of change.  Clinton won an overwhelming majority in the Electoral College (370 to 168) but received only 43 percent of the popular vote.

== William Jefferson Clinton ==

[[image:Bill_Clinton.jpg|right|thumb|200px|William Jefferson Clinton]]
President of the United States of America. William Jefferson Clinton was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas, a small town with a population of about 8,000. His father, William Jefferson Blythe, died in a car crash several months before Clinton was born, leaving him in the care of his mother, Virginia Cassidy Blythe. In order to provide for her son, Virginia moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, to complete two years of nursing school, while Clinton stayed with his grandparents, Eldridge and Edith Cassidy. Clinton's grandparents were strict disciplinarians who instilled in him the importance of a good education. &quot;My grandparents had a lot to do with my early commitment to learning,&quot; he later recalled. &quot;They taught me to count and read. I was reading little books when I was three.&quot;


[[w:William Jefferson Clinton|William Jefferson Clinton]] became the 42nd President of the United States in 1992, signaling a generational change. He was the first Democrat in over 50 years to win a second term and presided over the longest peace time economic expansion in history. He was an activist, progressive president (of a breed of politicians which he called the &quot;New Democrats&quot;) who stayed constantly surrounded by controversy. 

Bill Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe in Hope, Arkansas and was raised in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1950, Clinton's mother remarried to Roger Clinton, Clinton's natural father having been killed in an automobile accident, three months before his son's birth. Roger Clinton was an alcoholic gambler who would beat his wife and Clinton's half-brother also named Roger.

===Clinton's Domestic Agenda===

Clinton had a very progressive agenda, which included ending the recession of the early 90s, health care reforms, and domestic reforms. Clinton, working with the Republican Congress, helped narrow the deficit by cutting spending and increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans. On the issue of health care, Clinton wanted to stop the rising costs of health care and provide the estimated 39 million uninsured Americans with health insurance. He created a task force, headed by his wife, [[w:Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]], to deal with the problem, but critics attacked the plan. They worried that the plan was too expensive and too complicated. Congress would never vote on Clinton's plan, and his health care effort would die.

Clinton was able to succeed in other efforts, though. Despite opposition, Clinton was able to pass the [[w:Brady Bill|Brady Bill]] (named after [[w:James Brady|James Brady]], who was crippled after being shot in the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt), which created a mandatory waiting period in which gun vendors could check a buyer's criminal background before a buyer could recieve his gun. A 1994 crime bill complemented the bill by banning 19 kinds of assault weapons and creating 100,000 new police jobs.

Clinton was also able to push Congress to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), despite strong opposition from labor unions (which, ironically, are the strongest source of Democrat support). The agreement would provide lower costs for consumers in many markets, due to increased trading with Mexico and Canada.
====The Third Way====
Clinton is a supporter of the Third Way, or Radical center, a centrist political philosophy of governance that embraces a mix of market and interventionist philosophies. The Third Way rejects both socialism and laissez-faire approaches to economic governance, but chiefly stresses technological development, education, and competitive mechanisms to pursue economic progress and governmental objectives. Third way philosophies have been described as a synthesis of capitalism and socialism by its proponents.

In the United States, Third Way adherents emphasize fiscal conservatism, some replacement of welfare with workfare, and a stronger preference for market solutions to traditional problems (as in pollution markets), while rejecting pure laissez-faire economics and other libertarian positions. The Third Way style of governing was firmly adopted and partly redefined during the Administration of President Bill Clinton.

After Tony Blair came to power in the UK, Clinton, Blair and other leading Third Way adherents organized conferences to promote the Third Way in 1997 at Chequers in England. The Democratic Leadership Council are adherents of Third Way politics.

In 2004, several veteran U.S. Democrats founded a new Washington, DC organization entitled Third Way, which bills itself as a &quot;strategy center for progressives.&quot; John Kerry of 2004 U.S. Democrats Presidential candidate is also considered to be third way politician, as are 2008 U.S. Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

===Keeping Peace===

During the Clinton administration, keeping peace in other parts of the world was a priority. When the President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was overthrown by violent dictators, Clinton sent troops to Haiti to pressure the new dictators to step down and to help slow the tidal wave of Hatian refugees fleeing to Florida. They did step down, and Aristide's power was restored.

Another challenge to peace was a bloody civil war that had erupted in Yugoslavia, part of the Balkan peninsula in Europe. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, and Croatia all declared independence from Yugoslavia, but many Serbs (from Serbia, a part of Yugoslavia) still lived in those areas, and Yugoslavia fought to hold onto parts of Bosnia and Croatia. As America became aware of the atrocities of the war, Clinton arranged peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, and the Serbs, the Croats, and the Bosnians signed a peace agreement in December 1995. Eventually, another conflict would arise in the region during Clinton's second term.

===1994 Midterm Elections===

During the 1994 midterm Congressional elections, Republicans presented a plan called the &quot;Contract with America.&quot;  The contract detailed the actions Republicans would take upon becoming the majority party in Congress.  This charge was led by Newt Gingrich.  The GOP plan was a success, winning the Republicans a majority in the House for the first time in 40 years, and a Republican majority in the Senate.  The massive success became known as the Republican Revolution.

In retrospect, the Republicans' dramatically large gains can be attributed to many things. A larger than average number of incumbents retired, and thus there was a larger number of open seat races, which are far easier to switch parties. Additionally, the previously Democratic-controlled House had been plagued by a [[w:House banking scandal|scandal]] since before the 1992 election. The scandal implicated far more Democrats than Republicans and can in part be blamed for the large number of open seats. Historians and political scientists also point to President Clinton's resounding failure to pass his [[w:Clinton health care plan|universal healthcare plan]] in a Democratic-controlled congress. The plan had been a large part of his 1992 campaign and was to be the cornerstone of his first-term agenda. The defeat likely demoralized Democratic voters, who ended up turning out in low numbers.

===1996 Election===

Clinton easily won Democratic renomination in 1996. His opponent was Kansas senator Bob Dole, who had served in Congress since 1961. Dole claimed that he could lower taxes by 15 percent and that Clinton was an unethical president. Clinton said that Dole would ruin the environment and reverse the progress that Clinton had made with medicare. Ross Perot ran again, and relying on infomercials, also claimed that Clinton was unethical. 

Despite it all, Clinton won the election in a landslide, while Perot received a much smaller amount of votes than he did in the 1992 election. Even though the Democratic campaign for the presidency was successful, they didn't fare well in the congressional elections. Republicans gained 2 seats in the Senate, giving them a 55-45 majority. Even though Democrats gained 11 seats in the House, Republicans still held a 226-207 majority. Independents held two seats. Republicans had total control of Congress.

===Conflict in Kosovo===

After 1995, it seemed that things would stay relatively quiet in the Balkans. But a series of events would lead to rampant political instability within Yugoslavia and eventually a civil war. Kosovo, a province of Serbia (which was a part of Yugoslavia) was home to a large number of Albanians (from the neighboring Albania), who were actually the ethnic majority in the area. In the late eighties and early nineties, the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic passed laws that eliminated Kosovo's constitutional rights and opressed Albanians. In 1991, Kosovo voted to break away from Yugoslavia. Although Yugoslavia claimed that the vote was illegal, things in the area stayed relatively quiet until April 1996, when a mysterious organization known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) began attacking Serbian civilians.

Eventually, the attacks on civilians caused hundreds of thousands of people to flee Kosovo. Serbians viewed the KLA as a group of terrorists, and retaliated. As the violence became bloodier and bloodier, more and more refugees began to flee into Macedonia, and tensions between the refugee Albanians and the native Macedonian Slavs grew, and a possible civil war loomed. A civil war in Macedonia would have been catastrophic to the already damaged stability and security of the area, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization concluded that intervention was needed.

A coalition of NATO members, headed by the United States, began a bombing campaign on March 24, 1999. The goal of the campaign was to force the Serbs to leave Kosovo so that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. Initially, the bombing caused a mass Albanian exodus from Kosovo, with the U.N. reporting that over 850,000 Albanians had fled from Kosovo to Albania or Macedonia. Milosevic would not step down until June, when Finnish and Russian negotiators convinced him that NATO was serious in its goal and that Russia (a long time protector of Slavic people) would not step in to protect Yugoslavia. On June 10, the bombings ended, and an occupation of the area by U.N. and NATO peacekeeping troops began. Kosovo lay in ruins and hundreds of thousands of people were displaced.

===Oklahoma City Bombing===

At 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, a truck bomb exploded near the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, pulverizing nearly the entire north face of the 9-story building into dust and rubble. It took weeks of sorting through debris to find the victims. 168 people were killed, including 19 children, as the building housed a day-care center. This was the deadliest act of terrorism on US soil until September 11, 2001. 

Although militant groups based in the Middle East were initially seen as the likely perpetrators, a native-born white American named Timothy McVeigh was soon arrested and charged with the crime. McVeigh, a veteran of the Persian Gulf War, would subsequently be put on trial and sentenced to death. Also implicated in the crime was McVeigh's army friend Terry Nichols, who was convicted in a separate trial and sentenced to life in prison. The attack was said to be motivated in part by the siege in Waco, Texas, which culminated in a fire which killed 80 Branch Davidians on April 19, 1993. This was said to be McVeigh's reason for attacking on April 19. 

In September 1994, McVeigh purchased large amounts of fertilizer (ammonium nitrate) and then stored it in a rented shed in Herington, Kansas. The ammonium nitrate was the main ingredient for the bomb. McVeigh and Nichols reportedly stole other supplies needed to complete the bomb from a quarry in Marion, Kansas.

On April 17, 1995, McVeigh reportedly rented a Ryder truck, and on the following day he and Nichols reportedly loaded the Ryder truck with approximately 5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. McVeigh related to biographers that on the morning of April 19th, he drove the Ryder truck to the Murrah Federal Building, lit the bomb's fuse, parked in front of the building, left the keys inside the truck and locked the door, then walked across the parking lot to an alley, and started to jog.

McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. In a direct quote McVeigh stated that he was &quot;sorry&quot; people died - but added, &quot;That's the nature of the beast.&quot;

Questions persist regarding the full extent of the conspiracy to bomb the Murrah building. Although McVeigh and Nichols were the only ones ever charged with the attack, and Nichols was by all accounts at home in Kansas at the time of the actual blast, several witnesses reported seeing McVeigh in the company of at least one other person on the morning of the bombing. A &quot;John Doe&quot; was reportedly seen exiting the Ryder truck after it was parked next to the building. As well, Nichols was known to have traveled to the Philippines on at least five occasions, and was reported by one witness to have met there with international terrorist [[wikipedia:Ramzi Yousef|Ramzi Yousef]], who was himself later arrested and convicted of masterminding the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City. More generally, those who argue for a wider conspiracy question whether McVeigh and Nichols working by themselves had the ability to produce such a large and powerful explosive device.

===Columbine High School Massacre===

On April 20, 1999, Colorado's Columbine High School was the site of a deadly rampage by two students, who killed twelve classmates, a teacher, and themselves; approximately twenty-three others were injured. The assailants were eighteen-year-old Eric Harris and seventeen-year-old Dylan Klebold, who had reportedly planned the attack for a year with hopes of killing hundreds. In addition to firearms, Klebold and Harris brought many explosive devices to the scene, including two propane bombs meant to detonate in the cafeteria during the lunch period. Though there were minor explosions, all fifteen deaths resulted from gunshots. The killers left behind videos in which they discussed their deadly plans and target practiced with old bowling pins. This massacre raised a lot of concern over youth violence and access to guns.

==The Monica Lewinsky Scandal==
The Monica Lewinsky Scandal was a scandal involving President Bill Clinton and a young White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Bill Clinton had a relationship that was sexual in nature with the intern and lied about it in court. The catalyst of the scandal were the tape recordings of Linda Tripp and Lewinsky discussing Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton, conversations recorded by Tripp.
Monica Lewinsky was a young twenty two year old who interned at the White House only about two years later her and President Clinton were accused of having an affair. After the news got out President Clinton had a televised speech and stated &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman.&quot; This caused a huge controversy and many people began to make political jokes using Clinton's bold statement.

Initially, the Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was investigating President and Mrs. Clinton's role in the Whitewater scandal, which led to the investigation of the Lewinsky affair after Attorney-General Janet Reno granted Starr authority to probe the affair. The incident that led to the advancement of the scandal was the procurement of the tapes of Linda Tripp and Lewinsky discussing her relationship with Clinton, by Starr from Tripp. There doesn't appear to be any evidence that Starr sought the tapes out or knew of their existence, rather it was perhaps Linda Tripp who handed them over freely to Starr.

On February 12, 1999, the US Senate voted on the Articles of Impeachment requiring a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, to convict. On Article 1, which charged that the President willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury&quot; in relation to the Paula Jones lawsuit, 45 Senators voted for guilty and removal from Office, and 55 for not-guilty and no removal from Office. On Article II, which charged that the President &quot;prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice&quot;, 50 Senators voted for guilty and 50 for not-guilty.
In his testimony, Clinton denied having had an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, an unpaid intern and later a paid staffer at the White House, in 1995–96. Lewinsky had earlier, in a deposition in the same case, also denied having such a relationship. Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater case, had previously received tape recordings made by Linda R. Tripp (a former coworker of Lewinsky's) of telephone conversations in which Lewinsky described her involvement with the president. Asserting that there was a “pattern of deception,” Starr obtained from Attorney General Janet Reno permission to investigate the matter.

The president publicly denied having had a relationship with Lewinsky and charges of covering it up. His adviser Vernon Jordan denied having counseled Lewinsky to lie in the Jones case, or having arranged a job for her outside Washington, to help cover up the affair. Hillary Clinton claimed that a “vast right-wing conspiracy” was trying to destroy her husband, while Republicans and conservatives portrayed him as immoral and a liar.


Despite the scandal many still hold firm that Clinton’s presidency was a success.  He was the first president since the depression to have consecutive quarters without a deficit.  His two terms were a success for the economy after George H.W. Bush’s tenure.  Clinton also kept us out of any major wars.  Kosovo was one of the only acts of battle that happened during the Clinton administration.

==Rodney King== 

As police cracked down on gangs and Crack Cocaine users, tensions began to mount between police and urban communities.  On April 29, 1992, the tensions reached their tipping point.  A year earlier, Los Angeles resident Rodney King was pulled over and beaten by Los Angeles police.  King, who had a history of drug and alcohol problems, initially led the police on a high speed chase going over 110 mph.  When the chase finally came to an end, King attempted to flee from officers.  Four white male officers pursued and brought down King.  But instead of simply apprehending and cuffing King the four officers proceeded to kick and use batons to beat King within an edge of his life.
	
To many urban Americans the police brutality did not seem unfamiliar, with countless others facing similar treatment.  The reason Rodney King’s story was different was because a bystander, George Holliday, captured the assault on video.  After news networks got hold of the video millions of Americans demanded for the officers to be jailed.  When the officers finally were charged and faced trial the entire nation watched on.  Then, on April 29, 1992, all four officers were acquitted of all charges.  Urban Americans and the African Americans of Los Angeles were enraged.
	
Within hours of the verdict fires were started, homes and stores were looted, and people began being attacked all across Los Angeles.  The riots were filmed by news networks and broadcast nationwide.  No matter how many police squads were released the rioting raged on.  The riots lasted for nearly a week as blacks expressed their angst over a continued oppression in America, an inequality between race, and an unwillingness by society to recognize and act on urban problems.  Over the week long riots 53 people were killed and over a billion dollars in damages was caused.

An [[wikipedia:atom|atom]] is the smallest unit of matter that has the properties of an element. It is composed of a dense core called the [[wikipedia:Atomic_nucleus|nucleus]] and a series of [[wikipedia:Electron_shell|outer shell]]s occupied by orbiting [[wikipedia:electron|electron]]s.

The nucleus, composed of [[wikipedia:proton|proton]]s and [[wikipedia:neutron|neutron]]s, is at the center of an atom.  Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons are neutral.  The [[wikipedia:atomic_number|atomic number]] of an atom is dictated by the number of protons, which in turn, determines the chemical element of the atom.  The isotope of the element is determined by the number of neutrons.

The electron has an electric charge equal but opposite the proton (that is, they cancel). A stable atom has the same number of electrons orbiting as it does protons in the nucleus; this makes the atom electrically neutral. Atoms that are missing an electron (that is, have one more proton than electrons) will tend to attract additional electrons, while atoms that have an excess electron (one more electron than protons) will tend to eject the outer-most electron. The shell containing the outer-most electron is called the [[wikipedia:Electron_shell#Valence_shell|valence shell]], and is the chemically active shell.

In size the entire atom has been thought to be approximately four-billionths of an inch, meaning that approximately 250,000,000 atoms of this size must be put into line to span 1 inch. Atoms are not usually alone, but instead come in groups called molecules.

==Molecules==
A molecule is a single unit created by two or more atoms that are tightly bonded together. Diatomic molecules are molecules which are made of two atoms. Certain elements are diatomic elements because they do not naturally occur as single atoms, but as a pair of atoms. The diatomic molecules are (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Hydrogen, (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Nitrogen, (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Oxygen, (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Fluorine, (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Chlorine, (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Iodine and (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Bromine. Earth's atmosphere is comprised, almost completely, of diatomic oxygen and nitrogen.  Molecules that are found with only one type of element in them, like the diatomic elements, are known as homoatomic molecules. When a molecule is formed from elements of a different species it is a heteroatomic molecule. As an atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains the properties of that element, a molecule is the smallest particle of a compound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is physics? Why study physics? Physics, before everything else, is an ''experimental'' science, as are many branches of natural and physical sciences. When physicists study a phenomenon, they first observe a pattern in nature, develop a hypothesis how the pattern occurs, and test the hypothesis ''by experiment''. Thus ''experiment is the sole judge of all scientific truth''. This is in contrast to how mathematics or some branches of philosophy works, where one starts out with axioms, or self-evident truths, and proceed by means of logics.

For example, after observing the motion of falling objects, Galileo Galilei hypothesized that the time it takes for an object to fall is independent of its weight. Then he tested his hypothesis, according to legend, by dropping two equal-sized, equal-shaped objects, one made of metal and the other of wood, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Also, after observing the motion of a hanging lamp, how, as it moved back and forth, the time it took to complete one oscillation was constant, he made an hypothesis that a period, the time taken for one oscillation, of a pendulum is independent of the amplitude, how large the swing is, and he also tested this hypothesis by measuring the period with pendulums swinging with different amplitudes, everything else being equal.{{fact|article}} In fact, his invention hinging on this hypothesis is the now well-known grandfather clock.

Note that the observation or the testing of the hypothesis required an accurate measure of time and distance. We will soon come back to this topic in Part 0. 

Then, since this is how all science works, how is physics different from other sciences? One thing that separates physics is that the consistent goal of physics is to discover the fundamental laws governing our universe. Instead of simply stating, &quot;The time it takes an object to fall is independent of its weight,&quot; a physicist looks for a deeper underlying pattern that explains this observation and other similar occurences in nature as well (and in this case, that underlying pattern is Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation). For this reason, some describe physics as &quot;reverse engineering the universe.&quot; 

This is what separates physics from other sciences, and what makes it necessary for all scientists and engineers, not just the students planning on pursuing a career in physics, to learn physics.

== Chinese textbook ==
Nice to see your work at [[Chinese Lesson 1]]! I am working on that too. i think we need cooperation. first of all, i don't want a simplified and traditional mix-up Chinese textbook: that's too confusing for learners! they should exist separately respectively, what do you think? we can talk more about the overall plan in details later! :) --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 08:44, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Thanks for your response! I though you are a Chinese at first! so don't worry about your final, you will do it will! ;) my aim is to make this textbook best among the language books here, easy to understand, and funny to learn. we need to figure out some way as how will it be easy for a basic? a middle level learner and a high level learner? i am not majoring in Chinese, so i will just do the basic level. do you have any ideas as what is needed to be taught at that level? Here is my little plan:
# we can organize every 3-4 lessons into a &quot;Unit&quot;, talking about one topic;
# make this book systemically, which means the characters in the book should be consistent; (like Wang Ming is a student in the first lesson, and he will not be a police in the next lesson :) )

okay, the units:
#Unit 1: simple statement sentences, like &quot;what's this/that?&quot;, &quot;this/that is...&quot;, &quot;i/you/she/he am/are/is ...&quot;
#Unit 2: introduce yourself. like &quot;i am a student, i am studying in Peking University&quot;, &quot;i am 20&quot;, &quot;there are 3 persons in my family&quot;
#Unit 3: numbers and mesure words, time and date.
...

tell me what you think of that draft. --Yacht

:okay, i just joined the group, so that we can plan our textbook in details later. i know how exhausted it would be by a large vocabulary learning a foreign language, that's what i am facing when learning my English. you may take a look at [[Chinese Lesson 7]], which i follow the pattern of my Japanese textbook. there are some &quot;Additional Vocabulary&quot; (marked by *) and new words (marked by **). I guess from the 2nd text on, we can add a &quot;review&quot; at the first first beginning. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 18:51, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Hi Everlong,

Thanks for the extensive work you've done on the Chinese Wikibooks. One quick thing though: instead of using:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ăĕĭŏŭ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Can you use instead:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ǎěǐǒǔ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Thanks. ;) -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 03:46, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Merging ==

I guess we can merge the lesson 1 and the lesson 8 now. and move the lesson 2-lesson 6 to somewhere else. tough grammar at the very first beginning would only bore people IMO. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 04:12, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Move lesson 3 to lesson 6 to [[Chinese Grammar]]? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 15:03, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Pinyin table ==

Hi Everlong, I just saw you made an initial-final combination table some time ago for the Chinese wikibook on [[Chinese/Pinyin Pronunciation]]. Coincidentally, I made the same on the english Wikipedia only a few days ago, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_table . There are some small differences between both tables, especially regarding wether to combine the intials and finals on a logical letter base (''q + u = qu'', for example )or rather on phonetic base (''q + ü = qu''). It would be great to come up with a merge of our two tables.

Bye, Abdull ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Abdull )

==PDF==

The PDF is an excellent job. I have never looked at the book because it demands all sorts of downloads but the PDF just gives it to us straight. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:04, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
:Thanks for the compliment. It's good to know that the PDF makes the book more accessible. Not as big as some of the other Wikibooks, but the structure and detail make it among the best in Wikibooks in my opinion.

== Fighting vandalism ==

I see you reported vandalism, thanks for that. Have you seen [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#Requests for CheckUser rights]]? CheckUser rights will allow some admins to check IP of vandals using registered accounts. Can you take a look at the vote? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:29, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

== Chinese audio ==

I've created an account here and I've recorded most of the vocabulary and some of the dialogue, but I haven't uploaded anything yet. When I was recording the second dialouge, I hesitated, since I'm a tad skeptical about the choice of &quot;Amy&quot; for the name of the Chinese person. It would seem a lot more appropriate to choose a commonly used native Chinese name, and not just a Chinese version of an English name. Any thoughts on that one?

Also, I'm not quite sure how to name the dialouge files or whether I should make just one file of the entire dialogue or just one file for each line.

[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:19, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

:Peter, thanks for starting on the recording. This will make the book much more accessible to people without a teacher or those unwilling to slog through the pronunciation lessons before jumping into Lesson 1.

:About 艾美's name, you have a point. I just wanted to pick something relatively easy to write (which it is, since 美国 is also taught in the lesson) and that looked the same in simplified and traditional if possible. You can swap in another name if you like before recording.

:With the file naming, I'd say for the vocabulary, use the pinyin with tone numbers (i.e. Zh-che1.ogg). That way homonyms of the word could use the same file, which would be awkward if you named them using the characters. For the dialogues, they're pretty stable, so I think having the two parts recorded in just two files would be best. Users can always slide back a few seconds in their audio player to rehear a line. In naming them, just make it descriptive, possibly in Chinese because the Chinese of our lessons has been reused in [http://pl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chiński:_Podstawy:_Lekcja_1#Słownictwo translated] [http://it.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cinese:_Lezione_1#Vocabolario versions] of the English book (i.e. Zh-中文_第一课_你好！_1.ogg). For the example sentences in the grammar section, I'd say one file per example would be more appropriate, because those are more likely to be switched around or added to. With those I would just name them using the whole sentence in characters so that people know what it means, as homonyms would be unlikely (i.e. Zh-我不是美国人.ogg).
::-[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 22:16, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, the formula at Commons for individual words is pinyin followed by the number of the tone. If anything, it should be easy to recycle sound files after we have enough of them. Like the multitude of various &quot;shi&quot;-words.
::I know there's been trouble in the past with downloading sound files even with really simply non-English characters like &quot;åäö&quot;, so I'm worried that this will spell even more trouble for file names with Chinese characters. And I know the HTML-rendition of those characters tend to be horribly complicated. Isn't it better to just call them &quot;Zh-Lesson_1_dialogue_1.ogg&quot; or something like it? Yes, it's English, but it does seem like a reasonable compromise even for the other wikiprojects.
::[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:02, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

:::OK, I see what you mean with the name corruption. When I try to save a file with Chinese characters in the name they all are replaced by underscores. As long as we put the Chinese and any other translations on the file page, it should be fine to leave the filename in English.

== Thank you for fighting vandalism ==

I really appreciate your efforts to help combat vandalism on this project.  Neither myself nor all of the rest of the administrators can really keep track of all of Wikibooks, and any help to stop this rampant behavior is appreciated.  In this case, there is some idiot who is trying to spamlink, but is discovering that it is harder now than it was in the past.  And a perception that Wikibooks is a backwater project with nobody paying attention.

I would be cautious however.... you might just end up becoming an administrator here if you keep this behavior of yours up.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Art]] ==
Maybe the [[art]] book would be better named as [[Introduction to Art]] and [[art]] redirected to the bookshelf? If you don't think that's a good idea, ignore this w/o a response. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 21:35, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:Good idea. I hadn't even thought about bookshelves when I started the naming cleanup. With something as general as &quot;Art&quot; a bookshelf is probably best.  --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 21:39, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== Embassy Page ==

I've been planning some major work on the [[Russian]] wikibook, and was planning on asking some people from the russian wikibooks for some help, and came across the idea of a wikibooks embassy. Apparently, I wasn't the first person with this idea, and you have listed yourself as ambassador on the meta page. I went ahead and made the module [[English Embassy]], which is basically a rough copy of wikipedia's embassy, but was planning on really opening some communication with wikibooks in other languages. I really only speak russian and spanish, though, so maybe you could help me out with this? I was thinking the first good thing to do would be to make a list of en.wikibooks users who can communicate with other wikibookians in their native tongue. Let me know what you think, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 14:56, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

== Positive Psychology ==

I noticed you were working on a new psychology test. Interested in help yet? (I'm working on one myself, although just a tad less positive.) --[[User:Elaragirl|Elaragirl]] 19:44, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

*snorts* 我无法教我们的语言. I am ... rusty. Worse than rusty. But still, the Chinese book seems to be coming along nicely on it's own. As for positive psychology, I'm a mental health professional and I have some pretty good access to psychological libraries. I think positive psychology is overlooked, since (don't laugh) people actually prefer to feel miserable than happy so that they have something to complain about. Or maybe I'm getting cynical. :) Still, I'll see what I can come up with for you. --[[User:Elaragirl|Elaragirl]] 14:47, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for picking that up.  I've checked the IP and it is black listed in places so I've blocked it for a while - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

Just wanted to say thanks for working on the book.  I'm shamelessly using it to get ahead before I take up Chinese this next year.  I was wondering how close Lesson 2 was to being finished too.  I was hoping eventually I could contribute, I was thinking in the vocab section, to give characters separate pages where you detail stroke order, former incarnations of the character, and maybe a brief history.  I know Japanese, so I have some of this information on hand (at least for the more obvious characters).  Anyway, keep up the great work! --[[User:Hygiene|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Hygiene&lt;/font&gt;]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Yacht. Thanks for the welcome. It would be great to collaborate on this. I've had a ton of ideas about what could be done with this, but I'd like to be able to bounce around ideas with the rest of the crew. I've been really impressed with the level of organization at the [[Japanese]] Wikibook. Although their lessons aren't too developed, they at least figured out how to talk to each other and plan together. 

I've been trying to emulate that, so I copied their idea for a [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/chinese_wiki Mailinglist]. So far no signups though. It would be good to have a centralized place for discussion rather than have it scattered among the various modules' discussion pages (so join!). We need a good debate over stuff like the splash page and Traditional vs Simplified.

Personally, I agree with you that having both in an intoductory text is confusing. I suggested to have parallel development of two texts with a crosslink for every page. For now I've started with both, but in separate columns in the dialogues and only showing the traditional in the vocab when different. I wouldn't want traditional beyond that b/c it would just get cluttered having it for the examples and everything else too.

I'm only a second-year student of Chinese, but I have some grand ideas for this Wikibook. Of course, the time I did any real work on it was only when I should have been studying for my Chinese final (in two days:&lt;). But then, Winter Break, so I should have a good month of time to put into working on it. Hope to talk later. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 09:35, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Yacht, I'm flattered that you could have thought that I was a native Chinese, though I think if you heard my pronunciation the illusion would not last very long :). 

:I've used two introductory Chinese textbooks and looked at a couple more, so I have a little perspective as to what is good, especially for a native English speaker. What really made the best ones were clear grammar explanations and lots of examples. If we follow up all the lessons with a page or two of phrases/sentences using the words of the lesson it will clear up a lot of questions. 

:I wouldn't worry about intermediate or advanced students just yet. If it's too easy for them they can always skip ahead. What we need to do now is plan out the base and build up from there. I've been looking at the order in which my textbooks tackled different sentence patterns and been trying to draw up the first few lesson plans. I made something like your Unit lesson plan, but only for lessons 1 &amp; 2 over at our [[Chinese:_Level_I_Planning#Lesson_Roadmap|planning page]]. It basically has your Units, but instead of 1-2-3, in the order 1-3-2.

:About your points:
:#I think your Unit grouping is a good idea. Every few lessons there should be a recap of what was covered with extra examples and problems. This is especially good if the text is used for a real class with midterms as it gives review for the big test.
:#I also think that consistant characters (Aimei, Ouwen, etc) are important. One book I used made no attempt at this and it was very confusing meeting new actors every lesson.
:#New point. I think that even more than character constancy is a smooth buildup from stuff learned before. In an Introductory course, any student is going to be overwhelmed with the number of characters and such. It makes no sense to barrage them with even more words they haven't learned yet. Maybe by Intermediate when they want to build up their vocabularies, but not to start. Any words or grammar structures that show up in our lessons should be taught when they first show up. That means we have to be creative during the first few lessons to not overstep, but I feel it will make things much simpler for any students using this book.

:::About your Yahoo! login problem, I hadn't considered that there might be blocked-website problems. You at least got the emailed messages, right? You could just use it by mailing in your responses and without the website at all.

:::I had also been considering using Google Groups as they have a cooler interface and no banner ads, but in the end I settled on Yahoo Groups. Although Google has a lot more potential, as of now they don't support features like filesharing, polls, or chat like Yahoo! does, which we might need. Also I figured more people would already have a Yahoo! account, so it would be easier for them to join.

Hey, I'm not sure if this is the proper way to send a message, tell me if it's not.  Re: your message to me - I actually started by just reading through the Chinese book and touching it up as I saw fit.   But it looks like it could really use a lot of work, so I was considering at least contributing some grammar notes to Lesson 2 and maybe a second dialog.  --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 20:00, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Hey Yacht, I'm not sure I understand your latest message to me, especially the last sentence.  Are you saying that you don't want to have both traditional and simplified in one book and would rather have separate ones for each?  If so, then I think that's a bad idea.  If you learn to write only simplified, you should at least be able to read traditional, and having them separated out would impede this.  Additionally, the book is definitely not only about learning characters, but also grammar and spoken Chinese.  If you separated the two writing systems into two books you would have a ton of duplicated information about grammar and such, since the characters would be the only place where the content differs.  --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 19:30, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:A couple of responses to your message.

:I am a native English speaker (which I think is the intended audience of the book) who learned/is learning Chinese at an American university.  The way that my school does things is to mix traditional and simplified characters.  We are required to choose one system to write with, and have to master the writing of that system.  However, we are required to be able to read both systems.  This has been wonderful for me - I can hand write simplified characters decently, and type them very well.  But because I can read traditional, I am even able to type traditional Chinese pretty well using Pinyin input since I can recognize the characters.  The way I achieved this proficiency in both systems was by being taught with materials that had both systems interspersed.  We had two versions of our reading materials, and I always chose the traditional version to read since I was already learning simplified characters by writing them.  More importantly, on our tests half of the questions were in tradition and half in simplified, and we had to do all of them.  This mixing made me able to read both systems, which has been a great thing for me.  And it wasn't even very hard to do, because the way things were mixed in the learning materials made it very natural to pick up both systems.

:If we make the point of telling readers that they should choose one system to write and only write with that system while attempting to read both and moreover make our materials emulate the style of education that I just described, our readers can have the same experience of easily picking up both systems as I did.  And since the reader is only writing with one system, it would be impossible for him to make a mixup like the one that you described: why would he write 書 instead of 书 if he didn't know how to write 書 in the first place?

:You say that learning both systems is not required, since a learner would be studying exclusively either for mainland China or for Taiwan.  But what about someone like me, who is looking to interact with Chinese speakers in America?  Depending on what region of America you are talking about, you will find groups of people who use traditional and groups of people who use simplified.  I have friends from both groups.

:Moreover you say that the Chinese themselves don't like having the two mixed systems and cite the Chinese Wikipedia as an example.  This is an interesting point, but I don't think it applies here.  The people who frequent the Chinese Wikipedia and those who are arguing about the issue are presumably native speakers who have been raised with one system or the other.  To them, one is familiar and the other is foreign and maybe even ugly.  To go further, there is some political charge to the issue, with Taiwan using traditional and much of the mainland using simplified.  None of these issues exist for a beginning learner who knows nothing of Chinese characters.  This beginning learner would be better off to learn to read both systems now, while both are still equally fresh and foreign to him.  I said that learning to read both systems was no extra challenge for me, and that is precisely because I was not yet used to one or the other. --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 21:55, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::Since you asked me about my major, let me just give you my background real quick (would you do the same?). I'm a Math major, not a Chinese major.  My girlfriend's family is from Taiwan, so I got into Chinese in order to be able to speak with her grandparents and was originally planning on just taking the first four lower division courses.  However, I enjoyed Chinese and some Linguistics classes I was taking so much that I switched to being a double Math and Linguistics major with a minor in Chinese. So I'm not a completely hard-core Chinese student, but I do enjoy it quite a bit. I'm not aware that my school (the University of Texas at Austin) has such a requirement of Chinese majors, but if they do it does not apply to me as a minor.

::As for the rest of your post, I truly believe that you ''are'' worrying a bit too much. You do, however, have a point in saying that the two character sets might be overwhelming to the average beginner and that they need to be warned.  But I think that if we add to the beginning of the book a thorough explanation of the situation surrounding the two character sets as well as the advice I presented before of choosing only one set to write then the reader will be fine.  We can definitely also say that if the reader is interested in only one of mainland China or Taiwan then he can ignore the irrelevant character set to simplify things.

::The situation in America is that there are tight groups of Chinese speakers in many different regions.  Each one of these groups seems to mostly be composed of either speakers from China or speakers from Taiwan, without too much mixing.  So in one place traditional characters are dominant while in another simplified characters are.  Additionally, printed materials and TV/movie subtitles are just as likely to be printed in simplified as in traditional, depending on where they come from.  Overall, I think it is useful for an American to be able to read both sets, even if they only write one.  And again I'll stress, ''if the educational materials are well-designed, I don't think it represents a significant extra amount of work for a beginner to learn to read both systems when compared to only one''.

::As for your examples, it was made very clear to me that the mapping is not 1-1 (another good example is 只), and I feel that it's not a big issue if our aforementioned introduction to the two systems also makes this clear as a pitfall.  Your example of 電腦 versus 计算机 is interesting as well, but that actually has little to do with character sets; rather it's a question of dialects.  That can be dealt with by presenting both words, and designating one as Taiwanese usage and the other as mainland usage.

::Finally, you say that maybe the problem of the two sets is only actually a problem for native speakers. I won't say that it's not a problem for foreigners but, as I pointed out in my previous message, native speakers generally have the considerable disadvantage of having been raised all of their lives with one system, never dealing with the other.  This makes the other system strange to them and, subconsciously or not, they may think it's ugly and 'wrong' (I would guess that this probably would happen more for Taiwanese raised with the traditional system). I don't believe that foreigners have this problem. --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 05:13, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

That's pretty funny; you're sort of the inverse of me.  Are you from Taiwan, China, or somewhere else?

Anyway, I don't think either of us are going to change our opinions on which way is better.  My opinion as an English speaker is still that mixing the two systems provides a benefit at very little extra cost to the reader.  But of course it is very possible that I am just an exception.  The thing to do would be to query some additional English speakers who have learned Chinese my way and see if they also found it easy.

The text I learned from comes in three volumes.  The first volume has thirty chapters.  Most chapters have two reading texts and some grammar information.  The following grammar topics (in this order) are introduced before measure words:

*Chinese word order
*the 吗 particle
*adjectival sentences (such as 我很忙) 
*是 sentences: 那是我的书
*possessive 的
*interrogative pronouns (谁，什么， etc)
*verbal predicates (你吸烟吗？)
*affirmative-negative sentences (他是不是你的弟弟？)
*verbal constructions in series (我去图书馆看书)
*word order of 也 and 都
*possession with 有
*给 and 在
*Chinese numbers

This was just a quick skim, so I probably missed some topics.  Also, I'm not sure what the copyright considerations are of copying that order, though. --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 18:01, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)


Sorry, I forgot to comment on Lesson 7.  Its English prose definitely needs some cleaning up, but the structure is pretty good.  I like the lengthy grammar explanations.

For stroke order, it would be easy enough to add a separate diagram for traditional in the cases where the characters differ.  Every Chinese book for Americans that I have ever seen uses Pinyin.  As an English speaker (and Linguistics student) I think it's a good choice, since it seems to correspond better with English orthography than the other systems (in my limited experience with them).  If we ''did'' make a separate book for traditional Chinese aimed at Taiwan or somewhere else one of the other systems might be a good idea, but in a combined book I think Pinyin is definitely the best choice.  I've read that even Taiwan is attempting to switch over to either Hanyu Pinyin or another variant.

To tell you the truth, I know next to nothing about Cantonese.  I have a coworker who's a native speaker, and he said that he's not aware of any standard romanization - it seems to be very fragmented in that respect.  Also, what does 'TC' stand for? --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 05:26, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)

'''Roasting nuts''' gives them a fuller flavour, and is a particularly good way to prepare nuts as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]].

Nuts can be roasted (or toasted) by placing them evenly on a sheet pan and roasting in a [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350 degree F oven]] for five to ten minutes.

Small nuts, such as [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]] or chopped [[Cookbook:Hazelnut|hazelnuts]], can be toasted in a dry [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]] over a fairly high heat. Keep the nuts moving, with a [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]], to keep them from burning. (You can also do this with [[Cookbook:Sunflower seeds|sunflower seeds]] and [[Cookbook:Pumpkin seeds|pumpkin seeds]].)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chest pain''' caused by cardiac ischaemia is called ''angina''. It is most often triggered by exertion. Angina can also be precipitated by emotional stress, exposure to cold and sometimes may occur after eating a large meal. 
Usually it decreases when the patient rests and increases if the exertion is continued.

Insufficient blood flow to the heart results in an area of the heart muscle becoming deprived of Oxygen which then stimulates pain fibres.

The underlying pathology is narrowing of the blood vessels by fatty deposits called Atheroma. These narrowings restrict the amount of blood that can flow through the blood vessels. As the individual exercises the energy requirements and therefore oxygen needs of the heart muscle increases. If the blood flow to an area of the heart is not able to increase to cope with the heart muscles requirements Angina may result.

The main risk factors for developing Angina are: Hypertension, Hyperlipidaemia, smoking, age, Diabetes and obesity.
It is important to note that not all episodes of cardiac ischaemia are associated with pain, so called ''Silent Ischaemia'' which is found more often in people with Diabetes.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Logical operator ==

=== Boolean operator ===

 X : Boolean := A &gt; 10 {{Ada/kw|and}} A &lt; 20;

=== Boolean shortcut operator ===

Shortcut operators are used to make the evaluation of parts of boolean expressions conditional: ''and then'', ''or else''. This should never be done to speed up the evaluation (with modern optimizing compilers, it will possibly not have that effect). The correct use is to prevent the evaluation of expressions known to raise an exception.

 {{Ada/kw|if}} Dog /= {{Ada/kw|null}} &lt;b&gt;and then&lt;/b&gt; G (Dog) {{Ada/kw|then}}
    Walk (Dog);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};

In the example above, &lt;tt&gt;G (Dog)&lt;/tt&gt; is only called when the pointer &lt;tt&gt;Dog&lt;/tt&gt; is not &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt;, i.e. it actually points to something.

Actually ''and then'' and ''or else'' are not operators in the sense of the reference manual, they are called 'Short-circuit Control Forms'. The difference is that (true) operators can be redefined (i.e. overloaded), whereas these cannot. They are however defined for any boolean type.

Since Ada allows parallel evaluation of the arguments for an expression, shortcut operators are not the standard way of evaluating boolean expressions.  In any case where the final result of the evaluation is guaranteed to be the same, the compiler is allowed to use a shortcut evaluation.

=== Boolean operator on arrays ===

The and operator is applied to each pair of boolean elements from the left and right arrays. The result has the same bounds as the left operand.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Month_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean;
 
 X : Month_Array := Function_1;
 Y : Month_Array := Function_2;
 Z : Month_Array := X {{Ada/kw|and}} Y;

=== Bitwise operator ===

The operator '''and''' could be used with [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|modular types]] to perform bitwise operations.

== Adding interfaces to tagged types ==

{{Ada/2005|And}}

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person

      <text xml:space="preserve">An understanding of the basic lesions that occur on the skin is essential to the discipline of [[Introduction to Dermatology|dermatology]]. Lesions are divided into the general categories of primary and secondary. Primary lesions are those that are directly associated with the disease process and usually appear early in the course of the disease. Those appearing later are called secondary lesions and may be a result of the ongoing disease process and changes to the primary lesions. Secondary lesions are often the result of manipulation by the patient (rubbing, scratching, etc.) or the result of treatments applied to the skin after the process began.  An ulceration could be primary (the disease process) or secondary (result of scratching).

A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is most helpful to the identification of the diseases present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body. Dermatology has been called &quot;a window through which to see the entire body.&quot; As such an understanding of Dermatology is essential to the Internist. 

== Basics ==


=== Skin Anatomy ===
Skin consists of distinct layers.  The most superficial (most exterior) layer is the epidermis.  The epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium.  It has stacked layers of cells.  Below the epidermis lies the dermis and below that we find the subcutaneous fat, or subcutis. 

====Epidermis====
The epidermis consists of stratified squamous epithelium.  The &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; cells of the epidermis are keratinocytes.  Interspersed among the keratinocytes, we also find melanocytes and other specialized cells, known as Merkel cells.  The keratinocytes provide the structure and maintain the barrier function of the skin. Melanocytes make protective pigment.  Merkel cell function is less certain.

=== Skin Function ===

The primary functions of skin include protection from physical injury, impermeability (keeping fluids out of your body, and keeping necessary fluids inside of your body), resistance to microbial penetration, and function as a sensory end organ. 

The secondary functions of skin include:

* Immune Functions
** Dryness, desquamation, normal flora of bacteria
** Antigen presenting cells such as Langerhans cells, Keratinocytes (immunoregulating cytokine), Epidermotropic T-Cells.

* Solar and Heat Interactions
** UV Radiation Protection (melanin)
** Thermoregulation
** Vitamin D Metabolism

* Communication

=== Functional Adaptations of Skin ===
* Hair
* Nails
* Eccrine sweat glands
* Apocrine glands
* Sebaceous glands

=== Cellular Components of Skin ===
* Epidermis
** Keratinocytes
** Langerhans cells
** Melanocytes
** Merkel cells
** Lymphocytes

* Dermis
** Fibroblasts
** Connective tissue
** Extracellular proteins
** Matrix
** Endothelial cells
** Mononuclear cells
** Nerves and Neural organs

* Hypodermis
** Connective tissue
** Adipocytes
** Endothelial cells

[[Image:Bobcat.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A bobcat]]

These odd-shaped, ruff-faced cats are not as lordly as the lion or powerful as the tiger.  They are mid-sized predators, too big to bother with mice and too small to tackle a healthy adult deer.  But they do one job rather well--keeping the rabbit population under control.  With their long legs and short tails, they are superbly equipped to tackle anything from a tiny cottontail to a huge snowshoe hare. The natural enemies of the Iberian Lynx are the wolf and the bear but the most dangerous enemy  that almost extincts it is the human that kills it with traps, venom and hunts them.

==Where do lynx live?==
[[Image:lynx range.png|thumb|left|Places where lynx live are colored green.]]
The four species of lynx are very widespread.  The European Lynx lives in northern [[Wikijunior:Europe|Europe]] and Asia.   The Canadian Lynx lives in North America.  The Iberian (or Spanish) Lynx is one of the most highly endangered cats and only lives in wild parts of [[Wikijunior:Europe/Spain|Spain]].  Bobcats are the smallest type of lynx, living in North America.  Because they hunt small prey, they live in a wide variety of habitats. The Iberian Lynx is an animal which lives only in the Iberian Peninsula. 

==What do lynx look like?==

[[Image:Lynx lynx poing.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A lynx]]

Not all lynx look the same. Some of them have dark spots, while others have plain yellow or gray fur. All of them have white bellies. Lynx have long hairs at the tops of their ears, and a beard around their jaw. A bobcat is much smaller than a regular lynx. The lynx males weigh 40 pounds (18 kg) or more, and females weigh 18 to 30 pounds (8 to 14 kg), but the bobcat males only weigh 16 to 28 pounds (7 to 13 kg) and the females weigh 10 to 18 pounds (5 to 8 kg). The lynx also stands at 30 to 42 inches (74 to 107 cm) high, but the bobcat only is only 17 to 23 inches (43 to 58 cm) high. The bobcat also lacks the distinctive ear tufts and looks more like a big house cat. They have smaller feet and shorter legs compared to other lynx, and almost always have spots. The most unique part on the lynx and bobcat is their tail.  The bobcat was named after its tail, because it is &quot;bobbed&quot; or short.

==What do lynx and bobcats eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
[[Image:Lynx-canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|A lynx hunting]]
Lynx eat mainly arctic hares (a large member of the rabbit family). They sometimes eat squirrels, ptarmigan (birds that look like large pigeons), and grouse (which look like fancy chickens). The Iberian Lynx feeds mostly on rabbits and hares.

Bobcats eat smaller animals like squirrels, rabbits, and mice.  Their odd shape with long legs, a short neck and short tail, is an adaptation to hunting prey that must be captured with a sudden burst of speed and a killing pounce.  In order to catch their prey, they must first sneak up as carefully and close as they can (stalking), and only make a final rushing attack when the prey makes a run for it.  Obviously the closer they can approach before the run, the greater their chances of success.

They can't eat more than three pounds of meat at a time.

One common prey species for lynx, the arctic hare, has a secret weapon.  Every year when the snow melts on the Arctic tundra (swampy grasslands) the timid animal sheds its white winter coat for a new crop of brown fur.  This does not happen all at once, so while the hare still has patches of white, it still matches the surroundings where bits of snow still linger on the ground.  By staying perfectly still, these hares are nearly impossible to see.  This strategy often accomplishes a great deal more than running away.

==Fun facts==
To show their toughness, people used to claim that, in a fight, they could triumph over their &quot;weight in bobcats&quot;. However, bobcat experts would not believe this claim for a moment. All cats are stronger for their size than any human.

The '''Atmel AVR'''&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is a family of 8-bit RISC [[w:microcontroller|microcontrollers]] produced by [[w:Atmel|Atmel]].  The AVR architecture was conceived by two students at the '''Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH)''' and further refined and developed at '''Atmel Norway''', the Atmel daughter company founded by the two chip architects.

== Memory ==

The memory of the Atmel AVR processors is a [[w:Modified Harvard architecture|Modified Harvard architecture]], in which the program and data memory are on separate buses to allow faster access and increased capacity.  The AVR uses internal memory for data and program storage, and so does not require any external memory.

The four types of memories in a Atmel AVR are:
* Data memory: registers, I/O registers, and SRAM
* Program flash memory
* EEPROM
* Fuse bits

All these memories are on the same chip as the CPU core.
Each kind of memory is separated from each other, in different locations on the chip. Address 0 in data memory is distinct from address 0 in program flash and address 0 in EEPROM.

===Program Memory===

All AVR microcontrollers have some amount of 16 bit wide non-volatile [[w:Flash memory|flash]] memory for program storage, from 1&amp;nbsp;KB up to 256&amp;nbsp;KB (or, 512-128K typical program words). The program memory holds the executable program opcodes and static data tables. Program memory is linearly addressed, and so mechanisms like page banking or segment registers are not required to call any function, regardless of its location in program memory.

AVRs cannot use external program memory; the flash memory on the chip is the only program memory available to the AVR core.

The flash program memory can be reprogrammed using a programming tool, the most popular being those that program the chip ''in situ'' and are called in-system programmers (ISP).  Atmel AVRs can also be reprogrammed with a high-voltage parallel or serial programmer, and via JTAG (again, ''in situ'') on certain chips.  The flash memory in an AVR can be re-programmed at least 10,000 times.

Many of the newer AVRs (MegaAVR series) have the capability to self-program the flash memory.  This functionality is used mainly by [[Embedded Systems/Bootloaders and Bootsectors|bootloaders]].

===Data Memory===

Data Memory includes the registers, the I/O registers, and internal SRAM.

The AVR has thirty-two general purpose eight-bit registers (R0 to R31), six of which can be used in pairs as sixteen-bit pointers (X, Y, and Z).

All AVR microcontrollers have some amount of RAM, from 32 bytes up to several KB. This memory is byte addressable. The register file (both general and special purpose) is mapped into the first addresses and thus accessible also as RAM. Some of the tiniest AVR microcontrollers have only the register file as their RAM.

The data address space consists of the register file, I/O registers, and SRAM. The working registers are mapped in as the first thirty-two memory spaces (0000&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;-001F&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;) followed by the reserved space for up to 64 I/O registers (0020&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;-005F&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;). The actual usable SRAM starts after both these sections (address 0060&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;). (Note that the I/O register space may be larger on some more extensive devices, in which case the beginning address of SRAM will be higher.) Even though there are separate addressing schemes and optimized opcodes for register file and I/O register access, they can still be addressed and manipulated as if they were SRAM.

The I/O registers (and the program counter) are reset to their default starting values when a reset occurs.
The registers and the rest of SRAM have initial random values, so typically one of the first things a program does is clear them to all zeros or load them with some other initial value.

The registers, I/O registers, and SRAM never wear out, no matter how many times they are written.

====External Data Memory====

Some of the higher pin-count AVR microcontrollers allow for external expansion of the data space, addressable up to 64&amp;nbsp;KB.  When enabled, external SRAM is overlaid by internal SRAM; an access to address 0000&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; in the data space will always resolve to on-chip memory.  Depending on the amount of on-chip SRAM present in the particular AVR, anywhere from 512 bytes to several KB of external RAM will not be accessible.  This usually does not cause a problem.

The support circuitry required is described in the datasheet for any device that supports external data memory, such as the [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2513.pdf Mega 162], in the &quot;External Memory Interface&quot; section.  The support circuitry is minimal, consisting of a '573 or similar latch, and potentially some chip select logic.  The SRAM chip select may be tied to a logic level that permanently enables the chip, or it may be driven by a pin from the AVR.  For an SRAM of 32&amp;nbsp;KB or less, one option is to use a higher-order address line to drive the chip select line to the SRAM.

===EEPROM Storage===

Almost all AVR microcontrollers have internal [[w:EEPROM|EEPROM]] memory for non-volatile data storage.
Only the Tiny11 and Tiny28 have no EEPROM.

EEPROM memory is not directly mapped in either the program or data space, but is instead accessed indirectly as a peripheral, using I/O registers.  Many compilers available for the AVR hide some or all of the details of accessing EEPROM.  [[w:IAR Systemes|IAR]]'s C compiler for the AVR recognizes the compiler-specific keyword &lt;code&gt;__eeprom&lt;/code&gt; on a variable declaration.  Thereafter, a person writes code to read and write that variable with the same standard C syntax as normal variables (in RAM), but the compiler generates code to access the EEPROM instead of regular data memory.

Atmel's datasheets indicate that the EEPROM can be re-written a minimum of 100,000 times.  An application must implement a wear-leveling scheme if it writes to the EEPROM so frequently that it will reach the write limit before it reaches the expected lifetime of the device.  AVRs ship from the factory with the EEPROM erased, i.e. the value in each byte of EEPROM is FF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;.

Many of the AVRs have errata about writing to EEPROM address 0 under certain power conditions (usually during [[w:Brownout (electricity)|brownout]]), and so Atmel recommends that programs not use that address in the EEPROM.

===Fuse Settings===
A Fuse is an EEPROM bit that controls low level features and pin assignments.  Fuses are not accessible by the program; they can only be changed by a chip programmer.  Fuses control features which must be set before the chip can come out of reset and begin executing code.

The most frequently modified fuses include:

#Oscillator/crystal characteristics, including drive strength and start-up time.
#JTAG pins used for JTAG or GPIO
#&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; pin used as a reset input, debugWire, or GPIO
#Brown Out Detect (BOD) enable and BOD voltage trigger points

There is a also a fuse to enable serial in-system programming, which is set by default.  If it is set incorrectly, the only way to program the chip is by using a high-voltage programmer, such as the STK-500, AVR Dragon, or third-party programmer. A developer is therefore cautioned to be careful when manipulating fuses.

== Reset ==
The AVR's &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; pin is an active-low input that forces a reset of the processor and its integrated peripherals.  The line can be driven by an external power-on reset generator, a voltage supervisor (which asserts &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; when the power supply voltage drops below a predefined threshold), or another component in a larger system.  For example, if the AVR is managing a few sensors and servos as part of a large integrated system, another controller might observe some condition that justifies resetting the AVR; it could do so by asserting the AVR's &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; line.

AVRs also include a [[Embedded_Systems/Threading_and_Synchronization#Watchdog_Timer | watchdog timer]], which can reset the processor when it times out.  The watchdog timer must be reset periodically to prevent it from timing out.  Failure to reset the watchdog timer is usually an indication that the program code has failed (locked up, entered an infinite loop, or otherwise gone astray), and the processor should be reset. On some AVRs the watchdog can be programmed to issue an interrupt instead of resetting the processor. This functionality can be used to wake up the AVR from a sleep mode.

The &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; pin is used for in-system serial programming, as a GPIO, or for debugWIRE&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; low pin count debugging, depending on the chip and the programming of the fuse bits.  If the reset functionality of that pin is disabled, it cannot be recovered by in-system serial programming, and another method such as high-voltage programming must be used.

== Interrupts ==

AVRs support multiple interrupt sources, both internal and external.  An interrupt could be from an internal peripheral reaching a certain state (i.e. character received on UART), or from an external event like a certain level on a pin.  Each interrupt source causes a jump to a specific location in memory.  That location is expected to contain either a RETI (Return from Interrupt) instruction to essentially ignore the interrupt, or a jump to the actual interrupt handler.

Most AVRs have at least one dedicated external interrupt pin (INT0).  Older AVRs can trigger an interrupt on a high or low level, or on a falling edge.  Newer AVRs add more options, such as triggering on the rising edge or either edge.  Additionally, many of the newer AVRs implement pin-change interrupts for all pins in groups of eight, eliminating the need for [[w:Polling_%28computer_science%29|polling]] the pins.  The pin-change interrupt handler must examine the state of the pins that are associated with that interrupt vector, and determine what action to take.

Due to button bounce issues, it is considered poor design to connect a push button or other user input directly to an interrupt pin; some debouncing or other signal conditioning must be interposed so that the signal from the button does not violate the setup and hold times required on the interrupt pins.

== General Purpose I/O Ports ==

General Purpose I/O, or GPIO, pins are the digital I/O for the AVR family.  These pins are true push-pull outputs.  The AVR can drive a high or low level, or configure the pin as an input with or without a pull-up.  GPIOs are grouped into &quot;ports&quot; of up to 8 pins, though some AVRs do not have enough pins to provide all 8 pins in a particular port, e.g. the Mega48/88/168 does not have a PortC7 pin.  Control registers are provided for setting the data direction, output value (or pull-up enabled), and for reading the value on the pin itself.  An individual pin can be accessed using bitwise manipulation instructions.

Each port has 3 control registers associated with it, DDRx, PORTx, and PINx.  Each bit in those registers controls one GPIO pin, i.e. bit 0 in DDRA controls the data direction for PortA0 (often abbreviated PA0), and bit 0 in PORTA will control the data (or pullup) for PA0.

The DDR (Data Direction Register) controls whether the pin is an input or an output.  When the pin is configured as an output, the corresponding bit in the PORT register will control the drive level to the pin, high or low.  When the pin is configured as an input, the bit in the PORT register controls whether a pull-up is enabled or disabled on that pin.  The PIN (Port Input) register was read-only on earlier AVRs, and was used to read the value on the port pin, regardless of the data direction.  Newer AVRs allow a write to the PIN register to toggle the corresponding PORT bit, which saves a few processor cycles when bit-banging an interface.

== Timer/Counters ==

All AVRs have at least one 8-bit timer/counter.  For brevity, a timer/counter is usually referred to as simply a timer.

Some of the Tiny series have only one 8-bit timer.  At the high end of the Mega series, there are chips with as many as six timers (two 8-bit and four 16-bit).

A timer can be clocked directly by the system clock, by a divided-down system clock, or by an external input (rising or falling edge).  Some AVRs also include an option to use an external crystal, asynchronous to the system clock, which can be used for maintaining a real-time clock with a 32.768&amp;nbsp;kHz crystal.

The basic operation of a timer is to count up to FF&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (or FFFF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;), roll over to zero, and set an overflow bit, which may cause an interrupt if enabled.  The interrupt routine reloads the timer with the desired value in addition to any other processing required.

The value of a timer can be read back at any time, even while it is running.  (There is a specific sequence documented in the datasheets to read back a 16-bit timer so that a consistent result is returned, since the AVR can only move 8 bits at a time.) A timer can be halted temporarily by changing its clock input to &quot;disabled,&quot; then resumed by re-selecting the previous clock input.

=== PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) ===

Many of the AVRs include a compare register for at least one of the timers.  The compare register can be used to trigger an interrupt and/or toggle an output pin (i.e. OC1A for Timer 1) when the timer value matches the value in the compare register.  This may be done separately from the overflow interrupt, enabling the use of pulse-width modulation (PWM).

Some AVRs also include options for phase-correct PWM, or phase- and frequency-correct PWM.

The Clear Timer on Compare (CTC) mode allows for the timer to be cleared when it matches a value in the compare register, before the timer overflows.  Clearing the timer prior to overflow manipulates the timer resolution, allowing for greater control of the output frequency of a compare match.  It can also simplify the counting of an external event.

The ATtiny26 is unique in its inclusion of a 64&amp;nbsp;MHz high-speed PWM mode.  The 64&amp;nbsp;MHz clock is generated from a PLL, and is independent of, and asynchronous to, the processor clock.  

Some AVRs also include complementary outputs suitable for controlling some motors.  A dead-time generator (DTG) inserts a delay between one signal falling and the other signal rising so that both signals are never high at the same time. The high-end AT90PWM series allows the dead time to be programmed as a number of system clock cycles, while other AVRs with this feature simply use 1 clock cycle for the dead time.

=== Output Compare Modulator ===

An Output Compare Modulator (OCM), which allows generating a signal that is modulated with a carrier frequency.  OCM requires two timers, one for the carrier frequency, and the second for the signal to be modulated.  OCM is available on some of the Mega series.

== Serial Communication ==

AVR microcontrollers are in general capable of supporting a plethora of serial communication protocols and serial bus standards. The exact types of serial communication support varies between the different members of the AVR microcontroller family.

On top of support in hardware there is also often the option to implement a particular serial communication mechanism entirely in software. Typically this is used in case a particular AVR controller does not support some serial communication mechanism in hardware, the particular hardware is already in use (e.g. when two RS-232 interfaces are needed, but only one is supported in hardware), or the chip's  hardware can't be used, because it shares pins with other chip functions, and such a function is already in used for the particular hardware. The latter often happens with the low-pincount AVRs in DIP packages.

Finally, there is also the possibility to use additional logic to implement a serial communication function. For example, most AVRs don't support the USB bus (some later ones do so, however). When using an AVR which doesn't support USB directly, a circuit designer can add USB functionality with a fixed-function chip such as the FTDI232 USB to RS-232 converter chip, or a general-purpose USB interface such as the PDIUSB11. Adding additional electronics is in fact necessary for some supported communication protocols, e.g. standard-compliant RS-232 communication requires adding voltage level converters like the MAX232.

The number of serial communication possibilities supported by a particular AVR can be confusing at times, in particular if the pins are shared with other chip functions. An intensive study of the particular AVR's datasheet is highly recommended. The serial communication features most commonly to be found on AVRs are discussed in the following sections.

=== Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART) ===

Recent AVRs typically come with a Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART) built-in. A USART is a programmable piece of hardware which is capable of generating and decoding various serial communication protocols. USART is an acronym from the following words:

;Universal:Can be used in a lot of different serial communication scenarios
;Synchronous:Can be used for synchronous serial communication (sender and receiver are synchronised by a particular clock signal)
;Asynchronous:Can be used for asynchronous serial communication (sender and receiver are not explicitly synchronised via a clock signal, but synchronise on the data signal).
;Receiver:The hardware in the AVR can receive serial data
;Transmitter:The hardware can send serial data

Earlier AVRs had a UART that did not support synchronous serial communication, hence the absence of the &quot;S&quot; in the acronym.

USARTs or UARTs work with logic voltage levels while e.g. the RS-232 protocol requires much different voltage levels than the 5&amp;nbsp;V or 3.3&amp;nbsp;V supplies found on AVR circuits. The conversion from and to such voltage levels is performed by an additional chip  which is commonly called a line driver or line interface. 

With the right line interface an AVR's USART can, for example, be used to communicate with RS-232, RS-485, MIDI, LIN bus, or CANbus devices, to name some of the popular protocols.

See [[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: Networks]] for more details.

====RS-232 Signalling====

The RS-232 specification calls for a negative voltage to represent a &quot;1&quot; bit, and a positive voltage to represent a &quot;0&quot; bit.  The spec allows for levels from +3 to +15&amp;nbsp;V, and -3 to -15&amp;nbsp;V, but +/-12&amp;nbsp;V is commonly seen.  The AVR does not have the ability to drive a negative output voltage on any GPIO pin, and so a level converter, such as the [[Serial_Programming:MAX232_Driver_Receiver|MAX232]], is used to talk to PCs and strict RS-232 devices.  See [[Serial Programming:RS-232 Connections]] for more detail on RS-232 wiring.

RS-232 has a relatively short maximum cable length.  For longer cabling distances, consider using [[Serial Programming:RS-485 Technical Manual|RS-485]] signaling on your USART.

=== Two Wire Interface ===
TWI is a variant of Phillips' [[w:I2C | I&amp;sup2;C]] bus interface.  I&amp;sup2;C consists of two wires, known as SDA (serial data) and SCL (serial clock), which use open-drain drivers and therefore require pull-ups to a logic-1 state.  I&amp;sup2;C uses a common ground, so all devices on the bus should be at the same ground potential to avoid ground loops.  TWI uses 7 bit addressing, which allows for multiple devices to connect to the bus.

Many TWI devices have at least the top four bits of the address hard-coded, and the remaining bits configurable by some means such as connecting dedicated address pins to power or ground; this often allows for only 2-8 model ''X'' devices on the bus. The AVR's TWI hardware can act as Master or Slave, and can meet the 400&amp;nbsp;kbit/s spec.

=== Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) ===
SPI, the [[w:Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]], is a master-slave synchronous serial protocol. This means that there is a clock line which determines where the pulses are to be sampled, and that one of the parties is always in charge of initiating communication. It uses at least three lines, which are called:

; MISO: Master In Slave Out.
; MOSI: Master Out Slave In.
; SCK: Serial Clock.

Conceptually, SPI is a bidirectional shift register; as bits are shifted out on either MISO or MOSI, bits are shifted in on the other line.  The master always controls the clock.

An SPI slave has a Slave Select (SS) signal, which signals to the slave that it should respond to messages from the master.  SS is almost always active-low.  If there is only one master and one slave, the slave's SS line could be tied low, and the master would not need to drive it.  If there are two or more slaves, then the master must use a separate slave select signal to each slave.  The downside of this approach is that the master can only address as many slaves as it has extra outputs (without the use of a separate decoder).

'''Hardware Implementation'''
The larger AVR microcontrollers have built-in SPI transceivers (from the ATmega8 upwards).  The serial clock is derived from the processor clock, with several divisors available.  The data length is always 8 bits.  The clock polarity and phase may be configured, leading to four possible combinations of when the data is clocked in and out of the chip.  This interface is very popular, and is widely available on a variety of other processors and peripherals.

The pins used for the SPI bus are also used as a way of programming the chip via ISP (In System Programming)(Except on the mega128).

'''Universal Serial Interface'''
Some AVRs, particularly in the Tiny family, provide a Universal Serial Interface (USI) instead of an SPI.  The USI is capable of operating as an SPI, but also as an I2C controller, and with a little extra effort, a USART.  The bit length of the transfer is configurable, as is the clock driver.  The clock can be driven by software, by the timer 0 overflow, or by an external source.

'''Software Implementation'''
SPI can be implemented using [[w:bit-banging|bit-banging]] of the I/O lines. An efficient implementation of a slave can be done by connecting SCLK to an external interrupt source.

The datasheet for a particular AVR provides a block diagram of the SPI or USI controller on that chip.

=== Protocol Issues ===

SPI, RS-232, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C, and other serial interfaces only define the method by which bits and bytes are transmitted; they correspond to layer 1 in the [[w:OSI model|OSI model]], the physical layer.  The bytes could be anything: temperature readings (in Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on your sensor), readings from a pressure sensor, control signals to turn off a pump, or the bytes of a JPEG image.  Some of this meaning may be assigned by the use of a serial communications protocol.

A serial protocol must handle a wide variety of usage conditions, as well as provide for recovering from failures.  For example, if two sensors are connected to a single microcontroller (such as inside and outside temperature), the protocol provides a way for the receiver on the other end of the serial line to discern which reading belongs to which sensor.  If a cable is unplugged during transmission, or a byte is lost due to line noise, the protocol can provide a way to re-synchronize the transmitter and the receiver.

The [[Serial Programming]] wikibook contains more discussion of serial protocols.

== Analog Interfaces ==

=== Analog to Digital ===

Analog to digital conversion uses digital number to represent the proportion of the analog signal sampled.  For example, by applying a 3&amp;nbsp;V to the input of an ADC with a full-scale range of 5&amp;nbsp;V, will result as a digital output of 60% of the full range of the digital output.
The digital number can be represented in 8 or 10 bits by the ADC.  An 8 bit converter will provide output from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2^8 - 1&lt;/math&gt;, or 255. 10 bits will provide output from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2^{10} - 1=1023&lt;/math&gt;.  

10 bit sample: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3 V}{5 V} = 0.6 \times 1023 = 614&lt;/math&gt; in ADCH:ADCL or 

8 bit sample: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3 V}{5 V} = 0.6 \times 255 = 153&lt;/math&gt; in ADCL

Many AVRs include an ADC, specifically a [[w:Successive Approximation ADC|successive-approximation ADC]].  The ADC reference voltage (5&amp;nbsp;V in the example above) can be an external voltage, an internal fixed 1.1&amp;nbsp;V reference.

AVRs with an ADC have several analog inputs which are connected to the ADC via an analog multiplexer.  Only one analog input can be converted at any given time.  The ADC controller provides a method for sequentially converting the inputs, so that an AVR can easily cycle through multiple sources thousands of times a second.  AVRs can run ADC conversions continuously in the background, or use a special &quot;ADC sleep&quot; mode to halt the processor while a conversion is taking place, to minimize voltage disturbances from the rest of the MCU.

=== Analog Comparator Peripheral ===
Nearly all AVR microcontrollers feature an Analog Comparator which can be used to implement an ADC on those AVRs which do not have an ADC, or if all of the ADC inputs are already in use.  Atmel provides sample code and documentation for using the comparator as a low-speed ADC.  The signal to be measured is connected to the inverted input, and a reference signal is connected to the non-inverting input. The AVR generates an interrupt when the signal falls below or rises above the reference value.

A common use for the analog comparator is sensing battery voltage, to alert the user to a low battery.

== Other Integrated Hardware ==
Aside from what might be considered typical peripherals for a microcontroller (UART, SPI, ADC), some AVRs include more specialized peripherals for specific applications.

=== LCD Driver ===

In larger models like the ATmega169 (as seen in the AVR Butterfly), an LCD driver is integrated. The LCD driver commandeers several ports of the AVR to drive the column/row connections of a display. One particular trait of Liquid Crystal that must be taken care of is that no DC bias is put through it. DC bias, or having more electrons passing one way than the other when pumping AC, chemically breaks apart the liquid crystal. The AVR's LCD module uses precise timing to drive pixels forwards and backwards equally.

=== USB Interface ===
{{main | Serial Programming/USB }}

The [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/devices.asp?family_id=607#1761 AT90USB] series includes an on-chip USB controller.  Some models are &quot;function&quot; only, while others have On-The-Go functionality to act as either a USB host (for interfacing with other slave devices) or as a USB slave (for interfacing with a USB master).

AVRs without built-in USB can use an external chip such as the PDIUSB12, or for a low-speed and minimal functionality device, a firmware-only approach.

Two firmware-only USB drivers are
* [http://www.obdev.at/products/avrusb/index.html obdev], which is available under an Open Source compliant license with some restrictions, and
* [http://www.xs4all.nl/~dicks/avr/usbtiny/index.html USBtiny], which is licensed under the GPL.
* The LUFA library, released released under the MIT License, allows the USB-enabled AVR microcontrollers to act as a USB Host, slave or OTG device.[http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php]

Although these software implementation provide a very cheap way to add USB connectivity, they are limited to low-speed transfers, and tie up quite some AVR resources. Other hardware ICs which translate USB signals to RS-232 (serial) for the AVRs are available, from vendors such as [http://www.ftdichip.com/ FTDI]. These ICs have the advantage of offloading the strenuous task of managing the USB connection with the disadvantage of being limited to the speed of the AVR's serial port.
See [[Embedded Systems/Particular Microprocessors#USB interface]] for more details on such USB interface chips.

=== Temperature Sensor ===
Some newer models have a built in temperature sensor hooked up to the ADC.

== AVR Selection ==

The AVR microcontrollers are divided into three groups:

*tinyAVR
*AVR (Classic AVR)
*megaAVR

The difference between these devices mostly lies in the available features. The tinyAVR microcontrollers are usually devices with lower pin-count or reduced feature set compared to the megaAVRs. All AVR devices have the same basic instruction set and memory organization, so migrating from one device to another AVR is usually trivial.

The classic AVR is mostly EOL'd, and so new designs should use the Mega or Tiny series. Some of the classic AVRs have replacement parts in the mega series, e.g. the AT90S8515 is replaced by the mega8515.

Atmel provides a [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/param_table.asp?family_id=607&amp;OrderBy=part_no&amp;Direction=ASC Parametric Product Table] which compares the memory, peripherals, and features available on the entire line of AVRs.

=== Hardware Design Considerations ===
Atmel provides the [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2521.pdf AVR Hardware Design Considerations] to assist the hardware designer. This document also shows the standard in-circuit serial programming connector.

=== AVR development/application boards ===
==== Butterfly Demo Board ====
The AVR Butterfly is a self-contained, battery-powered demonstration board running the ATMEL AVR ATmega169V Microcontroller. The board includes an LCD screen, joystick, speaker, serial port, RTC, flash chip, temperature, light and voltage sensors. The board has a shirt pin on its back and can be worn as a name badge.

The AVR Butterfly comes preloaded with software to demonstrate the capabilities of the microcontroller. Factory firmware can scroll your name, display the sensor readings, and show the time. Also, the AVR Butterfly has a piezo buzzer that can reproduce sound.

The AVR Butterfly demonstrates LCD driving by running a 14-segment, 6 alpha-numeric character display. However, the LCD interface consumes many of the I/O pins.

The Butterfly's ATmega169 CPU is capable of speeds up to 8&amp;nbsp;MHz, however it is factory set by software to 2&amp;nbsp;MHz to preserve the button battery life. A pre-installed bootloader program allows the board to be re-programmed with a standard RS-232 serial plug.

Ecros Technology produces a [http://ecrostech.com/AtmelAvr/Butterfly/index.htm carrier board for the Butterfly] which provides a power supply, convenient connections to I/O ports, a DB-9 serial port (with level translator), and a large prototyping area.

==== STK500 starter kit ====
The STK500 starter kit and development system features ISP and high voltage programming for all AVR devices, either directly or through extension boards. The board is fitted with DIP sockets for all AVRs available in DIP packages.

Several expansion modules are available for the STK500 board. These include:
*STK501 - Adds support for microcontrollers in 64 pin TQFP packages.
*STK502 - Adds support for LCD AVRs in 64 pin TQFP packages.
*STK503 - Adds support for microcontrollers in 100 pin TQFP packages.
*STK504 - Adds support for LCD AVRs in 100 pin TQFP packages.
*STK505 - Adds support for 14 and 20 pin AVRs.
*STK520 - Adds support for 14 and 20 pin microcontrollers from the AT90PWM family.

==== Third-Party Boards ====

There are many AVR based development and/or application boards available from third parties, far too many to list all of them here.

== Programming Interfaces ==
There are many means to get program code onto the AVR.

=== In System Programming ===
Functionally, ISP is done through [[w:Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], with some twiddling on Reset. As long as the SPI pins of the AVR aren't connected to anything disruptive, the AVR chip could stay soldered onto a board while reprogramming. All that's needed is a 6 pin plug, and an affordable PC adapter. This is the most common way to develop with an AVR.

Atmel's AVR ISP mkII connects to a PC's USB port and performs in-system programming using Atmel's software.

[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude avrdude] (AVR Downloder UploaDEr) runs on Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and Mac OS X, and supports a variety of in-system programming hardware, including Atmel AVR ISP mkII, Atmel JTAG ICE, older Atmel serial-port based programmers, and various third-party and &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; programmers.

=== High Voltage Programming ===
HV programming is mostly the backup mode on smaller AVRs. An 8 pin package doesn't leave many unique signal combinations to kick the AVR into programming mode. A 12 volt signal, however, is something the AVR should never see in a proper circuit.

=== Parallel Programming ===
Parallel is a backup mode on larger AVRs. It may be the only way to talk to an AVR that has a crazy oscillator fuse set. Parallel programming may also be faster, good if you have a modest production line going.

=== Bootloader Programming ===
Most AVR models can reserve a bootloader region, 256&amp;nbsp;B - 2&amp;nbsp;KB, where re-programming code can reside. At power on, the bootloader runs first, and does some user-programmed determination whether to re-program, or jump to the main application.  The code can re-program through any interface available, it could read an encrypted binary through an Ethernet adapter if it felt like it. Atmel has application notes and code pertaining to any interface from RS-232 onwards.

Bootloaders are covered in detail in chapter
[[../Bootloaders and Bootsectors/]]
.

=== No Programming at All ===
The AT90SC series of AVRs are available with a mask ROM rather than flash for program memory. [http://www.atmel.com/products/secureavr/overview.asp]

Because of the large up-front cost and minimum order quantity, mask ROM is only cost-effective for a large production run.

== Debugging Interfaces ==
The AVR offers several options for debugging, mostly involving on-chip debugging while the chip is in the target system.

=== '''JTAG''' ===
JTAG provides access to on-chip debugging functionality while the chip is running in the target system.  JTAG allows accessing internal memory and registers, setting breakpoints on code, and single-stepping execution to observe system behaviour.

Atmel provides a series of JTAG adapters for the AVR.

# The [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2737 JTAGICE adapter] interfaces to the PC via a standard serial port.  It is somewhat expensive by hobbyist standards at around US$300, although much more affordable than many other microntroller emulation systems.  The JTAGICE has been [[w:End-of-life_(product)|EOL'ed]], though it is still supported in AVR Studio and other tools.
# The [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3353 JTAGICE mkII] replaces the JTAGICE, and is similarly priced.  The JTAGICE mkII interfaces to the PC via USB, and supports both JTAG and the newer debugWIRE interface.
# The [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3891 AVR Dragon] is a low-cost (approximately $50) substitute for the JTAGICE mkII for certain target parts.  The AVR Dragon provides in-system serial programming, high-voltage serial programming and parallel programming, as well as JTAG or debugWIRE emulation for parts with 32&amp;nbsp;KB of program memory or less.

There are also several third party JTAG debuggers/reprogrammers for around $40, such as those from Ecros and Olimex, as well as [[w:Do it yourself|DIY]] projects, including [http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/evertool/ Evertool] and [http://aquaticus.info/jtag Aquaticus].  These are clones of the original JTAGICE,

JTAG can also be used to perform a [[w:Boundary scan|Boundary Scan]] test [http://atmel.com/dyn/corporate/view_detail.asp?ref=&amp;FileName=JTEGICE.html&amp;SEC_NAME=product], which tests the electrical connections between AVRs and other Boundary Scan capable chips in a system.  Boundary scan is well-suited for a production line; the hobbyist is probably better off testing with a multimeter or oscilloscope.

=== debugWIRE ===
debugWIRE&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is Atmel's solution for providing on-chip debug capabilities via a single microcontroller pin.  It is particularly useful for lower pin count parts which cannot provide the four &quot;spare&quot; pins needed for JTAG.  The JTAGICE mkII and the AVR Dragon support debugWIRE.  debugWIRE was developed after the original JTAGICE release, and none of the JTAG clones support it.

=== Simulation ===
Simulation is not a debugging interface, ''per se'', but simulation in software can be an effective debugging aid prior to committing a design to physical hardware.

[http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSTUDIO.aspx Atmel Studio] simulates the AVR core at the assembly language level, and allows viewing and manipulation of all internal registers.  [http://www.helmix.at/hapsim/ HAPsim] is a set of virtual devices that plug into AVR Studio. It provides LCDs, LEDs, buttons, and dumb terminals.

Other software packages exist which provide software simulation of the AVR core and peripherals are available.

* [http://www.amctools.com/vmlab.htm VMLab] provides full-circuit simulation as well as a virtual oscilloscope.  The debugger offers the ability to single step C code, as well as edit and rebuild winAVR programs.  As of version 3.12, VMLab is freeware.

* [http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/avrora/index.html AVRora] is an &quot;AVR simulation and analysis framework.&quot;

* [http://www.labcenter.co.uk/ Proteus] provides schematic capture, PCB editing, and microcontroller simulation, including the AVR.  The simulator &quot;downloads&quot; code into simulated AVR core.  There is also support for a variety of virtual peripherals within the simulator.

* [http://www.nongnu.org/simulavr/ Simulavr] is a free (GPLv2) simulator working with GDB and commonly used with AVR-GCC.

== Firmware Programming ==

A microcontroller won't do much without [[w:Firmware|firmware]]; program code to tell the microcontroller what to do.  Firmware for AVRs can be written in many different languages.  Atmel published  [http://www.atmel-grenoble.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/novice.pdf The Novice's Guide to AVR Development], part of [http://www.atmel.com/journal/documents/issue1/journal.pdf Atmel Applications Journal 2001 Summer], which provides a brief tutorial in assembly language programming using AVR Studio.

Some features of the AVR microprocessor can only be accessed with assembly language.

Assembly language will almost always produce the smallest code as compared to other compiled languages, and for this reason, it is a popular choice for applications that must fit into a very small code space.

Certain features of C++ are unsuitable for use on a smaller micro like the AVR due to the amount of memory required to implement them; these include exceptions and templates.

{{Wikipediapar||protein#Nutrition}}

An essential part of organisms, '''proteins''' are made up of amino acids. Some amino acids can be synthesized by the human body while some must be obtained through food. Proteins are major contributors to cells' functions.

Protein is one of the nutrients that are needed in larger quantities (i.e., macronutrients) along with [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]] and [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]. Proteins contain 17 kJ/g (4 cal/g) energy.

Sources of protein in the diet include nuts, legumes, grains, eggs, meats and dairy products. Proteins have a distinct behaviour in cooking compared to fats and and carbohydrates. Proteins in general stiffen when heated, for example a egg yolk becomes more solid when heated, because it's rich in protein.

Some proteins are toxic for humans but become edible via cooking, for that reasons some legumes must be boiled before they can be eaten.

==Amino acids==

The building blocks of protein molecules are called amino acids. There are only 20 amino acids, but these can be combined in a huge number of combinations. The proteins are digested in the intestine, and split up in amino acids. These amino acids are later recombined to new proteins in the cells of the body.

The problem I always find on the gujarati pages of wiki is that I see the sign of ઇ (haswa ee) on the right of the consonants it should appear on the left of the consonant. I see ક્ + ઇ = કિ . And being a gujarati I know it should look like ક્ + ઇ = િક . When I corrected some pages on gu.wiki.org, it was restored back by somebody. So, I raised this issue. According to the answer of an admin of gu.wiki, my browser and of some font setting is incorrect. I opened gu.wiki on many other different computers and found the same problem. Could anybody help me please?

I have tried latest Internet Explorer, Mozilla (my usual program) and Netscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MMM devHeader}}

&quot;I'm tempted to say, 'Writing treatments is like designing a film by hiring six million monkeys to tear out pages of an encyclopedia, then you put the pages through a paper-shredder, randomly grab whatever intact lines are left, sing them in Italian to a Spanish deaf-mute, and then make story decisions with the guy via conference call.' But no... compared to writing treatments, that makes sense, too.&quot;  - Terry Rossio

==Purpose==
The term &lt;i&gt;treatment&lt;/i&gt; is short for &quot;treatment of bullshit&quot; or &quot;treatment of a concept&quot;.  While standards for screenplay formats and theories on screenplay structures are ten a penny, it's quite difficult to find any agreed-upon approach to treatments.  One person's treatment is another's &quot;synopsis&quot;, while some people write treatments that look like written-down pitches.  What your &quot;treatment&quot; looks like depends on its purpose.

In &lt;i&gt;Scr(i)pt&lt;/i&gt; magazine (Mar/Apr 2005), John Hill offers &quot;a sample synopsis/treatment&quot; which reads like a written-down pitch.  It's about 1500 words (or 5 pages) and it does a great job of explaining the movie.  But Hill then says this:

&quot;So, why write a synopsis or a treatment?  YOU SHOULDN'T. [...] Why not?  Because they are the worst of both worlds for a writer with a new movie story to sell.  They expose the idea but not in a form where a deal could be made (unless you're an A-list screenwriter already).&quot;

I guess the not-so-subtle implication here is that if you're &quot;an A-list screenwriter&quot;, you can ditch your subscription to &lt;i&gt;Scr(i)pt&lt;/i&gt;.  Hill's point is that people who are already well-established in the industry can get hired on the basis of a treatment, but for people trying to break in a treatment isn't going to do the business.

Well, it's an opinion.  Producer/director/writer Cauri Jaye points out that producers just don't have the time to read every script that comes their way, so a treatment can help them decide whether or not to invest the time reading the full script.  Arguably, if you can't sell your script via a treatment, then why should anyone believe your script sells a story?  And at the very least a treatment gives you a hell of a lot more room to show what you've got besides a bare logline.

I asked Hollywood script consultant Craig Kellem what he thought of Hill's position, and Craig said that &quot;it depends on the situation - sometimes it's needed&quot;.  To develop that idea: where it's needed is where someone asks for one, and is very clear that they won't read a script as an alternative.  

Where writing a treatment might do you actual creative harm is when you start your passion-project spec.  If you're writing a spec script, a good treatment may create a gloss that gets in the way of your creative process.  The glare of your sales vehicle can make you botch your craft.  (Okay, so it happened to me, you can tell.)  Hill recommends that for your own script development purposes you create a simple step outline rather than a treatment.

==Overview==

A treatment (or script outline) should adhere to the following:
* Take the reader through the story of the film. It must bring across the characters and events as they will appear in the film.
* It must not give more information than the audience of the film will have.
* It should go through each sequence, but does not have to contain every scene.
* It should come to about 10 pages for a 90 minute feature film (double spaced, 12 pt courier font)
* You can separate it into acts and sequences (with titles) if it helps.
* A treatment sells the film to both creative and financial minds, therefore it must:
** Grip the reader in the first line of the first page.
** Make the reader want to turn to the next page at the end of every page.
** Move the action forward and not linger on descriptions

==Style notes==
* Take all of the language into the present tense. i.e. not &quot;We cut to the Police Sergeant Joe Rawlins who is muttering under his breath&quot; but rather &quot;Police Sergeant Joe Rawlins mutters under his breath&quot;

* Remove any camera instructions to maintain the suspension of disbelief, this also means get rid of lines like &quot;The final scenes include&quot; and &quot;We are now deep into the third act&quot; for the same reason

* Generally 1 paragraph = 1 scene and you can link them with CUT TO: 

* Use dialogue now and again to help develop the characters and reveal plot points. put dialogue in novel format, i.e. quotes and paragraphs

* Take out any unnecessary items: for each scene/paragraph ask &quot;does this express conflict&quot; and &quot;does this move the plot forward&quot; if it does not either insert conflict or remove the scene from the treatment (and probably the script)

* As an addendum to this, keep the most dramatic scenes. This means skip the transitions and skim over the back story. Try and let the background come out as the plot reveals it to the audience

* Determine the point of view(s) of the story and try to tell it all from that point of view, i.e. do not reveal anything that she does not see or will not know very soon.

* Start on action, not description. This goes for the treatment as a whole as well as each paragraph.

* Do not use details about the functional characters. In fact you can probably remove them completely from the treatment as you should only reveal the broad strokes.  Remember that we want to tease the reader into asking for more detail, i.e. the full screenplay.

* Remember make it dramatic, dramatic, dramatic. We want to hear Beethoven's 5th in the background as we read, da da da daaaaaaa :-)

==Pace==

It should flow approximately like this (this comes from a textbook on treatment writing, it summarizes what I have learned pretty well, so use what you can)

Pgs 1-2  act 1
- Introduce protagonist
- Let us know (his/her) mission
- Set up the mood
- Give a hint of the protagonist's conflict
- Introduce the subplot, the plot-line that conflicts with the protagonist's misson
- Introduce antagonist
- The huge event that changes (his/her) life around

Pgs 3-6 act 2, part 1
- Protagonist reacts to (his/her) new challenge, and the decisions made lead (him/her) into action
- Protagonist starts to develop along (his/her) character arc
- Give the reader an inkling of what's coming

Pgs 7-8 act 2, part 2
- Protagonist's reversals continue, until (S/he) begins to make headway 
- Around page 8, new information that turns everything 180 degrees and forces (him/her) to face an even greater obsticle than the reader imagined

Pgs 9-10 act 2, part 3
- The characters converge
- A hint at the moral of the story. Maybe a place where all seems lost, where protagonist feels maybe (S/he) should give up. Here the plot and subplot begin to break up and we get to protagonist's darkest hour
- Suddenly something happens and everything changes. The universe gives (him/her) a break. (S/He) siezes the moment and goes for it.
- By page 10 (S/he)'s standing at the crossroads of action. (His/Her) next move will be definitive, the climactic turning point. Will (S/he) win or lose?

Pgs 11-15 act 3
- The crisis is the sequence of scenes in which the final outcome of the story is completely determined by the protagonist's actions. At this point it's like a separate story with its own beginning, middle and end, here we put in all the twists and turns. 
- The climax is the end of the crisis
- The resolution: the final moments (keep this short– end quickly and with a dramatic punch)

These are just guide points to help you pace a treatment. It will guide you in where you need to reduce the detail and scenes to make things shorter and where you need to add some meat. The screenplay will follow a similar pacing (just with more pages per act of course)

==Music Video Treatment==

A treatment consists of a written condensation of a proposed film or TV dramatic production. It covers the basic ideas and issues of the production as well as the main characters, locations, and story angles.

In part, its purpose is to sell the proposal to financial backers and major stars. Treatments should be attention-getting and interesting to read. They are written in the present tense, using active language and often read like a short story.

Treatments cover the full story sequence. They typically contain some key scenes that help to entice the reader and sell your idea.

Here is an example;

'''“Leap Year” Music Video'''

This music video is all about time and friendship, losing friends and those who never loose hope or stop waiting for those that matter. We begin by focusing on a boy, pondering a picture on a window-sill (digitally), the picture flies from his hand in a gust of wind, music begins. An montage of urban scenes flash by, starting with a sun rising very fast, mixed with short flashes of character remembering his two friends.
There are three main shots that remain constant scenes. One, a candlelit room with a large frozen clock taking up the entire background, where the boy occasionally sings along with mixture of mystery, longing, and sadness.
Next, a simple framed shot of the boy centered between his female and male friend, both facing them, only the backs of their heads and shoulder blades are visible as the stand halfway outside the spotlight .
The boy now sits up in an old, grey tree, centered in a gated off abandoned schoolyard. Numbers of a clock circle around him and certain things hang on the branches like a Christmas tree.
These very fantasy like, slow motion; whimsical, a little detached from reality shots of the boy striving to find the true friends as he remembers but not clearly enough. The girl friend is a manikin through most of the video, symbolizing how girls grow less honest of themselves around old friends in awkward meetings, and at the climax of the song she becomes real as he finally finds the way to see her the same again.
Now the climax of the song and at an abandoned closed down establishment the two stand together, Just beginning to speak, suddenly a car turns towards them, the headlights blinding bright. From this point on, several flashes, like camera flashes, creating a sense of the clock getting faster and slowing down to normal at the end of the video.
Finally, we see a close up of the character's hands reaching for on another, silloutted by a bright headlight.
This image fades to “The End” written in Christmas lights.

'''Summarizing'''

A music video treatment is the starting point of every project. It allows the production company to communicate its ideas to the artists and it allows artists to make decisions regarding the direction of their video. The treatment also helps production companies to write production budgets that are accurate and that give artists a complete view of what to expect when embarking on the production of their music video.

Making a film is a group endeavour.  You cannot do it alone and you will need to convince others to come along for the ride.  Sharing your idea for the film and the story of the film is called &quot;pitching&quot; and if you want to be a filmmaker you need to get good at it.

==Hook==

Describe your film in a sentence. Few have done better than the Alien description of &quot;Jaws in space.&quot; But beware - &quot;movie x in setting y&quot; or &quot;movie a meets movie b&quot; descriptions (known as &quot;High Concept&quot;) are becoming cliched. Don't try and force your one-line description into one of these if it doesn't fit.

==Use Descriptive language==

Be as precise as possible with your language. Which is better?

# Amores Perros opens with a shot of a dog. 
# Amores Perros opens with a shot of a slavering pit bull terrier.

When pitching &lt;b&gt;a film&lt;/b&gt; you need to use visual language.  Make the audience of your pitch &quot;see&quot; the film you are describing - sell the sizzle not the steak.

There’s no great mystery to scouting good locations for a film. There’s no template that tells you exactly how to do it, either. Many of the requirements for a location will be in the script. Finding them is down to marshalling your resources. If you know the area where you are looking, you are well on your way, If you don’t, a good starting point is people who do know it well.

Start with the local film commission. It is their job to attract films to their area and not just big budget films. You may be shooting on a shoestring today, but what about next time? Film commissions are keen to generate future film spend, so they will always be willing to help you stretch today’s pennies so you will be keen to come back. Their collective body is the Association of Film Commissioners International, found at http://www.afci.org/ Their website is a mine of location information and their on-line magazine “Locations” is packed with features on places where film has been shot all over the world.

When we were locating King’s Ransom in Newcastle Upon Tyne, Northern Film Commission were delighted to assist. From notifying them of what we had in mind to the day we wrapped at the last location, they did everything we asked of them and more. They emailed photographs of possible locations from their photo archive before our first recce and then spent recce days with us getting firmer and firmer ideas of what we were looking for. You will find them at www.nsc.org.uk

Their suggestions were always pertinent and they would follow up with calls to local estate agents to establish baseline property rental costs for us before we negotiated with location owners. Until we got a local production office established NFC acted as local referral point for everyone contacting us. Nearer the shoot they also helped us find local crew.

Other people who can come up with useful location suggestions include tourist offices, jobbing builders, delivery people and local council officials. When we needed to find a tidal watersplash scene for a pursuit sequence involving 4X4s, we asked the local Landrover club. They not only knew the places where you could drive Landrovers safely through the tide, but they knew which rivers you could drive up with a Landrover as well! Useful people to know. Their members also have 4X4s for rent as picture and action vehicles.

Draw up a standard location form on which all essential information can be recorded. It is a good idea to attach a sketch plan showing the location layout, access points, fire hydrants, water main, parking areas and so on. Also space for all the phone numbers of contacts people for that location. You will also need to make a risk assessment for the location, of which more later.

Having homed in on some likely prospects you have to consider aesthetics.

The location has to be able to meet the needs of the scene. Will it shoot just as it is, or will it have to be dressed for the part? In King’s Ransom, Mr Bright’s antique shop was in a former cinema and the entrance we needed to use looked like the emergency exit from a cinema rather than the entrance to an antique shop. The broad pavement outside dressed nicely with large antique pieces like a huge wooden mangle. A fresh painted trading title and a couple of pavement advertising boards turned the place into Bright’s antique warehouse and the location exterior looked fine.

==Location checklist==
* Sound
** Will the location be quiet during your shoot dates?
** Check with the local authority to ensure no building work will be running whilst you're filming.
** What are the acoustics like?
** If unsure, ask the sound recordist to check out the location.
* Available light
** Daylight?
*** Can you clean the windows?
*** In which direction do the windows face?
*** During which hours of the day do you get direct sunlight through the windows?
** Can you swap out the flourescent tubes for colour-corrected tubes?
* Power.
** can you tie into the local mains powersupply?
** is it OK for you to use a generator?
*** check out the legal requirements for storing fuel.
*** Will people mind the noise of a generator?
*** where can you get fuel from?
*** Will the generator run on red diesel?
* Parking
** How much will it cost?
** Where can you park the vehicles so they won't be in shot?
* Check where you can and can not put gaffer tape.
* And, most importantly, does the location suit the script?!?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''This Module is part of the [[Movie Making Manual]] [[w:wikibook|wikibook]]'''

Taken from wikipedia as starting point...please edit to make more relevant to filmmakers....

Super 8mm film is a motion picture film format that was developed in the 1960s by Eastman Kodak as an improvement of the older 8mm home movie format. The film, 8mm wide, comes in plastic cartridges containing a 50-foot reel (about 3 minutes, depending on the film speed). Color stocks were available only in tungsten (3200K), and cameras were required to come with a built-in daylight filter, allowing for both indoor and outdoor shooting.

Amateur usage of Super 8 has been largely replaced by video, but the format is sometimes used by professionals trying to imitate the look of old home movies, or create a stylishly grainy look. Many independent filmmakers such as Derek Jarman have made extensive use of 8mm film with remarkable results, and it appears to have made something of a minor comeback in both the art and experimental film world. Oliver Stone, for example, loves to use it in his more recent films, such as The Doors Natural Born Killers, Nixon, U Turn, and JFK where his DP Robert Richardson employed it to evoke period or to give a different look to setups within a scene.

Until 1999, the University of Southern California's famous School of Cinema-Television required students to shoot their initial projects using Super 8, but the dwindling availability of equipment and processing facilities eventually forced the school to switch these classes to Digital Video. However the film is still used elsewhere by film students who wish to learn the basics of shooting film.

Super 8 is supplied in a light proof cartridge, the design of which allows it to be inserted into a camera without directly threading the film, which made the format even more user-friendly.

Kodak (as of 2004) still manufactures several color and black-and-white Super 8 films, and even introduced new emulsions since year 2002. The most popular Kodak stocks usually have been either Kodachrome or Ektachrome, and usually tend to be quite slow, usually around ISO 25, although there are known stocks that go up to ISO 100 and higher.

The Japanese company Fuji produced another variant called Single 8. The film was exactly the same as Super 8, but used a different design of magazine.

You can shoot on 16mm very cheaply if you want. If you wish to shoot on film, here's one way of doing that (prices are for the UK):

==Stock==

# Get yourself some [[Movie Making Manual/Short Ends|short ends]] AKA free film.
# Run the stock through a dip test to find out which cans are dud and which are usable.

==Camera hire==
Most large rental houses have some very nice people in them who are willing to lend cheapskates like us a decent 16mm camera kit for virtually nothing.  Just be honest with them - tell them you've done everything you can to raise the money and promise them a screen credit. Be VERY nice to them.  You could get an Arri SRII, with a set of primes and a handful of glass filters for around UKP 100 - 200 for a WEEK.  Try to avoid shooting in summer though as all the film students will be using the kit.  And remember to budget for transport - all those flight cases are very heavy and large.  And for God's sake CHECK every bit of kit before it leaves the camera floor and when you return it.  And I don't mean just check you've got the right number of boxes - look inside each box and tick off every cable, bolt and filter - I almost got myself in UKP 35,000 of debt because the camera hire company claimed we'd forgotten to return the remote control for the dolly (it turned out they'd screwed up and sent it to the wrong place - but I wasn't sure because we hadn't checked properly).

If you're really skint then try to blag a 16mm camera from your local film society or school.  Or, even better, find a Director of Photography who owns their own camera and persuade them of the genius of your script.

And budget for insurance!  No camera hire company will give you the kit without insurance.  Insurance for UKP 100,000 worth of kit for a week should cost around UKP 150 - 250.  Shop around for insurance - the premiums vary by about 200% between insurers.

==Developing==
8p per foot is probably the cheapest anyone will develop it.  (400ft of Super 16mm = 11 minutes at 25 fps ... so, if your running time is 10 minutes and you're using a 10:1 shooting ratio, that's 100 min of stock, which equals 3636 foot of Super 16mm, which comes to a cost of UKP 330.

==Telecine==
Return again to your bible (The Knowledge).  Find the chapter on [[Movie Making Manual/Post-production/Telecine|Telecine]].  Phone them and ask, very nicely, if they have any trainee [[Movie Making Manual/Post-production/Telecine|telecine]] operators who wouldn't mind scanning your film during down-time in return for a generous volume of their favourite drink and a special thanks on the credits.  Most will reply &quot;no&quot; or &quot;sure, that'll be £400 per hour&quot;.  But some will say &quot;not a problem, come round next Tuesday evening and we'll se what we can do&quot;.

See also the &quot;Amateur Telecine of Super 8mm Footage&quot; guide in the Telecine section for a cost-free telecine method. Before some wiseguys rush to say that the method is useless, I would like to make clear that this is an AMATEUR method, suggested for personal, non-critical usage only, not for professional use! And if one follows all the steps EXACTLY, he/she will get very good results. After all, it is free, trying it won't hurt...

==Guestimate budget==
So, a rough camera hire and filmstock budget for a week's shoot for a 10 min short would be:

UKP 100 dip tests + UKP 200 camera hire + UKP 200 insurance + UKP 330 developing + UKP 50 alcohol for TK opp = UKP 880.

The adage &quot;It's not what you know but who you know.&quot; is probably closest to being true in film. Writers need producers, directors need cinematographers and editors, actors need directors, everyone needs actors, producers need everyone.

This is the most collaborative of all creative mediums and the personnel often change from project to project - producers especially need a large network of contacts to succeed. Do not despair if you don't have a large pool of contacts as meeting, getting to know people, and turning casual contacts into useful ones are skills which can be learned. What you know actually determines who you know.

Although we all try to network, many of us in the industry could be better at it. This article is primarily written for producers but everyone from actors to zoom operators will find it useful.

=Why Network?=

Why make films? Why tell stories? We are filmmakers because we have something to communicate. Communication implies other people.

Perhaps in certain fields of human endeavour one can become successful through skill and talent alone - maybe seismologists don't need many relationships with others. For filmmakers however, social skills are as important as creative ones and to be effective in the industry it is necessary to assidiously develop both.

To work, raise money or get any recognition we must establish professional relationships within the industry, networking is the most effective ways to start off these relationships. For some people networking comes naturally but most of us have to work at it, and work at it we should for our careers may well depend on it..

=What is Networking?=

Having lunch? Speaking on the phone a lot? Using friends to find work? Using acquaintances to find work? An excuse to socialise rather than finish that difficult treatment?

Networking is not only about meeting people but also about building trust with those people and making effective use of our relationships with them. It is not good enough to briefly meet Steven Soderberg at an event and then send him a script - he probably gets that a lot . Networking is about building a *relationship* and to do that you need to help people.

The key to networking is helping people, selfish people are very poor networkers. If you are possessive about your time and contacts you will fail at it.

If for example you have a contact in Greek Television and you meet someone who happens to be making a film with a Greek actor - pass the contact on, the person you met will remember you and be more inclined to help you later.
Some help you can give people:

* Supply information
* Supply introductions
* Give ideas and advice
* Give personal support
* Give free or discounted services

An effective skill to learn is how to spot opportunities for others. Every offer we turn down as inappropriate may be perfect for someone else in our network. To quote Dale Carnegie, &quot;You can make more friends in two months by becoming really interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.&quot;. This is just another way of saying that the way to make a friend is to be one.

Networking is not a game so don't keep score. I once asked a friend who has been in the business a lot longer than I for an introduction and was stunned by the response, &quot;No you haven't really done enough for me to justify my giving that away.&quot;. This business moves in cycles and those down and out today may well be in a Tarantino film tomorrow.

=Who to Network With=

It is tempting to network with those people who we have a lot of common ground with and spend more time with them, forming close friendships. While it is wonderful and crucial to have friends it is only by reaching out to those who we may not have much in common with initially that we will actually build our networks.

These so-called &quot;Weak Ties&quot; are important because friends are likely to be exposed to the same sources of information as us and therefore don't have fresh news or relationships outside our circles. Those with whom we don't have huge amounts in common with will have access to other groups of people and other sources of information.

Don't network with dodgy geezers or dilettantes - they will sully the reputations we are busy building. A crucial element of networking is building and maintaining trust and nearly all effective networkers are held in high regard by their peers and have exacting ethical standards.

Selectivity is important in other ways. We will spend a lot of time helping our network of contacts so time is best spent on those who:

* Are good at what they do
* Understand networking and are willing to enter into the spirit of a mutually beneficial relationship

=Effective Networking=

Don't help one person by placing a burden on another, look for win-win situations.

I once made passing contact with a high level staff member working for Soros Private Equity (Venture Capital) and then promptly emailed him the CV of my friend who was looking for a job with a VC. This was premature. A better tactic would have been to, over some time, give him info about events in the high tech market he may have not spotted. This could have got him feeling obliged and relying on my information at which point I could have asked him to meet with my friend who was looking for a job in VC.

* If a contact shares interesting information that merits passing on we must ask how confidential it is.
* Always ask permission before passing on a contact's personal details.
* Let the person who gave us the information know the outcome of their introduction.
* If things work out show our appreciation.
* If we cannot help or pass on information explain why.

=Networking Online=

By subscribing to online groups and better yet contributing to them it is possible to make many useful contacts and perhaps even be remembered in face-to-face meetings.
Networking At Events

Remember that most of the others at an event feel just as out of place and uncomfortable as we do, try a conversation opener to break the ice. Closed question which supply the answer (&quot;Busy tonight isn't it?&quot;, &quot;You early too?&quot;) are nonthreatening and work well, this should be followed with an introduction and a business card.

To join groups of people conversing hang about next to the group and spot who's doing most of the talking (If I'm there chances are it will be me!) and when the opportunity arises ask that person a question, you will soon be included in the conversation.

It sometimes feels like we should meet as many people as possible but flitting from group to group is ineffective. Better is to concentrate on making a couple of meaningful connections at each event this will soon expand our networks.

=Networking Tools=

Whether it's a palm pilot, a mobile phone, a super rolodex or an ipod it is a good idea to use a system to keep lists of contacts current and backed up - digital is easier but not essential. A back up or a photocopy of the contact file is critical - knowing George Clooney is no good without his phone number.

To keep up contact with many people some form of system is essential. Recommending a specific system is beyond the scope of this essay but consider investing in good address book software or some form of CRM system and update and organise lists regularly. Like going to the gym updates are best if done regularly at a scheduled time.

Uber-networker Harvey Mackay organises his contacts daily and spends one Sunday per month going through his (thousands of) contacts, reconnecting with some and pruning others.
Business Cards

You need business cards - they are inexpensive, Printing Direct made me 250 full colour cards for £50.00, their prices start from £24.00. Having cards immediately raises your level of professionalism.

'''The Production Process'''

The following outline is intended to give you, the reader, a brisk walkthrough of what film and television production entails. You should not consider these steps exhaustive and must keep in mind that each production differs from the next, based on many factors. To confuse things further, these definitions differ from country to country. Many of the following definitions, for example, come from the US and mainland European industries and differ from the UK. Read and enjoy.

==Conceptualization==
The beginning of the process. Here the idea germinates. Investors and/or the conceptualizers usually finance this first stage, principally because it doesn't cost anything.

===Project development=== 
The conceptualizers, which may be a single writer planning a spec script or a producer or syndicate, put the broad outlines of their project in place. If they have started the idea from scratch, they write a [[w:Film_treatment|treatment]] to present the idea to others, followed by the writing of the full script. If they got the idea from a book or story, they seek to purchase the film rights and, once they have a signed contract, begin to convert the story into a script. 

Sometimes a director or producer will approach a writer with an idea. They hire the writer under a &quot;work-for-hire&quot; contract, meaning that the rights to the developed script remain with the person who provides the idea and the money to develop it. Professionals will usually provide the writer with a registered treatment of at least 3 pages outlining the story in detail. People new to the industry will simply tell the writer the idea in a few words. The writer will go off and turn the idea into 90-120 pages of plot, characters, dialogue, and action.

===Production Design===
The art director, production designer and/or producers decide on the overall feel of the production. This has a huge effect on the script breakdown.

===Script Breakdown=== 
The Production Designer and the producers dissect the script to identify how many of everything they need; i.e. actors, locations, visual and computer effects, props &amp; costumes.

===Crewing up===
The producers design a basic timeline and make initial wish-lists on actors, head crew members (director, director of photography (DP), gaffer, sound, visual effects designer, computer effects designer, editor and musician), locations and equipment as it affects format (b&amp;w or colour film, video or digital video)

==Finance==
This stage runs concurrently with conceptualization but can only really reflect actual needs after the script breakdown and production design stages have finished.

===Budget=== 
This tries to take into account all expenses for the entire venture based on results from the script breakdown and production design as well as budgets from similar projects. The line producer (someone familiar with filming in a particular geographical region) usually does the initial budget.

===Investors=== 
At this stage the project requires a second level of investors to commit to the project to carry it through to completion. The art of deal-making rules this stage. A good producer can raise millions based on how well they understand the distribution and exhibition controls in the industry. Small productions rely on smaller, non commercial forums of funding.

===Market analysis===
The producers and distributors clearly define the market at this stage.


==Pre-production==
Once the line producer completes the initial script breakdown, supplying the budget and schedule for the production, the initial meetings take place with the people involved and all the producers make all the 'final' decisions for the production. The line producer prepares the final budget and schedule during pre-production. Sometimes the 1st assistant director prepares the schedule with the line producer.

===First meetings=== 
The producers and crew heads meet to determine if they feel comfortable working together. As each has very different styles of working this meeting stage can make or break the production. Also the director usually meets with the major actors, determining if (s)he feels the actors need rehearsal time, or training (athletic, martial arts, military, medical, etc.) to play their roles.

===Locations=== 
The production team (in coordination with the art department) secures locations for the shoot. They determine time-frames and iron out all potential problems (seasonal traffic, weather, etc.) If the production shoots on a sound stage, the set design and construction begins.

===Props &amp; special effects===
The special effects team and the art department determine what they need to build, buy or borrow (miniature models, multiple vehicles for stunts and explosions, effects make-up, aged props and building, set dressings, etc.).

==Production== 
The executive producer gives the money to the producer to make the motion picture.  The producer hires the director who will control the performance of the actors.  The producer hires the cinematographer (director of photography) who will capture the performance of the actors on film or digitally.  The producer hires a production manager (or line producer) who then hires all the workers (the crew) for the filming of the motion picture.  The producer or the production manager will hire the sound recordist (sound mixer) who will capture the dialog of the actors.  The producer and the director select the actors for the motion picture with the assistance of a casting director.    Each day on the movie set, the actors and crew turn into reality the planning of the production.  '''On the set: Lights, Camera, Action!'''

'''Head crew''' &lt;br&gt;
Directors and assistant directors, script supervisor and location manager.

'''Camera department'''&lt;br&gt;
Director of photography, camera operator, camera assistants and focus pullers.

'''Lighting/electrical department''' &lt;br&gt;
Gaffer, best boy electric and electricians (sparks).

'''Grip department''' &lt;br&gt;
Key grip, dolly grip, best boy grip, rigging grips and grips.

'''Sound department''' &lt;br&gt;
Sound mixer, sound assistants and boom.

'''Art department''' &lt;br&gt;
Art director, prop manager, painters, set dressers, and construction crew.

'''Make-up/hair department''' &lt;br&gt;
Make up artist, hair designer, special effects make-up designer and assistants.

'''Wardrobe/costume department''' &lt;br&gt;
Costume designer (not on set), wardrobe manager, and dressers.

'''Visual effects department''' &lt;br&gt;
Visual effects supervisor and support crew.

'''Production department''' &lt;br&gt;
Production manager (not on set), production coordinator, and production assistants (PAs).

'''Support crew'''&lt;br&gt;
Medical, transport, catering, personal assistants, still photography, and behind-the-scenes videographers.

==Post Production==
On completion of filming (and even while it still continues) the editing team goes to work to start cutting the project together.  If you are interested in learning how to do these steps using your personal computer, see the [[Movie Making Manual/Education|Teach Yourself Filmmaking]] section.

===Developing /Dailies/Logging===
Every night during shooting of the motion picture, the film reels and the sound reels are sent to the lab. The film is developed and circle takes printed onto film or telecined onto video tape.  Then the audio is synced with the picture to create the dailies.  Or to explain it another way: The dailies are created by combining the visual image (from the motion picture camera or from the DV Camcorder) with the audio (the dialog) from the sound recorder.  To begin post production, a copy of these dailies are converted into the formatted required by the film editor and logged. On film, this is known as the '''work print'''. The editor never works with the original negative which scratches too easily. For digital films, this is called the off-line edit which is lower resolution than the original images which saves disk space and speeds up playback. For bigger films, logging means that information about every piece of film and every bit of audio must be entered into a huge database which is accessible by the entire post production staff.

===Editing===
Building the scenes to tell a story. Nowadays, non-linear editing using computers has become the norm (Avid, [[Final Cut Pro]], ...)  The editor works closely with the sound effects department and the film scoring person to bring the maximum impact to the movie.  For action sequence, the scene will be edited based on the visual images, the music and the sound effects.  For conversations, the editor must cut to get the best quality dialog... as well as to worry how the music and sound effects will affect the scene.

===ADR===
Editors must re-record dialogue that cannot be salvaged from production in a process called '''looping''', '''[[w:dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]]''', or '''ADR'''. ADR stands for either Additional Dialogue Recording, or Automated Dialogue Replacement, depending on whom you ask. But don't ask why the A sometimes stands for Automated, because there's nothing particularly automatic about the process. An actor watches the image repeatedly while listening to the original production track on headphones as a guide. The actor then re-performs each line to match the wording and lip movements. 

Actors vary in their ability to achieve sync and to recapture the emotional tone of their performance. Marlon Brando, for example, was said to enjoy looping because he didn't like to freeze a performance until he knew its final context. (People have said that he mumbled during his on-camera performances to make the production sound unusable, so that he can make adjustments in looping.) 

ADR is a necessary evil when production sound is unusable, but directors can also use it to add new character or interpretation to a shot. By altering a few key words or phrases an actor can change the emotional bent on a scene.

===Sound Effects===
The sound effects (including the [[w:foley|Foley]], [[w:walla|Walla]], &amp; Ambience) make a scene seem '''real'''. Without the addition of sound effects, a scene would feel like it was filmed on a studio sound stage... which it probably was.  Sound effects recorded by a sound effects person are rarely used as is.  Instead, sound effects are &quot;sweetened&quot; and enhanced.

====Foley====
A sound effects technique for synchronous effects or live effects.  Foleying supplies the subtle sounds that production mikes often miss. The rustling of clothing and a squeak of a saddle when a rider mounts his horse give a scene a touch of realism that filmmakers find difficult to provide using other effects methods.   
The good Foley artist must &quot;become&quot; the actor with whom they sync effects or the sounds lack the necessary realism to convince the audience.  
Most successful Foley artists are audiles; they can look at an object and imagine what type of sound it can be made to produce.  The foley crew include the artist or &quot;walker,&quot; who makes the sound, and a technician or two to record and mix it.  
A foley stage often appears as a storage area for the studio's unwanted junk. Metal laundry tubes filled to the brim with metal trays, tin pie plates, empty soda cans, hubcaps, bedpans, knives, forks and broken staple guns. They use these crash tubes  for anything from comedy crashes to adding presence (brightness and naturalness) to something as serious as a car crash.

====Walla====
Walla is the indistinguishable mutterings of people in a crowd.  It takes a special skill to create a series of intelligible words with no clear meaning.

====Ambience====
Unlike sound for television dramas, a motion picture normally records only the dialog (the spoken words) during production.  All the other sounds are created in post production.  This gives greater freedom when editing the dialog.  Therefore, the natural sounds of the environment need to be added.  This is especially true if the scene was recorded on a sound stage at the motion picture studio where the background sounds are never natural or realistic.  The sound of the environment is the '''ambience''' and must be recorded in a real location.  Even though ambience is very soft in the background, a scene will feel flat without it.

Ambience is also sometimes referred to as &quot;room tone.&quot;

===Musical Scoring=== 
The musical score and the musical sound effects create the '''mood''' for each scene.  Writing the music for film and TV requires special skills from the composers, musicians and sound engineers; they all need a flair for the dramatic and the ability to envision sound. Even though the actors' voices adds a kind of music to a scene as they speak, adding additional music is often necessary to create the proper mood.  
It is often the director who tells the film's composer what moods he wants the audience to feel during the action and the dialog in the motion picture.

===Visual Effects=== 
Visual effects are any element which was not captured during filming that must be created later.  This can be done by computers (CGI) or by matte paintings.  When two or more elements must be combined (such as live actor shots with computer generated effects), the images are composited.

====CGI====
CGI stands for Computer Generated Imagery. This term refers to any element created within a computer and encompasses anything from adding digital fog to a scene, to generating a crowd at a stadium, to creating whole characters, completely animated, such as Gollum from the Lord of the Rings films. 

====Matte Painting====
Matte Paintings were originally hand-painted scenery on glass which was photographed along with the live action.  When using a matte painting which has been painted on clear glass, the matte painting sits in front of the camera while the actors perform on a partial movie set which can be seen through a clear spot on the matte painting.  The rest of the movie set is simply the painting.  Now Matte Paintings are created with hand painting, paintings using computer software, still image manipulation, and/or 3D models which have been rendered, and then the matte painting is combined with the live action by compositing in post production, rather than during the filming of the movie.

====Titling====
Filmmakers consider designing the opening and closing credits to a film or TV piece  as an art and skill in itself. Nowadays people's whole careers can consist only of designing titles for major motion pictures and television series.

====Compositing====
When separate visual elements on film are combined, this is called '''opticals'''.  
With computers and digital images, this is called compositing which is just like combining pictures with Photoshop.

===Conforming the Negative===
Once all the post production is finished and a working edit of the movie is completed and approved, the negative must be cut to match the working edit of the movie.  Only after the negative is conformed is the movie is ready for viewing in a theater (usually at a film festival) where the motion picture will be seen by the public (and potential distributors) for the first time.
If the motion picture was made with digital images, the movie must be rendered at full resolution (the on-line edit) and transferred to film.  If there will be a digital intermediary, the digital version or a digitized version of the conformed negative is color corrected and then rendered onto film.

==Sales &amp; Marketing==
===Distribution===
If the project has distributors on-board from the beginning, this process requires little more than sitting back on the part of the producers and investors, as the distributors practice their trade. However if the producers have not pre-sold the distribution rights, this can entail going to film festivals and/or door-to-door selling to TV, cable stations or video/DVD distributors.

====Delivery====
Once the motion picture has been sold to a distributor, the distributor will spell out exactly the elements that she requires to accept the film. Then the filmmaker goes back and prepares all these elements.  For very low budget movies, this can cost more than the entire production and includes such odd things as insurance policies for '''errors and omissions''' and a sound track for the motion picture which has been divided into three separate parts - Dialog, Music and Effects.  It is the distributor who will create all the foreign language versions of the motion picture and make all the necessary cuts and reedits to the motion picture to get it acceptable for foreign markets.

===Publicity material===
Marketing also requires the design of posters, audio &amp; visual trailers and merchandise. Special staff, like graphic artists and voice-over characters, work to produce these invaluable tools.   It is the distributor who creates the DVD-Video disk so the distributor must create the special features and publicity for the DVD-Video disk.  Hopefully, the production company has created and saved the necessary items need for the publicity such as '''production stills''' and '''documentaries''' for the DVD-Video disk.

{{stub}}

Clint Eastwood never shouts &quot;action!&quot;, as he thinks it shocks actors and disturbs their concentration. Instead, he waits until the camera is rolling, and then says, &quot;when you're ready...&quot;

If you have done the casting correctly and your actor has the ability - let them express it. An actor will respond far better if they are given a degree of freedom to bring their creativity to the process.  A good director will encourage this without, however, letting it go too far.  The challenge here is to find the balance between allowing the actor to express themselves and serving the scene. The scene is part of a greater whole and their performance should be in balance with the other elements of the film.

==Casting Actors==

Next to having a great screenplay and a clear vision, casting great actors is the best thing you can do to improve the odds of your film succeeding. Casting good actors is 80% of the directing process because once you have cast actors who understand what they are doing, the director's job is almost done. [http://preproduction.4filmmaking.com/casting-actors.html External reference on Auditioning and Casting actors]

==Inexperienced Actors== 

Inexperienced actors nearly always err on the side of overacting, putting too much into the role.  Your task is often to convince them to be more naturalistic. Be clear and don't baffle them with technical terms. Explain how tight the shot is and their range of movement within the frame and they should be able to gauge how to behave.
One very effective way to get truthful acting from inexperienced actors is to let them improvise their own lines around a specifically designed situation. It works! Guaranteed.

Another rule of thumb is to compliment generally, but criticize specifically.  For example, telling an actress that you liked how she flipped her hair will cause her to do it again and again in subsequent takes, and it won't look as natural as it did the first time.  Just tell her how great she did and hopefully she'll unconsciously continue what she was doing.  However, you will want to be precise (but gentle) when pointing out the things you are certain you do not want.

Discourage the invention of backstories. They waste time. An inexperienced actor will either forget them entirely in the heat of the moment, or struggle to rationalise their performance, as they try to give it, by reference to some invented fact that is not in the screenplay, so that the performance cannot flow convincingly. Or, in other words: [s]he WILL overact, whatever you do to prevent it.

==Troubleshooting==

These tricks should be a last resort; the best way to work is through honest and open communication.  Being sneaky can sometimes lose you the trust of your cast.

There is a great story about an actor who was so nervous he was having trouble remembering his lines and was getting flustered. The director gave him a coin to flip and asked him to keep flipping it throughout the scene. This successfully made the actor less self conscious and the scene flowed after that.

If an actor continually overdoes it, quietly start the camera, keep it rolling and do a &quot;walkthrough&quot; of the scene.  Some of the footage might be quite usable.

Another tip: use action words to describe how you want the actor to play the scene. &quot;Play the scene as if you're begging your son to clean his room&quot; is different than &quot;play the scene as if you're threatening your son to clean his room&quot;.

The most intriguing part of movie making is music. Music is an essential component of any typical movie. Imagine a movie without sound - awful, isn't it?!

Different genres of movie adopt different music styles, for instance, soft music for a romantic comedy, crazy music for a comedy or jarring music for horror movies.

In the history of movie making, there are several examples of movies which were blockbusters, just because of the music! There are also many cases where movies have flunked due to poor music composition.

Music gives a mesmerizing spirit to the movie!

==What Is Editing?==

Editing is the process of choosing which picture and sounds will go into the finished film.  Initially this includes picking what is good and what is bad, removing the poor material and putting it into script order.  Later it also includes the creation and control of moments that may or may not have been intended during the shoot (see below).  This page deals primarily with picture editing, and the Sound Design module may be found [[Movie_Making_Manual/Sound_Design|here]].

==How do I edit a Film?==

What follows describes the typical process of editing a scripted drama.

===Logging and Assembly===
Watch and listen to all the material.  In a notebook make a log of your reactions to them and any ideas that pop into your head.  Use timecode to link your thoughts to specific shots and do not be fooled into thinking you will remember these thoughts later.
For a long project the first edit will be a simple version consisting of all the wide shots strung together.  This assembly will contain the fewest number of edits required to tell the story.  The assembly edit allows you to get a sense of the project as a whole before you begin to focus on the specifics.

===The First Rough Cut===
Now the rough cut begins.  Taking one scene at a time begin to work through all the takes so as to find the best, most consistent material.  The scenes may be cut in any order and the point is to let each scene work on its own.  When you have a good working version of a scene swap it into the assembly so the cut gradually builds in complexity.  Be sure to save versions of your edit several times a day so as to keep a record of all choices made.

Throughout the rough cut be careful to keep the sync sound together with its picture.  Do begin to mute or delete unneeded audio, but don’t bother putting in any additional sounds yet.  The first rough cut is completed when each scene has been looked at individually, and placed into the edit.

Take the opportunity for a break, overnight if possible, and view the cut without stopping.  Afterward take your notebook and begin to re-view the film, stopping to make notes of changes you’d like to try.  For a feature film this process can take many hours.

===The Main Edit===
Now the process of approaching a fine cut begins.  Scenes will have individual problems, and now that they are all part of one film, issues will become clear that are inter-dependent between scenes.  This stage of the edit can be difficult as some problems can seem unsolvable.  Be sure to keep moving.

Key sound effects and music may be introduced at this stage, and the complexity will grow.  Be sure to try out lots of ideas, secure in the knowledge that each version is safely saved and may be returned to if necessary.  The stage when a rough cut becomes a fine cut is not exact, but is often when the editor feels each idea has been fully explored.

Bring in others to watch your fine cut.  Merely sitting next to someone new while watching your film can bring out problems in the edit you have previously missed.  Pay careful attention to any questions they ask.  Even apparently casual queries can reveal holes in the storytelling that you and your team have missed or unsuccessfully tried to solve.  

===The Fine Cut===
You haven’t finished cutting until several new viewers have seen the edit and you’ve worked with the problems raised.  If there are major issues that are never quite dealt with then now is the time that you must be bravest with the material and experiment boldly.  It can mean going back to rough cut stage with a scene or two.

Fine cutting itself is the process of getting down to perfect frame accuracy for every single edit in the film, of making sure each moment flows as best it can.  Don’t bother working at this level of detail until all story issues have been satisfactorily solved.  
Once the fine cut is approved the picture is considered locked and no further changes will occur.  The project will move into full [[Movie_Making_Manual/Sound_Design|sound post]] and the editor’s work is done.  Back up all the project files.  You’re done.

==How Do I Edit a Scene?==

Look at the '''new''' section for [[Movie Making Manual/Scene Editing|How To Edit a Dramatic Scene]].  In this section, you will learn the specific details of creating the '''rough edit''' for a conversation and then creating '''L Cut''' and adding '''Cut Away Shots''' to obtain the maximum impact for a conversation.

==Software &amp; Equipment==

Films are edited almost exclusively off-line using computer-based editing systems.  These Non-Linear Editors (NLEs) allow for fast experimentation with ideas and the saving of multiple versions of films.  Although the basics of editing require only cuts and dissolves, commonly NLEs include tools for [[Movie_Making_Manual/Colour_Grading|colour grading]], [[w:Chromakey|keying]], speed effects and sound mixing.

These programs allow you to import raw digital video footage from many types of files, or to record in from tape.  You can then edit the video using a timeline, which is where the story is built up.  The program then allows you to play out the final edit onto tape, or to export the edited video in the form of a digital video file.

==A Short History of the Craft of Editing==

Editing is unique amongst the creative arts.  At the beginning of cinema at the end of the 1800s, there were writers, actors, directors, producers, set designers, musicians and choreographers all from the stage.  Even use of the new technology, the motion picture camera, was a straightforward step from stills photography.  But there were no editors.  Those that share the name, literary editors, share some of the concerns of film editors such as story and coherence, but in film parlance they are more akin to producers than editors.

===Origins===
Then one day a gentleman was filming a street scene and the camera jammed, as those hand-made machines did quite regularly.  After fixing the problem the filmmaker continued to film the street.  On developing the film, he discovered that a carriage in the centre of the road seemed to disappear before his very eyes.  Much enamoured with this trick, he used it to great effect and other filmmakers copied the technique.  This was the first known edit.

===As a Special Effect===
Among the finest exponents of this new technique was a stage magician named [[w:George_Melies|George Melies]] who created such lavish fantasies a ''La Voyage Dans La Lune''.  It was the Titanic of its day, of great length, with astonishing special effects, excitement, laughter and tense drama.  In it, cuts are used more often as an effect device than in the narrative sense that we are used to today.

===Telling a Story===
It was the American [[w:Edwin_Porter|Edwin S. Porter]] who created the first cinematic narrative box-office hit ''The Great Train Robbery''.  Although scenes were still largely played in long shot as if performed on a stage, the scenes of the hero riding to the rescue were intercut with scenes of the girl being terrorised by the hoodlums.  Narrative editing had begun!

===New Russian Ideas===
Russia is our next stop in the history of editing.  In Russia in the teens and twenties filmmakers such as [[w:Dziga_Vertov|Vertov]], [[w:Lev_Kuleshov|Kuleshov]] and [[w:Sergei_Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] experimented with editing styles.  The influence of Vertov’s apparently random connection of images can be seen in modern documentaries such as [[w:Koyaanisquatsi|Koyaanisquatsi]] and [[w:Baraka_%28film%29|Baraka]].  Eisenstein's almost brutal editing of images looked forward to the editing of today's action blockbusters and Kuleshov managed to codify Russian Montage Theory (or Intellectual Montage) to demonstrate how editing, through juxtaposition, creates meaning from two or more separate pieces of film.

In a [[w:Kuleshov_Experiment|famous experiment]], Kuleshov showed how by cutting from a man’s face to a bowl of hot food, the emotion of hunger was conveyed to the audience.  These two shots had not been filmed at the same time and so it was entirely through editing their meaning was created. Now the real magic happened.  Kuleshov used a close-up of the same actor and cut it with a pretty girl, showing affection.  It was in fact the ''exact'' same shot of the actor that the audiences were interpreting as two different performances.  Kuleshov had demonstrated that control of film's meaning lies in the control of the edit.

===The Dominant Style===
[[w:DW_Griffith|D.W. Griffith]] and other pioneers of American Cinema through the 1920s settled into using what is now considered the Classical Narrative style of filmmaking, in which editing aspires to be invisible to the audience.  This style of editing (also known as [[w:Continuity_editing|continuity editing]]) has become so dominant across the world that to use other styles is seen as radical and even anti-commercial.

''Please beware - this page lists some rude terms''

Silly as it may seem, the rating boards of various countries have lists of words and screen content that determine the rating of a movie and whether one can broadcast it publicly. You may want to keep these in mind when writing.

The ratings in the US, Asia, the Middle East and Europe vary, and are mainly based on sexual content. Europe remains the most liberal, followed by - respectively - Asia, the United Kingdom (separate from the rest of Europe), the United States, and the Middle East (which is &lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt; strict, with the exception of Israel).

Here we have a list of some of the general rules of language and content that helps writers/producers avoid the 17 years and up rating in English language films in the US (accepted by most other territories):

The standard regarding violence is that there cannot be any blood movement. This means no blood dripping, exploding or in any way moving from a body if shot, stabbed or hurt in any way.

No nudity allowed including: no visible nipples or genitals, though nowadays the occasional shot of the buttocks or the side of a breast may slip by unnoticed.

UNACCEPTABLE TERMS
* dick head
* shit, eat shit, shitting me, etc
* Jesus, For Christ Sakes or any other insulting refrence to religions
* Brass Balls or any other reference to testicles
* fuck, motherfucker, etc
* cunt
* piss
* cock
* tits
* ass-anything (though &quot;ass&quot; is deemed acceptable)

ACCEPTABLE TERMS
* ass
* son of a bitch (though not in excess)
* hell
* kiss my ass (when used sparingly)
* oh my god (acceptable since ''[[Wikipedia:Friends|Friends]]'')

DVDs have been with us for some time now yet the impact of the new format is just beginning to be felt and its potential just beginning to be explored.

The DVD player has entered the Guinness Book as the &quot;fastest growing paid-for consumer electronics format of all time&quot;. There are now 15 million DVD capable devices in the UK and this year for the first time more films will be watched on DVD than in all the other mediums combined.

&quot;Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism&quot; a direct to DVD documentary about Fox News is currently ranked 3rd on Amazon's DVD sales chart, just behind &quot;The Complete Star Wars Trilogy&quot; boxed set. So far it has sold over 250 000 copies on DVD - its budget was just USD300 000.

In the UK Luke Morris found no takers for the great short film he produced, &quot;J'Taime John Wayne&quot; and so packaged it with 15 other UK shorts to create the excellent Cinema16 UK directors DVD. This proved a such a success it was followed this year by a collection of 16 shorts by European directors on DVD.[2]

Most independent films lose money in the cinema. Prints cost USD5000 each, advertising with only a website, posters and postcards will cost tens of thousands and Exhibitors take a large chunk of revenues. When I say &quot;lose money&quot; I'm even not talking about losing money relative to the film's budget but actually losing money on the release. DVDs have much higher margins and this is where distributors look to recoup their payments.

The current justification for cinema release is that a high profile cinema release is essential if the film is going to do well on DVD. Yet most independent movies get anything but a high profile release, going out on a handful of screens with a marketing campaign consisting of postcards in pubs and posters on a few buses...if you're lucky.

The DVD success of &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; following their lacklustre cinema showings contradict the view that cinema success is crucial to DVD success. If the purpose is marketing the money spent on the theatrical release could probably be spent in a more focused way on selling/promoting the DVD. The problem is no one in the industry really knows how to sell DVDs yet.

For most of us Shooters the viability of a cinema release is a moot point as the budgets we are currently able to raise probably dictate a straight to DVD release anyway. If that is successful we might just be able to raise the capital for something which will go first to the cinema. In order for it to be successful the film needs to be good (of course!) but the DVD release also needs to be handled properly.

This is where the industry is pretty immature.

==What is still needed==

Realistically speaking there should be far more direct to DVD distributors than there are. The costs and infrastructure required for a company distributing DVDs directly are probably similar to those of a small book or music publisher yet there are far fewer small DVD distributors than small music or book publishers. In fact small book and music publishers might be just the people to push the next wave of films going out via direct DVD distribution.

In order to truly take advantage of this shift the industry still needs a number of things:

===Accurate DVD sales figures===

Knowing how many copies of a particular movie are being sold would be invaluable, far more useful than the box office figures. Yet box office figures are readily available while DVD sales figures are not.

Having the sales figures will make it easier to know what kind of budgets are realistic for different films and help immensely with funding plans for ultra-indie features.

===Distributors/Publishers with accessibility to the retail channels===

Sure we can sell from our website and via eBay and Amazon. But people
don't often buy products on a first viewing. Often we see something and
think &quot;That's interesting maybe...&quot; and the actual purchase happens after
a few encounters.

Being able to partner with companies who know how to get our films on the racks at HMV, Virgin, and Waterstones would be very useful.

===Reviews and feedback===

I touched on this last week. The more films are out there the more people are going to rely on trusted reviewers to find out what is worth buying/renting. Support of critics and online reviewers will be crucial in selling our films.

===Innovative Marketing Companies===

Are there any small marketing companies using creative means to sell DVDs? I've not seen any evidence of their work. Is there a company who could actually make something happen on a marketing budget of say GBP30 000? From what I've heard most of the independent firms marketing firms in the UK seem to be tied to the concept of cinema marketing and fairly formulaic in their approaches.

We need companies who can help a direct to DVD film get the attention of its audience. Again independent music promoters (Why have I seen no fly postings for indie DVDs?) and book publishers may have the skills in reaching a niche audience that film marketers have yet to develop.

I think there are still a lot of blanks to be filled in in the DVD distribution ecosystem and a lot of opportunity here. The sooner companies start taking advantage of these opportunities the better it'll be for us.

This is currently seen as a niche, but companies like [[wikipedia:Filmbay]] are already addressing this.

Note:  This section should be called &quot;Film Distribution &amp; Marketing&quot;.

What happens to your motion picture once you are finished?  How does your movie get into the hands of a distributor?  How does the distributor get the movie into the hands of the exhibitor or in the case of video tape/disks, into the hands of retail stores?  And how does the distributor/theater owner convince the public to attend your movie and to buy the tape/disk?

All of this is called &quot;Marketing&quot;.

==Finding a Distributor==

Probably 99% of all the motion picture which are distributed use a distributor.  If a filmmaker cannot find a distributor, the movie will probably never be distributed.  Probably 40% of all movies made never find a distributor.  So don't assume that finding a distributor will be automatic.

The distributor uses the economics of volume to market motion pictures as cheaply as possible.  Even so, the successful motion picture will cost 33% of the final gross just for marketing and distribution.  If you try to distribute the movie yourself, the cost can be far more than the income.

Back when you began to make your movie and you went looking for funding, one of the major options you had was getting a distributor on board early.  Be sure to read Roger Corman's books and notice that he always had a distributor before he began a movie.  It make life so much easier.

A good way to interest a distributor is to have a major star attached to your project.  Currently, the market for motion picture is &quot;Star Driven&quot; which means that the public is attracted to movies which have stars rather than good ideas.

If you cannot get a distributor while you are still in the pre-production stage, your only other practical option is to complete you motion picture and show the movie at film festivals to attract a distributor.

==Self Distribution==

If you want to try to distribute the movie yourself, you must consider your options which are booking directly at a movie theater (either by negotiating a box office split with a theater owner, or renting it for a length of time - also known as &quot;four walling&quot;), [[Movie Making Manual/Distributing Direct|Distributing Direct]], [[Movie Making Manual/Selling Online|Selling Online]], [[Movie Making Manual/Digital Cinema Distribution|Digital Cinema Distribution]], [[Movie Making Manual/Submitting to a broadcaster|Submitting to a broadcaster]], [[Movie Making Manual/Sales and Exhibition/Putting Videos Online|Putting videos online]], [[Movie Making Manual/Burning a DVD|Burning a DVD]]. The process of self distribution is time consuming, requires an additional financial investment, and is a separate business from filmmaking. However, it permits the filmmaker maximal control over how their work is marketed and the highest return on the dollar. An initial successful self distribution of a film can increase the filmmaker's leverage in securing a distribution deal.

==Delivery of the Film to the Distributor==

When you complete your movie and project your movie at a film festival, you movie is not finished yet.  You still do not have all the elements that are needed by the distributor '''before''' the distributor will accept your motion picture. These items are known as deliverables.  Now, you have to worry about technical deliverables (such as separate tracks of music and sound effects, known as M&amp;E Tracks) and legal deliverables (such as obtaining an &quot;Errors and Omissions&quot; insurance policy.)  If you have not planned for this day, you can be in deep trouble.   All of this might cost you more than the cost of filming and editing your motion picture.

==Developing the Campaign==

Finally, we get to the most controversial part of film marketing.  To sell a motion picture (with its huge advertising budget), a campaign must be created to introduce the movie to the public.  The basic questions are, &quot;What is this movie about?&quot; and &quot;Who will want to see this movie?&quot;

In general, many filmmakers and critics at large, do not like the ad campaigns.  But then, they are not paying for any of the millions of dollars that will be spend on the ad campaign.  So they complain and gripe and produce meaningless dribble like this: 

==Get on the Cluetrain==

Markets are conversations. Their members communicate in language that is natural, open, honest, direct, funny and often shocking. Whether explaining or complaining, joking or serious, the human voice is unmistakably genuine. It can't be faked.

Most film blurbs, on the other hand, only know how to talk in the soothing, humorless monotone of the clever line, marketing brochure, and your-call-is-important-to-us busy signal. Same old tone, same old lies. No wonder networked markets have no respect for Studio marketing hype unable or unwilling to speak as they do.

But learning to speak in a human voice is not some trick, nor will studios convince us they are human with lip service about &quot;listening to audiences.&quot; They will only sound human when they empower real human beings to speak on their behalf.

==Marketing the Movie to Exhibitors==

The distributor must somehow interest the theater owners to exhibit the movie in their theaters.

==Marketing the Movie to the Local Audience==

With help from the distributor, the local theater owner will publicize the motion picture before the opening of the movie at the theater.

==Marketing the Movie To Tape Distributors==

The film's distributor does not normally sell the tape or disk of the movie directly to the Mom &amp; Pop video store.  Rather, the distributor must get a specialized distributor to put this in their catalog.  In the USA, there are three major tape/disk distributors for movies to video stores.

==Publicity==

There are many ways to publicize a motion picture or a television drama.  The most common are a movie trailer and a behind-the-scenes documentary.  The movie trailer is the least expensive and the behind-the-scenes movie can be very time consuming if not expensive.

Publicity is done by both the production company and by the distributor.  The still photographs (called appropriately, &quot;stills&quot;) and the behind-the-scenes documentary are paid for by the production company.  But the movie trailer and movie posters are normally paid for by the distributor.  Some production companies in search of a distributor will create their own trailers and posters but once the movie is picked up by a distributor and the advertising campaign is determined, the distributor might still hire one of the many companies in LA which produce trailers for most motion pictures today.

===Income Distribution Considerations - Publicity===

Should a production company help in the publicity for a motion picture?  This is a surprisingly difficult question.

In most cases, the distributor pays the production company a small fee up front for the right to distribute the movie.  Then the production company receives a royalty after sales reach a certain amount.  Therefore, it is beneficial for the production company to help in the publicity.  Also, the cost of the distributor's advertising can often be charged against the income due the production company.  So is it better for the production company to do as much of this as they can.  But once the distributor creates a marketing campaign, they don't want the production company creating a different image for the movie.  And worst of all, all of the rights to most of the publicity material created by the production company is now owned by the film's distributor so the production company can no longer use this material in many cases.

===The Forms of Publicity/Advertisements===

First, you have the tradition forms of publicity and advertisement.

====TV Ads====

Television advertisements are simply the movie trailer.  Therefore, the cost is only for the air time.  This is often the bulk of the cost of publicity for a motion picture.

====Newspaper Ads====

Newspaper advertisements (either paid for by the distributor or by the theater owner) are almost always created by the distributor.

Publicity tours are paid for by the distributor and the actor's contract usually specifies the amount of pay that the actor will receive for doing the tour.  This is particularly useful for film festivals where the movie has won an award.

====Website====

All movies now have websites.

===Editing Workshops = A New Kind of Publicity===

Now there is a new way to publicize a motion picture which is half way between a trailer and a behind-the-scenes documentary.  This new form of publicity is a tour of the movie set and the editing room for just one (1) scene of the movie.  To create this, the film dailies for one scene are turned into a movie which shows the filming of the scene in chronological order showing all the circle takes.  That way, the audience can follow along with the script.  Then a rough edit of the scene is shown followed by the adjustments to the edits and finally the finished scene with a film score.   Once people have seen how the scene was filmed and edited, they can participate in the making of the movie by actually editing the scene on their personal computer.

Currently, there are over 40 million people who have personal computer which are capable of editing digital video but they have nothing exciting to edit.  But this new form of publicity will not take off until computer companies such as Apple Computer get behind it since half the benefit of the Editing Workshop is for people who use the personal computer.

To look at this new way to publicize your upcoming motion picture, visit the [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop] and purchase their '''Technology Demonstration''' disk. This is a fully working example of this new kind of publicity for motion pictures or television dramas.  You can never have enough publicity for your movie.  This is one way which is easy to do, specially if you are editing your movie with Final Cut Pro or similar type of editing program on your computer.  You already have all the elements and you just package them in a user friendly way.

===Film Scoring Workshop = A New Kind of Publicity===

It is also possible to create an entertaining product for people who use GarageBand (which is free will all new Macintosh computers) which is edited scenes without music set up for scoring with GarageBand.  At least 5 million people have GarageBand but still no one has done this.  Look for it in the next year or two.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using a Dictionary==

Foremost, Latin verbs are listed using the '''present indicative first person singular active''' construct of the verb.  For example, to find the meaning of the verb ''amāre'', you must find ''amō'' listed in the dictionary. Some verbs like ''esse'' and ''ferre'' are highly irregular and use different stems to form the perfect tenses.

Nouns are usually much easier. They are always given in the nominative singular. If you see a noun such as ''vōcem'' and do not know what it is, do not fret. If you look for ''voc-'' in the dictionary, you will not find what you are looking for. The ending ''-em'' typically belongs to the third-declension accusative; thus, be aware that third-declension nouns have radically changing stems. Those that have the consonant ''c'' or ''g'' usually have the consonant ''x'' in the nominative singular. Thus the nominative singular of ''vōcem'' is ''vōx'', and ''rēx'' becomes ''rēgem'' in the accusative singular. There are plenty of other simple rules which you will learn through experience.

Words that do not conjugate or decline (like prepositions and particles) are listed under their only form.

==Exercise 1==

===Vocabulary===

#''affectus, -ūs, m.'', goodwill
#''confessiō, -ōnis, f.'', confession
#''dē'', from, about, concerning
#''liber, librī, m.'', book
#''malus -a -um'', evil, bad
#''placeō -ēre'' + dative, to please (''placuīsse'' is a perfect infinitive)
#''filia, -ae f.'', daughter
#''puella, -ae f.'', girl

===Other Difficulties===

#''quod ad mē attinet'', as far as I'm concerned
#''cum scriberentur'', when they were written (imperfect passive subjuntive)
#''quid sentiant'', what they think (present subjunctive in indirect question)
#''ipsī viderint'', (loosely) they will see in their own way (future perfect)
#''eōs placēre sciō'', accusative-infinitive construction for indirect statement: &quot;I know they [the books] please&quot;

===Passage===

Translate the following passage:

''Confessiōnum meārum librī tredecim et dē malīs et dē bonīs meīs deum laudant iūstum et bonum atque in eum excitant humānum intellectum et affectum. Interim quod ad mē attinet, hoc in mē ēgērunt cum scriberentur et agunt cum leguntur. quid dē illīs aliī sentiant, ipsī viderint; multīs tamen frātribus eōs multum placuīsse et placēre sciō.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Vietnamese, the adjectives (Vietnamese: Tính từ) always come right after the nouns they modify:

;''áo đỏ''
:red shirt (literally: &quot;shirt red&quot;)

They always say about the particular trait, the property of the noun (before it). They can have the &quot;phó từ&quot; (like the adverbs in English) before it (e.g:&quot;đã&quot; for the sentence in the past simple tense, &quot;sẽ&quot; for the sentence in the future simple tense, &quot;đang&quot; for the sentence in the present progressive tense,... for more, see [[Vietnamese/Tense|Tense]])

;''Lúc này, thành phố đang rất yên tĩnh.''
:Now, the city is very quiet. ''(in present progressive tense)''

The adjectives can separate to two main kind:
*'''The adjectives mean the relative particular trait:''' They can go with &quot;rất&quot; (very), &quot;hơi&quot; (quite), etc.
*'''The adjectives mean the absolute particular trait:''' They can't go with &quot;rất&quot;, &quot;hơi&quot;, etc.

== Integral Domains ==
'''Motivation''': The concept of divisibility is central to the study of ring theory.  Integral domains are a useful tool for studying the conditions under which concepts like divisibility and unique factorization are well-behaved. In fact, they are very important for polynomial rings as well.

The integral domain was already defined before on the page on rings. We provide the definition again for reference.

'''Definition''' An ''integral domain'' is a commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1_R \neq 0_R&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;a, b \in R&lt;/math&gt;, the statement &lt;math&gt;ab=0&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

An equivalent definition is as follows:

'''Definition''' Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, a ''zero-divisor'' is an element &lt;math&gt;a \in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\exists x \in R, x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a*x = 0_R&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition''' An ''integral domain'' is a commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1_R \neq 0_R&lt;/math&gt; and with no non-zero zero-divisors.

'''Remark''' An integral domain has a useful cancellation property: Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be an integral domain and
let &lt;math&gt;a, b, c \in R &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; a \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; a b = a c&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; b = c&lt;/math&gt;. For this
reason an integral domain is sometimes called a cancellation ring.

'''Examples:'''
#The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of integers under addition and multiplication is an integral domain.  However, it is not a field since the element &lt;math&gt;2 \in {Z}&lt;/math&gt; has no multiplicative inverse.
#The set trivial ring {0} is not an integral domain since it does not satisfy &lt;math&gt;0 \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;.
#The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_6&lt;/math&gt; of congruence classes of the integers modulo 6 is '''not''' an integral domain because &lt;math&gt;[2] * [3] = [0]&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_6&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' Any field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.

'''Proof:''' Suppose that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a field and let &lt;math&gt;a \in F, a \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;ax = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then multiply by &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to see that &lt;math&gt;ax = 0 \Rightarrow a^{-1}(ax) = a^{-1}0 \Rightarrow 1x = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; cannot, therefore, contain any zero divisors.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Definition''' If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a ring, then the set of polynomials in powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients from
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;
is also a ring, called the polynomial ring of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and written &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt;. Each such polynomial is a finite sum of
terms, each term being of the form &lt;math&gt;r x^n &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r \in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; represents the
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The leading term of a polynomial is defined as that term of the polynomial which contains
the highest power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the polynomial.

'''Remark'''  A polynomial equals &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if each of its coefficients equals &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be an integral domain and let &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt; be the ring of polynomials in powers of
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
whose coefficients are elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain if and only if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is.

'''Proof''' If commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is not an integral domain, it contains two non-zero elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a b = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the polynomials &lt;math&gt;a x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b x&lt;/math&gt; are non-zero
elements of &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a x b x = a b x x = 0 x x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Thus if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is not an integral
domain, neither is &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt;.

Now let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be an integral domain and let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be polynomials in &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt;.
If the polynomials are both non-zero, then each one has a non-zero leading term, call them &lt;math&gt;a x^m&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;b x^n&lt;/math&gt;. That these are the leading terms of polynomials &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; means that the leading
term of the product &lt;math&gt;A B&lt;/math&gt; of these polynomials is &lt;math&gt;a b x^{m + n}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain
and &lt;math&gt;a, b \in R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a b \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. This means, by the Remark above, that the product &lt;math&gt;A B&lt;/math&gt; is not
zero either. This means that &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.

== Unique Factorization Domains, Principal Ideal Domains, and Euclidean Domains ==
Unique Factorization Domains, Prime Ideal Domains, and Euclidean Domains are ideas that work only on integral domains.

===Some definitions===
*Two ring elements a and b are '''associates''' if a=ub for some unit u.
*A nonzero nonunit a is '''irreducible''' if it cannot be expressed as a=bc where b and c are both nonunits.
*a divides b if b=ar for some r within R. When this happens, we write a|b.
*A nonzero nonunit is '''prime''' when a|bc implies that a|b or a|c.

'''Theorem''': If a is prime, then a is irreducible.

Let a be prime, and let a=bc, so that either a|b or a|c. Without loss of generality, assume that a|b, so that b=ad for some element d. Then you can factor a=bc into a=adc, implying that cd=1, or that c is a unit.

Now that we have proven that all prime elements are irreducible, is the converse true? The answer to that is no, for we can easily obtain counterexamples to it. However, we will prove a sufficient and necessary condition for all irreducible elements to be prime.

===Unique Factorization Domains===
'''Definition:''' Let R be an integral domain. If the following two conditions hold:
#If a is nonzero, then a=up&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; where u is a unit, and p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are irreducible.
#Let a=uq&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; be another factorization of irreducibles. Then n = m and after a suitable re-ordering, each p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are associates.
Then we call (the integral domain) R a '''unique factorization domain (UFD)'''.

The converse to the above theorem holds true in a UFD.

'''Theorem:'''
In a UFD, all irreducibles are prime.

''Proof''&lt;br /&gt;
Let a|bc, where a is irreducible. Then ad=bc for some element d. Taking the factorization, a = ud&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...d&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = vb&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...b&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;wc&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = bc where u, v, and w are units. Because it is a UFD, a must be an associate of some b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; or c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, implying that a|b or a|c.

The following theorem provides a sufficient and necessary condition for an integral domain R to be an integral domain.

'''Theorem:'''
#Let R be a UFD. R satisfies the following ''ascending chain condition'' on ''principal ideals'': let &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, a_3,...&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of elements of R such that the principal ideals &lt;math&gt;(a_1),(a_2),(a_3),...&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the condition that &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq (a_2)\subseteq (a_3)\subseteq ,...&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists an N such that for all n&gt;N, all the &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; are the same.
#If an integral domain R satisfies the ascending chain condition, then every nonzero element can be factored into irreducible elements, meaning that it satisfies the first condition for being a UFD.
#If, in addition to satisfying the ascending chain condition, all irreducible elements are prime, then the integral domain is a UFD.

''Proof''&lt;br /&gt;
#Consider a sequence &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, a_3,...&lt;/math&gt; of elements of R such that &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq (a_2)\subseteq (a_3)\subseteq ,...&lt;/math&gt;. Then obviously &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}|a_n&lt;/math&gt; for all natural numbers n, since &lt;math&gt;a_n\in (a_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;. Then due to unique factorization, all the factors of &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; are associates of the factors &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;, counting multiplicity of factors. Therefore, the number of non-unit factors is a decreasing sequence on the whole numbers. However, &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; has finitely many factors, so there is an N such that for all n&gt;N, all the factors are &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; associates, meaning that all the &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; are also the same.
#Clearly any nonzero irreducible &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; can be factored into irreducibles, which is itself. Otherwise, let &lt;math&gt;a_1=a_2b_2&lt;/math&gt; be a product of nonunits. If this is not a product of irreducibles, then suppose that one of them is not irreducible, say &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then obviously &lt;math&gt;a_2|a_1&lt;/math&gt; so the principal ideals satisfy the relations &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq (a_2)&lt;/math&gt;. We can factor &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; in the same way, to obtain &lt;math&gt;a_2=a_3b_3&lt;/math&gt; as a product of nonunits. Thus, if &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; cannot be factored into irreducibles, we can get an increasing chain &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq (a_2) \subseteq (a_3)\subseteq ...&lt;/math&gt; of principal ideals, meaning that it does not satisfy the ascending chain condition.
#Let &lt;math&gt;a=sp_1p_2p_3...p_n=rq_1q_2q_3...q_n&lt;/math&gt; where r and s are units and each &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are irreducible, and thus prime. Since &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; divides a, it divides one of the factors, and after suitably re-arranging the second factorization, &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; can divide &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible, so they must be associates, and thus can be factored out and replaced by a unit. We can continue this process until there are no factors left, at which point we conclude that all the factors are associates.

===Principal Ideal Domains===
Definition: a '''principal ideal domain''' (PID) is an integral domain such that every ideal can be generated by a single element (i. e. every ideal is a principal ideal).

'''Theorem:''' All PIDs are UFDs.

''Proof'':&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose we have an ascending chain of principal ideals &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq(a_2)\subseteq...&lt;/math&gt; and let I be the union &lt;math&gt;I=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty (a_i)&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously I is an ideal, and is a principal ideal because it is in a PID. Therefore, it is generated by a single element, &lt;math&gt;I=(a)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a\in I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a\in (a_N)&lt;/math&gt; for some N. Then if &lt;math&gt;i\geq N&lt;/math&gt;, then we have &lt;math&gt;(a)=(a_N)&lt;/math&gt;, so it satisfies the ascending chain condition of principal ideals.

Let an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be irreducible. If &lt;math&gt;1\in (a)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; would be a unit, so (a) must be a proper ideal. If there is no maximal proper ideal containing (a), then the ascending chain condition would not be satisfied, so we can conclude that there is a maximal ideal proper ideal I containing (a) (Note: This does not require the Zorn's lemma or axiom of choice, since we did not use the theorem on maximal ideals). This ideal must be a principal ideal (b), but since &lt;math&gt;a\in (b)&lt;/math&gt;, b|a, and since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible, b must either be a unit or an associate of a. Since (b) is a proper ideal, b must not be a unit, so it must be an associate of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, (a)=(b), so (a) is maximal. However, all maximal ideals are clearly prime, so (a) is a prime ideal, which implies that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is prime.

'''Theorem:''' A UFD is a PID if and only if every nontrivial prime ideal is maximal.

''Proof'':&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose R is a PID, so that consequently, it is a UFD. Let (a) be an ideal of R, which in turn must be contained in a maximal proper ideal (b) due to the ascending chain condition (Note: again, this does not make use of Zorn's lemma). Since &lt;math&gt;a\in (b)&lt;/math&gt;, b|a. Since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible, b must either be a unit or an associate of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. However, since (b) is a proper ideal, it must not be a unit, so it must be an associate of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, (a)=(b), so (a) is maximal. Conversely,

===Euclidean Domains===

Definition: An integral domain R is a '''Euclidean domain''' (ED) if there is a function f from the nonzero elements of R to the whole numbers such that for any element &lt;math&gt;a\in R&lt;/math&gt; and any nonzero element b, that a=bq+r for some &lt;math&gt;q,r\in R&lt;/math&gt; and such that f(r)&lt;f(b) or such that r=0.

Note: In an ED, the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor is applicable.

'''Theorem:''' All EDs are PIDs.

''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose we have an ideal of R. If it contains only 0, then it is principal. Otherwise, it contains elements other than 0. Then f(I), the image of I under f, is a nonempty set of nonnegative integers. Choose the minimum x of this set, and consider an element b within I which mapped to this x. Let a be another element of I, and there exists &lt;math&gt;q,r\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that a=qb+r and such that either f(r)&lt;f(b) or r=0. Since both a and b belong to I, r must also belong to I since r=a-qb. However, f(b) is the minimum, so it must be less than or equal to f(r). Thus, r must be 0, so a=qb, proving that b is the generator of the principal ideal (b).

----
[http://struts.apache.org/ Struts] is the most popular framework for developing Java based web applications. Struts is being developed as an open source project started by [http://www.apache.org/ Apache Software Foundation ]. Struts framework is based on [http://java.sun.com/blueprints/guidelines/designing_enterprise_applications_2e/web-tier/web-tier5.html Model View Controller] (MVC) architecture.

== Preface ==

== Action Framework in a Nutshell ==

Within the MVC context the struts framework provides its own web Controller component and integrates with other technologies to provide the Model and the View. For the Model, the framework can interact with standard data access technologies, like JDBC and EJB , as well as most any third-party packages, like Hibernate , iBATIS , or Object Relational Bridge . For the View , the framework works well with JavaServer Pages , including JSTL and JSF , as well as Velocity Templates , XSLT , and other presentation systems. 

The framework's Controller acts as a bridge between the application's Model and the web View. When a request is received, the Controller invokes an Action class. The Action class consults with the Model (or, preferably, a Facade representing your Model) to examine or update the application's state. The framework provides an ActionForm class to help transfer data between Model and View. 

Most often, the Model is represented as a set of JavaBeans . Typically, developers will use the Commons BeanUtils to transfer data between ActionForms and the Model objects (or a Facade). Preferably, the Model will do the &quot;heavy lifting&quot;, and the Action will act as a &quot;traffic cop&quot; or adapter.

== Struts Config in a Nutshell ==
A web application uses a deployment descriptor to initialize resources like servlets and taglibs . The deployment descriptor is formatted as a XML document and named &quot;web.xml&quot;. Likewise, the framework uses a configuration file to initialize its own resources. These resources include ActionForms to collect input from users, ActionMappings to direct input to server-side Actions , and ActionForwards to select output pages. 

The initialisation of struts is acheived through the inclusion of the following in the web.xml file

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

&lt;servlet&gt;
     &lt;servlet-name&gt;action&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
      &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
      &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;config&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;

&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

Here's a simple configuration (struts-config.xml) for a login workflow: 

    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE struts-config PUBLIC
          &quot;-//Apache Software Foundation//DTD Struts Configuration 1.3//EN&quot;
          &quot;http://struts.apache.org/dtds/struts-config_1_3.dtd&quot;&gt;
    &lt;struts-config&gt;
        &lt;form-beans&gt;
            &lt;form-bean
                name=&quot;logonForm&quot;
                type=&quot;app.LogonForm&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/form-beans&gt;
        &lt;action-mappings&gt;
            &lt;action
                path=&quot;/Welcome&quot;
                forward=&quot;/pages/Welcome.jsp&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;action
                path=&quot;/Logon&quot;
                forward=&quot;/pages/Logon.jsp&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;action
                path=&quot;/LogonSubmit&quot;
                type=&quot;app.LogonAction&quot;
                name=&quot;logonForm&quot;
                scope=&quot;request&quot;
                validate=&quot;true&quot;
                input=&quot;/pages/Logon.jsp&quot;&gt;
                &lt;forward
                    name=&quot;success&quot;
                    path=&quot;/pages/Welcome.jsp&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;forward
                    name=&quot;failure&quot;
                    path=&quot;/pages/Logon.jsp&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/action&gt;
            &lt;action
                path=&quot;/Logoff&quot;
                type=&quot;app.LogoffAction&quot;&gt;
                &lt;forward
                    name=&quot;success&quot;
                    path=&quot;/pages/Logoff.jsp&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/action&gt;
        &lt;/action-mappings&gt;
        &lt;message-resources parameter=&quot;resources.application&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/struts-config&gt;

There are several other resources you can specify in the framework's configuration file. You can specify validations for the ActionForms in an XML descriptor, using the Struts Validator. A standard extension, Tiles , helps you build pages from smaller fragments.

Struts Action Framework is extensible. Every class deployed by the framework can be replaced by your own default class. The properties of your default class can be set using the Digester's set-property feature. This is one reason why there are so many contributor extensions.

Tiles is a contributor extension.

== Features ==

=== Screen definitions ===
Create a screen by assembling Tiles : header, footer, menu, body, etc.
Definitions can take place:
* in a centralized xml file
* directly in jsp pages
* programatically in struts actions
Definitions provide an inheritance mechanism : a definition can extend another one, and override parameters.

==== Layouts ====
Define common page layouts and reuse them across your web site.
Define menu layouts, and use them by passing lists of items and links.
Define a portal layout, use it by passing a list of Tiles (pages) to show.
Reuse existing layouts, or define your own. 

==== Dynamic page building ====
Tiles can be gathered dynamically during page reload. It is possible to change any attribute: layout, list of Tiles in portal, list of menu items, etc.

===== Reuse of Tiles / Components =====
If well defined, a Tile can be reused across multiple applications.
Dynamic attributes are used to parameterize Tiles.
It is possible to define a library of reusable Tiles.
Build a page by assembling predefined components, giving them appropriate parameters.

==== Internationalization (i18n) ====
It is possible to load different tiles according to Locale.
A mechanism similar to Java properties files is used for definitions files: you can have one definition file per Locale. The appropriate definition is loaded according to the current Locale.

==== Multi-channels ====
It is possible to load different Tiles according to a key.
For example, the key could be user privilege, browser type, arbitrary name stored in session, etc.
A mechanism similar to Java properties files is used for definitions files: you can have one definition file per key. The appropriate definition is loaded according to the key.

== Prerequisites ==
Apart from basic understanding of building a web application. The reader is required to have some sort of working knowledge in the following technologies.
* [[HTML Programming|HTML]]
* [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]
* [[Programming:Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)|Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)]]
* [[../JSP|JSP and Java Servlets]]
* [[../Java Beans/]]
* [[XML - Managing Data Exchange|XML]] (Extensible MarkUp Language)

== Getting Started ==
Struts framework provides the following benefits over conventional methods of Web Application Development.
* Decoupling of business logic and presentation logic 
* Reusablity
* Maintainability

These benefits are gained because Struts provides a system based on the &quot;Model 2&quot; paradigm of Java web application design, while also providing a framework for the application that is cleaner than a series of J2EE servlets.

== Struts XML Tags and Attributes Reference ==
(The following list is in the same order as the [[#Struts Config in a Nutshell|example above (of a simple configuration)]] and the [[#Further Reading|example in link below of Struts tutorial on JBoss]].)
* &lt;struts-config - outer tag that encompasses the other tags.
* &lt;data-sources -
* &lt;form-beans - defines a section of forms that encompasses one or more &lt;form-bean tags.
* &lt;form-bean - defines a form :
** name=
** type=
* &lt;global-exceptions -
* &lt;global-forwards - defines a section of forward routes that are used, by default, in &lt;action tags. It encompasses one or more &lt;forward tags.
* &lt;action-mappings - defines a section of actions that encompasses one or more &lt;action tags.
* &lt;action - defines an action, which can have one or more forward routes (with one forward attribute, or one or more &lt;forward sub-tags) :
** path=
** forward=
** type=
** name=
** scope=
** validate=
** input=
** parameter= can be read from @struts.Action@ class by @mappings.getParameter()@
* &lt;forward - defines a forward route within an &lt;action tag :
** name=
** path=
* &lt;controller -
* &lt;message-resources -
** parameter=

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of this book is to create programmed instruction (PI) math lessons ranging from basic math all the way up through the end of high school math (usually trig). The idea of PI is that lessons can be learned in any order as long as subordinate lessons (pre-requisites) are taught before superordinate ones. For example, one would learn counting, then addition, then subtraction, then multiplication, then division. After this they would have the choice of learning either long division or fractions. After learning multiplication and division of fractions, one would have the choice of either mixed numbers or proportions. The content will be similar to the other math textbooks, but it will be presented in a non linear way. This way one can learn what they want to without having to learn extra material, and can learn the material in any order they choose. The challenge of this project will be figuring out what the prerequisites of each lesson are, and then directing the user to their options for their next lesson. 

Content can be freely copied from [http://www.planetmath.org PlanetMath.org], and any textbook in public domain (published before 1923) or released under the GFDL. Also note, the material on [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ MathWorld] is copyrighted so do not copy directly it as there have been legal problems with this website before.

If this project is a success then it will be expanded to other subject areas.

      <comment>/* Modules */ You do not necessarily take AS modules in 1 year and then A2 in the next. For example, you can take C3 and C4 (A2) in the first year.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This is a book about AS (advanced subsidiary) and A (advanced) level Mathematics. It aims to fit in with the [http://www.ocr.org.uk/Data/publications/key_documents/AS_A_Level86696.pdf OCR New GCE A-level Mathematics] syllabus but is not endorsed by OCR. It should be useful as a revision guide or to find alternative explanations to the ones in your textbook. It assumes you have already done GCSE Mathematics. While it is aimed at people studying A-levels, it may be of interest to others in general. More information about A-levels can be obtained from the [[w:A-level|A-level]] article in Wikipedia.
===Course Structure===
====Mathematics====
*To be awarded an AS-level qualification in Mathematics, it is required that a student takes 3 modules. These must be C1, C2 and any one of the applied modules.
*To be awarded an A-level qualification in Mathematics, it is required that a student takes 6 modules. These must be C1, C2, C3, C4 and any two of the applied modules.
====Further Mathematics====
*To be awarded an AS-level qualification in Further Mathematics, it is required that a student takes 3 modules. These must be FP1 and any two of the applied modules.
*To be awarded an A-level qualification in Further Mathematics, it is required that a student take 6 modules. These must be FP1, either FP2 or FP3, and any four other modules.
A module may only be taken as part of a Mathematics '''or''' a Further Mathematics course. A student must therefore take 6 unique modules to be awarded an AS-level qualification in Further Mathematics. These 6 modules must be C1, C2, FP1 and any three of the applied modules. A student must take 12 unique modules to receive an A-level qualification in Further Mathematics. You must take all the core modules and FP1. Then you have a choice of taking either FP2 ''or'' FP3 with any 6 applied modules or FP2 ''and'' FP3 with any 5 applied modules.

Students at schools or colleges that do not offer the Further Mathematics A-Level can now study it through one of the local centres of [http://www.fmnetwork.org.uk/ The Further Mathematics Network].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''indices''' in this chapter heading refers to the '''power''' to which a number is raised. Thus &lt;math&gt;x ^ 2&lt;/math&gt; is a number with an index of 2. This is never normally said as people prefer the phrase &quot;x to the power of 2&quot;. Likewise, surds is a heading that is not often used. Occasionally you wil be asked to give an answer in '''surd''' form; this implies that you should give the answer in terms of constants, trig functions and square roots instead of working out an imprecise decimal approximation.


==Indices==
As you should know from GCSE, &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; is a shortening of &lt;math&gt;x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt;. In the same way, any number to the power of n is that number multiplied by itself n times. To describe more detail, in the expression &lt;math&gt;x ^ 3&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the '''base''', and the 3 as the '''exponent'''.

By always reducing the expression back to its basic parts it is possible to come to conclusions about how to treat numbers raised to powers in algebra.

===Multiplication===
When you multiply indices you add the exponents together.


As you can see &lt;math&gt;x^3 \times x^2 = x^{3+2} = x^5&lt;/math&gt; .

===Division===
Division is, as expected, the opposite to multiplication. When you divide indices you subtract the exponents from each other.

&lt;math&gt; \frac{x^4}{x^2} = \frac{x \times x \times x \times x}{x \times x} = \frac{\not \! x \times \not \! x \times x\times x}{\not \! x \times \not \! x} = x \times x = x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Again this shows that &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^4}{x^2} = x^{4-2} = x^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Negative powers===
Having done the above division, we begin to ask ourselves what happens when we have a fraction that has a higher exponent on the bottom than the top.

Using the trusted method of showing each x separately we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{x^3} = \frac{\not \! x \times \not \! x}{\not \! x \times \not \! x \times x} = \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the just demonstrated method of subtracting the exponents:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{x^3} = x^{2-3} = x^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that x to the power of a negative number is one divided by x to the power of that number. 
The specific case of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x} \; \left( x^{-1} \right) &lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the '''reciprocal''' of x or more often as the '''inverse''' of x.

===Base raised to two powers===
When you have a base raised to two powers you multiply the powers.

&lt;math&gt;\left(x^2 \right)^3 = \left(x \times x \right) \times \left(x \times x\right) \times \left(x \times x\right)=x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x = x^6&lt;/math&gt;.

As you can see that &lt;math&gt;\left(x^2\right)^3 = x^{2 \times 3} = x^6&lt;/math&gt;.

===Multiple bases to the same power===
When you have two bases to the same power, you can raise both bases to the same power and multiply them.&lt;p&gt;
For example: &lt;math&gt;\left(xy \right)^3 = xy \times xy \times xy = x \times y \times x \times y \times x \times y = x \times x \times x \times y \times y \times y&lt;/math&gt; which is the same as &lt;math&gt;x^3y^3\,&lt;/math&gt;. Here is an example with numbers: &lt;math&gt;\left(2 \times 5\right)^2 = \left(10\right)^2 = 100 = 4 \times 25 = 2^2 \times 5^2&lt;/math&gt;. There is a similar situation with division: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2 = \frac{x}{y} \times \frac{x}{y} = \frac{x \times x}{y \times y} = \frac{x^2}{y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Fractional powers===
What if the power isn't even an integer? Suppose you wanted to find &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, you could say that &lt;math&gt;{x^\frac{1}{2}} \times {x^\frac{1}{2}}  = x^1&lt;/math&gt; (by law 3, addition of powers) which means that &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt x&lt;/math&gt;. However it is customary to only use the positive root and so &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt x&lt;/math&gt;. You can use a similar argument for other such fractions, for example &lt;math&gt;\left(x^\frac{1}{3}\right)^3=x&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{3} = \sqrt[3]{x}&lt;/math&gt;. In cases when the numerator is not 1 we need to use other laws of indicies to prove the square definition, for example &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{2}{3} = \left(x^2 \right)^\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; (using law 3), and &lt;math&gt;\left(x^2\right)^\frac{1}{3} = \sqrt[3]{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; (using the definition above). It's useful to remember the general rule that &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt[b]{x^a}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The 0 and 1 Power===
You may well have realised that &lt;math&gt;{x^1} = x\,&lt;/math&gt;. You can prove this by &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^n}{x^{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt; which is clearly &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;x^{n - \left (n - 1 \right )} = x^1 = x&lt;/math&gt; by law 2.&lt;br&gt; Also with &lt;math&gt;x^0\,&lt;/math&gt; we can prove that it is equivalent to 1, &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^n}{x^{n}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, but by law 2 it is also equivalent to &lt;math&gt;x^{n-n} = x^0&lt;/math&gt;

===The Laws of Indices===

The rules that have been suggested above are known as the laws of indices and can be written as:

1. &lt;math&gt;x^ax^b = x^{a+b}\,&lt;/math&gt;


2. &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;


3. &lt;math&gt;x^{-n}=\frac{1}{x^n}&lt;/math&gt;


4. &lt;math&gt;\left(x^a\right)^b = x^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;


5. &lt;math&gt;\left(xy \right)^n = x^n y^n&lt;/math&gt;


6. &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^n = \frac{x^n}{y^n}&lt;/math&gt;


7. &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt[b]{x^a}&lt;/math&gt;


8. &lt;math&gt;x^0 = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;


9. &lt;math&gt;x^1 = x\,&lt;/math&gt;


10. &lt;math&gt; (x^m)^\frac{1}{m}= x\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Surds==
In mathematics, a Surd is an expression containing a root term, with an irrational value, that
can not be expressed exactly – for example, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3} = 1.732050808...&lt;/math&gt; .

Sometimes it is useful to work in surds, rather than using an approximate decimal value. Surds can be manipulated just like algebraic expressions and sometimes it may be possible to eliminate the surd (called rationalising the expression), which may have not been possible if you tried to work with the approximate value. When asked to give the exact value, approximate decimal answers will not do and you will have to manipulate surds in order to give a final answer in simplified surd form.

===Simplification of surds===

Because surds can be manipulated like algebraic expressions, you can easily multiply out the terms and add the like terms. However, there are also a few rules that will be useful when simplifying surds.

===Basic rule of surds===

Because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {x} \times \sqrt {x} = x&lt;/math&gt;, it is useful to know that it can be rearranged to give &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {x} = \frac {x} {\sqrt {x}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {\sqrt {x}} = \frac {\sqrt {x}} {x}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Surds as indices===

Because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x} = x^\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; the laws of indices also apply to any n-th root. The most frequently used instances of this are laws 4 and 5 with surds:

* &lt;math&gt;\left(xy \right)^n = x^n y^n&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x} \times \sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^n = \frac{x^n}{y^n}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}} = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{y}}&lt;/math&gt;

The first of these points is often used to simplify a surd, for example &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{200}=\sqrt{100 \times 2}=\sqrt{100} \times \sqrt{2}=10\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. In an exam, you will be expected to write all surds with the smallest possible number inside the surd (i.e. the number inside the root shouldn't have any square factors).

'''Note:'''
This rule only applies to non-negative numbers, attempts to involve negative numbers
might give absurd results;
&lt;math&gt; -1 = \sqrt{-1}\cdot \sqrt{-1} = \sqrt{(-1)(-1)} =\sqrt{1} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Rationalising the denominator===

Another technique to simplify expressions involving surds is to '''rationalise the denominator'''. This means removing a surd from a fraction. In the case of a fraction such as &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, both numerator and denominator can be multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; to give &lt;math&gt;\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the fraction is of the form&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+\sqrt{c}}&lt;/math&gt; the strategy used in the previous paragraph will work if it is slightly modified. This time you should multiply the numerator and denominator by &lt;math&gt;{b-\sqrt{c}}&lt;/math&gt;. If you are familiar with the standard difference of two squares expansion you should already know what happens next:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+\sqrt{c}} \times \frac{b-\sqrt{c}}{b-\sqrt{c}} = \frac{ab-a\sqrt{c}}{b^2 + b\sqrt{c} - b\sqrt{c} - \sqrt{c}^2} = \frac{ab - a\sqrt{c}}{b^2-c} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
As you can see the denominator now does not contain any surds. For example:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{\sqrt{3}+1} = \frac{2\left(\sqrt{3}+ 1\right)}{3-1} = \sqrt{3}+1 &lt;/math&gt;

==Common questions and mistakes==

===Splitting up roots===

A common mistake is to split &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x + y}&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\left(x+y\right)^2&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;, usually whilst moving it to the other side of the equals. Trying a few examples will quickly convince you that this is not possible:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{64}\ \ne \sqrt{32} + \sqrt{32}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{25}\ \ne \sqrt{12} + \sqrt{13}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
And so on

===What is the value of &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;?===
The short answer is that for this course you don't need to know, and you can safely skip this section. If you're still interested then read on:

The question arises because &lt;math&gt;x^0=1&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and yet you would expect that &lt;math&gt;0^y=0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;0 \times 0 \times 0 \dots = 0&lt;/math&gt;. It turns out using a value of 1 is quite useful (perhaps even necessary) in various parts of algebra, whereas making it zero doesn't help at all. Almost all mathematicians would therefore either say that &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; is 1 or that it is undefined (that is, it can't be given a value).

== Test cases ==

I have had a list of common test cases transwikied from Wikipedia because I thought it could be put to good use in this or a similar book.  The list can be found at [[Transwiki:Common Test Cases]].  It needs a little cleanup, of course, but is in pretty good shape.  Hopefully, someone for familiar with this book than me can put it to good use.  Thanks --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 00:33, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

== The Style Leaves a Lot to Be Desired - what should I do about it? ==

Hi all!

I learned about this book, from a link someone placed on the my [[Optimizing Code for Speed]] wikibook. Now I agree that reading a good introduction on how to write a program should come before you start optimizing a working code senselessly. (I should note that I haven't encouraged such unwise behaviour in my article, just possibly not stressed it enough.)

In any case, I feel the style of this wikibook and its tone leaves a lot to be desired. It's very unofficial, quite condescending  not NPOVish (= Neutral Point Of View) enough (I admit that wikibooks need not be as NPOVish as the wikipedia and may be somewhat biased, but it's still an important partial factor). As a result requiring it as a pre-requisite to mine may leave a bad impression.

But naturally I should not complain if I don't volunteer to fix it myself, and I do. However, I'm not sure my modifications will be accepted by the originators of this wikibook, and so kindly ask for their permission, to fix the style and correct the manuscript. From my wiki-ing experience, I know that sometimes documents that I've started were taken to completely different directions that I've neither intended nor found desirable, which I didn't appreciate, due to a certain feeling of propriety. (Which I hope was not territoriality.). So I'm asking here whether it would be OK.

[[User:Shlomif|Shlomif]] ([[User talk:Shlomif|talk]]) 11:32, 10 November 2009 (UTC)

I find even the premise of the book a little skewed. According to the book title this is a book about learning how to program, but the contents assume familiarity with languages, so the topic is not how to use the languages to program, but about how to program in an industrial environment where you have Requirements Papers and such like already generated for you.

If we are going to discuss production programming, then shouldn't we cover more than just the basics such as refactoring, and perhaps cover disciplines like Top-Down, Extreme Programming, Agile Programming, etc. techniques? Should we accept the premise that language is not important to the book, or should we discuss the relative usefulness of a number of programming languages in order to give the programmer a background in modern languages other than the ones they learned at school, or should we discuss the use of Structured English, and Flow Charts as tools to organize the program. Perhaps a section on UML might be in order? How about a chapter on profiling and how to use it to determine where in the program you want to optimize?

Should we limit ourselves to just programming techniques or should we include Patterns, and links to the rich information sources that have been developed in relation to that discipline? I think that books that have to be used as pre-requisites for other books, should be held to a higher standard than this book seems to be.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 15:09, 14 November 2009 (UTC)

: Dear Shlomif,
: I totally agree with practically everything you have said.
: In particular, a good introduction on how to write a program should come before learning a bunch of optimization tricks.
: I also agree that this particular wikibook is not yet a particularly good introduction.
: Is there some other wikibook that would make a better introduction?

: We have many Wikibooks about specific programming languages -- [[Python]], [[Lua Functional Programming]], etc.
: I've been assuming, based on the title, that this wikibook &quot;How to Write a Program&quot; is intended to discuss the sorts of things that are important for every programmer to know, but are not specific to any one programming language -- and so get very little notice in those books about some particular programming language. Things like version control, automated testing, colored syntax highlighting, pair programming, handling bug reports, estimating time to fix a bug, estimating time to add a new feature, how to divvy up parts of a program among a bunch of programmers, etc.
: Some teachers try to teach these things before getting to the language-specific stuff, but it seems that these things make more sense to students after they've learned to write a few small programs in some specific language.
: ''shouldn't we cover more than just the basics such as refactoring, and perhaps cover disciplines like Top-Down, Extreme Programming, Agile Programming, etc. techniques?'' Yes, that is a great idea.
: ''Should we ... discuss the relative usefulness of a number of programming languages...?'' While such a comparison would be really useful, I think this book should stick to non-language specific stuff -- perhaps the [[Computer Programming]] book or [[Programming Languages]] book is a better place for those comparisons.
: ''How about a chapter on profiling'' Also an extremely useful technique, but -- perhaps the [[Optimizing Code for Speed]] book is a better place for that chapter.
: I want everyone to feel free to make any and every kind of improvement to this book.
: As long as you [[Wiki: AlmostNeverDeleteHumor]].

:: Well, I've started the rework of this book when I've ran into [http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/46078.html a little Browser-related Yak-shaving] and now I'm back. However, in the meantime, I've concluded something else. I had written [http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/rev2/ an essay titled &quot;What Makes Software High-Quality?&quot;] (written in DocBook/XML and under CC-by - possibly wikibooking material) which contains four sections: an Introduction, a list of parameters of software quality, a list of ways to achieve software quality, and finally an evaluation of the quality of various [[wikipedia:FreeCell|Freecell]] solvers (the latter due to a quote that prompted the discussion in the first place in the introduction and my role as the primary author of [http://fc-solve.berlios.de/ a Freecell solver]). 
:: Now, while the section of the parameters of software quality was supposed to be as comprehensive as possible (and I would appreciate anything you believe is an omission), the other main section about ways of quality did not aim to be comprehensive, but rather give a taste of what people find useful. That's because it's
::# A huge subject. How to write quality software has been the subject of many books, and countless of articles, papers, essays, blog posts, mailing list posts and conversations.
::# A controversial subject. People don't seem to agree on what exactly is the right way to do things. 
::# It doesn't appear to be absolutely necessary for one's success (or alternatively to ensure one's success). In [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html the Joel Test], Joel Spolsky says that «Of course, these are not the only factors that determine success or failure: in particular, if you have a great software team working on a product that nobody wants, well, people aren't going to want it. And it's possible to imagine a team of &quot;gunslingers&quot; that doesn't do any of this stuff that still manages to produce incredible software that changes the world.». The plentyoffish.com creator taught himself .NET programming and became a millionaire a year later simply because he had the idea to create a completely-ad-supported web-site, and was the first to market it, but its code probably had left a lot to be desired. And on the other hand, thousands of well-managed projects, products, companies and teams fail each year, and many great web-sites (like my own [http://perl-begin.org/ Perl-Begin] appear to be) still destined for obscurity.
::Back to the topic, if we are going to write a &quot;How to Write a Program&quot; or &quot;How to write Quality Software&quot; or whatever you want to call it wikibook, then we'll have a huge and controversial task ahead of us. Do we cover what we think are the right measures for achieving quality? Do we cover all possible ways to achieve quality and discuss the various opinions about them? In which context do we discuss this: open-source software, commercial software, in-house software, embedded software, games; GUI software, command-line software, libraries and APIs, web-based software, terminal software, client/server; by freelancers, by businesses, out-sourcing, off-shore outsourcing, in-house development, for fun, for profit, etc. etc?
::It's not an easy question, and I'm not sure we can start tackling it starting from &quot;How to Write a Program&quot; excuse for a wikibook. There are other much more commendable efforts in regards to FOSS development: 
::# ESR's [http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/ the &quot;Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;] and some other writings by him. (Open Publication License)
::# Karl Fogel's [http://producingoss.com/ Producing Open Source Software] - a comprehensive and good book about the topic (CC-by).
:: And naturally, there are many more books and resources about that for non-FOSS development. We should also ask ourselves if we want to add another resource. I think it would be more worthwhile to tackle particular aspects of achieving software quality at a time: [[Optimizing Code for Speed|speed and efficiency]], modular code, readable code, skimmable code, automated tests, tact and social engineering, publicity, picking up a good name, writing comments (or not - some people think code should be self-documenting) bug tracking/triaging/fixing, and other aspects.
:: I think that unless we're planning on tackling that huge problem by writing a definitive resource, then I can safely remove the recommendation to read this book from [[Optimizing Code for Speed]]. I guess I can add some text to the introduction explaining the context and risk of optimisation and pointing to relevant resources about measuring and achieving software quality. 
:: Would it be agreeable? [[User:Shlomif|Shlomif]] ([[User talk:Shlomif|talk]]) 23:22, 25 February 2010 (UTC)

::: ''possibly wikibooking material''
::: Thank you for writing that essay.
:::''if we are going to write a ... wikibook, then we'll have a huge and controversial task ahead of us.''
::: Yes. This is also true for many (most? all?) wikibooks. Have you seen the [[C++ Programming]] controversy? :-(
::: ''In which context do we discuss this: open-source software, commercial software, in-house software, embedded software, games; GUI software, command-line software, libraries and APIs, web-based software, terminal software, client/server; by freelancers, by businesses, out-sourcing, off-shore outsourcing, in-house development, for fun, for profit, etc. etc?''
::: Contexts where &quot;Use version control, automated testing, and colored syntax highlighting&quot; is good advice. That's all of them, right?
::: I think there's room for a small book that discusses these and similar widely-applicable programming tips, that we suggest people read just before the &quot;optimization&quot; book.
::: I don't think we should make a huge, definitive book on software quality a prerequisite to the &quot;optimization&quot; book.
::: ''There are other much more commendable efforts''
::: I don't understand. I agree that the current version of wikibook, like the current version of every other wikibook, is inferior to some other work. But I hope that future versions rapidly improve and surpass other static works.
::: ''I'm not sure we can start tackling it starting from &quot;How to Write a Program&quot; excuse for a wikibook.''
::: If you are suggesting starting from scratch, then I suspect you haven't actually read the links you mentioned.

A few tips to keep the crew happy:

==Food==
Never underestimate the importance of good food.  If your crew is working for free then you MUST feed them well and at well defined times.  If you're going to overrun then stop and ASK your crew if they mind working for another hour before lunch.  Always try to provide hot food.  Sandwiches are your last resort.

Good food needn't cost a lot.  See if you can get your Mum involved or your best friend's mate who's an out-of-work chef.  Remember also that some of your cast and crew (especially the clapper-loader) may have to work though their food breaks and so will need easy-to-eat food.  Oh, and don't forget to check on allergies.

Check here for advice on good food which is affordable and works on set - [[Movie Making Manual/Recipes|Ultra Low Budget production Recipes]].

Also remember to have a snack table (called craft services table in the USA). This may seem insignificant, however, film sets bring together very different personalities and egos, both technical and artistic, in very intense situations over a short period of time. Tempers will flare. They always do. Humans when upset or dealing with any extreme emotion in all cultures like to do one thing: put something in their mouth. A drink, a smoke, a chocolate, a thumb... whatever. The craft services table provides this option. Coffee, tea, water, donuts, pastries, water, chocolates, sweets, juice, fruit and water. Don't underestimate it.  Try to put the emphasis on healthy food like fruit rather than chocolates and crisps - junk food may give a quick 'high' but wont sustain that high so your crew will become irritable as the day progresses.

Another option (if you're lucky) is to get a deal with a local restaurant or pizza place, perhaps exchanging discounts on food for product placement in your film or advertising in the credits, brochures or your film's website.  Local pizza places are a good first stop. This can get costly if done too often. Some consider this option selling out, which is fair, however, it's not a bad way to get some grub for the crew.

No matter what your position on set try to offer others a tea or coffee whenever you can.  As a runner you will quickly gain the enthusiasm of others by offering tea and coffee.  As a more senior crew member you will show that you aren't a snobby nosed, status-obsessed fool in it only for the power, but a good natured human who likes to get along with people and do the best job possible.

But - be warned - never eat in front of a hungry camera crew.  Why?  The camera crew don't have the option of quickly picking up a sandwich because their hands must be kept very clean whilst on set and handling camera kit.  Once, on my first ADing job, I was casually nibbling on a sandwich when the DoP gave me a loud and public telling off.  You have been warned!

==Hours==
Don't overwork your crew.  Your job as a filmmaker is to get the very best out of your cast and crew - as a producer or director you actually do *very little* hands-on filmmaking.  So the best thing you can do is create a productive, exciting and comfortable environment for your cast and crew.  The one thing that will destroy the mood on set (and destroy your film) is exhaustion.  If your schedule demands 20 hour days then cut the script or increase the number of shooting days.

It is important to remember that the hours worked also include the 'wrapping out' time: not all crew just walk away when 'wrap' is called, spark (electricians), camera crew, grips, makeup, wardrobe and others still have a lot of work to pack up from the day and clean and prepare for the next day. So an estimated wrap time of say, 22.00 hours really means an end of shooting at 21.00 to allow for the wrapping-out. Expecting a 12 hour on-camera day to then be followed by an hour's worth of putting away the gear is a surefire way to spark a mutiny!

==Communication==
Give the cast and crew as much information as possible, especially when things are going wrong.  If you can then print and distribute the schedule to EVERY crew member at the start of each day, if not far earlier.  If you're going run over schedule then first explain the situation to your crew, then ask very nicely if they mind working longer and then tell your crew the new estimate wrap time.

==Drugs==
You can't stop everyone from taking loads of drugs but do your best to dissuade your cast and crew.

Drugs and alcohol on set will void most insurance policies. You must get your crew to never ever take any kind of extreme mind altering substances while anywhere near set. I would advise firing anyone that does not heed this warning. This has nothing to do with moral or social issues it has to do with running a business. Until the insurance contracts change no drugs or alcohol on set.

==Drinking==
This is a dodgy one.  Going out for drinks every night of the shoot is a good way to get to know everyone.  But don't over do it.  What you do as a director or producer is up to you.  You'll certainly increase your chances of getting on well with your cast and crew if you go out drinking with them.  But, then again, you've probably got to spend every evening preparing the next day's shot list.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Take formal lessons from a qualified teacher. Be sure to seek testimonials and references.
A great way to continue learning if you can already play is to teach guitar to other people.
A good website is the http://www.registryofguitartutors.co.uk
* Watch others play. Notice what they have to pay attention to and what seems like magic. 
* Practice arbitrary scale runs.  Go up and or down 3 or 4 notes and then move up the scale with the same interval.
* Jam up with friends who are better than you as frequently as possible
* Get some friends along who are at the same skill level and form a band of your own
* Play some serious air-guitar.  This will make you think about where your hands would be positioned when playing the notes, as well as giving you a chance to develop your stage presence, without having to focus on technique.
* Listen to your favorite music and try to envision what the guitarist is doing to make the notes come out as they do.
* Listen to different music.  It may open your mind to techniques and phrasing you never imagined using before.  It may also expand your musical library.  Pick any genre you're not familiar with.  Get a feel for the timing and note choice.  Into classical?  Try bluegrass.  Headbanger?  Pick up some jazz or blues.  Then move on to your hero's heroes.  Find out what musical influences got Jimi Hendrix, B.B King or Eric Clapton primed for stardom.

=What is Linux?=
[[w:linux|Linux]] is a piece of software known as a 'kernel.' The name has also been inaccurately applied to an entire operating system known as [[w:GNU|GNU]]. [[w:GNU/Linux|GNU/Linux]] is the preferred method of referring to the operating system. GNU/Linux is a computer [[w:operating system|operating system]] which can run on many different types of computer hardware.  GNU/Linux is the most famous example of [[w:free software|free software]].  It is developed and maintained by thousands of people around the world.  Most GNU/Linux distributions are gratis.  Please take a look at the [[w:wikipedia|Wikipedia]] entry for more info about [[w:GNU/Linux|GNU/Linux]].

==Advantages==
* Almost always free (or very inexpensive)
* Open Source (most distributions, but not all)
* Bugs are usually fixed very quickly
* Stable
* Fast
* You can modify it to your heart's content, learn from it and even redistribute changes.
* There is a lot of support available on-line through Wikis and Forums
* Developers are usually very open to suggestions from users.  Much more so than proprietary, closed-source, corporate software developers.  If you've got money to spend, then the developers will probably gladly design custom modules for you.
* Many software options for similar tasks.
* Many variations on the kernel for various uses depending on hardware, resources, and what you want to do on it.

==Disadvantages==
* Documentation is often a little sketchy depending on the distribution
* The Macintosh is the Industry standard for most aspects of film production
* Is again its own operating system and takes time to get use to (depending on your own speed of picking things up)

=But I thought GNU/Linux was bad for content creation?=
It used to be.  But it's grown up.  There are already lots of great tools for content creation on GNU/Linux (and, yes, lots of them are free).

=Why use GNU/Linux for film production?=
* Lots of film companies (especially 3D and effects houses) already use GNU/Linux.  So what?  Well, lots of these guys contribute code to the open-source world.  Free of charge.  So you and I can use code which has been developed at ILM.  Examples:
** [http://www.cinepaint.org/ Cinepaint], forked from the GNU Image Manipulation Program ([[w:GIMP|GIMP]]), is partially developed by Rhythm &amp; Hues, ILM, and Sony Pictures.  It's mainly used for cleanup, and dust and scratch removal.
** [http://www.openexr.com OpenEXR] is developed by ILM.
* It's very stable.

* Most [[Movie Making Manual/Windows in film production|Windows programs]] can be made to run under Linux using [http://www.winehq.com/ Wine] (which is free, and costs no money).

Everything which isn't marked as &quot;proprietary&quot; is gratis!

*[http://www.tvpaint.com/linux TVP Animation Pro] (proprietary)

*Windows programs running under Wine

Besides dastoryboard, there are no free specialized storyboarding programs on Linux but see the [[#Still_image_creation|&quot;Still image Creation&quot;]] section below.

A useful technique could be to photograph and outline your actors with a vector graphics program, then reposition them behind photographs of your locations.
Check out the vector graphics section.

The program [http://www.celtx.com/ celtx], listed in the &quot;scriptwriting&quot; section, has storyboarding capabilities. You would still need to create the images as explained in the previous paragraph but they can be entered into a template within the celtx application. Notes can be added to the images as well.

The 2D animation software [http://www.maefloresta.com/portal/ Tupi] also has made steps to implement storyboard facilities.

=Personal opinions=
====Wish List====
I love Linux.  Don't get me wrong.  
I think the whole project is perfect and I use Linux all the time. I use Linux for everything.  Everything, including video editing.

My wish list is:

* Flash MX 2004/2005 on Linux (for DVD Menus)
* Adobe port Premiere over to Linux / Avid port DV Xpress to Linux
* There are many very promising Open Source video editing packages that one day may become mature enough to compete with Premiere, but I'm porting this one right now with Xen.

Once one of these wishes becomes true then Linux will rock as an NLE platform.

====GNU/Linux Multi-media forums====

I'm somewhat disappointed that many of the forums on GNU/Linux multi-media are very quiet.  The best forums that I know of are:
*[http://forum.doom9.org/forumdisplay.php?f=63 Doom9] Linux specific multimedia forum on a mostly windows site
*[http://www.videohelp.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=19 Video Help.com] Linux specific multimedia forum on a mostly windows site
*[http://forums.gentoo.org/viewforum-f-33.html Gentoo-Multimedia forum] Hosted on a gentoo-specific forum, but has a lot of generic GNU/Linux multimedia information (and relatively very active)
*[http://wiki.multimedia.cx MultimediaWiki] All about Multimedia
Does anyone know of any other good multi-media forums for linux?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
== Motivation ==
In [[../Rings/]] we saw that the set of even integers &lt;math&gt;2 \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; was a subring of the integers.  

We can also see very easily that the integers &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} &lt;/math&gt; are a subring of the rational numbers under the usual operations of addition and multiplication.

The even integers, when taken as a subring of the integers have a property that the integers when taken as a subring of the rationals do not.  The even integers taken as a subring of the rationals also lack this property.

The property is that the even integers, taken as a subring of the integers, ''absorb'' multiplication.    Let's call the even integers &lt;math&gt;I = 2 \mathbb{Z} &lt;/math&gt; for ease of notation.

Consider the following:
For all &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;, we can see by the definition of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;i = 2k&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  

For all &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; see that &lt;math&gt;ai = a(2k) = 2ak \in I&lt;/math&gt;.  

In English, regardless of which even integer is chosen, multiplying it by any integer will give us a different ''even'' integer.

== Definition of an Ideal ==
'''Definition:'''
Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, a subset &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''left ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;'' if it absorbs multiplication from the left; that is, if
&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in I, \forall r \in R, ri \in I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, a subset &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''right ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;'' if it absorbs multiplication from the right; that is, if
&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in I, \forall r \in R, ir \in I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
We define an ''ideal'' &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; to be something that is both a left ideal and a right ideal. We also require that &lt;math&gt;(I, +)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;(R, +)&lt;/math&gt;.

We write &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; as shorthand for this.

To verify that a subset of a ring is an ideal, it is only necessary to check that it is closed under subtraction and that it absorbs multiplication; this is because of the subgroup criterion from [[Abstract_Algebra/Group_Theory/Subgroup]].

'''Definition:'''
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''proper'' if &lt;math&gt;I \subsetneq R&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''trivial'' if I={0}.

'''Lemma:'''
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is proper if and only if &lt;math&gt;1 \notin I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''
If &lt;math&gt;1 \in I&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;r = r1 \in I&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;I = R&lt;/math&gt;.

The converse is obvious.

'''Theorem:'''
In a division ring, the only proper ideal is trivial.

'''Proof:'''
Suppose we have an ideal in a division with a nonzero element a. Take any element b in our division ring. Then a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;b is in the division ring as well, and aa&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;b = b is in the ideal. Therefore, it is not a proper ideal.

'''Definition:'''
Let S be a nonempty subset of a ring R. Then the ideal generated S is defined to be the smallest ideal in R containing S, which would be the intersection of all such ideals. We can characterize this ideal by the collection of all finite sums

&lt;math&gt;\left \{ \sum_{i=1}^n r_{i1}s_ir_{i2}|r_{i1},r_{i2} \in R, s_i \in S \right \} &lt;/math&gt;

And one can easily verify that this is an ideal, and that all ideals containing S must contain this ideal. If it is commutative, then one can simply characterize it as

&lt;math&gt;\left \{ \sum_{i=1}^n r_i1s_i|r_i \in R, s_i \in S \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

The ideal generated by a single element a is called a '''principal ideal'''. If the ring is commutative, it consists of all elements of the ring of the form ra where r is any element in the ring.

'''Example''':
Let &lt;math&gt;R = \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; be the ring of integers. The principal ideal &lt;math&gt;(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of positive and negative multiples of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For example &lt;math&gt;(2)&lt;/math&gt; is the subset of even integers. Then one can view the factor ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} / (n)&lt;/math&gt; simply as the set &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1, \ldots, n - 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; under addition and multiplication modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Operations on Ideals ==

Given a collection of ideals we can generate other ideals. For instance it is easy to check that the intersection of any family of ideals is again an ideal. We write this simply as &lt;math&gt;\cap_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Given any set &lt;math&gt;S \subset R&lt;/math&gt; we can construct the smallest ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; which we denote by &lt;math&gt;\langle S \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. It is determined by &lt;math&gt;\langle S \rangle = \cap_{S \subset I \triangleleft R} I&lt;/math&gt;, though often we can be more explicit than this.

If &lt;math&gt;I_{j \in J}&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of ideals we can determine the ''sum'', written &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt;, as the smallest ideal containing all the ideals &lt;math&gt;I_j&lt;/math&gt;. One can check explicitly that its elements are ''finite'' sums of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} x_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally if &lt;math&gt;I,J&lt;/math&gt; are two ideals in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; one can determine the ideal-theoretic product as the smallest ideal containing the set-theoretic product &lt;math&gt;\{ i j \mid i \in I, j \in J \}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the ideal-theoretic product is in general strictly larger than the set-theoretic product, and that it simply consists of finite sums of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum i_r j_r&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i_r \in I \; j_r \in J &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example:'''
Let &lt;math&gt;(m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(n)&lt;/math&gt; the principal ideals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; just given. Then one can check explicitly that &lt;math&gt;(m) \cap (n) = (r)&lt;/math&gt;, where r is the lcm of m and n. Moreover &lt;math&gt; (m)(n) = (mn)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(m) + (n) = (s)&lt;/math&gt; where s is the hcf of m and n. Observe that &lt;math&gt;(m)(n) = (m) \cap (n)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if s = mn if and only if m and n are co-prime if and only if &lt;math&gt;(m) + (n) = (1)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Homomorphisms and Ideals ==
Rings, like groups, have factor objects that are kernels of homomorphisms. Let &lt;math&gt;f:R\to S&lt;/math&gt; be a ring homomorphism. Let us determine the structure of the kernel of ''f'' which is defined to be all elements which map to the identity.

If ''a'' and ''b'' are in the kernel of ''f'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(a)=f(b)=0&lt;/math&gt;, and ''r'' is any element of ''R'', then
:&lt;math&gt;f(a-b)=f(a)-f(b)=0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(ar)=f(a)f(r)=0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(ra)=f(r)f(a)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\ker(f)&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal of ''R''.

Also note that the homomorphism will be a monomorphism i. e. it is injective or one-to-one when the kernel consists only of the identity element.

We also have the following&lt;br /&gt;
'''Theorem''': If the only proper ideal of R is the trivial ideal {0}, then if f is a homomorphism from R to S, and it does not map all elements of R to the identity in S, then it is injective.&lt;br /&gt;
''Proof'': The kernel of the homomorphism must be an ideal, and since the only ideals are R and the trivial ideal, one of these two must be the kernel. However, since not all elements of R map to the identity of S, R is not the kernel, so the trivial ideal must be.

Since this condition is satisfied for all division rings, it is true for all division rings.

The construction of factor rings in the next section will prove that there exists a homomorphism with I as its kernel for any ideal I.

== Factor Rings ==
'''Definition:'''
Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and an ideal &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt;, the ring of cosets of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, r+I where r is within R, is written &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt;, where each coset is defined to be the set {r+i|i is an element of I}, and by Lagrange's theorem, it partitions R. This set of cosets, called the ''factor ring'' (or ''quotient ring'') of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a ring with addition defined the same way as one would define it for groups (since the ring is a group under addition), and with multiplication defined as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;(a + I)(b + I) = ab + I&lt;/math&gt;.

To show that this is independent of the choice of a and b (or, the operations are well-defined), suppose that a' and b' are elements of the same respective coset. Then a'=a+j and b'=b+k for some element j,k within I. Then a'b'=ab+ak+jb+jk and since ak, jb, and jk are elements of I, a'b' and ab must belong to the same coset, so ab+I=a'b'+I. Obviously the cosets form a group under addition because of what was proved earlier about factor groups, and furthermore the factor ring forms an abelian group under addition because the ring forms an abelian group under addition. Since the product rs+I is analogous to the multiplication in the ring, it obviously has all the properties of a ring. Furthermore, if the ring is commutative, then the factor ring will also be commutative.

Observe that there is a canonical ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\pi : R \rightarrow R / I&lt;/math&gt; determined by &lt;math&gt;\pi(r) = r+I&lt;/math&gt;, called the projection map. We record some properties of this homomorphism in the next section of the isomorphism theorems.

== Ring Isomorphism Theorems ==

We have already proved the isomorphism theorems for groups. Now we can use analogous arguments to prove the isomorphism theorems for rings, substitution the notion of &quot;normal subgroups&quot; with ideals.

=== Factor Theorem ===

Let I be an ideal of a ring R, Let &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)=x+I&lt;/math&gt; be the usual homomorphism from R to R/I. Now let f be a homomorphism from R to S. Observe that if &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi} : R/I \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism, then the composition &lt;math&gt;\phi = \tilde{\phi} \circ \pi : R \rightarrow R/I \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;I \subset \ker{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;x \in I \Rightarrow \phi(x) = \tilde{\phi} \circ \pi(x) = \tilde{\phi}(0_{R/I}) = 0_S&lt;/math&gt;). This characterizes all such morphisms in the following sense

'''Factor Theorem:'''
Let &lt;math&gt;\phi : R \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; be a ring homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;I \subset \ker{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi} : R /I \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi = \tilde{\phi} \circ \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism if and only if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is a monomorphism if and only if its kernel is I.

''Proof'' We prove it the same way we did for groups. Define &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}(x+I)&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;. To see that this is well-defined, let a+I=b+I, and so that a-b is an element of I, so that &lt;math&gt;\phi(a-b)=0_S&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\phi(a)=\phi(b)&lt;/math&gt;. Now &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism, implying that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is also. The proofs of the additional statements can be carried over from the proofs of the additional statements of the factor theorem from groups.

=== First Isomorphism Theorem ===
Let R be a ring, and let f be a homomorphism from R to S with kernel K. Then the image of f is isomorphic to R/K.

''Proof''&lt;br /&gt;
Using the factor theorem, we can find a homomorphism from R/K to S, and since the kernel is the same as the ideal used in forming the quotient group, and since the f is an epimorphism over its image, this homomorphism is an isomorphism.

=== Second Isomorphism Theorem ===
Let R be a ring, let I be an ideal, and let S be a subring.
#S+I, the set of all s+i with s within S and i within I, is a subring of R.
#I is an ideal of S+I.
#The intersection of S and I is an ideal of S.
#(S+I)/I is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;S/(S\cap I)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof''
#It can be verified that it contains 1, and is closed under multiplication.
#Of course, since I is an ideal of R, then it must be an ideal under any subring.
#From a similar argument for groups, it can only contain elements of I, but restricted to S, so it must be an ideal of S.
#Let &lt;math&gt;f: R \rightarrow R/I&lt;/math&gt; be a function restricted to the domain S, and define &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+I&lt;/math&gt;. It is obvious that its kernel is &lt;math&gt;S\cap I&lt;/math&gt; and that its image is (S+I)/I.

=== Third Isomorphism Theorem ===
Let I be an ideal of a ring R, and let J be an ideal of the same ring R that contains I. J/I is an ideal of R/I, and R/J is isomorphic to (R/I)/(J/I).

''Proof''
Define the function &lt;math&gt;f: R/I \rightarrow R/J&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;f(a+I)=a+J&lt;/math&gt; which is well-defined because since I is an ideal that is within J. This is also obviously a homomorphism. Its kernel is all elements that map onto J, and is thus all a+I such that a is within J, or J/I. Moreover, its image is R/J, and so we can use the first isomorphism theorem to prove the result.

=== Correspondence Theorem ===
Let I be an ideal of a ring R. Define the function &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to map the set of rings and ideals containing I to the set of rings and ideals of R/I, where &lt;math&gt;\pi (X)&lt;/math&gt; = the set of all cosets x+I where x is an element of X. This function is one-to-one, and the image of rings or ideals containing I are rings or ideals within R/I.

''Proof''
Define the function f from rings or ideals containing I to the rings or ideals of R/I, by f(A)=A/I. We have already proved the correspondence for addition because rings form an abelian group under addition. Thus, we need only to check for multiplication. Suppose S is a subring of R containing I. S/I is obviously closed under addition and subtraction. For multiplication, suppose that x and y are elements of S. Then (x+I)(y+I)=xy+I which is also an element of S/I, proving that it is closed under multiplication. The identity 1 is within S, and we have it that 1+I is also within S/I. Thus, S/I is a subring of R/I. Now suppose that S/I is a subring of R/I. Then it is also obvious that S is closed under addition and subtraction and multiplication, proving that S is a subring of R. Now suppose that J is an ideal of R containing I. Then by the third isomorphism theorem, J/I is an ideal of R/I. Now suppose that J/I is an ideal of R/I. Let r be any element of R, and let j be any element of J. Then since J/I is an ideal of R/I, (r+I)(j+I)=rj+I must be an element of J/I. This indicates that rj must be an element of J, proving that J is an ideal of R.

==Chinese Remainder Theorem==
=== Definitions ===
'''Definition:'''
Two elements &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; are said to be ''congruent'' in an ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; if and only if they belong to the same coset in R/I. This is true when a-b is within I. Write &lt;math&gt;a = b \bmod{I}&lt;/math&gt; to mean that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Lemma:'''
Given an ideal &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt;, a subset of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the congruence class &lt;math&gt;[r]&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of an element &lt;math&gt;r \in R&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;[0]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;r \in I&lt;/math&gt;.  To see this, simply note that &lt;math&gt;a = b \bmod{I}&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;a-b\in I&lt;/math&gt;; plugging in gives &lt;math&gt;r-0\in I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
Two natural numbers are relatively prime when ax+by=1 for integers x and y. We do the same for rings - two ideals I and J are relatively prime when ai+bj=1 for ring elements a, b, and for an element i within I and an element j within J. In other words, two ideals are relatively prime if their sum contains the identity element i. e. if I+J is the whole ring R.

We will now prove the

=== Chinese Remainder Theorem ===

Let R be a ring, and let &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; be n pairwise (i. e. when considering any two pairs) relatively prime ideals.
#Let a be a number from 1 to n. There exists an element r within R that is within all ideals &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n \neq a&lt;/math&gt;, and such that &lt;math&gt;r = 1 \bmod{I_a}&lt;/math&gt;
#Let &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2, ..., r_n&lt;/math&gt; be elements of R. Then there exists an element r within R such that &lt;math&gt;r = r_i \bmod{I_i}&lt;/math&gt; for all i=1,2,3,...,n.
#Let I be the intersection of the ideals. Another element of R, s satisfies &lt;math&gt;s = r_i \bmod{I_i}&lt;/math&gt; for all i=1,2,3,...,n if and only if &lt;math&gt;r=s \bmod{I}&lt;/math&gt;.
#R/I is isomorphic to the product ring &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i=1}^n R/I_i&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof''
#Since &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_i&lt;/math&gt; (i&gt;1) are relatively prime, there will exist an elements &lt;math&gt;b_i\in I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_i\in I_i&lt;/math&gt; (i&gt;1) such that &lt;math&gt;b_i+c_i=1&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i=2}^n (b_i+c_i)=1&lt;/math&gt;. Now we expand this product on the left side. All terms of the product other than &lt;math&gt;c_2c_3c_4...c_n&lt;/math&gt; belong to &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;c_2c_3c_4...c_n&lt;/math&gt; itself belongs the set S of all finite sums of products &lt;math&gt;x_2x_3x_4...x_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_i\in I_i&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, it can be written in the form b+a=1, where b is an element of &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;, and where a is an element of S. Then &lt;math&gt;a\equiv 1 \pmod{I_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a\equiv 0 \pmod{I_i}&lt;/math&gt; for i&gt;1.

== Prime and Maximal Ideals ==

There are two important classes of ideals in a ring - ''Prime'' and ''Maximal''.

'''Definition''':
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''prime'' if it satisfies:

for any ideals A and B such that AB is a subset of I , implies A is in I or B is in I. 

'''Definition''':
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''maximal'' if it is proper (i.e. &lt;math&gt;I \subsetneq R&lt;/math&gt; and it satisfies:

&lt;math&gt;I \subset J \triangleleft R \implies I = J \text{ or } J = R&lt;/math&gt;

That is, there are no proper ideals between &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

The following Lemma is important for many results, and it makes essential use of Zorn's Lemma (or equivalently the Axiom of Choice)

'''Lemma''':
Every non-invertible element of a ring is contained in some maximal ideal

'''Proof''':
Suppose &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the non-invertible element. Then the first observation is that &lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a proper ideal, for if &lt;math&gt;(x) = R&lt;/math&gt;, then in particular &lt;math&gt;1 \in (x)&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;1 = ax&lt;/math&gt; contradiction the assumption. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of proper ideals in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ordered by inclusion. The first observation implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, so to apply Zorn's Lemma we need only show that every increasing set of ideals contains an upper-bound. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\{ I_j \}_j&lt;/math&gt; is such an increasing set, then the least upper bound is &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in j} I_j&lt;/math&gt; as this is the smallest ideal containing each ideal. If one checks that the union &lt;math&gt;\cup_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal, then this must be &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt;. To show it's proper, we need only show &lt;math&gt;1 \notin \cup_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. But this follows precisely because each &lt;math&gt;I_j&lt;/math&gt; is proper.

Therefore by Zorn's Lemma there is a maximal element &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. It is clearly maximal for if &lt;math&gt;J'&lt;/math&gt; were any ideal satisfying &lt;math&gt;J \subset J^\prime \subsetneq R&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;J^\prime&lt;/math&gt; would be an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, and by maximality of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; we would have &lt;math&gt;J^\prime \subset J&lt;/math&gt; whence &lt;math&gt;J = J^\prime&lt;/math&gt;.

Properties of rings may be naturally restated in terms of the ideal structure. For instance

'''Proposition''':
A commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an Integral Domain if and only if &lt;math&gt;(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a prime ideal.

'''Proof''': This follows simply because &lt;math&gt;x = 0 \iff x \in (0)&lt;/math&gt;.

This explains why an Integral Domain is also referred to as a ''Prime Ring''. Similarly, we may give a necessary and sufficient condition for a ring to be a field :

'''Proposition''':
A commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a ''Field'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal (that is there are no proper ideals)

'''Proof''': We only need to show that every element &lt;math&gt;0 \neq x \in R&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. Suppose not then by Lemma ... &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some (proper) maximal ideal, a contradiction.

'''Corollary''':
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''maximal'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; is a field.

'''Proof''': By the previous Proposition we know &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; is a field if and only if its only proper ideal is &lt;math&gt;(0)&lt;/math&gt;. By the correspondence theorem (...) this happens if and only if there are no proper ideals containing &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Corollary''':
The kernel of a homomorphism f from R to S is a maximal ideal when S is a field. The proof of this follows from the first isomorphism theorem because S is isomorphic to R/ker f.

It's also clear that

'''Lemma''':
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''prime'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.

'''Proof''': Write &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; for the element of &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the equivalence class &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly every element of &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; can be written in this form.

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\bar{xy} = 0 \iff xy \in I \iff x \in I \text{ or } y \in I \iff \bar{x} = 0 \text{ or } \bar{y} = 0&lt;/math&gt; where the second equivalence follows directly because &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is prime.

&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow)&lt;/math&gt; This follows in exactly the same way.

'''Corollary''':
The kernel of a homomorphism f from R to S is a prime ideal when S is an integral domain. The proof of this follows from the first isomorphism theorem because S is isomorphic to R/ker f.

'''Lemma''':
A maximal ideal is also prime.

'''Proof''':
Suppose &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal, and &lt;math&gt;xy \in I&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose further that &lt;math&gt;x \notin I&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ideal &lt;math&gt;I + (x)&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal containing &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, so is strictly larger than &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. By maximality &lt;math&gt;I + (x) = R \ni 1&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;1 = i + rx \implies y = iy + rxy \in I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Alternatively, we can use the above two results, and the fact that all fields are integral domains to prove this.

'''Telecine''' (otherwise known as &quot;TK&quot;) is the process of transferring motion picture film to a video format, such as television, or a machine used to complete this process.  Telecine enables a motion picture, captured originally on film, to be viewed with standard video equipment, such as televisions and video cassette decks. This has allowed producers and distributors working in film to release their products on video and allowed producers to use video production equipment to complete their film projects.

==Basic principle==
In a simple telecine, white light is shone through exposed and developed motion picture negative (positives can also be used.)  As in a projector, the film filters the white light into different colors, according to the image on the film, except in a telecine this image is projected not onto a screen, but onto a charge-coupled device (CCD) or vidicon tube.  The CCD converts the light into electrical impulses which the telecine electronics modulate into a video signal which can then be recorded onto video tape, or broadcast.

The most complex part of telecine is the synchronization of the mechanical film motion and the electronic video signal.  Every time the video part of the telecine samples the light electronically, the film part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph.  This is relatively easy when the film is photographed at the same frame rate as the video camera will sample, but when this is not true, a sophisticated procedure is required to change frame rate.

==Frame rate differences==
In countries that use the PAL or SECAM video standards, film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second. The PAL video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second, so the transfer from film to video is simple; for every film frame, one video frame is captured. Theatrical features originally photographed at 24 frames per second are simply sped up by 4% to 25 frames per second. This can cause a noticeable increase in audio pitch, which is sometimes corrected using a pitch shifter.  (Note: '''frames per second'' is sometimes refered to as '''frame/s''' or '''fps'''.)

In the United States and other countries that use the NTSC television standard, film is generally photographed at 24 frames per second. (Only programs aimed directly for television in the USA are shot at 23.976 fps.)  Color NTSC video is broadcast at 29.97 frame/s.  For the film's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal, an NTSC telecine must use a technique called the 3:2 pulldown to convert from 24 to 29.97 frame/s.

Similar techniques must be used for films shot at &quot;silent speeds&quot; of less than 24 frame/s, which include most silent movies themselves as well as many home movies.

Some High Definition video recorders can record directly to 24fps (23.976fps) or 25fps so no interlacing is required. You can find out more at High-Definition Telecine.

==3:2 Pulldown==
The 3:2 pulldown is accomplished in two steps.  The first step is to slow down, or &quot;pulldown&quot; the film motion by 0.1%.  This speed change is unnoticeable to the viewer, and makes the film travel at 23.976 frame/s.  (This is done simply by slowing the projector.)

The second step of the 3:2 pulldown is the 3:2 step (which adds the extra frames needed for the conversion.)  At 23.976 frame/s, there are 4 frames of film for every 5 frames of NTSC video:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{23.976}{29.97} = \frac{4}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

These four frames are &quot;stretched&quot; into five by exploiting the interlaced nature of NTSC video.  For every NTSC frame, there are actually two complete images or &quot;fields,&quot; one for the odd-numbered lines of the image, and one for the even-numbered lines.  There are, therefore, ten fields for every 4 film frames, and the telecine alternately places one film frame across two fields, the next across three, the next across two, and so on.  The cycle repeats itself completely after four film frames have been exposed, and in the telecine cycle these are called the &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B,&quot; &quot;C,&quot; and &quot;D&quot; frames, thus:

:[[image:Three-two_pulldown_diagram_%28telecine%29.png|Three-two pulldown diagram telecine.png]]

Note that the pattern in this example is actually 2-3, 2-3.  The name &quot;3:2 pulldown&quot; is an archaic reference to the pattern that was used by older telecine equipment.  The modern telecine uses a 2-3 technique.

&quot;3:2 pulldown&quot; creates error in the video signal that can be clearly seen in the above image.  This is one reason why NTSC films viewed at home rarely appear as smooth as when viewed in a cinema.  Some line doublers and most software DVD players are designed to detect and reverse 3:2 pulldown, thereby recreating the original frames.

==One light, best light and scene to scene==

The color of the frame can be controlled during the telecine process.  This section needs to be expanded to explain one light, best light, and other terms used in the telecine process which effect the coloring of the frames and the consistency of the color from scene to scene.

Briefly, a one light transfer means that footage is transferred with no regard to variations in exposure on the original negative i.e, the telecine is set at one value to transfer all of the footage. This is the standard first step when transferring rushes to tape, it's quicker, since it requires no intervention on behalf of the telecine operator, and is therefore cheaper. Best light means that footage is graded to look it's best in every take and scene, matching original lighting conditions and the desires of the Director and DOP. Finally, scene-by-scene tries to match the light and coloring of each scene, usually after picture editing is complete. All of the above can be done with either traditional methods (photochemically etc) or digitally.

==History of Telecine==

Before the invention of video tape, telecine was used only to convert motion pictures for immediate '''broadcast''' via television.

After the invention of video tape which can be used to store motion pictures, the telecine process was also used to convert motion pictures to video tapes or LaserDiscs for '''distribution'''. 

By 1987, '''computer editing systems''' such as the '''CMX6000''' became available to edit motion pictures.  Somehow, the '''film dailies''' from a motion picture (or a television drama that was shot on film) had to be converted to a format that can be used by computer editing systems.  In the case of the CMX6000, this computer editing systems controlled the playback of LaserDiscs containing the film dailies.   To get the film dailies onto Laser Disc, the film dailies had to be telecined.  The CMX6000, EditDroid, Ediflex or Montage did '''not''' actual store the images in the computer.

A few years later, after digital video formats for computers (such as QuickTime) were invented, there needed to be a way to transfer all the frames of the film dailies onto hard disk drives of computer editing systems so the images and sound for a motion picture or television drama can be edited '''inside''' the computer, not externally as with the CMX6000, EditDroid, Ediflex or Montage.  The only practical option was to telecine the film dailies to video tape (which is a cheap storage media) before digitizing each of the frames of the video into data files for the computer editing systems.

Only in the last few years, can you telecine dailies directly to computer disks (rather than video tape.)  Be aware that most post-production houses today still cannot telecine to hard disk drives so ask before you decide which film lab you will use to develop and telecine your dailies.

;Telecine Dailies - For Theatrical Release
:When movies are edited in a computer editing systems, the film negative for the motion picture must still be cut so the movie can be projected on film in theaters.  Therefore, the computer editing systems must work at exactly 24.00 frames per second, not 29.97 (in the case of NTSC video) or 25 frames per second (in the case of PAL video).  Unfortunately, there is no video format which works at exactly 24.00 frames per second.  This causes no end of problems. (Note: Cutting the negative is called &quot;Conforming the Negative&quot; so that it conforms to the edit done on the computer editing systems.)

;Telecine Dailies - Direct to Video Tape
:Even if a motion picture will be edited on video and release on DVD-Video disk, it must edited at approximately 24 frames per second, not 29.97 frames per second.  '''All motion picture shot on film and released on NTSC DVD-Video disk in Hollywood are stored on the DVD-Video disk at '''23.976''' frames per second.  Motion pictures on NTSC DVD-Video disk are never stored 29.97 frames per second.'''  This is probably the most common misconception of beginning filmmakers.  The reason is motion pictures stored at 24 frames per second can be much higher resolution than motion pictures shot on video at 29.97 frames per second since a motion picture at 24 frames per second contains fewer frames that must be compressed into the very limited bandwidth of a DVD-Video disk.  (Actually, this is not a great problem '''until''' you add multiple audio track which also have to fit in the limited bandwidth of a DVD data stream.)

===Telecine for Dailies===

Today, video tape remains the cheapest and (ugh!) the most convenient method of storing dailies which have been telecined.  Therefore, film editors have two choices when working with film dailies:

;1.  Do an Inverse Telecine
:One option is to '''telecine''' to video, then digitize all the frames, but finally do an '''inverse telecine''' to throw away the unwanted fields and frames so that your disk drive only holds actual film frames.  In this case, there is a one-to-one relationship with the original film negative.  This is a very clean solution... but most computer editing systems do not work this way.

;2.  Software Solution (such as CineTools)
:The other option is to '''telecine''' to video and then digitize all the frames (even the duplicate frames created during the telecine process) for storage on a hard drive. Then use a computer program to keep track of '''bad''' frames while you edit the motion picture so you only see the good frames and you never edit on a bad frame.  This is wasteful and confusing but because video tapes are so cheap and disk drives are so expensive, most everyone uses this method.

===NTSC Inverse Telecine===

The '''inverse telecine''' process is the opposite of the telecine process (at least in theory).  Inverse telecine is the process of taking '''video''' at 29.97 frames per second (59.94 fields per second) and converting them back to exactly 24.00 frames per second.  In practice, most computer software will inverse telecine NTSC video back to 23.976 frames per second Computer programs such as Media Cleaner and Adobe AfterEffects have an '''inverse telecine''' feature.  Actually, these programs only do half the job (remove the 3/2 pull down) and ignore the rest (specifically correcting the audio speed)... which most of the time is acceptable.

To repeat what is said above, telecine is really a two step process:

:1.  Slow down the projection of the film from 24.00 to 23.976 (24.00*1000/1001) frames per second.

:2.  Add extra fields and frames to convert 23.976 frames per second to 29.97 (30.00*1000/1001) frames per second for NTSC video.

====Practical Example====
Computer programs such as Media Cleaner and Adobe AfterEffects only reverse step 2, not step 1.  In some cases, this does not matter.  Here is an example:

;Wrong but Easy
:The [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop] creates editing workshops from dramatic scenes shot on 35mm film for film students to edit with Final Cut Pro at 24 frames per second on a Macintosh computer.   After the dailies have been telecined, the dailies are delivered on either NTSC video tape or NTSC DVD-Video disks.  First, Adobe AfterEffects is used to '''inverse telecine''' the footage from 29.97 frames per second (interlaced) to 23.976 frames per second (progressive). Then QuickTime Movie Player is used to '''compress''' the movie clips at 24.00 frames per second which means that occasionally (every 1000 frames), the program duplicates one frame to keep the audio in sync with the picture.

:Hopefully, you notice that this is '''not''' the correct way to do an inverse telecine.  Using this method, any edit created using these dailies can '''never''' be matched back to the original negative.  Because of the occasional duplicate frame, the frame numbers will be '''wrong'''.  But for training film students, this is good enough.

:To do this correctly, the Star Movie Shop should change the speed of the audio from 23.976 frames per second to 24.000 frames per second as well as change the projection speed of the QuickTime movie clips from 23.976 to 24.000.  Correcting the audio is not easy... so they don't.  They just add duplicate frames instead.  (Note:  No one has ever complained!!!)



== Amateur telecine of Super 8mm footage: ==


Here is a free way to telecine your Super 8mm footage for personal use. The method can also applied to other film gauges with the relevant equipment. It is based on the initial telecine method of shooting the projection screen. However, attention must be given to obtain good results. If you think that you just point and shoot, forget it! The result will be very disappointing. You have to do exactly as described, mainly calibrate the video camera correctly and eliminate flicker.

'''History:'''

My father has a moderate collection of Super 8mm movies, either bought (mostly cartoons and B&amp;W comedies) or shot back in the 80's with an amateur Canon Super 8mm sound camera. In the late 70's, early 80's when me and my sister were little, video was rare and expensive, at least in Greece, so our only source of entertainment was a black and white TV or cartoons on Super 8mm films. My father had bought quite a lot of these and made a good collection of Disney and Warner Bros classics. He had even spliced some of these in longer reels to keep us busy for more time. Of course he shot amateur films in every occasion (mostly at 18fps, which was similar to the LP mode in video-cameras), much like we shoot video today. Back in 1993, I decided to transfer all these memories to video for easier watching and sharing with friends. When I asked at our local photo lab I was astonished to hear a rather high price per 50ft reel (about 30€ which back in 1993 was much more valuable than today in 2006), and this was simply transferring the movies to a humble VHS tape, not any correction included, (and of course DV tapes and DVD didn't exist back in 1993)! Meanwhile, I had bought my Sony Handycam TR-805E Hi-8 camera that year which was the best (EISA Award for best camcorder 1992-1993), according to a popular Greek magazine called Hitech. Yes it had many features first seen in this particular model like optical steady shot, 400 lines resolution, manual controls etc. So I quickly decided to telecine the films myself, for free, using that camera. Of course I hadn't done it before, so first results were not satisfactory. But a tape can be re-recorded, so I tried again and again until I mastered the technique. So fellow amateurs don't worry! If you do EXACTLY what I describe below you will get good results, even with the first time!


'''Equipment:'''

1) Super 8mm (or whatever) film projector with variable projection speed.

2) Video-camera with manual exposure, focus, color balance and external mic in socket. Preferably a PAL version at 25fps which makes eliminating flicker easier (see below).

3) A good quality matte A4 white sheet of paper used as screen. Thick paper is better as it is easier to stretch it to keep it smooth.

4) Tripod to mount the camera.

5) A color monitor, preferably without overscan (so avoid a TV, use PC monitor if possible).

6) Headphones and other appropriate connection cables and adapters.


You could clean and lubricate your film if desired, and then you are ready to proceed...


'''Setup of the system:'''

The white A4 sheet of paper should be stuck on a wall. To avoid adhesive tape showing on the video you should use tape that sticks on both sides and put it at the back side of the paper. I use regular tape but create a little loop so it sticks both sides, and I place it at the back of each corner of the A4 paper. Thick paper is better. When you stick the paper make sure it is stretched and looks straight. If you have a smooth matte white wall you could use that instead. Avoid projection screens as they are not white and they are not smooth. Place the projector directly in front of the A4 paper or white wall. Make sure it is as centered to the screen as possible and doesn't project from an angle, either horizontal or vertical as this will give a distorted trapezoidal image! Mount your video-camera on the tripod and make sure it frames the A4 paper as centered as possible, again avoid any large angles which will distort the image. If your projector has sound editing capabilities, it should have a audio monitor output or external speakers output. Connect that with the camera's external microphone socket, using appropriate adapters if required. Don't load tape or disc to the camera yet. Most consumer cameras will switch off if not recording for several seconds. To avoid that simply don't load the tape/disc so it will stay on as long as it takes for you to calibrate your setup (see below). Connect the TV or computer monitor (via video or TV card) to assist framing etc. Connect headphones to the camera to assist sound setup (see below). Needless to say that the video-camera should be mains-powered to avoid switching off during the process! Don't load the projector with film yet...

'''Finding and locking the white balance:'''

Without film in the projector, project to the A4 paper. Use the zoom function (if applicable) to make the projected image as small as possible. This will help enhancing the video dynamic range (since the image will be as bright as it gets, we will set the exposure so as not to washout highlights and leave the camera cover darker tones as good as it can, see below). Adjust the projector if necessary so the white rectangle is projected at the center of the A4 paper. Frame the white rectangle with the camera, and zoom in enough to make sure that all the camera's sensor is filled with white. You may also deliberately blur the image a little (using the camera's focus control) to make white appear more uniform. Leave the camera to obtain the white balance automatically. After several seconds which ensure the camera has made up its mind on the white point, HOLD it using the appropriate control. This will ensure it is not affected by the scene lighting or color variations during recording. For cameras that allow manual white balance in small steps you could fine-tune it but rely on a good calibrated monitor for this, avoid the viewfinder or the camera monitor! I would suggest not to touch the white balance once locked. At this point bear in mind that some films (e.g., Disney cartoons) are color balanced for a Super 8mm projector's yellow light so they might appear a bit blue if balanced as above, but I personally don't mind as this can be fixed digitally later. If you are using a PC monitor, make sure it is well calibrated so your movie color and brightness appears correctly. Most monitors allow a &quot;user color&quot; setting. If you use that and set all three primary colors to the same value (e.g., 80% or 100%) you will almost always have correct white balance. The application used to watch the video image should have its color settings reset to default. Any errors can be corrected during editing later. I once had changed the color settings in the video application for another capture and I forgot to reset these to default, so the film image appeared bluer. When I tried to &quot;correct&quot; this altering the white balance from the camera, I resulted with yellowish video! So don't touch ANY controls once adjusted, especially from the camera! For B&amp;W films you could enable the B&amp;W or sepia effect (for cameras that support it), but I would rather record it as &quot;color&quot; to have a more realistic look (B&amp;W effect would make it look more like B&amp;W TV broadcast, rather than B&amp;W film). So we have white balance fixed, let's proceed with...

'''Adjusting the focus:'''

At this point you have to load a short film in the projector. If you are quick enough you can do all of the rest calibrations before it runs out. While projecting on the A4 sheet, focus the projector as sharp as possible. Then zoom out and frame roughly the camera so it sees all the image and manually focus it. Leave focus to manual so it is not affected with scene changes. Using the monitor frame the camera as good as possible so you don't crop the projected image, but not let any annoying black areas either. If the aspect ratio doesn't match, then make sure you don't crop the horizontal dimension while centering the vertical dimension. Focus again if necessary. Bear in mind that if you change reels you may have to fine-tune focus of the projector. Also focus may be lost between spliced sections, if the splicing is not very good. If you use a computer monitor to avoid overscan, I suggest watching the video in a window so to assist perfect framing. If you only have a TV monitor you could zoom in by one or two steps to make sure there are no black areas around the projected image.

'''Adjusting the exposure:'''

While watching the image, manually adjust the camera exposure so it doesn't wash out light areas (highlights) and let camera cover darker areas as best as it can. This is because it is preferable to lose some information of the dark areas (which might not be that obvious) than wash out light areas which will be very annoying. Hopefully newer digital cameras will have greater dynamic range than my old analog Hi-8 had and should give better results. Let exposure to manual so it is not affected with lighting and scene changes. Hopefully the lighting will be the same for most of the movie, but in some amateur films there are differences notably between outdoor and indoor scenes. Don't worry some of it can be corrected digitally. Don't touch the exposure! Again, if you are using a PC monitor make sure is well calibrated for our dark working environment (brightness and contrast) and that the video application's color/brightness/contrast settings are reset to default. Due to gamma difference between TV/video and a PC monitor the image might appear a bit darker. This is normal, adjust the exposure as described above and don't worry. The same video played back on a TV monitor should look normal since it will have the correct gamma value.

'''The trickiest part, eliminating flicker:'''

To eliminate flicker, we have to match the projection frame rate with the camera frame rate. For PAL cameras this is relatively easy. We adjust the projection speed to 25fps for 24fps footage or to 16.66fps (50/3) for 18fps footage using a variable speed projector. Audio pitch difference is negligible and should not concern an amateur. A different approach is to adjust the shutter speed in cameras that support it. Mine doesn't so I cannot tell how good that works. I can tell that I was able to almost eliminate flicker by carefully adjusting the projection speed as described above. For NTSC users you could project at 20fps (60/3) for both 24fps or 18fps footage but the audio pitch difference might be very annoying, and not all variable speed projectors support that large variation of ±2 or ±4fps (my Chinon 9600 only supports ±1.5fps for example). I only have a PAL camera model, so I cannot tell how bad audio pitch difference sounds at 20fps. Later you could speed up or slow down the movie as appropriate to restore audio pitch, using a video editing software which supports this feature (eg Adobe Premiere). Of course you should rely on your monitor to eliminate flicker, not the camera viewfinder or built-in monitor! A CRT monitor is preferable since LCD monitors tend to hide flicker if it is small. Of course make sure the refresh rate (for CRT PC monitors) is set to highest possible for the used resolution, so as not to mistake monitor's flicker as film's flicker. Color depth should also be at least 16-bit or higher to assist color balance. Have in mind that when changing reels you may need to readjust the projection speed to eliminate flicker again. Also I am not sure if enabling the steady shot feature will help, but I do it anyway just to be on the safe side. Besides, since the video-camera is mains-powered we shouldn't worry about the higher power consumption. For new digital cameras that support it, you could try the 24fps setting (for 24fps films only), provided the image aspect ratio is not affected (in some models setting 24fps capture may also set 16:9 mode). Also enabling progressive mode (if supported) will improve image quality, regardless of the frame rate setting. Unfortunatelly my old analog Hi-8 camera doesn't support either of the two, so I don't know how much they help.

'''Adjusting the audio recording level for sound films:'''

It is recommended to use headphones for this as with speakers you may not notice much of the noise. Since we will be using the camera's external microphone input, it is usually boosted to improve reception, or in our case to distort sound! Using the headphones lower the volume a lot until you don't hear any distortion or the distortion is as small as it gets. Make sure the sound is heard as clear as it gets albeit if you cannot remove noise 100%. Usually a small noise is not audible in normal listening conditions through the TV loudspeakers. It only becomes audible in a very quiet environment or using headphones, so an amateur should not worry too much. Some video editing applications can also clean noisy soundtracks in some degree, if necessary, but again I wouldn't bother if noise is not audible in normal listening conditions.

'''What about my silent films?'''

If you have silent films I suggest that you set the projector to &quot;silent&quot; mode (if applicable) and switch off the internal camera microphone. Many will rush to say this is not possible with consumer cameras. Don't worry, here is a trick I have used: Connect a cable in the external microphone input but leave the other end unconnected. This will switch off the internal microphone in order to use the &quot;external&quot; one supposedly connected to the external microphone input. Always use your headphones to confirm no sound is recorded as a bad connection could record electronic noise and spoil the movie (unless you are willing to mute your TV set when watching your silent films). Don't forget to switch back to &quot;Magnetic&quot; or &quot;Optical&quot; mode for your sound films!

'''Ready to telecine your films?'''

Rewind the short reel you used to calibrate your setup. Load carefully the projector with the actual film you want to telecine, making sure you don't move the projector! Load carefully the tape or disc in the camera without moving it. If there is a remote control for the camera, it is a good idea to use it to avoid any accidental movement. Set the projection switch to THREAD (or similar) position and make sure the film leader is properly wound on the take up reel, even if it supposed to do that automatically, to avoid damage while projection. Do not thread it too much however, but keep it as far from the beginning of the movie as possible, so you won't miss the start! Switch off the projector. Turn off all lights to make sure stray light doesn't affect the projected image so the colors will look as vivid as it's possible (stray light reduces saturation and makes old films look even fader). If it is daytime darken the room as best as you can and use only a very small light (about 2 or 4 watts) away from the projection screen. It is recommended that all calibration is done in these final dark conditions for best results. When ready start projecting immediately and then start recording as fast as you can. If you don't mind leaving some blank seconds on the tape, you could start recording first, to make sure you won't miss the film start if the film leader is too short and the movie is almost starting. Fine-tune the focus of the projector carefully, if required, avoiding to blur the image. If you are familiar with your projector you should be able to know which way to turn the focus knob to avoid blurring the image accidentally. Wear your headphones for a few seconds, make sure sound is recorded as expected (I have had some bad experiences), or no sound is recorded at all for silent movies. When finished with one reel, rewind and change reels carefully without moving the projector. Refocus the new reel if required. Never leave the projector unattended as the picture may jump and you have to press the relevant release button briefly. If you fail to do so, the rest of your movie will be jumping and useless and you may damage the sprocket holes of the rest of the film. Don't even think about fixing a jumping movie digitally. It is virtually impossible. It is better to telecine that again. Other problem that I have seen is that the framing of the projector is lost and the upper or lower area of the picture shows the adjacent frame. This usually happens between spliced sections (not perfect splices) and can be corrected with the relevant knob which moves the projection gate vertically. Once familiar with the projector you should know which way to turn it to correct rather than pronounce the error. Usually the overscan feature of a TV will hide a small framing error, but I personally prefer to be as perfect as I can.

'''Digitizing tips:'''

*  If you want to digitally edit your video, of course you must first import it in a computer. When using a digital camera, video is already in digital form and is transferred as is to a computer (provided you use a DV cable, not analog cables!) or converted to other digital format (eg MPEG 2 for DVD authoring). So with the right software you can edit your footage in some degree. Remember that if the recording is not good enough you cannot do wonders, at least not with consumer level software.
*  If you are using an analog camera (or a digital connected with analog cables for some reason), make sure film flicker is totally eliminated or as small as it gets. This is because when digitizing the video using consumer level cards (such as TV tuner cards) the flicker will most likely be pronounced. I have seen some of my early telecine attempts that they have only negligible and hardly visible flicker when watched on a TV, but too much when the same footage is digitized. This usually appears like the picture is perfectly exposed for a moment and then overexposed and washed out. This cycle repeats about every half second or faster while watching and it is very annoying. No matter what settings I chose to digitize that footage, I could not avoid this annoying effect. Thankfully newer TV tuner cards do not suffer that much as my old Matrox Rainbow Runner I used back in the 90's but the problem still exists! And don't forget that the best analog connection (that cameras support) is S-Video, so prefer that over the simpler composite output. Also if you use the dual RCA audio outputs, you should get better quality than the headphones output.
*  Also for best results I recommend to capture the video (analog source) or convert it during transfer from the camera (digital source, DV connection) using the desired final resolution, such as 720x576 for DVD or 352x288 for Video-CD. Using larger resolution and then resizing could give better results but it takes more hard disk space and rendering time. If you don't want to make any corrections other than cut and merge, using the final desired resolution will make rendering times much shorter as scaling is time and resource consuming. Also make sure you capture (or convert for DV cameras) directly to the final desired format such as MPEG 2 for DVD, if your capture card/software allows. Of course you should capture at 25fps for PAL or 29.97fps for NTSC, to match the camera rate, NOT 24fps (unless video was shot at 24fps) or you will negate any flickering elimination efforts made!
*  If you first capture to AVI or MOV/QT for MAC computers (usually M-JPEG compressed) and then convert to MPEG (as with older capture cards that didn't support MPEG capturing), will make editing easier (most programs work with AVI/MOV/QT rather than MPEG files) but will make rendering time larger (conversion between formats is time consuming). Also if you compress the video in one format (eg M-JPEG for AVI/MOV/QT capture) and then convert to another, the video is re-encoded, even for simple cut and merge functions, and quality degrades. This is also true for scaling, so use final specifications (format, resolution, color depth etc) directly. There are several programs to edit MPEG video, such as Pinnacle Studio and some freeware too (eg TMPGEnc, search on the internet with keywords such as &quot;MPEG editing&quot;).
*  During editing keep changes confined to the scene concerned (unless most of your film needs correction) to shorten rendering times and keep degradation from re-encoding to the minimum. A clever trick is to cut out the parts that need corrections or effects or titles, edit them separately and then merge them with the rest of the movie using references to the original video file for the unedited parts. If you do all of this keeping the SAME specifications, most programs will merge all the footage WITHOUT re-encoding (recompressing) the unedited parts, so there will be no degradation at all in the unedited parts (since basically their data will be copied directly from the original video file, rather than being processed)! This also saves much time since copying a digital file is much faster than creating it form start. (Processor only takes notice when starting to copy rather than being involved the whole time, whereas when creating the file all job is supervised by the processor).
*  If you want to make a DIVX video or similar MPEG 4 format, avoid capturing directly to MPEG 4 format, since MPEG 4 compression on the fly is very CPU and memory demanding and you will most likely get a lot of compression artifacts. It is best to capture to high quality M-JPEG compression (AVI/MOV/QT) or MPEG 2 format and convert to DIVX later. When you have finished editing your film in the original format, render it as a video file of the original capture format using the same specifications to minimize compression artifacts, as explained above. Then convert the final rendered file to DIVX or similar MPEG 4 format using as large bitrate as you can (provided the final video fits on a CD if you want to save it on CD) and of course select the best possible quality setting (this in DIVX PRO 5 and above is called &quot;insane quality&quot;). Conversion utilities include QuickTime Pro (for MOV/QT files), VirtualDub and its variants (for M-JPEG AVI to DIVX AVI conversion), FlaskMPEG, XMPEG Pro (for MPEG to AVI DIVX conversion) DIVX PRO Encoder (for MPEG/AVI/MOV/QT to DIV/DIVX format or AVI/MOV/QT DIVX format) and many more. There is no need for dual or multi-pass encoding, if you set enough bitrate (at least above 700 Kbit/sec for 720x576) and best possible quality. As a novice guide, 700Kbit/sec video data rate and 96kbit/sec audio data rate will fit 2 hours of video in a 80min (700MB) CD-R disc. Keeping audio data rate at 96Kbit/sec, for up to 90 minutes use 960 Kbit/sec video data rate which will give far better quality. For up to 60 minutes use 1500Kbit/sec which will give excellent quality for standard definition video (720x576 for PAL, 720x480 for NTSC).
*  For DVD Authoring you have to convert the final rendered video file in MPEG 2 (MPG/MPEG) if it is not already in this format (some consumer level DVD Authoring applications may also accept AVI/MOV/QT files, but it is not recommended as their rendering quality is usually inferior to that of a dedicated video editing application) and as for the bitrate, 5000 Kbit/sec is the minimum acceptable quality and will fit 2 hours in a standard (single layer) DVD disc, while 9500 Kbit/sec is the maximum DVD compatible (not all consumer grade programs support it) and will give about 1 hour of excellent quality on the same disc. Of course you can use anything between but don't forget to use the SAME settings from capturing, editing and to the final rendering to avoid unnecessary re-encoding and minimize compression artifacts. If you had set rather high bitrates and the final DVD files don't fit in a single layer DVD (about 4480MB), don't worry. You can use Nero Recode, DVD Shrink or similar utility to recompress it at exactly 4480MB. To minimise degradation use dual pass encoding (this in DVD Shrink is called Deep Analysis). This may take some more time, but for sizes about 75% to 100% of the original DVD folder size, you won't notice any difference.
*  For DVD audio you can either use Dolby Digital 2.0 (Stereo) or MPEG Layer II format. I consider 192 Kbit/sec adequate, so you leave more space for video data on a DVD disc. Of course Dolby Digital 2.0 will give better sound than MPEG at the same bitrate since it is more efficiently compressed than the much older MPEG Layer II and it is compared to MP3 (MPEG Layer III) compression which at 192 Kbit/sec Stereo is almost CD quality. Of course the audio format for DVD compatibility is 48000Hz (48KHz) 16-bit per channel, and Stereo or Mono. Don't make the common mistake to capture at 44.1KHz (CD quality) because later you may experience audio sync problems when the DVD Authoring application may wrongly suppose audio is at 48Khz (DVD compatible)! Yes, I have seen this problem in consumer grade DVD Authoring applications, for example Sonic DVDIt. Fortunately most video capturing applications will force the correct settings if the DVD template is chosen.
*  DVD Audio Note: Most consumer level video capture applications do not support audio capturing directly at Dolby Digital 2.0 format, even if the DVD template is chosen. Don't worry, you can capture audio at MPEG Layer II format and convert it to Dolby Digital 2.0 at the Authoring stage using a compatible DVD Authoring application, such as Pinnacle Studio Pro, DVDIt! etc (degradation in quality from conversion between audio formats is not gererally noticeable as it is when converting video from one format to another). For better quality you could try capturing at a higher rate (eg 256Kbit/sec or 384Kbit/sec) for MPEG sound and then select to encode sound to 192Kbit/sec Dolby Digital 2.0 in the Authoring application before proceeding with the rendering step. Don't forget the 48KHz setting, or you will most likely end up with audio sync problems which cannot be fixed!!! You will have to render the DVD data again, provided the original audio format is in 48KHz, otherwise you may have to capture the video again! So take care to avoid frustration! I cannot emphazise more the need to use correct settings for the intended final video format (eg DVD). And don't forget: Using the same settings (resolution, bitrare etc) from capturing to rendering will save you time and provide the best possible quality for the selected settings, based on your hardware and software used.

When calibrating your telecine setup as good as it gets, the results are amazingly good considering the method used, and best of all it is for FREE!

I hope that this amateur telecine guide was helpful. Good luck to anyone trying that. I know the video digitization section should be in another place in Wikipedia and Moviemaker Manual. Excuse me for this lengthy reference to video digitization, but I was trying to help novices.

===Film Editing Software===

Apple Computer develops Cinema Tools with Final Cut Pro.  Final Cut Pro (and Cinema Tools) are purchased as part of Final Cut Studio.  You use Cinema Tools to keep track of all the original frames for each piece of film before it was telecined into the computer.  '''NOTE: Please explain the Cinema Tools process.&quot;''

==Resolutions==
* 4k - 4,096 pixels across
* 2k - 2,048 pixels across
* 1k - 1,024 pixels across
* HD - 1920 x 1080 called also as 1080p or 1080i 
     - 1280 x 720  called also as 720p or 720i
        p = progressive, i = interlaced frame's
* PAL -  720 x 576 
* NTSC - 720 x 480 

It's unlikely that your telecine machine will be able to capture high resolution images in 'real time'.  For example, most telecine machines can only do a 4k capture at about 6 frames per second.

In comparison, I had once read in a Super 8mm newsgroup that Kodachrome 40 (discontinued in 2005) had a resolution of approximately 2048x1536 (3 Megapixels). This was determined experimentally by a poster, and it means that if film had discrete pixels like digital video, Super 8mm Kodachrome could capture at 2048x1536 resolution (2K). Super8 mm film is snubbed by some professional filmmakers, who state that it can show limited detail (and a lot of grain) compared with larger formats. But even this humble format can show better definition than HD video (currently 1920x1080 maximum).

==Lighting Conventions==
Broadcast, Video, and Film Productions share common lighting conventions. Due to the fact that most lighting tools were originally developed for film, with a few tools introduced for video, the equipment carries ratings and specifications are standardized for film. All the lighting tools found in a decently equipped video production studio have direct relatives (usually just larger, brighter and more expensive) in a film production studio.

==Electricity==
Every lighting fixture uses electricity. How much it requires and in what form varies on the application of the light(s). The electrical description consists of Voltage, Amperage, and Wattage. Commonly, studio lights use 115± (plus or minus) 5 Volts (''V'') or &quot;225±5 V&quot;. The amperages (''amperes'' or ''amps'') and wattages (''Watts'' or ''W'') vary depending on the fixture, bulb type, and light output. 115V lights range from 10W (LEDs) up to 2000W-2500W (Halogen-Quartz), 225V range also from 10W to 4500W-5000W.

==Terminology==

;Bulbs: Refers to the actual light source. Most bulbs consist of a filament, insulating gas, and a glass encasement.  Also known as &quot;lamps,&quot; or &quot;globes.&quot;
;Fixtures: The cases or enclosures that hold a bulb, and often serve the purpose of directing the light. Fixtures range from simple bulb holders (such as ''clamp lights''), to elaborate mechanisms (such as ''Source Four'').  Also known as &quot;heads,&quot; or &quot;instruments.&quot;
;Mounts: A device that holds the light where you want it to be. Some clamp to overhead lighting grids, while others are stands.
;Power (''AC''): The power source or the power supply. Where the light is getting its electricity.

==Lighting equipment==

[[Image:Lighting_kit.jpg|thumb|150px|Lighting kit just after it's been loaded off the van.  [http://jack-kelly.com/gallery More production stills here.]]]

Lighting equipment consists of a great deal more than just sockets with bulbs. Lighting equipment (briefly) consists of bulbs, fixtures, dimmers/power units, mounts, light control/quality.

=====Redheads=====
Redheads are a specific type of open-faced light made by [http://www.ianiro.com/ Ianiro]. They usually offer tungsten 1000W. They are also known as Mickey-Moles (when made by Mole-Richardson). The term Redhead comes from the reddish color of the original fiber casing and is often used to loosely describe smaller, open-faced lights.

=====Blondes=====
Blondes are a 2k open-faced light. Because they are open-faced, they tend to put out more light than a 2k Fresnel.

==Bulb Types==
Video/Film recording lights use many different bulb types. Some are standards from Edison (tungsten) but others are cutting edge of the 2000s (LED). Most bulb types use a filament-ignition process to produce light. A wire of some electrically excitable material is put under voltage in an oxygen-depleted environment, causing it to 'burn' without lighting afire. Fluorescent bulbs and LEDs function rather differently from filament bulbs. 

===Tungsten===
A tungsten light is basically a more powerful version of a common household light bulb. While a household light bulb may only take a few hundred watts at most, lights that are used to light film sets are easily 1000 watts (1K) and often over 20,000 watts (20K). The tungsten light bulb naturally produces an orange hue, similar to indoor lights. Tungsten lights have a color temperature ranging from 3200 to 3400 Kelvin. One typically uses a [[CTB (''color temperature blue'') filter]] to balance the color temperature with outdoor or HMI light.

===Halogen-Quartz===
Halogen-Quartz bulbs, often known as &quot;Halogens&quot; or &quot;Quartz&quot; are a staple of lighting. Halogens rarely posses a color temperature outside of 3200°K. These same bulbs are often used in car headlights, portable work-lights, and recently in house-decor lighting. The bulbs come in wattages ranging from 15W-3500W. Additionally they are manufactured in a wide range of enclosures, bases, and connectors. Common are the &quot;T&quot;, and bayonet base. Halogens emit significant amounts of heat during operation, so much so that oils on the glass surface of the bulb case lead to uneven heat distribution and rupturing (through thermal shock to the glass) or heat build-up and exploding gas within the bulb.

===HMI===
An HMI light is used very often to light film sets. One requires a ballast in order to power and creates a loud noise when turning on, so it is set protocol to yell &quot;striking&quot; in order to warn others on set to both ignore the noise and avoid looking at the light. The HMI light is a different type of light bulb than the more common tungsten. An HMI emits ultra-violet lights and emits a blue hue. HMI lights produce a color temperature around 5600 Kelvin. One typically use a [[CTO (''color temperature orange'') filter]] to balance the color temperature with indoor or tungsten light.

===Fluorescent===
Fluorescent bulbs were not used for lighting film and video until recently. This was because of problems with flicker and a tendency to emit more of a greenish hue. The Fluorescent lights used in film now are made to be flicker-free and come in both daylight and tungsten balanced bulbs. &quot;Kino-flo&quot; is one of the major companies involved in making fluorescent bulbs and fixtures for film and video production. Fluorescent lights tend to be very soft, but do not put out much light in comparison to other lighting instruments.

===LED===
Until the last five to ten years Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) have seen little implementation. Recent advances in production costs and chemical advances used in the diode junctions have led to inexpensive LED 'bulbs' as well as even color temperatures in multiple bulbs. LEDs are manufactured in all colors, and white comes in many color temperatures; 3200K being the most common, but ranging from 3000K to 5600K+. Diodes, due to their engineered design tend to have a very directional light. The front lens is parabolic, focusing the light to a small dot even several meters away.

==Light Control, Quality, and Appearance==

===Lighting Shape/Area===

There are a number of tools used to control where light falls. Often these are used to prevent light falling where it is not needed. In other circumstances a pattern created by the light is desired.

====Barn Doors====
Perhaps the most common form of lighting area shaping, barn doors are found around the front outside of the fixture. Most commonly there are four barn doors forming a square around the fixture, but the numbers vary for specialty applications.

Basically, barn doors block the light from hitting an area of the set or frame you don't want them to. They swing towards and away from the fixture opening.

====Gobos====
Gobos shape the light. Many gobos appear to be shapes cut in a cookie sheet (and indeed many are) but they consist of a material able to withstand the heat put out by the fixture, with shapes cut out for the light to travel through.

Think of gobos as jack o' lanterns.

====Flags &amp; Cutters====
A flag or cutter can be any item that blocks light. A standard flag on set can be of varying sizes. The standard flag is attached to a small metal handle and short rod that can be attached to a C-Stand and placed so that it blocks the light from hitting something in the shot. Flags can be used to prevent light from hitting background walls, for example, leaving only the central subject/s in the light.

Types of flags include singles &amp; doubles to cut down hard light. Solids to block light. Silks, though similar, are translucent and used to diffuse, rather than block light.

====Blackwrap====

Blackwrap is essentially aluminum foil, but covered in black paint. It is often used to block light and kill any spill from a light.  Blackwrap can be shaped however you like to affect where the light falls.  It is useful in narrowing larger lights to point lights or spots or making lights non-circular.  It is very inexpensive, light weight and more flexible than barn doors.  However, it will burn on too hot a light, so watch for smoke.  Blackwrap(TM) is a product from the company, Gam Products Inc.  A similar product, CineFoil(TM) is made by Rosco Laboratories Inc.

===Lighting Intensity===

====Focus====
Adjusting the focus on a focusable light changes the distance between the actual bulb and a lens at the end of the light.  This affects how diffuse the light is.  Closer to the lens spreads the light out more, whereas farther back makes it closer to a spot.  Try to do this before the light gets too hot, so you can adjust it without burning yourself.

====Neutral Density Filters====

Neutral density filters are a variety of gel (or camera filter) which reduces all colors of light equally, making a light less intense without altering its color.  This can be added on top of color gels or used on its own to make a light less intense.

===Lighting Quality===


====Gels====
Gels are thin and translucent. They come in rolls that can be cut into a more manageable size when needed. While a gel can be any color, there are two main colors which are referred to as Color Temperature Orange (CTO) and Color Temperature Blue (CTB). These two types of gel are respectively orange and blue, with varying degrees of darkness broken up into 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and Full. Full is the darkest and 1/8 is the lightest. When asking for a gel, one may say &quot;I'd like a quarter CTO put on this light.&quot;

Gels are attached to a light in order to alter their color temperature. Tungsten lights produce an orange hue, while HMI's produce a blue hue. If filming outside with tungsten lights, gels would be needed to match the color temperature of the daylight if the DP wanted all the light to be the same color temperature. Daylight produces a blue hue like an HMI light, so CTB would be needed to be placed on all the tungsten lights. Gels are attached to lights with clothespins, also called &quot;C-47's.&quot;

Besides CTO and CTB, to work with fluorescent lights or a &quot;kino flo&quot;, there are &quot;plus green&quot; and &quot;minus green&quot; gels. Since fluorescent lights produce a green hue, a minus green gel would remove the green hue from a fluorescent light and a plus green gel would help match a non-fluorescent light to a fluorescent.

=====Attaching=====
Some lights have clips for attaching gels, but the most common method of attaching them is via wooden clothespins (also referred to as C47s, pegs, or bullets).  These clothespins will begin to smoke before the gels, so you can prevent your gels from being ruined, and they also don't conduct heat, so they can be manipulated even on a very hot light.  They can also be reversed to give them a longer mouth, allowing you to use them to pull scrims from hot fixtures. Once reversed, they often go by C-74's or &quot;scrim pullers&quot;.

==General Lighting==

Here is the nitty-gritty of the page. Although different formats have varying needs in both quantity and quality of light, the underlying yet critical concepts of lighting are fairly applicable to any medium.

==Lighting Digital Video==

'''Dynamic range'''. There are many differences between [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dv DV] and film, but one that particularily stands out regarding lighting is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stops_%28Dynamic_Range%29 dynamic range].

Most DV and video cameras have a relatively low dynamic range. (I.ex. the Sony PD150 has about 4-5 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stops_%28Dynamic_Range%29 stops], and Kodak's 50D film has up to 11). This means the range between the completely black and the whitest white is very low. One therefore has to keep this in mind while lighting. This has been an integral part of cinematography since the beginning. Controlling so one can see details in the darkest area of an image, and also in the brightest. One can always adjust the contrast in post ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading Colorgrading]). This style of working is called shooting for post. (The DV standard has an ok light intensity resolution, so adjusting contrast in post is not as difficult as adjusting color.)

'''White balance'''. As the DV standard has a low color-resolution, it is important to control and know how to filter and white balance the image on set. It has been proved difficult to adjust color in post with a good result, although it has been done. Regarding lighting, be aware of the possibilities the white balance setting on the camera have, and use gels on the lamps, and sometimes on windows to create a neutral image.

In return for these shortcomings, DV-cameras can be more light-sensitive than most film stocks, and therefore require less light intensity, to give the same image. (PD150 is about 320ASA versus Kodak's 50D's 50ASA. One would need about 8 times more light, to get the same image at the same F-stop). Although high ASA film is available.

You just do what you have to do.

This is a book to complement the ''[[Data Structures]]'' book and the ''[[Algorithms]]'' book, and assumes these books as prerequisites.

There are two conflicting goals in online book writing:

* to be an introduction to fundamental material 
* to be a complete reference work that includes discussions of tangential material 

We've decided to do both. The ''Data Structures'' text and the ''Algorithms'' text focus on just the fundamentals. This book (''Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms'') is a place for reference material. The idea is that a student in the span of a year or less can cover those fundamentals and then move on the advanced topics in this book.

== Possible topics ==

* Parallel Programming (section; an elaboration of divide and conquer, or pipeline decoupling for streaming algorithms) 
* Memory Management and Garbage Collection (whole chapter) 
* NP-Completeness (whole chapter) 
* Proof of the master theorem (section) 
* Quadtrees and [[Wikipedia:Octree|Octree]]s and [[Wikipedia: R-tree| R-tree]]s (chapter)
* B-trees (chapter) 
* (pseudo) random number generators 
* Introspective Sort (section; a hybrid sorting algorithm) 
* Closures ( [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatIsClosure What Is Closure?] )
* Continuations ( [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ContinuationExplanation continuations] )
* Cache-Aware and Cache-Oblivious Algorithms
* Approximation
* Maximum Flow
* Primality testing

While there is no content here yet, please feel free to start writing sections! Because this book is more of a reference, chapters can be more independent of each other. Further, you can assume the reader already knows the basic data-structures and algorithms.

=== FFT Multiplication* ===
As covered in the Algorithms book, by breaking an integer into two parts and treating it as a polynomial, we were able to derive a better-than-grade-school multiplication algorithm. Even more gains in efficiency can be made if we break the integer into three parts instead. However, we don't need to stop there: we can generalize the technique of polynomial multiplication and interpolation by breaking an ''n'' digit binary number into a degree ''n'' polynomial, which breaks the number up into its individual digits (and is the furthest we can divide such a number).

We noticed that evaluating the polynomial representations at points 1, -1, and 0 made the expressions easy, but if we are to use degree-2n polynomials, how can we come up with enough points to use? The trick is to evaluate the polynomial using complex numbers, in particular, by using &quot;roots of unity&quot;: that is, complex numbers that are all distance 1 from the origin.

=== Tree-List ===

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28computer_science%29

When dealing with lists, we normally have two choices: either we get &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; indexed access but &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; insertion with vectors, or &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; indexing and &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; insertion with linked lists. It'd be nice if we could find some middle ground, say with &lt;math&gt;O(\log N)&lt;/math&gt; (amortized) running time for all operations. Well, Soren Sandmann has implemented [http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/nautilus/cut-n-paste-code/gsequence/ GSequence], which uses a splay tree to achieve exactly that. ''[TODO: This structure doesn't have a widely accepted name yet. If someone can think of a better name, suggest it.]''

''I think B-tree algorithms give worst-case O(ln(N)) insertion, deletion, and access by name. Is GSequence better in some way? I've been told that some operating systems stored files and directories on disk as B-trees. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 23:39, 21 July 2005 (UTC)''

''There's a number of balanced trees that give O(ln N) performance. The idea here is just wrapping a list interface around a tree. You might as well just say that you can use a tree since a list interface is only for implementation convenience.''

''There are various heap data structures that give O(log(N)) insertion, deletion and access by name.''

''I believe these are called random-access lists.  Also, it is possible to get O(1) insertion and O(log N) indexing; e.g. Okasaki's skew-binomial random access lists.  If there is an interest, I can upload a demonstration-quality implementation in Common Lisp.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Other Questions?==
Are there other questions we should answer? Culture? Religion? Music? Any ideas? [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 01:37, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: Oh yes, definitely. I was in fact hoping this issue to focus primarily on those topics. Really, cover whatever you want to write about. Extra content online is a major bonus if we can get it. A few years from now, I hope we're at the stage with content and funds that we could publish issues on single countries, or at least groups.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

==Racism==

The only country in the whole of South Americas that's primarily white is Argentina, the rest are primarily Indian or Black. South America is composed of '''mestizo''' (Indian - European), '''mulatto''' (Black - European) or '''mestizo-mulatto''' (Indian - Black - European) people. The white people are a small minority everywhere except Argentina. Are these facts reflected in the books? No, they are not. The books all read like they were written by white supremacists. The only exception is Venezuela and only because I fixed it personally. It's one thing to distort the picture by not mentioning the blatant racism in South America, it takes it to a whole other extreme when you distort such an obvious thing as ethnicity. [[User:70.26.56.242|70.26.56.242]] 21:08, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, many of the [[Wikijunior:South America]] modules are stubs missing much information. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:24, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== El Salvador ==

Why is El Salvador not in this book?
Is it because it is in fact in Central America?
Some children in New York think it is in South America, and I'm inviting them to participate in this book, and that's why I should like some correct information. I've had one accusation in regard to this book of passing on incorrect information to children, so I should not like another on my conscience.
--[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 00:57, 19 January 2006 (UTC).

:Some people consider Mexico to be in South America too.  Look at a map of North America and you will see some important differences.  From a geological viewpoint, El Salvador is actually in North America (it is physically on the Carribian plate, often associated in physical geography with North America) even if it has strong cultural ties to South American coutries.  For now, all we are trying to do is to somehow limit the range of countries that are involved with this Wikibook.  We really do need to eventually expand and move into other regions, and often Central America and the Carribian nations are geographically linked together.  Also, distinguishing between Anglo-America and Latin-America is very artificial and overly broad as well.  And tends to gloss over important groups like French-speaking people in Quebec, Louisiana (OK, Creole there) or Haiti. Or the Pennsylvania Dutch for that matter.  There is also a huge difference in culture between Mexico and Argentina, even though the typical American doesn't see any difference.

:In this regard, don't try to spread misinformation that El Salvador is in South America.  In addition, we do want to get to the Central American countries as well at some time in the future but not at the moment.  I am glad that you are trying to help improve this Wikibook, and I hope that the kids that you are encouraging to work on this have been enjoying the experience.  They would be a group of kids writing for kids, and that is exciting by itself.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:10, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

== Aztecs? ==

There is a page on Incas, why not the Aztecs? [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 14:18, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

: The Aztecs lived in North America. Where Mexico is now. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 02:28, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

== Revitalizing Wikijunior South America ==
In my opinion, Wikijunior South America doesn't really work as is. I think there are probably reasons rooted in it being the third book to be started and the push that happened on the first two books for it being as undeveloped as it is. 

I find the history/culture/geography approach to be kind of dry. I think that most kids wouldn't find these articles to be very interesting. I would like to propose a major reworking of the book, with new questions, and a new development effort. A relaunch almost. I think we need questions that are more directly relevant to kid's experience.

The new set of questions I would propose for each country are: 
*What are %country's% national symbols? ''
:(Flag, Animal, Seal, etc.)''
*What are some famous places in %country%? ''
:(Historic places, Big Cities, Natural Features)''
*What important events have happened in %country%? 
:''(European Contact, Founding, Elections, Millitary Conflicts.)''
*What is the natural environment like in %country%? 
:''(Natural Geography, Climate, Animals, Nature Preserves)''
*What types of things are exported from %country%? 
:''(Business &amp; Economy Overview, GNP, Free-Market/State-Run, Natural Resources)''
*What is school like in %country%? 
:''(Language, Education System, Age of students, Education levels of kids and adults, Universities)''
*What is the food like in %country%? 
:''(Agriculture, Local dishes, specific foods eaten (eg. beef, plantains)''
*What music is popular in %country%? 
:''(Indigenous music forms, popularity of music from other parts of the world, dancing)''
*What sports are popular in %country%? 
:''(Football (soccer), Olympic Athletes, Notable athletes playing internationally.)'' 
*Who are some famous people from %country%? 
:''(2 sentence biographies, writers, politicians)''

Is anyone else up for this kind of effort? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 05:56, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

:I have been working on [[Wikijunior:South America/Colombia|Colombia]] to demonstrate how these articles might look. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 21:38, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Parametric polymorphism (generic units) ==

The idea of code reuse arises from the necessity for constructing large software systems combining well-established building blocks. The reusability of code improves the productivity and the quality of software. The generic units are one of the ways in which the Ada language supports this characteristic. A generic unit is a subprogram or package that defines algorithms in terms of types and operations that are not defined until the user instantiates them.

Note to C++ programmers: generic units are similar to C++ templates.

For example, to define a procedure for swapping variables of any (non-limited) type:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};  {{Ada/--|Generic formal type parameter}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Swap (X, Y : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Element_T);

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Swap (X, Y : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Element_T) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Temporary : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Element_T := X;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   X := Y;
   Y := Temporary;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Swap;

The &lt;tt&gt;Swap&lt;/tt&gt; subprogram is said to be generic. The subprogram specification is preceded by the generic formal part consisting of the reserved word {{Ada/kw|generic}} followed by a list of generic formal parameters which may be empty. The entities declared as generic are not directly usable, it is necessary to instantiate them.

To be able to use &lt;tt&gt;Swap&lt;/tt&gt;, it is necessary to create an instance for the wanted type. For example:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Swap_Integers {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Swap (Integer);

Now the &lt;tt&gt;Swap_Integers&lt;/tt&gt; procedure can be used for variables of type &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;.

The generic procedure can be instantiated for all the needed types. It can be instantiated with different names or, if the same identifier is used in the instantiation, each declaration overloads the procedure:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Instance_Swap {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Swap (Float);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Instance_Swap {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Swap (Day_T);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Instance_Swap {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Swap (Element_T =&gt; Stack_T);

Similarly, generic packages can be used, for example, to implement a stack of any kind of elements:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   Max: Positive; 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Stack {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Push (E: Element_T);
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Pop return Element_T;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Stack;

 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Generic_Stack {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Stack: {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. Max) {{Ada/kw|of}} Element_T;
   Top  : Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. Max := 0;  {{Ada/comment|initialise to empty}}
   {{Ada/--|...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Stack;

A stack of a given size and type could be defined in this way:

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
   {{Ada/kw|package}} Float_100_Stack {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Generic_Stack (100, Float);
   {{Ada/kw|use}} Float_100_Stack;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Push (45.8);
   {{Ada/--|...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

== Generic parameters ==

The generic unit declares ''generic formal parameters'', which can be:

* objects (of mode ''in'' or ''in out'' but never ''out'')
* types
* subprograms
* instances of another, designated, generic unit.

When instantiating the generic, the programmer passes one ''actual parameter'' for each formal.  Formal values and subprograms can have defaults, so passing an actual for them is optional.

=== Generic formal objects ===

Formal parameters of mode ''in'' accept any value, constant, or variable of the designated type.  The actual is copied into the generic instance, and behaves as a
constant inside the generic; this implies that the designated type cannot be limited.  It is possible to specify a default value, like this:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    Object : {{Ada/kw|in}} Natural := 0;

For mode ''in out'', the actual must be a variable.

One limitation with generic formal objects is that they are never considered static, even if the actual happens to be static.   If the object is a number, it cannot be used to create a new type.  It can however be used to create a new derived type, or a subtype:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    Size : {{Ada/kw|in}} Natural := 0;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} T1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} Size; {{Ada/comment|illegal!}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} T2 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. Size; {{Ada/comment|illegal!}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} T3 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. Size; {{Ada/comment|OK}}
    {{Ada/kw|subtype}} T4 {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. Size; {{Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

The reason why formal objects are nonstatic is to allow the compiler to emit the object code for the generic only once, and to have all instances share it, passing it the address of their actual object as a parameter.  This bit of compiler technology is called ''shared generics''.  If formal objects were static, the compiler would have to emit one copy of the object code, with the object embedded in it, for each instance, potentially leading to an explosion in object code size (''code bloat'').

(Note to C++ programmers: in C++, since formal objects can be static, the compiler cannot implement shared generics in the general case; it would have to examine the entire body of the generic before deciding whether or not to share its object code.  In contrast, Ada generics are designed so that the compiler can instantiate a generic ''without looking at its body''.)

=== Generic formal types ===

The syntax allows the programmer to specify which type categories are acceptable as actuals. As a rule of thumb: The syntax expresses how the generic sees the type, i.e. it assumes the worst, not how the creator of the instance sees the type.

This is the syntax of RM {{Ada/RM|12|5}}:

  formal_type_declaration ::=
    {{Ada/kw|type}} defining_identifier[discriminant_part] {{Ada/kw|is}} formal_type_definition;
  
  formal_type_definition ::= formal_private_type_definition
                           | formal_derived_type_definition
                           | formal_discrete_type_definition
                           | formal_signed_integer_type_definition
                           | formal_modular_type_definition
                           | formal_floating_point_definition
                           | formal_ordinary_fixed_point_definition
                           | formal_decimal_fixed_point_definition
                           | formal_array_type_definition
                           | formal_access_type_definiton
                           | formal_interface_type_definition

This is quite complex, so some examples are given below. A type declared with the syntax &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; denotes a type with ''unknown discriminants''. This is the Ada vernacular for indefinite types, i.e. types for which objects cannot be declared without giving an initial expression. An example of such a type is one with a discriminant without default, another example is an unconstrained array type.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Generic formal type || Acceptable actual types
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};&lt;/code&gt; || Any type at all.  The actual type can be [[Ada Programming/Types/limited|limited]] or not, indefinite or definite, but the ''generic'' treats it as limited and indefinite, i.e. does not assume that assignment is available for the type.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};&lt;/code&gt; || Any nonlimited type: the generic knows that it is possible to assign to variables of this type, but it is not possible to declare objects of this type without initial value.
|-

The generic knows about &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt;'s operations, so can call them.  Neither &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt; can be abstract.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Parent {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};&lt;/code&gt; || Any type, abstract or concrete, derived from &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt; is a tagged type, so calls to &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;'s operations can dispatch dynamically.

|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} (&lt;&gt;);&lt;/code&gt; || Any discrete type: [[Ada Programming/Types/range|integer]], [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|modular]], or [[Ada Programming/Types/Enumeration|enumeration]].

|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} &lt;&gt; {{Ada/kw|digits}} &lt;&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; || Any decimal fixed point type
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|digits}} &lt;&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; || Any [[Ada Programming/Types/digits|floating point type]]
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (I) {{Ada/kw|of}} E;  || Any [[Ada Programming/Types/array|array type]] with index of type &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; and elements of type &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; could be formal parameters as well)
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} O;&lt;/code&gt; || Any [[Ada Programming/Types/access|access type]] pointing to objects of type &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; could be a formal parameter as well)
|}

In the body we can only use the operations predefined for the type category of the formal parameter. That is, the generic specification is a contract  between the generic implementor and the client instantiating the generic unit. This is different to the parametric features of other languages, such as C++.

It is possible to further restrict the set of acceptable actual types like so:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Generic formal type !! Acceptable actual types
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}}&lt;/code&gt;... || Definite or indefinite types (loosely speaking: types with or without discriminants, but other forms of indefiniteness exist)
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (D : DT) {{Ada/kw|is}}&lt;/code&gt;... || Types with a discriminant of type DT (it is possible to specify several discriminants, too)
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}}&lt;/code&gt;... || Definite types (loosely speaking types without a discriminant or with a discriminant with default value)
|}

=== Generic formal subprograms ===

It is possible to pass a subprogram as a parameter to a generic.  The generic
specifies a generic formal subprogram, complete with parameter list and return
type (if the subprogram is a function). The actual must match this parameter
profile.  It is not necessary that the ''names'' of parameters match, though.

Here is the specification of a generic subprogram that takes another subprogram
as its parameter:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
   {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (X, Y: Element_T) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_T;
 {{Ada/kw|function}} Square (X : Element_T) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_T;

And here is the body of the generic subprogram; it calls parameter as it would
any other subprogram.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Square (X: Element_T) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/kw|return}} X * X;   {{Ada/--|The formal operator &quot;*&quot;.}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Square;

This generic function could be used, for example, with matrices, having defined the matrix product.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Square;
 {{Ada/kw|with}} Matrices;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Matrix_Example {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Square_Matrix {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Square
     (Element_T =&gt; Matrices.Matrix_T, &quot;*&quot; =&gt; Matrices.Product);
   A : Matrices.Matrix_T := Matrices.Identity;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   A := Square_Matrix (A);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Matrix_Example;

It is possible to specify a default with &quot;the box&quot; (&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/delimiter|&lt;&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;), like this:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
   {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (X, Y: Element_T) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} &lt;&gt;;

This means that if, at the point of instantiation, a function &quot;*&quot; exists for the
actual type, and if it is directly visible, then it will be used by default as the
actual subprogram.

One of the main uses is passing needed operators. The following example shows this &lt;small&gt;(follow download links for full example)&lt;/small&gt;:

   {{Ada/Sourceforge|Algorithms/binary_search.adb}}

   {{Ada/kw|generic}}
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
      ''...''
      {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;&lt;&quot;
        (Left  : {{Ada/kw|in}} Element_Type;
         Right : {{Ada/kw|in}} Element_Type)
         {{Ada/kw|return}}  Boolean
      {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/delimiter|&lt;&gt;}};
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Search
     (Elements : {{Ada/kw|in}} Array_Type;
      Search   : {{Ada/kw|in}} Element_Type;
      Found    : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean;
      Index    : {{Ada/kw|out}} Index_Type'{{Ada/attribute|Base}})
      ''...''

=== Generic instances of other generic packages ===

A generic formal can be a package; it must be an instance of a generic package, so that the generic knows the interface exported by the package:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Q ({{Ada/delimiter|&lt;&gt;}});

This means that the actual must be an instance of the generic package Q.  The box after Q means that we do not care which actual generic parameters were used to create the actual for P.  It is possible to specify the exact parameters, or to specify that the defaults must be used, like this:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/comment|P1 must be an instance of Q with the specified actual parameters:}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|package}} P1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Q (Param1 =&gt; X, Param2 =&gt; Y);
 
    {{Ada/comment|P2 must be an instance of Q where the actuals are the defaults:}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|package}} P2 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Q;
 
It is all or nothing: if you specify the generic parameters, you must specify all of them.  Similarly, if you specify no parameters and no box, then all the generic formal parameters of Q must have defaults.  The actual package must, of course, match these constraints.

The generic sees both the public part and the generic parameters of the actual package (Param1 and Param2 in the above example).

This feature allows the programmer to pass arbitrarily complex types as parameters
to a generic unit, while retaining complete type safety and encapsulation. ''(example needed)''

It is not possible for a package to list itself as a generic formal, so no generic recursion is possible.  The following is illegal:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} A;
 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} A ({{Ada/delimiter|&lt;&gt;}});
 {{Ada/kw|package}} A; {{Ada/comment|illegal: A references itself}}

In fact, this is only a particular case of:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} A; {{Ada/comment|illegal: A does not exist yet at this point!}}
 {{Ada/kw|package}} A;

which is also illegal, despite the fact that A is no longer generic.

== Instantiating generics ==

To instantiate a generic unit, use the keyword '''new''':

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Square_Matrix {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Square
    (Element_T =&gt; Matrices.Matrix_T, &quot;*&quot; =&gt; Matrices.Product);

Notes of special interest to C++ programmers:

* The generic formal types define ''completely'' which types are acceptable as actuals; therefore, the compiler can instantiate generics without looking at the body of the generic.
* Each instance has a name and is different from all other instances.  In particular, if a generic package declares a type, and you create two instances of the package, then you will get two different, incompatible types, even if the actual parameters are the same.
* Ada requires that all instantiations be explicit.
* It is not possible to create special-case instances of a generic (known as &quot;template specialisation&quot; in C++).

As a consequence of the above, Ada does not permit template metaprogramming.  However,
this design has significant advantages:

* the object code can be shared by all instances of a generic, unless of course the programmer has requested that subprograms be inlined; there is no danger of code bloat.
* when reading programs written by other people, there are no hidden instantiations, and no special cases to worry about.  Ada follows the Law of Least Astonishment.

== Advanced generics ==

=== Generics and nesting ===

A generic unit can be nested inside another unit, which itself may be generic.  Even though no special rules apply (just the normal rules about generics and the rules about nested units), novices may be confused.  It is important to understand the difference between a generic unit and ''instances'' of a generic unit.

'''Example 1'''. A generic subprogram nested in a nongeneric package.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Bag_Of_Strings {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Bag {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|generic}}
       {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Apply_To_All (B : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Bag);
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Bag_Of_Strings;

To use '''Apply_To_All''', you first define the procedure to be applied to each String in the Bag.  Then, you instantiate '''Apply_To_All''', and finally you call the instance.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Bag_Of_Strings;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Example_1 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|separate}}; {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize_All {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All (Operator =&gt; Capitalize);
    B : Bag_Of_Strings.Bag;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Capitalize_All (B);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Example_1;

'''Example 2.''' A generic subprogram nested in a generic package

This is the same as above, except that now the Bag itself is generic:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Type (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Bag {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Bag {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|generic}}
       {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Element_Type);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Apply_To_All (B : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Bag);
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Bag;

As you can see, the generic formal subprogram '''Operator''' takes a parameter of the generic formal type '''Element_Type'''.  This is okay: the nested generic sees everything that is in its enclosing unit.

You cannot instantiate '''Generic_Bag.Apply_To_All''' directly, so you must first create an instance of '''Generic_Bag''', say '''Bag_Of_Strings''', and then instantiate '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All'''.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Generic_Bag;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Example_2 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|separate}}; {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|package}} Bag_Of_Strings {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Generic_Bag (Element_Type =&gt; String);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize_All {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All (Operator =&gt; Capitalize);
    B : Bag_Of_Strings.Bag;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Capitalize_All (B);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Example_2;

=== Generics and child units ===

'''Example 3'''. A generic unit that is a child of a nongeneric unit.

Each instance of the generic child is a child of the parent unit, and so it can see the parent's public and private parts.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Bag_Of_Strings {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Bag {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Bag_Of_Strings; 
 
 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All (B : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Bag);

The differences between this and Example 1 are:
* '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''' is compiled separately.  In particular, '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''' might have been written by a different person who did not have access to the source text of '''Bag_Of_Strings'''.
* Before you can use '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''', you must '''with''' it explicitly; '''with'''ing the parent, '''Bag_Of_Strings''', is not sufficient.
* If you do not use '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''', your program does not contain its object code.
* Because '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''' is at the library level, it can declare controlled types; the nested package could not do that in Ada 95. In Ada 2005, one can declare controlled types at any level.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All; {{Ada/comment|implicitly withs Bag_Of_Strings, too}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Example_3 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|separate}}; {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize_All {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All (Operator =&gt; Capitalize);
    B : Bag_Of_Strings.Bag;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Capitalize_All (B);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Example_3;

'''Example 4'''. A generic unit that is a child of a generic unit

This is the same as Example 3, except that now the Bag is generic, too.

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Type (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Bag {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Bag {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Bag;
 
 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Element_Type);

       {{Ada/kw|new}} Generic_Bag (Element_Type =&gt; String);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize_All {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All (Operator =&gt; Capitalize);
    B : Bag_Of_Strings.Bag;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Capitalize_All (B);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Example_4;

'''Example 5'''. A parameterless generic child unit

Children of a generic unit '''must''' be generic, no matter what.  If you think about it, it is quite logical: a child unit sees the public and private parts of its parent, including the variables declared in the parent.  If the parent is generic, which instance should the child see?  The answer is that the child must be the child of only one instance of the parent, therefore the child must also be generic.

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Type (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Hash_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} (&lt;&gt;);
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|function}} Hash_Function (E : Element_Type) {{Ada/kw|return}} Hash_Type;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Hash_Map {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Map {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Hash_Map;

Suppose we want a child of a '''Generic_Hash_Map''' that can serialise the map to disk; for this it needs to sort the map by hash value.  This is easy to do, because we know that '''Hash_Type''' is a discrete type, and so has a less-than operator.  The child unit that does the serialisation does not need any additional generic parameters, but it must be generic nevertheless, so it can see its parent's generic parameters, public and private part.

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Hash_Map.Serializer {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Dump (Item : {{Ada/kw|in}} Map; To_File : {{Ada/kw|in}} String);
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Restore (Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Map; From_File : {{Ada/kw|in}} String);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Hash_Map.Serializer;
 
To read and write a map to disk, you first create an instance of '''Generic_Hash_Map''', for example '''Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings''', and then an instance of '''Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings.Serializer''':

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
 {{Ada/kw|with}} Generic_Hash_Map.Serializer;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Example_5 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Hash (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} Unbounded_String) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|separate}}; {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|package}} Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Generic_Hash_Map (Element_Type =&gt; Unbounded_String,
                             Hash_Type =&gt; Integer,
                             Hash_Function =&gt; Hash);
    {{Ada/kw|package}} Serializer {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings.Serializer;
    M : Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings.Map;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Serializer.Restore (Item =&gt; M, From_File =&gt; &quot;map.dat&quot;);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Example_5;

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can't build a robot without at least a few tools. This page will cover some of the tools and equipment that'll be useful.

==Mechanical Tools==
For building your robot you'll need some tools to form the body.

#Small vise: you'll need this.
#Hammer: A hammer is one of the standard tools you'll need.
#Screwdrivers &amp; Wrenches: their uses are obvious.  Two spanners of equal size are required for locknutting.
#Saw: Metal and wood saws. Miter saws can be very handy, but are pretty expensive. A miter box might suffice for many purposes.
#Square, measuring tape, scriber and other marking out tools.  
#Vernier calipers: Allow very accurate marking out and measurement.  Also can be used to check thread pitch on machine screws without a dedicated pitch gauge.
#Files: especially when working with metal, as rough metal edges are sharp.
#Centre Punch: Essential for accurate drilling of holes in metal to prevent the drill skating over the surface.
#Drill Press: (small table top versions suffice) is very handy for drilling accurate holes.  Can also provide the low speeds for drilling large holes in metal, which hand drills cannot do easily.
#Hobby Tool: Useful for many purposes.
#Sharp utility knifes: Mostly used when working with plastics.
#Hot glue guns: handy for quickly mounting parts. Not too strong bound, but useful for many applications.
#Arc Welder: Only useful when working with thick steel on large projects (use a gas welding torch for thin metal;arc welders tend to burn holes right through the workpiece). Aluminium cannot be welded with ordinary welders. (Unless you have a MIG/MAG or TIG welder available)
#Paint stripper/Electric Heat Gun: like a hairdryer on steroids. Useful for bending plastics, also applying heat-shrink tubing to electric cables at low power.
#Safety Goggles: You only get one pair of eyes, and machine tools are potentially dangerous.  Safety goggles are essential for using anything other than hand tools.

==Electronic Tools==

===Soldering iron===
The soldering iron is a very useful tool for assembling electronic circuits and connecting copper wires together.

For electronic circuits you'll need a light soldering iron (~25W) with a small point (shaped like a pencil point). Especially SMD components require small points (or even better: special SMD soldering points).&lt;BR&gt;
Soldering electronic components is done with &quot;soft soldering&quot;: with a low temperature (less than 300°C). Usually for electronics the melting point of the solder lays around 238°C. When buying solder choose for a solder wire (60% lead, 40% tin) with non-corrosive flux. (There is also &quot;eutectic solder&quot; - 63% lead, 37% tin, which transitions from liquid to solid immediately, with no plastic state in between.)  Take the thinnest wire you can find (&lt;=1mm).

See [http://www.epemag.wimborne.co.uk/solderfaq.htm this page] for an in depth explanation of soldering electronic components.

For connecting metal wires you'll need something more powerful (30W-100W) like a soldering pistol, but an ordinary soldering iron would do just as well.  
Note: not all materials are as good to solder. Copper is easy to solder and has a reasonable strong bond. Aluminum has a weak bond.

For stronger connections it's better to braze instead of soft soldering. Brazing involves higher temperatures (typical between 450°C and 1000°C) and different flux (&quot;Borax&quot;) and solder (copper and zinc or silver alloys) it also requires a welding torch instead of a soldering iron.&lt;BR&gt;
see [http://www.handyharmancanada.com/TheBrazingBook/bbook.htm this online book] for more in depth information on brazing.

If you need even more strength you could use welding. However welding is only used for heavy materials like steel alloys and these are in most cases too heavy to be used in robots (unless you're building a very big or industrial robot). Aluminum can be welded but it isn't as simple as welding steel alloys.&lt;BR&gt;
See [http://www.aussieweld.com.au/arcwelding/index.htm this site for basic welding information].

==Breadboard==
[[File:Breadboard.svg|thumb|Breadboard|100px]]
The boards allow you to build a temporary circuit in no time. Especially handy for testing new circuits. Connections are made with either ordinary thin stiff wire with the insulation removed at the ends or with special breadboard wires with stronger tips. Wires with crocodile clamps are needed for hooking up signal generator, oscilloscope, DMM, etc. Larger boards have connectors (typically banana plugs) for the power supply.

There are small breadboards with an adhesive strip at the bottom. These can be mounted on an empty part of a microcontroller board and can be used to build small circuits.

*'''Note:''' when you build a sensitive analog circuit on a breadboard, it can behave differently than when it's build as a PCB. This is because of parasitic components: the wires connecting the components on the board act as a combination of a resistor, capacitor and coil (all with very low values). Keep in mind that in some circumstances this can affect the working of a circuit. Usually this is only a problem when working with low amplitudes and/or high frequencies.
{{clear}}
==Electronic Equipment==
[[File:Digital Multimeter Aka.jpg|thumb|Digital Multimeter]]
*Multimeter: measures voltage, current &amp; resistance. Many can measure transistor and diode characteristics, frequency and capacity. Some can measure temperature or light intensity.
**Note: measuring voltage and current of a AC source isn't as simple as measuring DC levels. But since robots rarely use AC this would be out of the scope of this text. But if you would require to measure AC levels you should read up on this.

*Oscilloscope: makes a electric signal visible. Very useful when working with more complicated electronic circuits, especially analog signals and data communication. Oscilloscopes exist as stand-alone devices or as add-on modules for PCs. The latter provides extra abilities like spectrum analysing and recording of signals.

*Variable power supplies: power supplies with variable output. Either AC or DC. Either the output voltage or current can be regulated, although most power supplies let you set a max current.

*Signal generators: generates different shapes of signals (sine, square, saw and triangle), with variable frequency (1Hz up to 100MHz) and amplitude.

*Logic probe: pen-like devices that detect logic levels (either TTL or CMOS). Most can detect pulse signals. Very handy when working with digital electronic circuits.

*Frequency meters: measures the frequency of a signal. Can also be used as a pulse counter.  Oscilloscopes can be used for measuring frequency, and storage scopes can freeze a waveform onscreen allowing pulses to be manually counted, but frequency meters are a good investment if this needs to be done very often.

*LEDs: An underrated test device for digital circuits. LEDs are far better than voltmeters for digital circuits in some situations, as you can see many input and output values concurrently, without connecting a multitude of voltmeters or constantly checking everything with a logic probe.  In particular, they can instantly show the status of several logic signals simultaneously, impossible with a logic probe.  Good breadboard building practice also includes an LED for each breadboard to show it is powered up correctly - this can help avoid the potentially frustrating situation of faultfinding a logic circuit that is actually sound, but has an intermittent or noisy power supply.  It's also an excellent indicator if a component is short-circuiting at any time during operation, as the LED will likely dim or go out.

== Connectors ==

=== Insulation Displacement Connectors (IDC) ===

Assembling parallel ribbon cables from ribbon and the IDC connectors:

Practical tips:

#Note that IDC ribbon cable is usually not provided with multicoloured or ‘rainbow’ insulation, but with single-colour insulation — usually grey or white. However it also has a stripe of coloured ink or paint (red or black) down one side, to guide you with connector orientation. If you need to strip away some of the wires of a multi-way cable to suit the IDC
connectors you’re using, remove them from the side furthest from the ink stripe so it’s still present on the cable.
#It’s usual to fit IDC connectors to the cable so their pin 1 end is on the stripe side of the ribbon. This also
helps guide you when you’re mating the cable connectors with those on the equipment, knowing that the stripe
corresponds with pin 1.
#Before clamping an IDC connector to a ribbon cable, make sure that the cable grooves are aligned with the contact jaw tips and that they are also aligned with the scallops moulded into the underside of the clamping strip.
#Make sure too that the connector pin/jaw axis is as close as possible to 90° with respect to the ribbon cable wire axes. If the connector/ribbon angle is not close to 90°, some connections may not be made properly. If the connector is being fitted at the end of a ribbon cable, cutting the end of the ribbon cleanly square first will allow you to use it as a guide.
#Try to squeeze the IDC connector and its clamping strip together as evenly as possible, so they remain as close as possible to parallel with each other during the operation. This too ensures that all joints are made correctly. The easiest way to squeeze them together evenly is by using a small machine vice or a special compound-action clamping tool.
#If an IDC connector has a second cable clamping strip, don’t attempt to fit this as part of the main assembly. Assemble the main parts of the connector first on the ribbon cable, and only then fit the second clamping strip.
#When you are bending the ribbon cable around before fitting the second clamping strip, don’t pull it hard. This may loosen some of the connections inside the IDC connector. Just bend the ribbon around gently — a small amount of slack won’t do any harm, and may in fact protect the IDC connections from strain.

Properly-assembled IDC connector illustration:

http://www1.electusdistribution.com.au/images_uploaded/IDCconnE.pdf


Practical uses:

A common IDC cable in use is an IDC D9 socket to IDC 2 by 5 header socket. This cable is often used to connect a PC serial (RS232) port to a microcontroller development board. On the board there will be a 2 by 5 pin header.

===RJ45 network connector===
[[File:Ethernet_RJ45_connector_p1160054.jpg|thumb|100px|RJ45 Connector]]
These are the connectors used on UTP network cables. A smaller version (RJ11) is used for telephones. You need a crimping tool to attach the connector to the cable. These connectors are very useful for hooking up different PCB with each other. A good use for RJ45 connectors is for making serial (RS232) programming cables for small embedded systems (many credit card terminals use a DB9 to RJ45 cable to download software from a PC during development). If you are building small embedded controller boards an RJ45 can be a handy connector size to use.

==DVDs==
One of the most exciting new areas for filmmakers with a strong visual style is the music/video DVD.  Warp records are leading the way here - producing pieces of work that can only be described and visionary.  DVDs where the music and the visuals have been developed together, not one after the other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The twentieth century has seen huge changes in the modes and meanings of artistic production that mirror the enormous social changes that have occurred during the same time period. Continuing with the break with the academic values such as the hierarchy of genres, many movements and many countries re-evaluated aesthetics, technique, color, media, meaning, and many other aspects of artistic enterprise. Technology has had not only an indirect impact on artists, but often is the subject matter, or even the media that artists have worked with. 

The Impressionists, at the end of the nineteenth century, who championed landscape painting and revolutionized technique and use of color helped to open the floodgates for many more movements (not all of which identified themselves as such). The Secession movement, Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, Futurism, Dada, Suprematism, Surrealism, The Bauhaus, De Stijl, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Op Art, Minimalism, and the Postmodern are some of the major movements that have shaped the century and changed our very conceptions of what art is.

==Secessionist movement==
The Secessionist  movement was the Austrian branch of a larger movement known primarily as Art Nouveau (&quot;new art&quot;). Depending on the country, the style is also known as Jugendstil (Germany), Style Liberty (Italy), Modernisme (Spain), or Latvian Romanticism. Art Nouveau is an umbrella term but also refers to works of this style produced in France and Belgium. Art Nouveau has its roots in the English Arts and Crafts style of the 19th century; in fact, certain artists, like Charles Rennie Mackintosh, work in both styles. The purpose of Art Nouveau was to create what is known as a complete work of art - a work that includes painting, drawing and printmaking as well as applied arts and architecture. For this reason, some of the most beautiful and informative Art Nouveau works are complete rooms or houses where every object within is executed in Art Nouveau style. Art Nouveau is characterized by free-flowing floral, vegetal, and other typically feminine motifs. It also features a kind of romantic mysticism that can be traced back to the Pre-Raphaelite and Symbolist movements of the 19th century. Some well-known Art Nouveau artists and craftsmen include Alphonse Mucha (Czech), an accomplished printmaker and painter; Antoni Gaudi (Spanish), whose architectural works dot Barcelona; Hector Guimard (French), whose wrought-iron entrances for the Paris metro have become his legacy; Gustav Klimt (Austrian), who led the Austrian Secessionists with his opulent and complex paintings; and Louis Comfort Tiffany (American), who is well-known for his distinctive stained-glass work. 

==Fauvism==
Fauvism, whose name derives from the French word for &quot;wild beast,&quot; was a Primitivist movement centered in Paris in the first decade of the 20th century. The most well-known Fauvist artists are Henri Matisse and Andre Derain. The large blocks of color and simplified forms Fauvist artists used undoubtedly influenced the Cubist movement, which overlapped Fauvism by a few years. 

==Cubism==
The Father of Cubism is said to be [[wikipedia:Cezanne|Cezanne]].  Pablo [[wikipedia:Picasso|Picasso]], a Spanish artist, who had many phases in his long career, picked up the gauntlet of Cubism.  His famous &quot;Demoiselles d'Avignon&quot; of 1907, housed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, depicts five nude women, possibly prostitutes, in an interior. The painting is primitivistic - Picasso synthesized his well-documented interest in African masks into the faces of the figures. The fragmentation and flattening of the figures also anticipates the development of analytical Cubism a few years later. One of the Spaniard's most socio-political cubist paintings is &quot;Guernica&quot; of 1937, his grey, black and white portrait of the horrors of war.  The basque town of Guernica was bombed by the German Luftwaffe on April 26, 1937.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Guernica]

Another founding member of the Cubist movement was Georges Braque, a French artist whose analytical Cubist work from the 1910s is quite similar to Picasso's. Braque and Picasso worked together closely, and Braque's influence on Picasso (and vice versa) should not be downplayed. Other major artists of the analytical Cubist movement include Juan Gris, whose interest in mathematics made his art more regularized, and less fragmented, than Picasso's; Marcel Duchamp, whose early, pre-readymade works such as &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase&quot; are highly fragmented and undeniably Cubist; Jean Metzinger; and Albert Gleizes. 

==Futurism==
Futurism was an Italian movement in the 1920s that was based on a fascination with movement, technology, and machinery.

==Postmodernism==
Postmodern artist Barbara Kruger is known for critical images inspired by commercial advertising.  She is the author of several books. &quot;Love for Sale&quot; shows Kruger's blown up photographic black and white images with text in a red box superimposed creating a new meaning for the viewer.  Kruger taught at the Art Institute and Cal Arts during the 70s. Kruger's work often focuses on feminist issues.  Kruger's Whitney Biennial 2'x3' work, enlarged as she tackled billboards in the US and other countries.
She was the subject of a lecture given at the 3rd Annual Conference of the Society of the Word and Image at Carleton University in Ontario, Canada in 1993.

==Abstract Expressionism==
A school of painting that flourished after World War II until the early 1960s, characterized by the view that art is nonrepresentational and chiefly improvisational.

Abstract art is defined as art that has no reference to any figurative reality. In its wider definition the term describes art that depicts real forms in a simplified or rather reduced way - keeping only an allusion of the original natural subject. The abstract paintings of Joan Miró are a good example of this wider definition. The term non-figurative is used as a synonym.



In the twentieth century Wassily Kandinsky is considered as the inventor of non-figurative art. Over a period of several years his paintings moved gradually away from figurative subjects. In 1910 he created the first completely abstract work of art - a watercolor - without any reference to reality. Wassily Kandinsky not only became the first abstract artist, he also promoted it as a theorist. In 1912 his book On the Spiritual in Art was published.

A movement of abstract painting that emerged in New York City during the mid-1940s and attained singular prominence in American art in the following decade; also called action painting and the New York school. Jackson Pollock 's turbulent yet elegant abstract paintings, which were created by spattering paint on huge canvases placed on the floor, brought abstract expressionism before a hostile public. Willem de Kooning 's first one-man show in 1948 established him as a highly influential artist. Other important artists involved with the movement included Hans Hofmann , Robert Motherwell , and Mark Rothko ; among other major abstract expressionists were such painters as Clyfford Still , Theodoros Stamos, Adolph Gottlieb, Helen Frankenthaler, Lee Krasner, and Esteban Vicente.

----

== Wiederholung ==
Lesson 10 is a review (''Wiederholung'') lesson to summarize the German language lessons presented in Lessons 6 through 9. You should, as well, return to [[German/Lesson_6|Lektion 6]] and review (that is, completely reread) each of the four lessons back up to this point.  For a more advanced course, you should now incorporate each of the advanced lessons into this &quot;review&quot; process.  That is: review Lesson 6, then do Lesson 6A, review Lesson 7, then do Lesson 7A, etc. If the advanced lessons have already been completed, then now review lessons in the order 6 -&gt; 6A -&gt; 7 -&gt; 7A -&gt; 8, etc.
----
== Verb Conjugation ==
You have learned that there is a relationship between the subject of a verb and the form that verb takes in German.  Some verbs follow a predictable regular pattern, while others are less predictable (irregular verbs). 

         verb:       ''können'' (can)    ''gehen'' (go)     ''sein'' (to be)
 pronoun              verb I (irreg.) verb II        verb III (irregular)
 Basicform            können          gehen          sein
 ich                  kann            gehe           bin
 du                   kannst          gehst          bist
 er/sie/es            kann            geht           ist
 wir                  können          gehen          sind
 ihr                  könnt           geht           seid
 sie                  können          gehen          sind
 Sie (formal)         können          gehen          sind

As you can see, any verb uses the same declination for wir, sie and Sie.
Also, er/sie/es uses the same declination for all three genders.

&lt;br&gt;
This page is meant to introduce art. Art is a very abstract concept, 
and as such, it makes writing a book on the topic very difficult. 
Even more difficult is the introduction to such a book. So to start 
off, it is ''very'' important to discuss what this book plans to
accomplish, and what it does ''not'' plan to accomplish.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What this book '''will''' do:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cuisine|Lebanon}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_the_Mediterranean|Mediterranean]]

Lebanese Cuisine consists of a variety of fresh vegetarian recipes, salads and stews all seasoned with a flavoursome combination of herbs and spices. One of the most widely recognised Lebanese specialties is called Maza, also written &quot;Mezze&quot;, which is a selection of appetizers: olives, cheeses, Labanee, or small portions also known as muqabbilat (starters).

The cuisine of Lebanon includes an abundance of starches, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and seafood; animal fats are consumed sparingly. Poultry is eaten more often than red meat, and when red meat is eaten it is usually lamb. The cuisine also includes copious amounts of garlic and olive oil, often seasoned by lemon juice - nary a meal goes by in Lebanon that does not include these ingredients. Most often foods are either grilled, baked or sauted in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw or pickled as well as cooked. While the cuisine of Lebanon doesn't boast an entire repertoire of sauces, it focuses on herbs, spices and the freshness of ingredients; the assortment of dishes and combinations are almost limitless. The meals are full of robust, earthy flavors and, like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons.

Cookbook recipe for '''Garlic Lemon Chicken'''.

== Ingredients ==

* For the Chicken
** 4 x Skin-on, boned [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
** 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|Lemons]] completely juiced (use fresh lemons!)
** 6 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
** 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
** 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
** 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Basil|Basil]]
** ¼ tsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|Cayenne Pepper]]
** 6 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] sliced in ¼&quot; slices

* For the '[[Cookbook:Toum|toom]]' (Arabic for garlic)
** 4 cloves of garlic
** ½ cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
** ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
** ¼ tsp salt
** a dash of cayenne.

== Procedure ==
# Blend the lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, basil and cayenne pepper to make the marinade. 
# Put the chicken breasts in a deep pan and pour the marinade over it
# Cover and sit all night.  In the morning, flip the chicken to the other side.
# At noon drain the liquid from the pan and cook in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 10-15 minutes (not to cook, only to brown)
# Once finished, pour the marinade over the browned chicken, tightly cover the pan with tin foil (don't burn your fingers) and put back in the oven.  Set the oven to 250°F (120°C)
# Baste at 1pm, 2pm and 3pm.
# At 4pm, add the sliced potatoes to the pot, baste everything, and recover with tin foil.
# Put back in the oven for another hour.
# Once the above step is finished, blend all of the ingredients for the toom together.

At 5pm, dinner's ready.

The trick is not in complicated ingredients - it is the slow cooking and lemon/garlic marinade.  

Use the toom as a condiment for the chicken and potatoes.

Serve with warm pita bread.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Wikipedia:Krebs cycle|Krebs Cycle]] is also known as the [[Wikipedia:Citric acid cycle|Citric Acid Cycle]] or Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle and occurs within the Matrix of the Mitocondria.

'''Acetyl-Coenzyme A''' produced from the Link Reaction is synthesised into '''Citric Acid''' by the action of citrate synthase and its combination with '''Oxaloacetate'''. The citric acid, known as '''Citrate''' in its ionised form is then converted into '''Isocitrate''' by aconitase. This is then converted to '''Alpha-Ketoglutarate''' by citrate dehydrogenase in an oxidative decarboxylation reaction, in which one molecule of CO2 is given off and one molecule of NAD+ is oxidised to NADH. Another oxidative deecarboxylation converts the alpha-ketoglutarate to '''Succinyl Coenzyme A''' with the addition of CoA-SH and again the loss of a CO2 and the oxidation of NAD+ is seen. Succinyl CoA is then converted into '''Succinate''' by the action of Succinyl CoA Synthetase, the addition of water, the loss of CoA-SH and the substrate level phosphorylation of one molecule of ADP to ATP. Succinate is then converted to '''Fumarate''' by Succinate Dehydrogenase, a dehydrogenation reaction which results in the reduction of FADH+ to FADH2. Fumarate is, in turn, hydrated by the addition of one water molecule by Fumarase to '''Malate''' which is finally converted back to '''Oxaloacetate''' by Malate Dehydrogenase in a dehydrogenation reaction that oxidises one NAD+ to NADH. The cycle can then begin again.

There are many products of, and substrates for the Krebs cycle: for instance, amino acids can be metabolised to or catabolised from '''Acetyl CoA, Alpha-Ketoglutarate, Succinyl CoA, Malate''' and '''Oxaloacetate''', depending which specific amino acid. '''Pyruvate''' can be re-synthesised by Pyruvate carboxylase from '''Oxaloacetate''', which can either replenish the Krebs Cycle or make glucose by '''Gluconeogenesis'''. '''Citrate''' can be used for fatty acid (fat) or cholesterol synthesis. '''Succinyl CoA''' can be used to make Haem for Red Blood Cells.

NADH and FADH2 are then used in the '''electron transport chain''' in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Net gain for the Krebs Cycle:
2 Carbon Dioxide, 1 ATP, 3 NADH, and 1 FADH2 '''per molecule of Acetyl CoA'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Translation Phase of Genetic Expression is divided into 2 Steps Transcription and Translation.  During Transcription RNA Polymerase unzips the two halfs of the DNA where it needs to transcript.  Then free RNA bases Attach to the DNA bases with the Polymerase starting at the promoter and ending at the Termination signal.  From this the RNA can become mRNA, rRNA, or tRNA.  The mRNA is a ribbon like strand that takes the genetic information from the nucleus of the cell to the ribosome.  rRNA forms a globular ball that attaches to the rough E.R. to help make ribosomes.  finally the tRNA forms a hair shaped landing base that reads the genetic information to make proteins.  Translation happens when mRNA is pulled through a ribosome and tRNA reads the RNA bases on the mRNA to make anti-codons of 3 bases and brings amino-acids to form the protein.  This starts with the condon AUG and ends at UAG.  When done the protein forms the correct shape and does the task it was created for.  This brings the genetic code from the nucleus, which it never leaves, to the cytoplasm of the cell where proteins are produced to upkeep the body.

==Teaching how to read and write Marathi?==

I would really like to see lessons teaching how to read and write Devanagari for Marathi step-by-step. It's hard to learn from an overview of letters. Lack of examples is another problem, but even if there were examples afterwards the learning situation would be far from perfect because the student would still have to memorise all letters at once in order to be able to begin practising. 

What I have found really useful when learning non-Latin alphabets is a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; method that introduces few letters at a time and offers example words for practise immediately after each letter / each set of letters. What's even better is if those example words are understandable without prior knowledge of the language, that is, international words. For example: names of countries, cities or famous people (if their name isn't significantly different in Marathi than in English), common personal names, Marathi words that have entered English, English words that are used in Marathi, words that both Marathi and English have derived from Greek or Latin...  The advantage of using these words is that students will be able to quickly see their own progress and the whole learning process becomes as fascinating as solving a puzzle. See the &quot;Read Write and Pronounce Greek&quot; lessons in the [[Modern Greek]] Wikibook for an example, or [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/alphabet.html this external page on Cyrillic]. 

If you'd like to try this approach for teaching how to write Marathi, I'd be glad to help you, even though I don't know it yet (I'd learn it though and I have learned a variety of foreign alphabets already). Just create a big list of suitable words on a planning page like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]], answer me here and I'll try to find an optimal order for letters. 

Thanks for your efforts to teach a language that is hard to find in European schools!

P.S.: If there's somebody generally unsure about how to create good language lessons, I really recommend reading the following two pages about it: [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] and [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks/Bite-sized language lessons]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bacteria are prokaryotic, unicellular organisms.  Bacteria are very small; so much so that 1 billion could fit on 1 square centimeter of space on the human gums, and 1 gram of digested food has 10 billion bacteria.  Bacteria are the simplest living organisms. Previously they fell under the Kingdom Moneran, but now they fall into two different Domains: Archaebacteria and Eubacteria.  There are several differences between the two.  Typically, microbiologists in the 21st century call these groups &quot;Archaea&quot; and &quot;Bacteria.&quot;  One of the co-discoverers of the three Domains has argued that the term &quot;prokaryote&quot; should be removed from classrooms because it reflects an evolutionary hypothesis that has been disproved, given that the Archaea are more closely related to the Eukarya than they are to the Bacteria (Pace 2006, &lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt; 441 p. 289).

It is incorrect to think of bacteria as particularly &quot;simplistic&quot; for all that they do not have internal organelles that can be visualized using a light microscope.  The bacterial nucleoid, for example, is a highly organized structure even though it typically contains just one or two circular chromosomes with a total of millions of basepairs of DNA (Thanbichier et el., 2005, &lt;u&gt;J Cell. Biochem.&lt;/u&gt; 96:506-521; see also http://www.microbelibrary.org/Laboratory%20Diagnostics/details.asp?id=782&amp;Lang=English).  Bacteria have complex cell walls exterior to the cell membrane.  Some bacteria contain plasmids, which are typically circular DNA with replication that is uncoupled from binary fission (cellular division).  Plasmids in nature often encode traits of significant interest to humans, such as the ability to be resistant to clinically important antibiotics, or the ability to degrade &quot;odd&quot; carbon sources such as TNT or human-made pollutants.  Plasmids from'' Escherichia coli'' have been &quot;domesticated&quot; and have long been in use for genetic engineering, as it is easier to isolate and modify plasmid DNA, and introduce it into a new cells, than it is to modify a bacterial chromosome (see &quot;Techniques&quot; at dnai.org; see also http://www.microbelibrary.org/Laboratory%20Diagnostics/details.asp?id=707&amp;Lang=English).   A few phylogenetic groups of bacteria can make endospores, which are metabolically inert but are able to resist high temperatures, radiation, and desiccation (see http://www.microbelibrary.org/Laboratory%20Diagnostics/details.asp?id=2511&amp;Lang=English).  

Bacterial reproduction is always asexual and usually occurs through binary fusion, once thought to be a simple process of growing and dividing.   Microbiologists now know, however, that binary fission is complex in that it requires dozens of proteins cooperating to build the septum (new cell wall between 'daughter' cells) and to actively separate the two daughter chromosomes.  Furthermore, there are other forms of reproduction in bacteria, all of them &quot;asexual&quot; in that they do not use gametes or involve genetic exchange (Angert 2005, &lt;u&gt;Nature Reviews Microbiology&lt;/u&gt; 3:214-224).  Genetic exchange in bacteria is instead called horizontal (or lateral) gene transfer, because bacteria can obtain genetic information from organisms that are not their parents (Amabile-Cuevas 2003, American Scientist 91:138-149). (Vertical genetic transmission is the inheritance of DNA down through the generations.)  Horizontal gene transfer can happen any time and has nothing to do with cell division.  There are three main types, conjugation which is the sharing of plasmid DNA; transduction, where a bacterial virus accidentally transfers bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another, and transformation, where bacteria bind to DNA in the environment, internalize it, and can use that DNA as genetic material.

==Archaea==

Archaea are microbes that are more closely related to Eukaryotic cells than they are to the Bacteria (http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/aboutoverview.html).  Under a light microscope, they visually resemble Bacteria, so that it wasn't until the advent of the use of molecular methods in evolutionary biology that they were recognized as belonging to their own Domain (a phylogenetic grouping above the level of Kingdom).  Archaea have ultrastructural features that are superficially similar to those in Bacteria but are usually comprised of distinctive molecules. They do, for example, have a cell wall, yet that cell wall never contains peptidoglycan.  Instead, peptidoglycan is a unique molecular signature of the Bacteria.  Archaea also have odd lipids in their cell membranes.  They were originally discovered living in extreme environments thought to resemble conditions on early earth, but now that microbiologists have become more adept at detecting them, it is clear that the Archaea are not confined to extreme habitats and can instead be found everywhere.   It is true that some Archaea are &quot;extremophiles,&quot; found in extremely salty or hot environments, but there are also extremophile Bacteria and even some very unusual extremophile Eukarya.  The best-understood groups of Archaea are:
# ''Methanogens'' use Carbon dioxide and Hydrogen to make Methane. They are found in sewage, cows, and swamps, and they do not take in oxygen.  
# ''Extreme Halophiles'' live in extremely salty places (i.e.:  the dead sea and great salt lake).
# ''Thermoacidophiles'' prefer extremely hot, acidic areas (i.e.:  hot springs and volcanos).

==Bacteria==

(sometimes called &quot;eubacteria&quot;)

Bacteria have peptidoglycan in their cell walls, and they have no unusual phospholipids.  Bacteria have four shapes: 
* bacilli (rod shaped)
* vibrios (curved shaped)
* coccus (round shaped)
* spirilli (spiral shaped).

Bacteria can also have prefixes before their names: strepto, indicating chains of the shaped bacteria, and staphylo, indicating clusters of the shaped bacteria.  A 19th century microbiologist invented the Gram stain, still used today to differentiate bacteria into two types, Gram negative and Gram positive (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Gram).  These types are not useful in determining phylogeny but can be very useful in a clinical setting, because Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria can exhibit differential sensitivity to some classes of antibiotics.  There are probably dozens of &quot;Kingdoms&quot; within the Domain Bacteria, but the phylogeny of Bacteria is still disputed as microbiologists continue to study the evolution of bacteria using molecular methods.   Some of the major types of Bacteria are: 
# Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophs that strip electrons from water and use them to fix carbon dioxide; they are a major source of organic carbon in marine ecosystems.
# Spirochetes are Gram negative bacteria that have flexible cells and internal flagella in an unusual form of a more typical Gram negative cell wall.
# Proteobacteria (E-coli)

Some bacteria produce virulence factors that can cause sickness.  Some examples of these are serotoxins, which are given off by the Gram positive bacteria, and endotoxins, which are given off by Gram negative bacteria as they die.  There are many other examples, however, and specific pathogens make a unique suite of virulence factors that lead to the particular disease caused by that pathogen.

==Introduction==
Our word for economy came from word roots that mean literally &quot;household management.&quot; Today the word refers to all goods and services that an entire community produces. But there's another way in which we use the word-- for example in the phrase &quot;it's more economical for me to ride my bike.&quot; This more common usage typically refers to either saving money or time. We claim is that these uses of the term are identical: At heart, ''economics is the study concerned with the proper allocation of limited resources''.

Wether you support socialism, capitalism, anarcho-syndicalism, or self-sustaining tribal communities you cannot get around the need for an economy: unless we can live off an ecology so suited to us that whatever we want can be plucked from the trees we'll have to make decisions about how to allocate the resources available to us to best suit our needs. Political issues arise when people have different ideas as to what really is &quot;best&quot; for our needs, and who decides, and what groups should be given what resources.

==Currency and the Division of Labor==
Many people naturally think of money after hearing the word economics, but our primary concern in this book is not with money, nor is the field of economics primarily concerned with money. However, as an example of the allocation of goods, currency systems are a good place to start, as most people easily understand the advantages of having a currency.

The use of currencies in society to enable efficient trade is a relatively old idea and has evolved over many centuries: currencies are a human invention that wasn't ever planned nor designed. Instead, it was something that came into use through accident, much like the spoken languages we use. That currencies are so useful explains why they have survived through many different forms and that their adoption has spread.

Money is useful because it creates a universal trading &quot;good&quot; that can be used to purchase almost anything that is tradable, whether it's a food item that might spoil in a couple of days, a sturdy home appliance, clothes that are just the right size, or payment to a neighbor's teenager for mowing your lawn. If we received payment in fruit, this would be excessively less useful for us, because we would either have to consume the fruit, or trade it for something else, before it over-ripened. Instead of playing a scavenger hunt where we trade fruit for spices, spices for blenders, and blenders for jogging suits, we can directly go to sellers of jogging suits and pay with money.

In some sense, money doesn't really exist: It's just something backed up by our government as suitable for payments of debts between people, or public or private entities. In the United States, the dollar is only legal tender for debts that are already owed: For example, it's legal for a bus system to accept payment only in non-dollar tokens, or for a hair stylist to only accept payment in massage. The legal tender aspect of the dollar only comes in when it's for a debt already owed: If the hair stylist gives you a hair cut anyway but you back out on the massage deal, she can take you to court, but the court would allow you to pay in dollars instead. It's requirements like this that give the dollar its legitimacy and thus culture accepts this form of wealth, even though it doesn't exist.

Not every time is using currency actually the most efficient means of trade. For example, you might have a home recording system that is high quality, but you can't sell it for enough dollars to get the used car you want, while your friend is ready to start a band and just got a new car as a gift. It might be more efficient for the two of you to trade the recording system and his old car rather than sell them to a wider market (which would require advertising) or a middleman (who would charge a fee for the service). Nevertheless, when it comes to goods that spoil or services that can only be experienced once (like getting a haircut) it's usually better to use some form of currency as a means of later acquiring specific wealth. Further, it can be rare to find perfect trades so easily.

[TODO: stuff on the division of labor: allows more productive people to do X instead of everyone needing to do it, and that implies economies of scale]

==Wealth and Capital==
Now that we've got the topic of money out of the way, we can actually start talking about wealth. Wealth is simply something that is valuable to someone. There are many different kinds of wealth: the natural resources of the earth, and the great sunset views, are a type of wealth that exists without human creation. In fact, human creation can actually ruin some of this natural wealth by making views or skies less pleasant to look at through pollution or intrusive construction.

Other forms of wealth are created by taking raw materials of a lesser value and transforming them into goods that are more valuable. For example, you might not think much of a hunk of metal and plastic given to you, although you might value a portable audio player made of the same materials. Still other forms of wealth are a little more abstract: the biological diversity of the world is wealth that is a means of taking sunlight that pours onto the earth (something we get for free), molecules from the air and trace elements from the soil and uses photosynthesis to turn them into something that nourishes our bodies (for example, the wealth of the DNA encoded in seeds that, when planted, turn into tomato plants). Other abstract forms of wealth include the works of Shakespeare and folk songs: the simple arraignment of words or tones is something that is valuable to us. A world with 8 billion DVDs of a single Adam Sandler film isn't worth as much as a world with only 1 billion DVDs but which include all of the works of Hitchcock, Kubrick, Kieslowski, and even Mr. Sandler.

Yet another form of wealth is a contract: contracts may be broken, but the legal enforcement behind contracts make them valuable and are something that people want to buy. For example, a band might be interested in buying a contract that lets them perform at a venue on a given night, even though the sheet of paper itself has very little value, and even though the contract doesn't provide for contingencies if the venue burned down before the play date. Sometimes what's valuable to us only has a high probability, but not a certainty, of being useful to us.

We now consider wealth's relationship to capital. First, think of an acre of forest: it has some trees, some rocks and minerals, and some areas with high hay grass. Now suppose a hard working woman named Alice comes to this acre and makes some tools from the rocks and trees and starts cutting down the high hay to make usable lawn, cuts down only as much trees as needed to make a two-bedroom home, and then starts to make bedding and musical instruments with the remaining resources. Even though it started with the same resources, the acre now is worth more than it was before. (Or, at least, it's worth more to Alice.) There are actually two kinds of wealth in this story: the value of the natural resources, and the higher degree of wealth they became. and the wealth inside of Alice's head. Alice's wealth is known by economists as human capital.

The term capital simply means the &quot;means of production.&quot; While Alice's arms and legs were also part of the means of production, none of the wealth would have been produced were it not for her human capital. Alice then created further capital by making the tools that she used to cut and build more things. When she gets around to building a weaving loom, she'll have even more capital.

We refer to some business as being capital intensive when they require large amounts of capital to be run. For example, starting your own printing press business requires an enormous investment in machinery and the infrastructure required to store, run, and maintain it. Other businesses, such as being a real estate agent, only require modest office space, licenses, and a car. It is important to understand the role capital plays in an economy, because capital is how we can create more wealth.

Over time, innovation has made it so that we are more productive at creating more wealth. For example, 200 years ago the majority of the population worked as farmers. We have become so much more effective at farming, primarily through gains from the industrial revolution, that a small minority of the population are farmers today. The industrial revolution, and now the information age, has shrunk the amount of hard labor required. Some people still have back breaking work, but our advances in technology have freed up many more people to have service-based jobs.

To some, a service-based job doesn't feel as &quot;real&quot; as a manufacturing job: i.e., one that creates a good that can be traded. But given that most of the US economy is based on service jobs, it's hard to say they aren't useful. Service jobs are much more than just office administration, and waiting on tables. Service jobs are held by teachers, coaches or other trainers; all forms of entertainers, including athletes, actors, commedians, disc jockeys, and musicians; lawyers and paralegals; health professionals, healers, veterinarians and massage therapists; software developers and hardware designers; architects; translators; tourist guides; clerks and other retailers; all managers; food service workers; taxi cab drivers, and bus drivers; and day care workers. The list could go on, but the short message is that people providing services to other people is something people find to be very valuable.

we'll return later to Marxism and capitalism, but the key point here is that Marxism and capitalism primarily disagree as to who should own capital and how it should be organized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ruby Programming/TopNav|prev=Interactive Ruby|next=Strings}}

The classic &quot;[[w:Hello world program|hello world]]&quot; program is a good way to get started with Ruby.

== Hello world ==

Create a text file called &lt;code&gt;hello-world.rb&lt;/code&gt; containing the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'Hello world'
&lt;/source&gt;

Now run it at the shell prompt.

 $ '''ruby hello-world.rb'''
 Hello world

or [http://codepad.org/8OlSc6Sf execute online] 

You can also run the short &quot;hello world&quot; program without creating a text file at all. This is called a [[w:One-liner program|one-liner]].

 $ '''ruby -e &quot;puts 'Hello world'&quot;'''
 Hello world

You can run this code with [[../Interactive Ruby/|irb]], but the output will look slightly different. &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; will print out &quot;&lt;code&gt;Hello world&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, but &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; will also print out the return value of &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; which is &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;.

 $ '''irb'''
 &gt;&gt; puts &quot;Hello world&quot;
 Hello world
 =&gt; nil

== Comments ==

Like [[w:Perl|Perl]], [[w:Bash|Bash]], and [[w:C Shell|C Shell]], Ruby uses the hash symbol (also called Pound Sign, [[w:number sign|number sign]], Square, or octothorpe) for [[w:comment|comments]]. Everything from the hash to the end of the line is ignored when the program is run by Ruby. For example, here's our &lt;code&gt;hello-world.rb&lt;/code&gt; program with comments.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# My first Ruby program
# On my way to Ruby fame &amp; fortune!
 
puts 'Hello world'
&lt;/source&gt;

You can append a comment to the end of a line of code, as well. Everything before the hash is treated as normal Ruby code.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'Hello world'                # Print out &quot;Hello world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also comment several lines at a time:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
=begin
This program will
print &quot;Hello world&quot;.
=end
 
puts 'Hello world'
&lt;/source&gt;
execute by clicking the link [http://codepad.org/vuCCnxsM &quot;run&quot;] online
Although block comments can start on the same line as &lt;code&gt;=begin&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;=end&lt;/code&gt; must have its own line.  You cannot insert block comments in the middle of a line of code as you can in [[w:C (programming language)|C]], [[w:C++|C++]], and [[w:Java (programming language)|Java]], although you can have non-comment code on the same line as the &lt;code&gt;=end&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
=begin This program will print &quot;Hello world&quot;
=end puts 'Hello world'
&lt;/source&gt;
[http://codepad.org/o5UAYMcw execute online]

== Executable Ruby scripts ==

Typing the word &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; each time you run a Ruby script is tedious. To avoid doing this, follow the instructions below.

=== Unix-like operating systems ===

In [[w:Unix-like|Unix-like]] [[w:operating systems|operating systems]] &amp;ndash; such as [[w:Linux|Linux]], [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]], and [[w:Solaris Operating System|Solaris]] &amp;ndash; you will want to mark your Ruby scripts as executable using the &lt;code&gt;[[w:chmod|chmod]]&lt;/code&gt; command. This also works with the [[w:Cygwin|Cygwin]] version of Ruby.

 $ '''chmod +x hello-world.rb'''

You need to do this each time you create a new Ruby script. If you rename a Ruby script, or edit an existing script, you do ''not'' need to run &quot;&lt;code&gt;chmod +x&lt;/code&gt;&quot; again.

Next, add a [[w:shebang line|shebang line]] as the ''very first line'' of your Ruby script. The shebang line is read by the shell to determine what program to use to run the script. This line cannot be preceded by any blank lines or any leading spaces. The new &lt;code&gt;hello-world.rb&lt;/code&gt; program &amp;ndash; with the shebang line &amp;ndash; looks like this:

 #!/usr/bin/ruby
 
 puts 'Hello world'

If your &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; executable is not in the &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory, change the shebang line to point to the correct [[w:path (computing)|path]]. The other common place to find the &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; executable is &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/ruby&lt;/code&gt;.

The shebang line is ignored by Ruby &amp;ndash; since the line begins with a hash, Ruby treats the line as a comment. Hence, you can still run the Ruby script on operating systems such as Windows whose shell does not support shebang lines.

Now, you can run your Ruby script without typing in the word &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt;. However, for security reasons, Unix-like operating systems do not search the current directory for executables unless it happens to be listed in your PATH [[w:environment variable|environment variable]]. So you need to do one of the following:

# Create your Ruby scripts in a directory that is already in your PATH.
# Add the current directory to your PATH (''not recommended'').
# Specify the directory of your script each time you run it.

Most people start with #3. Running an executable Ruby script that is located in the current directory looks like this:

 $ '''./hello-world.rb'''

Once you have completed a script, it's common to create a &lt;code&gt;~/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory, add this to your PATH, and move your completed script here for running on a day-to-day basis. Then, you can run your script like this:

 $ '''hello-world.rb'''

==== Using env ====

If you do not want to hard-code the path to the &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; executable, you can use the &lt;code&gt;[[w:env|env]]&lt;/code&gt; command in the shebang line to search for the &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; executable in your PATH and execute it. This way, you will not need to change the shebang line on all of your Ruby scripts if you move them to a computer with Ruby installed in a different directory.

 #!/usr/bin/env ruby
 
 puts 'Hello world'

=== Windows ===

If you install the native Windows version of Ruby using the [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ Ruby One-Click Installer], then the installer has setup Windows to automatically recognize your Ruby scripts as executables. Just type the name of the script to run it.

 $ '''hello-world.rb'''
 Hello world

If this does not work, or if you installed Ruby in some other way, follow these steps.

# Log in as an [[w:System administrator|administrator]].
# Run the standard Windows &quot;Command Prompt&quot;, &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt;.
# At the command prompt (''i.e.'' shell prompt), run the following Windows commands. When you run &lt;code&gt;ftype&lt;/code&gt;, change the command-line arguments to correctly point to where you installed the &lt;code&gt;ruby.exe&lt;/code&gt; executable on your computer.

 $ '''assoc .rb=RubyScript'''
 .rb=RubyScript
 
 $ '''ftype RubyScript=&quot;c:\ruby\bin\ruby.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot; %*'''
 RubyScript=&quot;c:\ruby\bin\ruby.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot; %*

For more help with these commands, run &quot;&lt;code&gt;help assoc&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;help ftype&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.</text>

You are welcome to study one of the languages of most beauty in the world, descendant of language of ancient sacred Slavic texts, Principality of Rus, language of Cossacks - free people by the will of God known all over the world and of modern Ukrainian (Ukraino-Russian Cossack) nation, state and society.

Please remember, the main secrets in quick learning of every language - freedom of mind and constant training, using and speaking it. If you want to learn our language - read, write, listen, make friends with us and soon you will become the real Cossack, free-minded man of the world - one of us. :) Don't worry to pronounce or say in your own way, to use mixed language - we, Ukrainians often also use it and we like to talk and make friends with people from all parts of our world despite their language skills, because we believe that all humanity is one big community of friends, or in our language - real cossacks. :)

Such sites as Wikipedia in Ukrainian - http://uk.wikipedia.org and Google Translate (one of the best translators in modern world) - http://translate.google.com will be a great help for you, especially during first time.

=Writing for the Screen=

&quot;I like the idea of making films about ostensibly absolutely nothing. I like the irrelevant, the tangential, the sidebar excursion to nowhere that suddenly becomes revelatory. That's what all my movies are about. That and the idea that we're in possession of certainty, truth, infallible knowledge, when actually we're just a bunch of apes running around. My films are about people who think they're connected to something, although they're really not.&quot; - *[[wikiquote:Errol Morris|Errol Morris]]

|}

Screenwriting is different from other literary forms. The script is essentially a &quot;blueprint&quot; that will guide the other filmmakers through the production of the film. Often, the final film will differ from what was on the page. These differences can be as small as a few simple dialogue changes, or as large as a complete change in tone, direction, and intent. Accepting this process is key to being a screenwriter who not only writes well, but will work well with the other people involved in the film's production.

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being the blueprint for the film, the script also serves as a way to get that film made in the first place. Based on the strength of your screenplay, budget, talent, and enthusiasm will fall into place. It is the strength of the story that can secure financing and production talent. It's not innovative and thrilling setpieces or even a smattering of really great scenes peppered throughout your script, but a cohesive, intriguing story that holds the reader's (and eventually the viewer's) attention from beginning to end. This is such a basic concept, and yet one that seems utterly lost on some screenwriters, even those already established in Hollywood.

==Finding a Story==

===Write what you Know===

This adage is always &quot;Write what you know&quot;.  This is excellent advice as writing from your personal experience will make the story, characters and tone believable.

The flip side of this is the joke that all first time scripts by writers who have recently moved to Hollywood are about...the struggles of a young writer recently moved to Hollywood.  So write what you know but choose something of interest to an audience.  You would be amazed at how easily a little known hobby of yours or a quirky friend translates into a scene or a character.  Shamelessly mine your personal history and cut and paste characteristics  of your friends together and you will be surprised at how little you need to spin from whole cloth.

The first ten pages of script are said to be the most important. They should begin to show how the entire film will work as a whole.

==The Right Budget==

More often than not, the beginning screenwriter will find that his first sold screenplay will result in low-budget film. This also applies to those writing for the independent film scene.

With that in mind, it may not be a good idea to call for giant six-legged creatures scurrying up the side of a skyscraper or epic space battles across multiple solar systems in your script. While such effects ''can'' be done on a limited budget, they will not be of similar quality to those features for which money is not a constraint. 

It is not only extended special effects sequences that can break a budget, but also a large cast and/or sets. For low-budget films, try to keep both the cast and the different locations as few in number as possible. While this may seem limiting to a writer's creativity, many find the opposite to be true when they are confronted with the challenge of creating a compelling and memorable story within the confines of a low budget.

Of course, if money is not an issue, feel free to create a ''Lawrence of Arabia''-style epic with a cast of thousands and computer-generated graphics that would break [[wikipedia:Industrial Light and Magic|Industrial Light and Magic]].

[http://soyouwanna.com/site/syws/makemovie/makemovie.html low-budget movie tips]

=Screenwriting Books and Authors=

&lt;p&gt;Screenwriting books come in two forms: those written by successful screenwriters in Hollywood and those by, well, other types of people. And while you may be thinking that you would prefer to read a book on screenwriting by someone who has actually ''sold'' a script, both types of books actually have their strengths and weaknesses.

Successful screenwriters have a certain pedigree to their &quot;how-to&quot; books because they have actually been there and done that. However, success in artistic fields is rarely formulaic. They themselves may be confused as to what it was exactly in their script that allowed them to sell it in the first place. These books tend to be slightly muddled in thought and offer a strong temptation to handle things the way this particular author did (because, after all, he did sell his script). 

While his method may have worked for him, it may not work for you for any number of reasons. These books are worth reading because they do offer a glimpse into the thought-process of a successful screenwriter, along with the usual samples that you can study, but just remember to take their pathway and alter it to fit your writing style and personality.

&lt;p&gt;The other type of screenwriting books usually comes from academia: often from a professor who has never sold a screenplay, but seems to know a lot about the format. These books are useful in learning the mechanics of the screenplay. It is crucial for a first-time writer to remember that all the characterization and pathos in the world cannot help a script that doesn't hold true to the basic foundation of what makes a screenplay a  screenplay in the first place. While it is true that there are plenty of scripts that break convention, knowing the convention is the only way you can break it successfully. The writers of these books can take a more generalized view of the process and focus in on things like act structures, climaxes, and inciting incidents, but rarely offer the advice on making your characters and story come alive. So any good writer will have a library that has at least two books from these two seperate categories.


===Syd Field and Robert Mckee===
&lt;p&gt;These are the two most well known screenwriting &quot;gurus,&quot; though neither has written a successful movie.  This does not mean they have nothing worthwhile to say; both writers are good analysts of structure and form. However, what you won't find in their books is how to put heart and spirit into your story. What is a story without heart and spirit? Lifeless. So get their books, read them, and use them to help you with structure. Just don't take their methods as gospel and don't be afraid to discard what they teach when the time is right.

===William Goldman===

&lt;p&gt;Goldman won an Academy Award for &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, another one for &quot;All the President's Men&quot; and he has written (among others) two famous books on screenwriting, &lt;i&gt;Adventures in The Screen Trade&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;More Adventures in the Screen Trade&lt;/i&gt;. The oft-quoted &quot;nobody knows anything&quot; (meaning you can have all the right elements for a great movie and flop at the box office) is a quote from &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot;. Although he does not teach structure, as Syd Field or Robert McKee do, he does provide often funny, sometimes heart-breaking insights into the life of a working (striving and surviving) screenwriter in Hollywood. His books are no screenwriting manuals, but the life and heart that are lacking in McKee's or Field's books are abundant in his memoirs. Read McKee once, so you know what people talk about when they mention &quot;inciting incident&quot; and other McKeeisms, but read Goldman every now and then, to be inspired, and know that, as hard as you think writing is for you, it is even harder for him.

===Cherry Potter - &lt;i&gt;Screen Language&lt;/i&gt;===

&lt;p&gt;An excellent counterweight to the more structural and formalistic screenwriting guides. Includes inspiring and original suggestions for approaching the process of generating and elaborating story ideas. Also contains insightful analyses of a number of classic films, concentrating on the sequence (a series of scenes) as an essential building block.

===J. Michael Straczynski - &lt;i&gt;The Complete Book of Scriptwriting&lt;/i&gt;===

&lt;p&gt;The Creator of the Emmy-winning series Babylon Five (as well as other credits too numerous to mention), J. Michael Straczynski provides a notable tome that marries insider experience with practical tips for outlining, writing, finding an agent, pitching and more. While his topic is broad (with sections on writing for movies, television, animation, radio, theatre and the business itself) his grasp and the script examples alone make it a worthy read. Producing between 2000 and 3000 pages of published or produced material every year, authors don't get much more credible than this.

===Elliot Grove - &lt;i&gt;Write and Sell the Hot Screenplay&lt;/i&gt;===

&lt;p&gt;From the director of Raindance, this book presents a down-to-earth, systematic approach to all the elements of writing a screenplay, plus a detailed strategy for selling it once it’s written. It covers a lot of ground and is therefore inevitably concise, but the clarity of the concepts and practical advice is hugely valuable. Elliot Grove regularly presents a two-day workshop of the same name, which is well worth attending

===Stephen King===

Okay, so he's not a screenwriter. He is, however, one of the best-selling authors of all time, so anything he has to say about writing is probably worth listening to.  King's book &lt;i&gt;On Writing&lt;/i&gt; is excellent as he tries to come to grips with what causes us to create and looks at from where the writing comes.  Anybody doing any sort of writing will find this book most useful.

=Screenwriting Websites=

===http://www.wordplayer.com===

WORDPLAY / wordplayer.com is a phenomenal resource. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio are working screenwriters who co-wrote the DreamWorks animated feature SHREK, winner of the first Academy Award for Best Computer Animated Film in 2002. These guys have written a number of brilliant essays and articles on the art and business of screenwriting that are essential reading.

==What is an &quot;Element&quot;==

Remember that seventies band [[Wikipedia:Earth, Wind &amp; Fire|Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]]? Actually, in film parlance, an element is not one of the four classical elements - nor one of the 101 modern elements. It is, instead, a well-known cast or crew member.  Jude Law is an element, as is Yuen Woo-ping, the famed fight director.  

If you have an element, studios and independent investors are inclined to give you money. You will get more money if you have signed Jude Law than if you have signed Yuen Woo-Ping, but both are enough to make your project a &quot;go.&quot;

== How to get an Element ==

! style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | The Harvey Keitel Part
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#ffffce;&quot; | 

This phrase was coined by Affleck and Damon and the method was explained by Peter Biskind in his great book 'Down and Dirty Pictures' and expanded upon during the launch of this book in the UK.  Here's Peter:

&quot;You really have to have a good script and a fairly bankable star attached, just like Jack Nicholson in 'About Schmidt'. That's a little bit of an exaggeration. The paradigmatic story, I think, is the way Matt Damon and Ben Affleck went about getting financing for 'Good Will Hunting' they knew the story of Quentin Tarantino attracting Harvey Keitel for 'Reservoir Dogs' and Harvey Keitel being the key factor getting Live Entertainment to finance the film for $1 million. So they wrote what became the Robin Williams part and they used it in 'Good Will Hunting' and used to refer it as the &quot;Harvey Keitel part&quot;.

That's what they did. They wrote a very self-contained part that a major actor could do in a week so it wouldn't interfere with his or her schedule, and they gave - I think Robin Williams got 30% of the gross for doing that tiny part. They got their deal based on the script and when Miramax got hold of it, they started to do what they often do which is the film went nowhere. But when Robin Williams committed to that role, it got made in a minute.&quot;

So the key to attracting a big star for a small film is to write a self contained part which you can shoot in one location in under a week.  This they can easily fit into their schedule and so it becomes attractive to them.

First, you need to decide who would be great for your part.  A small part for a crotchety grandfather who used to be a cop? Try Clint Eastwood. Once you have decided who you want, you need to attempt to contact them.  Direct contact is always best; if you know anyone who knows them, or if you can arrange to bump into them, take these options.  If direct contact is not possible, make contact with their agent or manager.  Here are some resources for finding managers or agents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MMM prodHeader}}
{{stub}}

== Types of microphone ==
* Dynamic: Most common / cheapest. Dynamic Microphones have a metal coil within a thin plastic diaphragm which vibrates beside a fixed-charge magnet, generating a voltage.  These microphones do not require an external power source.
* Condenser: Most require Phantom Power. Known for producing more detail, especially in the upper frequencies. Condenser microphones use one fixed and one movable electromagnetic plate, the vibration of which generates a voltage.  These mics require external power to charge the electromagnets. 
* Shotgun: A subtype of condenser mic that is used in filmmaking to catch dialogue during filming.  Shotgun mics are generally designs which use a long, notched barrel to increase side and rear rejection, picking up more sound from the front of mic.
* Ribbon: Ribbon Microphones use a thin charged ribbon beside a charged magnetic plate to generate a voltage.  Was rare, becoming more common. Catching speed as being 'smooth' on guitars. These mics require external power to charge the electromagnets. 
* Also: Mic Patterns
   * Omnidirectional: pickup sound in a circle around the mic
   * Cardioid: pickup sound better directly in front of the mic, less sound pickup as you move around the sides of the mic

== Electronics you should be aware of ==
=== Balanced versus unbalanced ===
Balanced audio connections use 3 wires for sending each channel: a positive phase, a negative phase, and a ground.  The sending device sends its output over both the plus phase and the negative phase.  But (and here's the clever bit) the signal is inverted on the negative phase.  The receiving device then inverts the negative phase back (to match the positive phase) and adds it to the positive phase.  Any noise picked up along a stretch of wire will be out of phase with itself, (once the destination reverts the negative phase) and be cancelled out.

=== Grounding ===

=== Shielding ===

=== Phantom power ===
Phantom power is used for condenser microphones that need power to run.  It is also used to power direct boxes.  Direct boxes turn unbalanced signal into balanced signal for reducing and preventing hum.  You will most often see phantom power in 48v.  You can get phantom power from a source such as many sound consoles, especially if you have a recording console.  If you don't have it built into your console, you can buy a portable unit that takes up an outlet and has an xlr in and xlr out(with 48v power).

== Boom technique ==
* http://www.filmunderground.com/77/Article/NWFS/Boom%20Techniques.htm

== Mixing ==
As a quick rule of thumb for a TV mix, dialogue should average 3.5/4 ppm on a meter i.e. around -20/-18dB. You should record it like this 
and mix at these levels. Peak dialogue shouts etc shouldn't really go above 6 ppm (-10dB). If you are recording or mixing for TV nothing 
should peak over 7ppm (-6dB). And those peaks should last a minimal amount of time. Music is mixed at the dubbing mixer's discretion, so 
that it works with the programme and fits with the dialogue, but shouldn't peak above 6.5ppm. A limiter would usually be placed across 
the output to ensure nothing goes above 7ppm.

If you are mixing for DVD or Theatre release you would use the full digital scale. Dialogues should still average -20/-18dB however your fx 
peaks can go the full range to 0dB but not over!

So you would have two mixes one for TV and one for DVD.

the BBC's audio delivery specification states:

&quot;Peak sound levels (when measured on a BS 5428 Peak Programme Meter) within the programme must not exceed PPM 6: that is, no greater than +8dB with respect to the reference level of -18dBFS.&quot;

In other words there should be no less than 10db of 'headroom' between the highest level you can record and your programme's highest peak. 

You can find the full document at:
http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/delivering_quality/pdf/tv/tv_standards_london.doc

It is preferable to have sound with &quot;hiss&quot; rather than distortion.  Distortion cannot be fixed, background noise can be somewhat fixed.

== What to record on? ==
=== The video camera ===
I've recorded onto camera quite a few times - the skinny is that you can get great audio from the cameras with XLR inputs and also:

The Canon XL1 does not have phantom power - you need an external mic power supply.

The DVX-100a has small audio controls which are more difficult to manipulate, a little movment seems to make a big difference in level

One of the two DVX100a's I've used had a buzz only when the DV tape was installed. Very annoying, but the other one was quiet.

The Sony PD170 has a good set of audio controls - especially the ch1/ch2 link function when using one microphone (two channels are better than one!)

The PD100 has needs a +48/XLR hot shoe attachment, otherwise it sounds fine.

It's wise to back up audio, and slate scenes without pausing, when using DV cameras - back up on DAT. On a recent 3 camera shoot, I had a total of 6 audio tracks, one into the DVx100a, one into a Canon Optura PI (fine little camera!), but with 1/8&quot; connector and one into a Sony tcd-08 DAT - the DAT won as the best overall sound with the lowest noise and cleanest sound. 
BM

=== DAT ===
DAT-Heads concerns itself with Digital Audio Tape decks, with an emphasis on their use for the recording and distribution of live music.

=== MiniDisk ===
ATRAC 3 is a proprietary lossy perceptual audio codec developed by Sony and used for minidisc and other Sony products such as the PlayStation Portable. Uncompressed PCM offers higher quality, and therefore field recording with a portable DAT or harddisk recorder is almost always preferable to a minidisc recorder. Personally, I'd trust a tape (DAT) more as I have accidentally recorded over material with the minidisk's chapter functions. It's easier to track down ABS (absolute time code) on a DAT, especially for sound logging purposes.
DAT = Digital Audio Tape

=== Hard Disk ===
Hard Disk recording has quickly become the industry standard (aside from analog tape.) Benefits include: Non-linear editing - no need to rewind or fast-forward to find different songs. Cost - You can buy a hard drive with well over a hundred gigs, for around a hundred bucks. 100 gigs can hold 300 hours of uncompressed single-channel audio, making it a very cheap way to record.

=== Portable Devices ===
With the advent of mp3 players, portable audio has become a household convenience. Some devices can be slipped into a pocket or clipped to a belt, but certain recorders are more bulky and cannot be carried as easily. Take this into consideration and make sure you have, if nothing else, long enough audio cables to allow your recordist to move around as he captures sound during your shoots.

== Wild track ==
When on location you should always record a &quot;wild track&quot;.  This should be a few minutes of the ambient noise from your location (the sound of traffic in the distance, birds singing etc).  You should ask the assistant director to tell the entire crew to be quiet so you get an undisturbed track.

Why bother?  In the edit it's very useful (and often absolutely required) to keep a wild track running in the background to smooth over the changes from cut to cut.

A Wild Track is an audio only recording of an actor's lines while the camera is NOT rolling. There are no sync marks or visible slates.  These wild recordings are used to replace dialogue from a filmed take that may be unusable for various reasons. Perhaps a plane flew over during the scene.  The Wild Track Or Wild Line will be used in part or in whole to replace the on-camera dialogue. It is also used for Off-camera lines that need to be recorded on-mic. Many times wild Lines are used to replace compromised recordings made during a Wide master shot where the microphone could not be placed in the optimal position. Because the shot is wide, lip-sync of these lines is not as critical and sync errors are not as visible as for a close up.

&quot;Room Tone&quot; or &quot;Presence&quot; is a wild recording of just the ambient sound of a location (no one speaking). It is used in post production to cover unwanted sounds (like the director's verbal instruction during the take). To record Room tone you should place the same microphone in the same position as it was during the dialogue take. Record at the same level used for the actual take but have everyone remain still and quiet.

Short films are often used as the starting place for new filmmakers, but others use them as an art form unto themselves, allowing the filmmaker far more creative control than he or she would have over a feature.  However, for those wanting to make a feature, it is commonly considered that one should make shorts first. Why is this?

Filmmaking is a skill that can only be learned by practice.  Diving into your first feature before learning your craft on shorts would be like driving your Dad's expensive sports car on the motorway before you'd had any lessons on quiet back-roads.  There has never been an easier time to make a short film.  Everyone owns or knows someone with a video camera.

==Advantages of shorts over features==
*Lower cost
*Less time commitment
*Can take bigger risks
*Good practice for filmmaking skills (almost all directors have made short films at one time or another)
*You can basically do anything you want - there are no censorship restrictions for short films (since there's no real market for them), and you don't need to tell a story in under ten minutes. You can just have an insane barrage of jokes and gags if you wish.

==Disadvantages of shorts==
*You'll never make your money back. It's rare to make any money at all from your short.

==What do you get (possibly)?==
*Publicity if you do well
*Networking
*Experience
*Fun (very important)

===Publicity and Networking===
The first two are maybes. Keep in mind that there are a lot of shorts out there. Don't expect them to come beating down your door just because you made something witty.

===Experience===
It is tough to start out big, and if you do, you can fall flat on your face (and the creditors can become your worst enemies). But, it helps to just try to get out there and shoot something. Taking a look at the outcome of a short piece can teach you a lot about yourself and what you need to improve (and maybe whether you are in the right industry).

===Fun  :)===
A short can be done with a bunch of friends in a week(end), or just some student actors. It can be shot with a cheap few hundred dollar handheld, and you can try out all kinds of things that you might feel a bit nervous about on a bigger budget film. You can take it easy and experiment. It can just be fun. If it isn't fun for you, well perhaps it is best that you only made a short.

The Ukrainian language, like Russian and Belorussian, uses the Cyrillic writing system, but Ukrainian alphabet has quite many differences from the aforementioned languages. Cyrillic alphabet is the modification of Greek alphabet which was used by saint fathers Cyril and Methodius to write sacred texts translated in Old Slavonic language. That is why many letters of the Ukrainian alphabet are similar to the Latin letters (because the Latin alphabet was also based on the Greek one).

There is a special sign in Ukrainian language, the apostrophe (апостроф), that used prior to я, ю, є, ї (ya, yu, ye, yi). For example, подвір'я (paw-dveer-ya), в'юн (v-yun), об'єкт (ob-yekt), під'їзд (pid-yizd). Unlike the hard sign in Russian, it is used much more often in Ukrainian.

== Pronunciation ==

Almost always Ukrainian words are pronounced literally i.e., each letter has fixed pronunciation and is pronounced only in one way, separately from the others. There are a few minimal exceptions, however, - they will be described also.

So the Ukrainian letters are pronounced:

* Consonants:

** '''Б''' - like ''b'' in ''big''
** '''В''' - like ''v'' in ''vote''
** '''Г''' - like ''h'' in ''hood'', also like ''h'' in ''Hamlet''. This h is soft. It is also voiced, unlike in English. 

Sometimes pronounced like a &quot;g&quot; as in &quot;gate&quot;

** '''Ґ''' - like ''g'' in ''go'', ''goose'' 
** '''Д''' - like ''d'' in ''door'', but without aspiration
** '''Ж''' - like ''s'' in ''measure, ''pleasure''
** '''З''' - like ''z'' in ''zoo''
** '''Й''' - like ''y'' in ''play'', ''joy''
** '''К''' - like ''k'' in ''keen''
** '''Л''' - like ''l'' in ''love''
** '''М''' - like ''m'' in ''month''
** '''Н''' - like ''n'' in ''night'' but the tongue touches the teeth, and not the alveoles
** '''П''' - like ''p'' in ''pig''
** '''Р''' - like ''r'' in ''rabbit'', but it's actually a trilled like the Spanish rr in perro
** '''С''' - like ''s'' in ''sing''
** '''Т''' - like ''t'' in ''table'', but without aspiration
** '''Ф''' - like ''f'' in ''fair''
** '''Х''' - like ''h'' but not soft; it is pronounced with the back of the throat and tongue. Often transliterated as 'kh' or 'ch', it's like the &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;Bach&quot;. (But not the 'ch' in German &quot;ich&quot;, which is pronounced further forward in the mouth.) Pronounced like ''j'' in Spanish in &quot;mojado&quot;.
** '''Ц''' - is pronounced like ''ts'' in ''bits''
** '''Ч''' - like ''ch'' in ''chess''
** '''Ш''' - like ''sh'' in ''shore'', ''shook''
** '''Щ''' - is pronounced like two separate sounds: '''ШЧ'''. Consider the sounds the letters 'shch' make in these phrases: &quot;Cash cheque&quot;, &quot;fish chowder&quot;, &quot;reddish cherry&quot;.

There are two sounds in Ukrainian that are represented by two letters:
** '''дз''' - like ''ds'' in ''goods'', ''bids''
** '''дж''' - like ''dg'' in ''hedge'' or the ''j'' in ''jam''

They are pronounced differently from coincidental combinations of the letters ''д'' and ''з'' or ''д'' and ''ж''. (cf. дзвеніти and підземний, бджола and піджарити)

Also there is a soft form of most consonants: mild '''Л''' sounds like ''l'' in ''leap'', mild '''Р''' sounds like the second ''r'' in ''carry'' or ''r'' in the Spanish ''arriba'' and so on. '''Ч''' is not always mild like it is in Russian or always hard like in Belorussian, it can be both mild and hard as in ''течія'' or ''чотири'' respectively.

The soft form is called ''palatalization'' where the tongue is moved from its original position. Consider the difference in pronunciation of ''key'' and ''cool''. In ''key'' the /k/ (precided by closed front vowel, the tongue moves up and forward) is palatalized and in ''cool'' the /k/ (labialized, and oral cavity is increased by this) is not. Same thing with ''tea'' and ''tool''. When we talk about soft or mild consonants we are talking about palatalization. Palatized consonants are called soft in Ukrainian.

A pair of identical consonants pronounsed not as a simple consonant and not as two separate sounds, but as long consonant.

* Vowels:
** Simple Vowels:
*** '''А''' - like ''a'' in ''father'' or the second ''a'' in ''apart''
*** '''E''' - like ''e'' in ''echo'', ''edit'', also like ''a'' in ''at''
*** '''І''' - like ''ee&quot; in &quot;meet&quot; and softens the previous consonant
*** '''И''' - like ''y'' in ''myth'' or 'i' in 'big' (near to the Russian sound ''Ы''), it is almost the same as '''І''' but should never be after a soft consonant
*** '''О''' - like ''o'' in &quot;more&quot;, &quot;lore&quot;, &quot;fore&quot;. NOT like &quot;o&quot; in ''obey'', and but never spoken as ''ou''. 
*** '''У''' - like ''oo'' in &quot;moon&quot;.
** Complex Vowels - have their analogs among simple vowels; if a complex vowel follows an hard (not mild) consonant, the consonant becomes mild and the vowel is pronounced as the simple; else first '''Й''' is pronounced, followed by the corresponding simple vowel:
*** '''Я''' -  '''ЙА''' pronounced &quot;ya&quot; a 'y' in front of an 'a' as in ''yard''
*** '''Є''' -  '''ЙЕ''' pronounced &quot;ye&quot; as in ''yes''
*** '''Ї''' -  '''ЙІ''' pronounced &quot;yi&quot; it is never placed after a consonant because ''І'' already palatalizes the consonant automatically
*** '''Ю''' -  '''ЙУ''' pronounced like as in &quot;you&quot;

'''Ь''' is not pronounced, it is called '''м’який знак''' (soft sign) or '''знак м’якшeння''' (sign of softening) and is used to make preceding consonant palatized. For example, in ''замість'' (instead of) the ''т'' is softened. In fact, the ''м'' is also softened by the ''і'' and the ''с'' is also softened by being in front of the soft ''т''

Keep in mind that there is no complex vowel that corresponds to '''О'''. Instead, '''Й''' and '''Ь''' are used together with '''О''' letter: ''його'', ''льодом''. 

Also the apostrophe sign is used after a consonant and before a complex vowel to prevent the consonant from becoming mild. The complex vowel is therefore pronounced like ''й'' and corresponding simple vowel. For example, ''в'язати'' (to tie up) is pronounced like ''вйазати''.

*Some cases of discrepancies between spelling and pronunciation:
**unvoiced consonant + voiced consonant = voiced pair (''боротьба'' is pronounced like ''бородьба''); but voiced consonant + unvoiced consonant or unvoiced consonant + approximant consonant do not change, except:
***'''З''' + unvoiced consonant = '''С''' (''розпис'' is pronounced like ''роспис'');
***'''Г''' + '''К''' or '''Т''' = '''Х''' (''нігті'' is pronounced like ''ніхті'');
**a pair of sibilants converges (''зшити'' is pronounced like ''шшити''; ''стежці'' → ''стезці''; ''дочці'' → ''доцці'').

==Try to Pronounce==

Here are some Ukrainian words. Try to pronounce them keeping in mind the bolded vowels are stressed:

* Рак (''rak''; crayfish) - Pronounce &quot;rruk&quot;, not &quot;rzake&quot;.
* Юрб'''а''' (''yurba''; crowd)
* '''Ї'''жа (''yizha''; food)
* Р'''а'''нок (''ranok''; morning)
* Кол'''и'''-н'''е'''будь (''koly-nebud' ''; somewhen)
* Ядр'''о''' (''yadro''; kernel)
* Сл'''о'''вa (''slova''; word)
* Ґедзь (''ged'z'''; gadfly) - &quot;Ґ&quot; is pronounced like &quot;g&quot; in &quot;get&quot;. In this word &quot;дз&quot; is palatalized. Touch your tongue to the palate and say &quot;z&quot;.
* Прох'''а'''ння (''prokhannya''; request, wish) - Long and soft &quot;ннь&quot; [-ɲːɑ].
* Б'''у'''ти (buty; to be) - Do not pronounce it &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;и&quot; doesn't sound like [i], slide back a bit.

Ukrainian is written as pronounced just like the other Slavs, but, like Russian and Bulgarian, the stress is very unpredictable and stressing the wrong syllable can lead to misunderstandings. Virtually every textbook and dictionary will write these words with an acute accent (ˊ) on the stressed syllable: юрба́, кість, ра́нок, коли́-небудь, ядро́, слі́дувати, ґедзь, бу́ти. Watch out for words that are written the same, but stressed in a different syllable, such as з'''а'''мок (castle) — зам'''о'''к (lock).

IFX Piranha HD is an ultra high end compositor. Actually it's much more than a compositor. It's really an effects suite along the lines of an inferno system (A turn key effects system from Discreet/SGI). It provides Hardware assisted rendering as well.

Wings 3D is a free, open source polygon modeler that was originally inspired by Nendo and later Mirai (both by Izware). Once learnt, its clean, no-frills interface and wide-ranging (but unbloated!) toolset lets the user concentrate on their prime purpose - modeling. 

The current release is available from the [http://www.wings3d.com/ Wings 3D site]. Other software is necessary to allow models made in Wings to be (properly) rendered and / or animated, although Wings does have an excellent feature-rich native UV unwrap facility.

Many industry standard import / export options are supported by Wings to allow it to communicate with the 'outside world'

El Martillo-ons y tira -offs es dos técnicas de cerca relacionadas. Se utilizan para jugar ' ' el '' del legato, es decir, de una manera lisa, y también se utilizan para ayudar al guitarist a jugar más rápidamente.

una E abierta en la primera secuencia. Mientras que la nota todavía está sonando, rápidamente y firmemente presione un dedo en el tercer traste. Si está hecha correctamente, una nota de G debe sonar. Esto se llama &quot;martilleo en&quot; la secuencia. Sin la amplificación eléctrica, martillo-en tiende para hacer el &amp;mdash más reservado sano; ¡mucho más reservado si uno no lo ha practicado! (aunque, porque las secuencias están más cercano al fingerboard, el martillo-ons es más fácil de ejecutarse en una guitarra eléctrica, son utilizadas extensivamente por los guitarists acústicos también.) Martillo-en la lata apenas como juegúese fácilmente con las notas preocupadas: juego justo la nota normalmente y martillo sobre otro traste (alto-numerado) en la misma secuencia. el

tira -apagado es el contrario del martillo-en. Sostenga la secuencia de E en el tercer traste. Pulse la secuencia y, mientras que la nota todavía está sonando, lance el dedo de preocupación. Si está hecho correctamente, el G se debe seguir por una E abierta. Como martillo-en, esto tiende para hacer el sonido más reservado. Para ayudar a aliviar esto, un movimiento oblicuo leve del dedo mientras que el quitar agregará la vibración adicional a la secuencia, preservando el volumen. Es muy duro que un principiante logren, y las ayudas oblicuas del movimiento grandemente. el

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before the common acceptance of the heliocentric model in the mid 1500s, the Earth was believed to be the center of the known universe. Many inherent problems in the geocentric model of the universe led Nicolaus Copernicus to formulate an alternate means by which planets and stars moved. Two such problems are the apparent retrograde motion of various planets, specifically Mars, and the ensuing epicycle theory made to compensate for this issue, as well as the phases of Venus that occur.


== Planetary Motion and Epicycles ==

[[Image:Ptolemy Epicycles.svg|250px|right|thumb|A model of the Ptolemaic model of geocentrism, complete with an epicycle.]]
Viewing Earth as the center of our universe, many of the planets in our solar system take on a peculiar motion across the night sky. For instance, Mars appears to move in a retrograde fashion from time to time. Since the geocentric model holds that all the planets in our solar system orbit the Earth, this would mean that from time to time Mars reverses its orbital direction only to resume it later. The Greek astronomer, Ptolemy, sought to explain this phenomenon with the use of epicycles - that is, small circular motions that planets orbiting the Earth followed on top of their circular orbit around the Earth. Astronomers from Greek times to the Enlightenment compensated for flaws in the geocentric model by adding extra layers of epicycles, until the system was so complex it became virtually unusable. Copernicus' heliocentric model, placing the Sun at the center with planets going around it rather than around the Earth, rid the universe of many of the epicycles that plagued astronomy at that time.

== Phases of Venus ==
[[Image:Phases-of-Venus.svg|thumb|right|250px|As can be seen, the discovery of the full range of phases of Venus by Galileo indicated that the Earth could not be at the center of the universe]]
[[Image:Geocentric_phases_of_Venus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Given the geocentric model, it would be impossible for Venus to be &quot;full&quot; - that is, entirely illuminated. This is one of the factors that convinced Galileo of heliocentrism]]
Another problem with the geocentric model occurred when observing Venus and its relative phases: should Venus and the Sun orbit the Earth, then it would be impossible for Venus to be in the &quot;full&quot; phase, that is complete illumination (similar to a full moon). Thus, the Ptolemaic model predicted only crescent and new phases of Venus. Yet, as Galileo observed, this was clearly not the case; Venus exhibited all phases of the moon, a phenomenon predicted and accounted for by Copernicus' model. Discovered by Galileo, this phenomenon was one of the key factors that would end up supporting the Heliocentric view of the universe.

Note that this is only one of a number of observations made by Galileo that contradicted the ancient beliefs, but this one most directly called into question the idea that planets orbit the Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''GET''' is a reference text for undocumented [[w:HTTP|GET]] arguments available on queryable [[w:WWW|WWW]] pages.

Background:  Web/Html forms are a process which allows users/viewers to Enter information on a web page which will then be sent to the web server for processing.  The most common method for processing is called CGI ( Common Gateway Interface ) and this stipulates how the data will be passed to an external ( from the web server) program and how that program will generate  web page to be displayed back to the user.  The HTML form can specify one of two methods for data to be sent from the webserver, the first is GET which specifies that all information is included in the requested URL.  The second is POST which specifies that additional information will be sent after the URL request.  While there are advantages of both the biggest advantage of GET is that since everything is in the URL the input (and resulting display) can be bookmarked or saved in a link so that the data doesn't need to be re-entered each time.  The biggest advantage of POST is that there isn't a limit on the size of the data which can be passed, so may claim that it also allows data to be passed secretly but that is a fallacy.  What is not necessarily widely known is that since most writers of CGI scripts use libraries to decode the form data and most library writers check for a decode both GET and POST automatically and treat both types the same, you can turn most POST forms into GET requests/links which allow for documented exploration.  HTML forms and GET (and POST) encoding is well documented on the web, and the source code can be easily viewed in most browsers with view source options.

GET arguments are the simplest means of querying a dynamic web page for specific information.  They consist of a simple modification to the base [[w:URL|URL]], beginning with a &quot;?&quot; sign after the filename.  Not all websites provide GET argument interfaces as part of their information portal, but many do.

For example, the [[w:Google|Google]] web interface can be queried directly by URL.  If you wish to search Google for &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, you can simply type the following directly into your address bar: http://www.google.com/search?q=Wikipedia

Everything after the &quot;?&quot; is the GET argument, which tells the Google server what you are interested in.  If you are unfamiliar with this, try experimenting by changing the text after the &quot;q=&quot; in the above URL.

Knowing GET arguments can be useful for everyday browsing, but are also a lot of fun for [[w:hacker|hacker]]s (mostly the harmless type) to play with in writing computer scripts.  Most web pages that allow GET queries do not, however, provide any documentation of the available parameters.  In the Google URL above, it is easy to determine that the &quot;q=&quot; string indicates your &quot;query&quot; and whatever follows it is what Google looks up.  The arguments are not always easy to decipher, however.

The idea of the '''GET''' Wikibook is to allow hacker types who have bothered to decipher cryptic GET strings to share their discoveries.

I'm Polish so I've fixed small mistake - locativ of 'piwo' (beer) is 'piwie', not 'piwu'. Simmilar 'słowo' - locativ 'słowie' (word), 'paliwo' - locativ 'paliwie' (gasoline).

Okay, you've decided on some sounds that you want to use in your language, on a way to write the sounds, and on what sounds can go where; now it's time to start word-building.

== Morphology ==

Word building isn't as simple as picking a word from the dictionary and making up a pattern of sounds (don't worry, it's not as boring either).  If you look in an English dictionary you will find many words that can be broken up into smaller words.  For example, the word '''everybody''' can be split into the two words '''every''' and '''body'''.  Even more often, you will find words that can be broken up into pieces that aren't actually full words.  '''Indescribable''' can be broken down into '''in-''', '''describe''', and '''-able'''.  You will notice that ''in-'' and ''-able'', while not full words, still mean something (even if what they mean  isn't exactly clear); the same word-parts appear in '''inadequate''' and '''readable''' and many other words.

These 'half words' are called affixes, and they build new words from simpler words.  (There are also affixes that change properties of a word without changing what word it is, like English ''-s'' for plural, but we'll deal with those in the [[../Grammar|next section]].)  You'll almost certainly want some word-building affixes for your conlang.  They give your vocabulary texture, and the more of them you have, the more words you can add to your vocabulary just by inventing one new simple word.

There are lots of different kinds of affixes, depending on how they change a word when they attach to it.  Some simple techniques you can use:
*add onto the front of a word (like ''in-'').
*add onto the end of a word (like ''-able'').
*insert into the middle of a word (like hip-hop ''-iz-'' in '''house'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''hizouse''').
*change part of a word (like '''goose'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''geese'''; of course that affix doesn't build a new word, but it shows another way an affix can work).
An affix may take different forms on different words, like ''-able'' that on some words becomes ''-ible''.  Sometimes the forms used on different words are so different that you might think of them as different affixes, that just happen to mean the same thing and apply to entirely different sets of words &amp;mdash; like the plural affix in '''goose'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''geese''', where for most English words the plural affix has the form ''-s'' or ''-es''.

If you set up your word-building affixes to work the same way as in English, even if they use different sounds and attach differently, they'll still make your conlang [[Conlang/Types#Relexes|feel similar to English]].  For example, if you have an affix equivalent to English ''un-'', don't use it exactly the way English does.  Experiment with it &amp;mdash; you might have no word for &quot;bad&quot;, but have &quot;ungood&quot; instead; maybe have a word for &quot;uncommon&quot; that doesn't use the &quot;un-&quot;, in the same way &quot;bad&quot; isn't &quot;ungood&quot;.

== Vocabulary ==

The English word '''manual''' comes from the Latin word ''manus'', which means &quot;hand&quot;.  Right?  Well, sort of.  Latin is a language with relatively few different words, so each word has to do a lot of work.  The Latin word ''manus'' does mean &quot;hand&quot;, the part of the human anatomy; but it also means &quot;fist&quot;; &quot;handwriting&quot;; &quot;finishing touch&quot;; &quot;workmanship&quot;; &quot;team&quot;; &quot;gang&quot;; &quot;band of soldiers&quot;; and &quot;trunk&quot;, the part of the anatomy of an elephant.  The English language has a tremendous number of different words, so the average word doesn't have to do nearly as much &amp;mdash; but especially basic and common words may still have a fairly wide range of meanings, and the English word '''hand''' is like that; it can mean everything from a person's handwriting (like in Latin), or the pointy bits on a clock face, to the set of cards that a player holds in a card game.  (Compare: [[wikt:manus#Latin|Latin '''''manus''''']], [[wikt:hand#English|English '''hand''']].)

No word in one natlang means exactly the same thing as any word in another natlang.  To keep your conlang from feeling like English, don't give it words for just the same concepts as in English.  Try to invent words that have the meanings of more than one English word, or are more specific than English words.  Even better are words that fall between levels of description in English.  For example, you might create a word that means &quot;a four-legged hairy animal&quot;, to cover '''dog''' as well as '''horse''', but not as much as '''mammal''' or '''animal'''.  Think about a whole set of related or similar things (for instance, colors, animals, or family relationships), and how your language can divide that mass of reality into manageable parts in a different way than English. 

You can even create words for concepts that are only very clumsily expressed in English, such as: ''that awkward situation when something has happened, which is known to more than one present party, which neither wish to speak about, and suddenly they have nothing to say to each other''.  Another word could mean the same thing, but with another, unknowing party present, who senses a weird atmosphere between the other parties.

Part of the challenge of conlanging &amp;mdash; whether you're building an artlang, engelang, or auxlang &amp;mdash; is that you won't really know how your language is going to feel until you've got enough of it together to start saying interesting things in it.  (That's also one reason why conlangers may tend to keep tinkering with their creations.)  So how can you tell, early in building your vocabulary, whether it will come out too much like English?  Well, as a rule of thumb, building a vocabulary of a hundred words or so should be a pretty massive job &amp;mdash; done properly, it's a major milestone, like a small company landing its first big client &amp;mdash; and each additional hundred words should be heavy work as well.  If you easily reach, say, a thousand words, you're probably in real danger of producing a conlang that will always feel too much like your native language, no matter what sounds and grammar you give it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to the Series==
This book is part of a series of three text books on data structures and algorithms:

* [[Computer Science:Data Structures|Data Structures]] -- A book suitable for a first course in data structures that presents the most common data abstractions and their construction and properties. A tutorial on the most key points.
* [[Algorithms|Algorithms]] -- A book suitable for a first course in algorithms that presents the most common algorithmic techniques and how to analyze algorithms. Assumes some knowledge of data structures. A tutorial on the most key points.
* [[Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms|Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms]] -- A book that covers more advanced material that assumes some prior knowledge of data structures and algorithms. While the first two books are tutorials, this book is more reference based. Thus, its content can be much more eclectic. Advanced (and interesting) material that doesn't fall into the tutorial nature of the first two books belongs in this book.

The reason these books are in a series is to help narrow their focus and to aid coordination of the efforts. An eventual goal is that books will be available for every computer science subject.

==Guidelines==
# If you want to fix a bug, simply click on &quot;edit&quot;, make your changes, and click on save. We'll review the changes to be sure they are appropriate for the book. If you are unsure, you can visit the &quot;discussion&quot; page and ask there. In general, to make a small change, you don't need to ask first, and you can just use common sense to determine if your change is appropriate.
# If you would like to write a chapter, section, or part of a section, take a look at the items marked with &quot;TODO&quot; tags and start there.
# Be sure to read all other sections of the book first in order to avoid duplication of content.
# When writing a section, you can mark some parts as &quot;[TODO: ''explanation'']&quot;, where ''explanation'' describes what you intend to take place in that part. For example, if you aren't good at making images, you can make as a TODO item a description of the image that should go there. Perhaps someone who is effective at making images will notice this and provide one for you. The purpose of a TODO item is to give the plan of what should be written.
# This is a tutorial: We aren't aiming to create an encyclopedia of every algorithm ever created, nor are we trying to present the absolutely best versions of particular algorithms.
# Don't include links to wikipedia articles in the book's chapters: The idea is that each book is self-contained so a reader can print out the book and read it separately, instead of having to navigate through it online.
# The book uses a pseudocode language that should be familiar enough to those who know Algol-family languages (including C, Java, Pascal, and Python). It includes extra features that help abstract away nitty-gritty implementation details, and thus allows for the real algorithmic idea to be communicated, rather than focusing on the trivial implementation issues that are language dependent.
# Implementations in non pseudocode can be written for an appendix. These implementations can serve to be usable by readers and to make clear any possible ambiguities. Implementations should be tested well and include test cases. Implementation languages are Python, C, Java and Scheme.
# Put a star (&quot;*&quot;) next to section or sub-section titles if the material presented there isn't essential to understanding the larger point of the chapter. (For example, a more junior reader might elect to skip or skim these sections.)
# Use primary sources when possible. If you do use a reference, put it on the references section. Never copy content without asking permission. Further, note that even some GFDL content uses a different license version (not all are forward compatible, either) and should not be copied without permission.
# Use the wikipedia as another source for material, but edit the material to present only the main points and ideas: the encyclopedic detail of the wikipedia can become a distraction when trying to learn just the basic concepts.
# Use the mathematical royal &quot;we&quot; for some phrases, but try to use the second-person &quot;you&quot; as much as possible: it makes sentences easier to construct that also sound more direct.
# Look for insights into understanding an algorithm or a part of the software engineering process in general.
# Avoid using the [[w:passive voice|passive voice]] (&quot;The article was written by us.&quot;).  Instead, try to use the [[w:active voice|active voice]] (&quot;We wrote the article.&quot;).
# Don't use &quot;this&quot; as a pronoun, only use it as an adjective.

==Development Phases==
# A table of contents should be created and more or less agreed upon. Such a table will set the scope for the book. Changes, of course, can be made later. ({{stage short|100%|May 28, 2005}} ''DONE'': The TOC is more or less agreed upon by contributors)
# After the chapters are broken up, the sections and subsections should be designed, with TODO items describing the content to go in that place. ({{stage short|100%|May 28, 2005}} ''DONE'')
# The most important concepts should be written first, to provide an anchor and context for the other material to be built from. ({{stage short|50%|May 28, 2005}} ''IN PROGRESS'': Join us!)
# Implement C, Java, Python and Scheme versions of the algorithms and put them in the appendixes. ({{stage short|00%|May 28, 2005}} Still ''TODO''...)
# Similar to an open-source project, more and more &quot;features&quot; (i.e., chapters and sections) should be added. This stage will happen after the First Edition milestone is met. However, when making improvements for the second edition, core items shouldn't be neglected. ({{stage short|00%|May 28, 2005}} Still ''TODO''...)

Writing a book takes time and dedication, but if you've come this far, it's probably going to be worth it. Just as free software programs don't simply drop from the tree, whole open books won't write themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trigonometry is the study of the properties of triangles. 

* '''&quot;Tri&quot;''' is Ancient Greek word for three, 
* '''&quot;gon&quot;''' means side, 
* '''&quot;metry&quot;''' measurement

Together they make &quot;measuring three sides&quot;. 

If you know some facts about a triangle, such as the lengths of its sides, then using trigonometry you can find out other facts about it.  If you know the lengths of sides then you can find what the angles are.  If you know the length of one side and of two of the angles, then you can work out what the remaining angle is, and also what the lengths of the other two sides are.

As a consequence the Ancient Greeks were able to use trigonometry to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. &lt;!--Link to a page showing how--&gt;

==Starting Learning Trigonometry==

One of the first things we learn in trigonometry is how to calculate what the third angle in a triangle is when given the other two angles.  For example, in a triangle if two of the angles are &lt;math&gt;60^{\circ}\,&lt;/math&gt; then the third angle must be &lt;math&gt;60^{\circ}\,&lt;/math&gt; too.

However, if we're instead told two lengths, say 7cm and 10cm, and if we're not told anything about the angles, then the third length has a range of possibilities.  It could be 5cm.  It could be 15cm.  

To calculate lengths we start out by examining a right-angled triangle, i.e. one where one of the angles is &lt;math&gt;90^{\circ}\,&lt;/math&gt;.  [[File:Rtriangle.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|A right-angle triangle]]  

We'll be using right-angled triangles a lot.

In a right-angled triangle we ''can'' work out the length of the longest side if given the lengths of the two shorter sides.  In a right-angled triangle the lengths of the sides have a particularly nice relationship to each other.  The formula for this relationship is written:

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

How you use this formula to calculate the third side when you know two of the sides in a right-angled triangle is explained in the page on the '[[../Pythagorean Theorem|Pythagoras' Theorem]]'

What if the triangle isn't a right-angled triangle, though?  What if it doesn't have a right angle?

More complex triangles can be built by joining right-angled triangles together.  What we learn about right-angled triangles enables us to work with other kinds of triangles too.  Trigonometry and trigonometric functions can also be used with more complex shapes such as squares, hexagons, circles and ellipses.  Ultimately the most important mathematical tools we have for measuring the universe are based on the study of the mathematics of triangles.

Trigonometry is a fundamental step in your mathematical education. From the seemingly simple shape, the right triangle, we gain tools and insight that help us in practical and theoretical endeavors. The subtle mathematical relationships between the right triangle, the circle, the sine wave, and the exponential curve can only be fully understood with a firm foundation in trigonometry.

&lt;!--
If you're learning how to do trigonometry, we suggest you bookmark the following page:

* [[../Overview|Overview of Trigonometry]]

You are also likely to find the videos and exercises at the Khan Academy useful.  To get good at trigonometry you will need to practice worked examples and exercises.

===In Review===

Here are some useful formulas that should be learned before delving into trigonometry:

:Pythagorean Theorem: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;, in a right triangle where ''a'' and ''b'' are the two sides, and ''c'' is the hypotenuse.
:Pythagorean Triples: 3-4-5 (the two smaller values being the sides, with the larger the hypotenuse), 5-12-13, 7-24-25, 8-15-17, and any multiples of these (including 6-8-10, 10-24-26, etc.) 
===Properties of Special Right Triangles=== 
In a 45-45-90 right triangle, i.e., an isosceles right triangle, let one leg be x. The hypotenuse is then x&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
In a 30-60-90 right triangle, let the short leg, i.e. the leg opposite the 30° angle, be x. The hypotenuse is then equal to 2x and the longer leg, i.e. the leg opposite the 60° angle, is equal to x*&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with the lengths of the sides and size of the angles of triangles.  Because many physical questions can be framed in terms of triangles, trigonometry has found wide use in the physical sciences and engineering. 

Trigonometry is needed in surveying and architecture since relationships between lengths and angles in triangles are used directly.

Trigonometry is also used in electrical engineering.  The functions that relate angles and side lengths in right triangles turn out to also be useful in expressing how AC electric current varies with time.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

:You just add a standard link to wikipedia's page on the subject. [[User:Programmermatt|Programmermatt]] 20:38, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

According to the Wikipedia article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal Sexagesimal], it was the ancient Sumerians who first invented it, not the Greeks. Is this correct? [[User:Gotsomeideas|Gotsomeideas]] ([[User talk:Gotsomeideas|talk]]) 21:17, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

James.Spudemann made a HUGE edit where he changed the nature of the introduction.  An introduction should, I think, promote eagerness in the reader to learn the subject, but I don't think the new introduction does that.  I'll change the introduction with this in mind. [[Special:Contributions/79.79.171.154|79.79.171.154]] ([[User talk:79.79.171.154|talk]]) 10:19, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

I agree that was a hugely significant edit.  It lost some important content and changed the book's tone.  I feel that for someone wanting to learn trigonometry the original introduction, before James.Spademann's historical notes, was way better.  This is in fact a general problem with how the book is shaping up.  It's becoming less suitable for someone learning how to do trigonometry.  I am adding back the lost material and making the historical background something readers are more likely to skip over on a first reading.

Religion is about our 'human spirit'. This may mean a simple shared philosophy, such as a 'team spirit'  familiar to participants of successful sporting and military activities, or a highly complex set of religious beliefs, sacred laws and temporal regulations about how 'we' may conduct ourselves and how 'they' -the rest of the world - is (or should be) properly ordered. 

==History==
Religion is a cultural manifestation that may have had a role in the survival of human groups and nations. Traditionally most religions were enforced, and people who failed to conform to religious rules (apostasy) or who expressed doubt (blasphemy) or interpreted things differently (heresy) were severely punished, often by death. Generally religion requires its adherents to support each other, and either enables or requires enemies (including the 'internal' dissidents just mentioned) to be suppressed or killed 'lawfully' within a general philosophy of 'divine justice' or some specific pronouncement of 'justified war'.

Religions develop depending on the way of life: Gathering and field work once were female activities and are highly dependent on the soil, leading to earth godesses. On the other hand, hunting and pastoral work were reserved for men, causing their gods to be male. These gods are often associated with the weather or the sky.

==Distortions==
In much of the western world, where Christianity is dominant, a common mis-conception of religion is simply that it involves a  God, or god-like figures such as emperors, royal households or priestly organizations. Since such people are supposedly 'appointed by God' they are generally assumed to be divinely authorized to rule, utterly incapable of error and so worthy of praise, love and devotion. 

This westernized view is however, extremely incomplete. It excludes many human activities that generally fall under the heading of &quot;religion&quot; and distorts the spiritual beliefs of many people in other religions. 

For example, Buddhism is a religion without a God. Though many forms of it have imagined the Buddha as a Christ-like figure, other Buddhists think of him as an historical figure -- not to be worshipped, but respected as a man of insight who set an example for others to follow. 

Afro-Cuban religions like Vodoun include ''loa'', powerful beings who are not gods, and are not worshipped, but are dealt with as we deal with our fellow humans. Believers allow these beings to possess them, under certain specific and controlled circumstances, in order to converse with them and receive advice. Quasi-religious practices, such as Taoism, or certain tantric schools, are harder still to classify in any easy way.

So before we can arrive at a toolbox for building a constructed religion, we must arrive at a reasonable definition. I propose the following as a reasonable definition of a religion: A set of metaphysical beliefs that describe the sort of existence we live in, suggests a goal its adherents wish to attain, and prescribes a method whereby that goal may be obtained by the individual.

== Forms of Religion ==
Religions take many forms and variations.  Don't let difficult words (and -isms) scare you! Some of them are described below, but the most common forms are atheism (believing that there is no god), agnosticism (unsure if god exists or not), monotheism (one God), polytheism (many gods) as well as monolatrism, polylatrism, henotheism, kathenotheism, deism, idealism, and animism.

=== Atheism and Humanism ===
Atheism is non belief in Gods and Goddesses. 
( Theism is belief in one or more of these. 
&quot;A&quot; is from Greek, meaning &quot;not&quot;,&quot;without&quot;; hence &quot;Atheism&quot; is &quot;Without Theism&quot;.)

Atheists hold that ideas of Deities are merely human constructs. 

Humanists omit belief in the Supernatural and concentrate on human life in this world.
Some humanist groups have trained officiants to lead weddings, funerals, namings or other life-passage ceremonies if individuals need them.

All ethics are seen as derived from human understanding of actions and their consequences.
Laws are not seen as given by Deities but arise out of society's consensus about how actions should be regulated.

Those who find Theism unbelievable of course share the common goals of all people who want to live in societies that promote happiness and security.

=== Agnosticism ===
View that God’s existence is unprovable: the belief that it is impossible to know whether or not God exists. Agnosticism is rarely the basis for a whole belief system but is commonly associated with atheism or skepticism.

=== Monotheism ===
Monotheism is the belief in one single god exclusively, and that no other gods exist.  This is the form professed by most, if not all, denominations of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, although Trinitarian sects of Christianity are sometimes construed &amp;mdash; generally not by their own followers &amp;mdash; to have a &quot;pantheon&quot; of three gods (the Trinity).

=== Polytheism ===
Polytheism is the counterpart of monotheism and holds that multiple gods (forming what is usually called a pantheon) exist. Most of the religions now regarded as &quot;mythology&quot; and most neopagan religions embrace some form of polytheism.

=== Monolatrism ===
''(Note: Different definitions of Monolatrism appear. The definition given here is not the only one.)''
Monolatrists worship only one god, but believe other gods exist. They believe that the other gods leave non-worshippers alone. It has been suggested that early Judaism was a monolatrism based on alleged references to other gods in sacred texts.

=== Polylatrism ===
''(Note: Polylatrism is not a word in real usage. It is used here for convenience and because the word just makes sense.)''
Polylatrism implies that a people worships a sub-set of gods exclusively but believes in the existence of other gods. They believe that other gods leave non-worshippers alone. Many neo-Pagans adhere to something akin to polylatrism, but the closest thing to a historical example we have might be the ancient Celts, which evidence suggests held a policy of &quot;you worship your gods, we'll worship ours&quot;.

=== Kathenotheism ===
Kathenotheism is a hard concept for many to understand, but might be best described as worshipping a Divine Office instead of the god holding it. Kathenotheists might believe there is a series or cycle of supreme deities, and worship each one for only as long as they hold the power of supreme god.

=== Henotheism ===
Henotheists worship one single god while not denying the existence of others. The difference between henotheism and monolatrism is that henotheists seem believe that the non-worshipped gods have power over those who don't believe in them.

=== Deism ===
''(Note: Deism has had many forms over the years. This is just one.)''
Deists assert that a power created the world but abandoned it, or at least doesn't interfere with it. Some forms of Deism say that in creating the world, the creator became part of it; this is a kind of pantheism. This form of religion appeared heavily in the thinking of many Enlightenment era philosophers, though not as of yet in a major religion. Famous Deists include Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.

=== Idealism ===
Idealists, in this sense, worship or strive toward a creed, philosophy, or perfect ideal and might be considered a secular religion. Examples include the North Korean philosophy of Juche and arguably many forms of Buddhism.

=== Animism ===
Animists believe that a soul or other supernatural power is in every single object. Mostly associated with pre-agricultural or hunter-gatherer cultures.

=== Manism ===
Manism is based on the belief that the deceased, often family members, mythological ancestors or saints, have a continued existence and/or possess the ability to influence the fortune of the living. Manism is most frequent in settled cultures.

== Concepts of Death ==
=== Reincarnation ===
This is a belief that after death, one will be born again in some form. There are many belief systems around this idea. A Southeast Asian folk tradition holds that one is reborn into the same family, so that you might be your Great-Aunt Edith. 

The most famous belief system pertaining to reincarnation is that of the Hindu Brahmins, which was exported to many lands and forms the basis of many New Age philosophies. In Brahminism, acceptance of one's station in life is necessary to improvements to one's status in future lives. Thus, a wealthy member of the nobility deserves his good fortune because of his actions in past lives, and the low-caste and untouchables similarly deserve their fate. The ultimate state, nirvana, is an extinguishing of all personality and desire. 

Not all who believe in reincarnation share this philosophy. Gnostic Christians, Druids, and Native Americans among many others have their own ideas of what it is like.

=== Nothingness after Death ===
This is the belief that nothing happens after death, except the bodily functions and consciousness cease. Most people would agree that the lives of the more charismatic ancients are recorded in human fable, religious tradition or vernacular (written) historical records. It is thus common for humans to achieve a sort of vicarious immortality simply by leading a full life which is interesting so capable of being 'bought alive' in the minds of our survivors and their students.  

=== Afterlife ===
This is the belief that some kind of world (an ideal heaven, limbo, underworld, or torment in hell) exists beyond the grave. It often provides at least two possibilities of happiness and torture based upon one's performance in life, or specific actions in one's life. This can be a powerful control myth for young impressionable warriors who may face death on the battlefield, and who must obey orders without question if their army is to be successful.  It is also a useful mechanism for instilling 'ethical values' and promoting 'righteous behavior'.

The underworld, like the Ancient Greek Tartaros, might also be akin to nothingness; the dualism of Heaven and Hell is actually a quite recent invention. According to the Romans and Greeks, everyone &amp;mdash;except for those who had directly committed a crime against the gods or those who had been really virtuous heroes&amp;mdash; would go to the Asphodel Meadows, a vast land with nothing in it. It might be compared to Purgatory, although the Asphodel Meadows were permanent.

Spiritualists believe that the next life is a place where one goes on learning and having a variety of experiences just as we do during our lifetimes. Many ancient peoples including the Egyptians conceived of the afterlife as being like Earth but without life's problems.

== Ritual ==
Although often overlooked, ritual holds an important place in human behavior. Ritual means repeating a sequence of activities in a routine (formulaic) way. Ritual may be something trivial, such as wearing 'lucky' clothes for certain important occasions such as job interviews, or extremely important aides to memory, such as the checks performed by a pilot before attempting to fly an airplane. Religious rituals generally are performed to make sure that all participants are 'of one mind' - that they have the same understanding of 'right' and wrong' behaviour. 

Some rituals may seem bizarre, but hold an important 'survival'  truth. The Pagan belief in sowing seed in the nude is an example. Without clothes, the farmer is sensitive to the air temperature, wind speed, soil condition, moisture content, presence of predators and so on. The 'comfortable' condition (in Southern Europe, where the practice emerged) just happens to be about ideal for seed germination, and so people who performed this naked sowing ritual also tended to have better harvests than those who did not!

Most religious rituals  tend to be simply routine reminders of our ancestors successful seasonal habits. The feasts of special food (for example the Western Christmas or Saturnalia, which is a winter solstice feast that tends to prevent depression) or fasts or absence of something familiar (Notably in early spring, when food is scarce, and we need to lose fat gained during winter) are common manifestations of formerly successful seasonal survival strategies for our ancestors, who lacked central heating and refrigerators. 

Most important however (both for a human survival and for our sheer enjoyment of human life) are public or religious celebrations of life's major events - birth, academic achievement, maturity, marriage, child rearing, sagacity and death. Most of these 'life changing' celebrations have become adapted, stylized and documented to reliably provide example, advice and guidance to attendees who aspire to achieving such goals.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is the primary conditional structure in Perl. The syntax is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if (''boolean expression'') {
    ''statement'';
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the ''boolean expression'' evaluates to true, the statements between the two braces will be executed. The braces around statements are mandatory, even if there is only one statement (unlike C or Java).

An alternative syntax to the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement may be used on a single statement.  This involves putting the conditional at the end of the statement rather than before, and does not include braces:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
''statement'' if (''boolean expression'') ;
&lt;/source&gt;

The following statements are synonymous:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ( $x == 20 ) { print &quot;hello&quot;; }
print &quot;hello&quot; if ( $x == 20 );
&lt;/source&gt;

You should choose whichever one is clearer in a given situation. For example, the following is legal, but unclear:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
foreach my $word (@words) {
    if ($word eq 'end') { last; }
    print &quot;$word\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This ''hides'' the &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; (which is like &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;, and ends the loop) over at the right. Instead use a postfix &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
foreach my $word (@words) {
    last if $word eq 'end';
    print &quot;$word\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''boolean expression'' conditional can contain any one of the comparison operators covered in the next section.

Multiple conditions can be checked together using the boolean expression operators:

* &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;  - logical and, C style; used for most conditionals
* &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; - logical and, but with a lower precedence; used for flow control 
* &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;  - logical or, C style; used for most conditionals
* &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;  - logical or, but with a lower precedence; used for flow control 
* &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;   - logical not, C style
* &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; - logical not, but with a lower precedence

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ( ($x == 20) || ( ($x &gt; 0)&amp;&amp;($x &lt; 10)&amp;&amp; !($x == 5) ) ){
    print &quot;x is equal to 20 or either between 0 and 10 but not 5.\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Conditional statements can also be extended with the &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; structures:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 if (''boolean expression 1'') {
     ''statement 1;''
 }
 elsif (''boolean expression 2'') {
     ''statement 2;''
 }
 else {
     ''statement 3;''
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is followed by any number (including zero) of &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; statements, and finally an optional &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; statement. The statements of an &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; will be executed if its boolean expression is true, and no preceding &lt;code&gt;(els)if&lt;/code&gt; statement's boolean expression is true. The trailing &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; (if present) is executed if none of the preceding statements' boolean expressions are true.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|Perl|Array Variables|User Input-Output}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A Perl hash is similar to an ordinary array, but instead of using integer indexes, a hash uses &quot;keys&quot; that can take on any scalar value.   These are usually strings or numbers.

Syntax: instead of the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; operator, associative arrays use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; symbol, and rather than square brackets &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, as in  &lt;code&gt;$myarray[0]&lt;/code&gt;, hash elements are referenced using curly brackets &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;, as in &lt;code&gt;$myhash{&quot;george&quot;}&lt;/code&gt;.

Hashes are one of the most powerful and commonly used features in Perl.   A typical use would be to build a hash that contains a &quot;dictionary&quot;, with each key being a word in the dictionary, and the corresponding values being the definitions of those words.

A hash containing the sounds various household pets make is below
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my %petsounds = (&quot;cat&quot; =&gt; &quot;meow&quot;,
                 &quot;dog&quot; =&gt; &quot;woof&quot;,
                 &quot;snake&quot; =&gt; &quot;hiss&quot;);   
&lt;/source&gt;

'=&gt;' and ',' are actually interchangeable, so the right side could look exactly like an array. This means that you can assign an array to a hash. In such an assignment, each element with an even index (starting from 0) in the array becomes a key in the hash. The following statements create the same hash as the previous one does
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my @array = (&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;meow&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;woof&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;, &quot;hiss&quot;);
my %petsounds = @array;   
&lt;/source&gt;
But the first style is more preferred because it makes the statement more readable.

To access a hash element, use the curly brackets:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 print STDOUT &quot;The cat goes &quot; . $petsounds{&quot;cat&quot;} . &quot;.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
will print the following to STDOUT

 The cat goes meow.
 
To add a new sound item to a hash
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$petsounds{&quot;mouse&quot;} = &quot;squeak!&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
To overwrite an existing element, just reassign it
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$petsounds{&quot;dog&quot;} = &quot;arf!&quot;;  # The dog now goes &quot;arf!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
To remove an item from a hash, use &lt;tt&gt;delete&lt;/tt&gt;. Setting the value to &lt;tt&gt;undef&lt;/tt&gt; does not delete the item; using &lt;tt&gt;exists&lt;/tt&gt; on a key that has been set to &lt;tt&gt;undef&lt;/tt&gt; will still return true.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
delete($petsounds{&quot;cat&quot;});  # will remove &quot;cat&quot; from our hash
&lt;/source&gt;
== &quot;Associative Arrays&quot; ==

Originally, a &quot;hash&quot; was called an &quot;associative array&quot;, but this term is a bit outdated (people just got sick and tired of using seven syllables).  Although it isn't intuitive for newcomers to programming, &quot;hash&quot; is now the preferred term. The name is derived from the computer science term, [[w:Hashtable|hashtable]].

== Working with hashes ==

=== Printing hash contents ===
If you know PHP, you may have thought by now of some convenient way to print the contents of your array the way &lt;code&gt;print_r&lt;/code&gt; does...
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Data::Dumper;

print Dumper(\%hash);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Counting the number of entries in a hash ===
To get the size of the hash, simply find the size of the result of the &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; function, by evaluating it in scalar context:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my %hash = (
   'key1' =&gt; 1,
   'key2' =&gt; 2
);

print &quot;Hash has &quot; . keys(%hash) . &quot; elements\n&quot;;
my $num_elements = scalar(keys(%hash));
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hash of Hashes of Hashes ==
You can define multidimensional hash array variables. An example may look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
use Data::Dumper;
 
my %a=();
 
$a{1}{&quot;a&quot;}{&quot;A&quot;}=&quot;FIRST&quot;;
$a{1}{&quot;c&quot;}{&quot;B&quot;}=&quot;THIRD&quot;;
$a{1}{&quot;b&quot;}{&quot;C&quot;}=&quot;SECOND&quot;;
  
foreach my $k1 ( sort keys %a ) {
  foreach my $k2 ( sort keys %{$a{$k1}} ) {
    foreach my $k3 ( sort keys %{$a{$k1}{$k2}} ) {
      print &quot;$k1\t$k2\t$k3\t$a{$k1}{$k2}{$k3}\n&quot;;
    }
  }
}
  
print Dumper(\%a);
&lt;/source&gt;

This code will produce:

  1       a       A       FIRST
  1       b       C       SECOND
  1       c       B       THIRD
  $VAR1 = {
            '1' =&gt; {
                     'c' =&gt; {
                              'B' =&gt; 'THIRD'
                            },
                     'a' =&gt; {
                              'A' =&gt; 'FIRST'
                            },
                     'b' =&gt; {
                              'C' =&gt; 'SECOND'
                            }
                   }
          };

===Purpose===
This book is intended for Java Developers, but other developers may also find some sections useful. 

The goal of this book to make the reader a better (Java) Programmer.

Intended Audience - (Java) developers, anyone interested in improving the way he/she programs.

Prerequisites - None

===Acknowledgements===

===Getting Started===
As described in [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] website, Eclipse is an IDE for everything and nothing in particular.  Eclipse core is a universal IDE (a general purpose development environment).

=====Downloading Eclipse=====
Eclipse doesn't come with the JRE. It is advisable that you download the latest JRE (Java Runtime Environment) from the [http://www.javasoft.com Javasoft] web site first.

After you have downloaded and installed the JRE, you may then download the [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse IDE]. Another version of Eclipse is the EasyEclipse project. Its interface is about the same as Eclipse. You can download it instead from [easyeclipse.org]

=====Installing Eclipse=====
Installing Eclipse just involves unzipping the downloaded file into a directory. After unzipping the Eclipse IDE is ready to run.

=====Running Eclipse=====
===Windows===
Eclipse can be run by executing the file '''startup.jar'''. If Java Environment (JAVA_HOME) variables are defined then Eclipse IDE will automatically detect the JRE and start running.

==Linux==
After downloading, open the file '''eclipse'''.

=====Getting Help=====
Types of help available with eclipse:
# Online documentation
# Context sensitive help
# Hover help
# Active Help

Eclipse Help can be accessed using external browser
&lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path_for_help_content&gt;
&lt;port&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The values for these fields can be found in preferences.ini file. 
Eclipse uses a tomcat server for displaying help documentation.

=====Configuring Eclipse=====
* Tuning your JRE
(Use different workspaces for different JREs otherwise due to autobuild wrong .class files will get generated)

====Using Eclipse====
=====Workspace=====
Resource (projects, folders, files)

.metadata folder contains information about the workspace.

Keep different workspaces for different development projects (or different customers)

Bookmarks - A bookmark acts as a link to a particular line in a file. 

Tasks - A task is created against each java error. Tasks can also be created as an reminder for some activities to be performed. Task contains priority and completion status. Tasks can also work as bookmarks.

* Running Multiple Instances of Eclipse at the same time
(See command line options)

=====Perspectives=====
You can create your own (customized) perspective using configurations.

====Running Other Applications within Eclipse====
* File Association (External Programs) 
* Run (External Tools)

need a &quot;how to&quot;/tutorial for External Tools running a main class in one project while referencing a jar file elsewhere.
ex. project DoesReallyNeatStuff creates output based on project SomeStuff. How does a project reference the other project using External Tools?

====Java Development using Eclipse====
* Writing Code - generate, edit and navigate Java code.
syntax highlighting, code completion, code assist, tasks and views.  
* Debugging
* Team Work
* Improving Productivity - hooking into well defined plugin points
* Using Eclipse Code
=====Debugging Java Programs=====
=====Working in a Team=====

* Eclipse - tool integration platform - open source
* Eclipse community - 1000s of developers - around 50 software companies
* Eclipse vision - new paradigm for development tools - platform centric - not tool centric - towards Universal IDE
* Eclipse Project - tools built independently - work together as integrated sets
* Eclipse Plug-ins - seamless integration - your imagination is the limited - 100 active Open Source Projects and vendors.

===Highlights===

* Eclipse 3-in-1 - a Java development environment, a tool integration platform, and an open source community.

* Editor -anticipates your next move - code assist , think faster that you write use spell checker, refactoring - iterative process of improving your code Object Oriented approach, scrapbook - experiment with expressions, search tools,
debugger - breakpoints, display value of variable, hot code replace support - change your code while in debug mode,
preference settings - tailor according to your needs yourself, 

* General purpose - For both programming and non-programming development tasks
Java doc comments templates

integrated support for Ant, JUnit 

====Basic Concepts====
* Developer's Toolset - (design) modelling tool, IDE, version control, word processor,
* Artifacts - architecture diagrams, code and user documentation

* '''Workspace''' is a directory where your projects are stored.
* '''Workbench''' consists of views, perspectives and editors.
* '''Views''' provide alternate way of navigation.
* '''Editors''' are associated with the file types. External editors can also be used with editors. OLE based editors integrates well with Eclipse.
* '''Perspectives''' are collection of views.

====Eclipse Architecture====
* Eclipse Platform
* SWT
* JFace
* GEF/GMF
* Workspace
* Workbench
* Help
* Team
* Debug
* Plug-In
* Extension Points 
* Plug-In Development Environment (PDE)

====Eclipse Plug-In Development====
====WorkBench Terminology====
* Menu bar
* Tool bar
* Perspective
* Fast View bar
* Resource Navigator
* Properties View
* Message Area
* Text editor
* Outline view
* Bookmarks view
* Editor status area
* Tasks view - 
predefined tags TODO, FIXME, XXX
* Stacked view
* Help View

====Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)====
The SWT is a collection of APIs that allow writing GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces).  The APIs are focused on providing tools to allow &quot;widgets&quot; (graphical controls such as checkboxes, edit controls, etc.) to be displayed and manipulated.

====Related Projects====
EMF - Eclipse Modelling Framework
EMF is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building tools and other applications based on a structured data model.  EMF allows a model described using Annotated Java, XML or modeling tools to be generated as executable Java code.  The generated code allows the model structure to be inspected, and the model data to be queried, updated and persisted to external storage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

According to this page: http://www.thejapanesepage.com/hka.htm the stroke order for the 'ka' is different...

I learned in elementary school: curve-line → slash → spot, and I think you can write better in this way.
But the stroke order is not so important...(if you can write well, that's ok) --[[User:Brevam|Brev]][[user talk:Brevam|am]] 03:41, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I learned sweeping curve, vertical line, dot.  Also, GO is next to KO, as well as in the alternate section near GE, etc. I think the one near KO is unneeded and identical.

== Mneumonic for Ko ==

It seems a little more complicated than it needs to be. Why not leave out the &quot;far away, closer to you&quot; stuff? That's not relevant for remembering the two lines being start and finish lines and &quot;Go!&quot; I'm going to edit it to make it simpler, but if there's some reason for the additional complexity feel free to revert. --Anonymous 2008/01/08

:Nevermind. I see that it was all because of the &quot;tail&quot; on the top line; but it's a very confusing mneumonic. It should probably be rewritten. In any case, I'm just going to ignore all that stuff and just remember &quot;Go!&quot;</text>

==Introduction==

An important part of being able to understand and speak Korean is that one must have a firm understanding of the grammar used to make coherent sentences.  During these first few lessons we shall focus on building a useable grammar base.  In this lesson, we will learn some more useful particles, Present progressive, future tense, and the requesting form.  We will also learn some new grammar, but it will not be the main focus of this lesson.

==Conversation==

Here we find Joseph meeting 찬호 again.

===Dialogue===
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''앗! 오래간만 입니다, 조세프!'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''네, 안녕하십니까, 찬호?'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''네. 저는 지금 학교로 가고 있습니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''선생님을 만나겠습니까?'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''아니요, 공부하겠습니다. 조세프는 오늘 숙제를 하겠습니까?'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''네, 저는 집에서 하겠습니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''그래요.  안녕히 가십시오.'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''안녕히 계십시오.'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Conversation review==

찬호 begins with another greeting:

: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''[[wikt:앗|앗]]! [[wikt:오래간만|오래간만]] [[wikt:이다|입니다]], 조세프!'''&lt;/big&gt;

&quot;오래간만 입니다&quot; can be translated as: &quot;Long time, no see&quot; in English.  At first, it's a hard expression to pronounce, but a little bit of practice should untie your tongue.

: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''네, 안녕하십니까, 찬호?'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''네. 저는 [[wikt:지금|지금]] 학교로 가고 있습니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;

{| border=solid
|-align=center style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;
| 네. || 저는 || 지금 || 학교 || [[wikt:로|로]] || [[wikt:가다|가]] || 고 있습니다
|-align=center
| Yes. || I (topic) || now || school || (to/towards) || go (verb stem) || (present progressive) 
|}

New vocabulary, new particle, new verb tense. [[wikt:지금|지금]] means “now”.  In a later lesson, we will learn many words such as &quot;later, tomorrow, yesterday, just a second ago, etc&quot;.  In the next part, 찬호 uses a new particle with a similar meaning to what we learned before: &quot;N + (으)로&quot;.  This particle means &quot;to&quot;, &quot;toward&quot;, or &quot;in the direction of&quot;.  It can be interchanged with &quot;에&quot; relatively safely, but &quot;로&quot; with its additional usages, is a little more versatile. If the noun ends in a consonant then it becomes &quot;으로&quot; (집'''으'''로).  Simple.

Finally, we have a new verb tense: the present progressive tense.  It can also be made into a statement or question by adding the &quot;VS + 고 있습니다&quot; or &quot;VS + 고 있습니까&quot; forms.  The strange thing about this verb tense is that the standard &quot;VS + ㅂ/습니다&quot; can mean the same thing! Remember in lesson 1, Joseph said &quot;집에 갑니다&quot;.  This could have also been said &quot;집에 가고있습니다&quot; or even &quot;집으로 가고 있습니다.&quot;  It is your choice.  Some combinations sound more natural to others, but a beginning student doesn't have to be concerned with that.  You will eventually get the feel of what sounds right.

: 조새프: &lt;big&gt;'''[[wikt:선생|선생]]님을 만나겠습니까?'''&lt;/big&gt;

This might sound funny, but one of the most important things to learn in Korean is '''not''' found in this sentence.  Where is the subject?  Is it [[wikt:선생|선생님]] (“teacher”)? No, there is no subject.  In Korean, if the subject of the next sentence is understood, it can be omitted.  This is often found in colloquial English: 

:English speaker A: &quot;I'm a little busy.&quot;
:English speaker B: &quot;Oh, studying today?&quot;

However, in Korean, you can omit the subject more freely than English, and sometimes other elements can also be omitted, resulting in very short sentences.  Well, if 선생님 (&quot;teacher&quot;) isn't the subject, what is it?  It's the direct object!

{| border=solid
|-align=center style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;
| 선생[[wikt:님|님]] || [[wikt:을|을]]
|-align=center
| teacher || (direct object)
|}

The particle 을 is used to designate the direct object of the sentence, i.e. the thing or person upon which the action is happening.  In most textbooks, this is usually denoted as &quot;을/를&quot; because &quot;을&quot; comes after words ending in a consonant, and &quot;를&quot; comes after words in a vowel.  This particle is omitable, but for the beginner, it's best left in so nothing gets confused.

Now, based on what we have learned so far, one might guess that the verb stem of the verb in this sentence is &quot;만나겠다&quot;, which is a perfectly logical guess, but wrong.  The actual verb stem is &quot;만나다&quot; which means &quot;to meet&quot; (as you might have gleaned from the previous paragraph).  The &quot;겠습니다&quot; or, more correctly &quot;겠다&quot; is the future tense form.  For this form, it is unimportant whether the verb stem ends in a consonant or vowel.  Simply add &quot;겠&quot; and then finish off with &quot;습니다&quot; to speak politely.  Easy as 파이, no?

: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''아니요, 공부하겠습니다. 조새프는 오늘 숙제를 하겠습니까?'''&lt;/big&gt;

{| border=solid
|-align=center style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;
| 아니요, || || 공부하겠습니다. || 조새프는 || 오늘 || 숙제를 || 하겠습니까?
|-align=center
| No, ||  (I) || will study. || Joseph (topic) || today || homework (direct object) || will do?
|}

This sentence may sound a little strange, but it is nonetheless correct.  [[wikt:공부하다|공부하다]] means &quot;to study&quot;, [[wikt:오늘|오늘]] means &quot;today&quot; and [[wikt:숙제|숙제]] means &quot;homework.&quot;  [[wikt:하다|하다]] will be explained in more detail later, but for now, it means &quot;to do&quot; when by itself.  Notice the [[wikt:를|를]] on [[wikt:숙제|숙제]]? What is he doing? his homework!

: 조새프: &lt;big&gt;'''네, 저는 집에서 하겠습니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;

{| border=solid
|-align=center style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;
| 네, || 저는 || 집 || 에서 || 하겠습니다.
|-align=center
| Yes, || I (topic) || home || (at) || will do.
|}

Finally, we have another particle, [[wikt:에서|에서]], which is translated &quot;from&quot; or &quot;at&quot;.  In this case, it functions as &quot;at&quot;.  Notice &quot;Yes, I will do it at home.&quot;

: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''그래요.  안녕히 가십시요.'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조새프: &lt;big&gt;'''안녕히 가십시요.'''&lt;/big&gt;

[[wikt:그러다|그래요]] is a polite way of saying &quot;okay.&quot; It also means &quot;Yes that's right.&quot;

==Korean sentence order==

Korean sentences have a different word order from English.  Whereas an English sentence typically has a Subject-Verb-Object word order, a Korean sentence typically has a [[w:Subject Object Verb|Subject-Object-Verb]] word order.  For sentences with only a subject and a verb, Korean and English word order is essentially identical:

{|
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 먹는다.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|-
| rowspan=2 | English:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | eats.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|}

If a sentence includes an object, the English and Korean order differs:

English:  I am reading a book.
English:  I(subject) am reading(verb) a book(object)

Korean:  저는 책을 읽고 있습니다.
Korean:  저는(subject) 책을(object) 읽고 있습니다(verb).

{|
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | 사과를
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 먹는다.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|-
| rowspan=2 | English:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | eats
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | the apple.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | object
|}

===Predicates===
A more complete understanding of Korean sentence order requires an understanding of Korean predicates ([[wikt:서술|서술]]부어).  As in English, complete Korean sentences must have a predicate that contains a conjugated Korean word ([[wikt:용언|용언]]).  Also as in English, Korean verbs ([[wikt:동사|동사]]) are conjugated and so can be sentence predicates.  However, with regard to forming sentences, Korean differs from English in two important ways: 
# Korean sentences do not require subjects ([[wikt:주어|주어]]), just predicates.  (That is, a Korean sentence with only a predicate is grammatically complete.)
# Korean adjectives ([[wikt:형용사|형용사]]) can be conjugated and used as sentence predicates.

Korean sentences that include subjects, indirect objects, direct objects, and complements often arrange them in this order:

{|
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Subject ([[wikt:주어|주어]])
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | indirect object ([[wikt:간접|간접]] [[wikt:목적어|목적어]])
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | direct object ([[wikt:직접|직접]] [[wikt:목적어|목적어]])
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFC0FF&quot; | complement ([[wikt:보어|보어]])
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | predicate ([[wikt:서술|서술]]부어)
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | 나에게
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | 사과를
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFC0FF&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 준다.
|-
| rowspan=2 | English:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | gives
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | me
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | the apple.
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFC0FF&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | predicate
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | indirect object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | direct object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFC0FF&quot; | complement
|}

Above is the usual word order in Korean, which is the order most easily understood by native speakers of Korean.  However, excluding the predicate (the verb), the placement of other words is not entirely relevant to the meaning of the sentence.  The following arrangements have the same meaning as the above example:
{|
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | 나에게
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | 사과를
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 준다.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | indirect object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | direct object
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|-
|
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | to me
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | the apple
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | gives
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | 사과를
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | 나에게
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 준다.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | direct object
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | indirect object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|-
|
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | the apple
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | to me
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | gives
|}

==  Automata Theory  ==

As per our discussion at [[Regular Expressions]], I have decided to create a new wikibook on the topic of automata theory. We can use this new book to serve as a foundational background behind regular expressions, so that we can talk about the advanced topics on that subject, without having to lay all the theoretical groundwork. Currently, this new book exists only as a preliminary outline [[User:Whiteknight/Automata Theory|HERE on my users page]]. Any comments or suggestions on this new outline would certainly be appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:22, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some thoughts on the questions posed... (perhaps this will become an 'answers' page in due course?)

'''Q1.'''  Think back to the ideas presented on '[[GCSE Science/Induction]]':  Increasing the speed of rotation is like moving the magnet in and out of the coil faster, so the waveform on the oscilloscope will be bigger in relation to the y-axis (larger voltage induced). However, since the rate of rotation is increased, the  frequency will also be greater, so the peaks will be closer together, hence correct answer is 'C'.

'''Q2.'''  Some typical sources of a.c. are the alternator on a car and the generator at a power station. Sources of d.c. include dry cells (commonly known as 'batteries' in the UK), photovoltaic cells (solar panels), lead-acid accumulators and smoothed d.c. power supplies found in science labs.

'''Q3.'''  A typical device which only works with d.c. is (as mentioned in the article - if you were paying attention!) the electric motor (the split-ring commutator type depicted in the article about [[GCSE Science/The motor effect|the motor effect]]). A device which doesn't mind whether you use a.c. or d.c. is the light bulb.

'''Q4.'''  Was this question put in as a red-herring, or a means of challenging brighter pupils?! Well, what did ''you'' make of it? Tricky, given the setting? Well, since hair-dryers need to blow out a lot of hot air, their power requirement is fairly large. This means that batteries won't last long enough to be a viable option! With this in mind, the only sensible thing to do is use mains, i.e. alternating current. The heater element doesn't care which way the current is flowing - it just gets hot. This does pose a problem for the motor, though. It can't be the split-ring commutator variety, since it would just vibrate on the spot, get hot, and then die!

(Most diodes are now made from semiconductor materials, but the original diode was called a 'thermionic valve'. From your knowledge of Biology (particularly of the heart) why do you think the term 'valve' is appropriate?)

      <comment>/* Duplication problem with How to learn a language article */ {{bad link}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Duplication problem with ''How to learn a language'' article==

There is a problem involving a duplication of the ''How to learn a language'' article that was originally on the en.wikipedia.

The article exists in two separate forms and appears to have been brought in twice:

* {{bad link|Transwiki:How_to_learn_a_language}}
* [[How to learn a language]]

Each has its own unique editing history. The one in the Transwiki domain is much more active. I would suggest the other version &lt;s&gt;has&lt;/s&gt; have its edits merged into the Transwiki version and then be deleted.

[[User:Oska|Oska]] 00:38, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:done. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:39, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:: Please correct me if I'm wrong but it appears that you have simply deleted the article under the Transwiki namespace and put in a redirect to the other version. If so that is not a good solution as the Transwiki version had been much more active and from memory (as the history page for that version has now disappeared) had about 30 edits made to it since being moved to wikibooks. The other version has only 3 edits made to it. My suggestion was for the articles to be merged, not for the (probably better) Transwiki version to be lost.

:: I would have done the merge myself but I was unsure if I had completely understood what had happened. I have been trying to find out what the protocol is for bringing stuff into wikibooks and what went wrong in this case. I can't do the merge now because it appears one of the versions has been lost.

:: The transwiki namespace seems to be problematic in allowing an article to be unintentionally forked like this. Why not just move the article into its normal title right from the start?

::[[User:Oska|Oska]] 08:41, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I guess I will have to type in text to make this test work.  Apologies.  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 06:01, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

== A bit confused ==

I have copied and pasted [[w:User:Endgame1/AutoCAD Layers]] to [[Transwiki:AutoCAD Layers]].  But even though [[w:Help:Import]] tells me that this is not enabled on Wikimedia wikis, it seems that there is a way to import with the history intact.  Also there seems to be just one person doing all the transwikis.  Can someone point me in the right direction of what I'm meant to be doing.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 01:10, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:Well, [[Special:Import]] doesn't work on Wikimedia wikis by default. However, things at the English Wikibooks are almost never the default. The developers enabled the import function here a few weeks ago. As stated in the Help page you found, only an admin can perform an import. I'll go see if I can remember how to import a file for you. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:32, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

::Yup, that was as easy as I remember, and I still managed to screw it up. The imported page with its history (and talk page) are at [[Transwiki:Endgame1/AutoCAD Layers]] and [[Transwiki talk:Endgame1/AutoCAD Layers]]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:38, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:::You didn't screw it up, it was just confusing because someone on wp had userified the article. I hadn't imported it yet because (a) the userifying made it a pain in the butt, and (b) totally forgot about it. It just needs to be moved to the nonuserified name... will do now. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:09, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

::Sorry, I didn't make that clear. I had to import it twice, as the first time, I imported the talk page over the content page. I fixed it with a speedy delete and re-import of the pages, which is still pretty easy. Even with having to do it twice, it's faster than the old copy-paste transwiki process. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:23, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Puh, yeah, no kiddin! But next time don't speedy, just move it to Transwiki_talk and then re-import :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:33, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Verb Conjugation==
{| align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
*Infinitive: -i
*Present: -as
*Past: -is
*Future: -os
*Command: -u
*Conditional: -us
|}
In lesson 1, we learned that the base form of a verb is the ''infinitive'', which ends in '''-i''' is translated &quot;to ''verb''&quot;, and the present tense of any Esperanto verb ends in '''-as''' and is translated &quot;I verb&quot;, &quot;I am verb'ing&quot;, or &quot;I do verb&quot;. Note that &quot;I&quot; is only an example and can be replaced with anything.

Now we will learn the future and past tenses, the command form of a verb, and even how to form verbs that lack tense all together.

;Future Tense:The future tense is formed by replacing the '''-i''' ending of the infinitive with '''-os'''. These can be translated &quot;I will verb&quot; or &quot;I will be verb'ing&quot;.
;Past tense:The past tense is formed by replacing the '''-i''' ending of the infinitive with '''-is'''. These can be translated &quot;I did verb&quot; or &quot;I verb'ed&quot;.
;Imperative:The imperative is the form one would use when they are telling somebody what to do, and is therefore sometimes called the command form. For example, in the sentence &quot;Bob, please '''run''' to the store&quot;, &quot;run&quot; is an imperative. In Esperanto, these are formed by replacing the '''-i''' of the infinitive with '''-u'''.
;Conditional:This form is used when a verb lacks a tense and refers to something that could potentially happen or have happened, and it is not really a tense, per se. For example, &quot;Bob '''would run''' if Jim '''were to tell him'''.&quot; Bob may not have run yet, and Jim has not necessarily asked him to. All we know is that bob ''would'' run if Jim ''would'' tell him to. Esperanto has no word for &quot;would&quot;, but the meaning of it is reached by replacing the '''-i''' of the infinitive with '''-us'''.

These are all the forms of the '''active voice''', that is, when the subject is the one &quot;doing the verb&quot;. The '''passive voice''', when the subject is &quot;being verb'ed&quot; by something else, will be covered later.

Be sure to memorize the &quot;theme vowels&quot; for each tense: '''a''' for the present, '''o''' for the future, and '''i''' for the past.

==Participles==
Participles are adjectives formed from verbs, and are used to describe somebody who did, is doing, or will do a verb. The English language has two types of participles: the present active participle and the past passive participle.
*The present active participle is an adjective describing somebody who is doing something in the present. For example, &quot;The '''running boy''' will soon arrive home.&quot; &quot;Running&quot; is a participle.
*The past passive participle describes somebody who, at some time in the past, had the verb done to them by something else. For example, &quot;The '''torn and crumpled paper''' was thrown in the trash.&quot; The paper is torn because, in the past, somebody tore it, and it's crumpled for the same reason. In English, the passive participle usually looks the same as the past form of the verb, as is the case with &quot;crumpled&quot; (&quot;he crumpl'''ed''' it&quot;, &quot;it is crumpl'''ed'''&quot;), but not for &quot;torn&quot; (&quot;he tor'''e''' it&quot;, &quot;it is tor'''n'''&quot;).

Esperanto, however, has '''''six''''' participles. Since English only has two participles, these don't always have perfect translations. Take a look at the table of forms below. If not already obvious, they are formed by replacing the final '''-i''' of the infinitive with these forms. Those in yellow exist in English, the rest have imperfect translations.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! !! Present !! Past !! Future
|-
|Active ||style=&quot;background-color:#FFFF99&quot;| -anta&lt;br/&gt;(verb'ing) || -inta&lt;br/&gt;(was-verb'ing) || -onta&lt;br/&gt;(will-be-verb'ing)
|-
|Passive || -ata&lt;br/&gt;(being-verb'ed) ||style=&quot;background-color:#FFFF99&quot;| -ita&lt;br/&gt;(verb'ed) || -ota&lt;br/&gt;(will-be-being-verb'ed)
|}

Because four of the participles have imperfect translations, they will have to be rephrased when translated into English.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Esperanto !! Rough English !! Rephrased English
|-
| Knabo kurinta falos. || The ''was-running'' boy will fall. || The boy ''who was running'' will fall.
|-
| Arbo haketota alta estas. || The ''will-be-being-chopped'' tree is tall. || The tree ''which will be chopped down'' is tall.
|}

At the same time, the English sentence &quot;The tree which will be chopped down is tall.&quot; can be translated &quot;Arbo haketota alta estas.&quot; instead of the more literal &quot;Arbo, kiu estos haketata, alta estas.&quot;

==Asking and Answering Questions==
Asking questions in Esperanto is very easy to accomplish with the help of a few question words.

===Yes/No Questions===
====Asking Yes/No Questions====
In Esperanto, all questions that require &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; as an answer begin in &quot;Ĉu&quot;, no other change is made to the sentence. For example, &quot;Do you eat?&quot; would be said &quot;Ĉu vi manĝas?&quot;.

In English, &quot;It is a dog.&quot; would be asked &quot;Is it a dog?&quot;. You may notice that the only change is that &quot;it&quot; and &quot;is&quot; switch places. This is not true of Esperanto: all you have to do is put &quot;Ĉu&quot; at the beginning of the sentence. That's it. (&quot;Ĉu ĝi estas hundo?&quot; means &quot;Is it true that it is a dog?&quot; or more simply &quot;Is it a dog?&quot;.)

====Answering Yes/No Questions====
Answering Yes/No questions is very easy: &quot;jes&quot; means &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;ne&quot; means &quot;no&quot;.

===Other Types of Questions===
Here is a list of several basic question words:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Vocabulary / Vortlisto
|-
! Esperanto !! English
|-
| Kiu? || Which?/Who? (Which person?)
|-
| Kio? || What?
|-
| Kiam? || When?
|-
| Kie? || Where?
|-
| Kial? || Why? (For what reason?)
|-
| Kiel? || How?
|-
| Kiom? || How many?
|}

These words may be useful in answering questions that use the above words:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Vocabulary / Vortlisto
|-
! Esperanto !! English
|-
| Tiu || That/That person
|-
| Tio || That (thing)
|-
| Tiam || Then
|-
| Tie || There
|-
| Tial || For that reason
|-
| Tiel || Thus/In that way
|-
| Tiom || That many
|}

Notice how all these words are linked to the question word that has same ending. This system of words, called the correlatives, will be dealt with in a later chapter.

The 'o' in dot and the 'o' in or seem to be different o's
*The 'o' in dot is the correct sound. --[[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 00:30, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Why does the U first have an accent in the beginning of the article and further down an umlaut?15:37, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

== Audio ==

I'm making recordings of all the sample Esperanto words. I'm almost done, but I want to clear something up before I finish: I'm not sure ''ĝojo'' is such a great example for the ''oj'' diphthongs. When the noun ending is added, a syllable break will usually be inserted, and the word typically sounds like ''ĝo-jo'', unless I force it. Hovever, any plural noun should do the job, so I'll change it to ''lingvoj'' (languages) unless there are any objections. I hope this will be clearer, and I'll be back soon with my finished recordings. --[[User:WurdBendur|WurdBendur]] 05:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Ought to change ==

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Esperanto/Appendix_A&amp;oldid=773351 Ref]
(Post-edit notice) The 'o' sound in the main table states ''o as in French m'''o'''t or o as in Spanish n'''o''''', but I don't speak French or Spanish. From what I gather, this would be the sound of o as in &quot;cord&quot; or &quot;sorry&quot;, and I think this being an English Wikibook it would be best to include English examples for all instructive content. ~Jafet 11:22, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

Near the end in the diphthongs section you mention the pronunciation of 'boy' for one digraph and then 'buoy' for another. To people who are from the UK (like me) this is confusing because we pronounce both words exactly the same (with that 'oy' sound) but I know that Americans pronounce each differently. It might help to mention that on the page to stop us Brits getting confused!</text>

      <comment>/* Ohm's Law */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter is an overview of [[Electronics/Resistors|resistors]] and their practical concerns.  Resistors are fundamental building blocks of amateur radio, being used for current limiters, voltage dividers, oscillators, filters and more.

==Resistors==
*Resistors, generally speaking, resist the flow of electricity.  They prevent some electrons from travelling through them.  This means that current flow is reduced.  Almost all materials have resistance (some, such as [[Wikipedia:Superconductors|superconductors]], have zero resistance.)  
*At an atomic level, resistors oppose the flow of electrons.  Some compounds have only a moderate hold on their electrons.  Thus, electricity can flow, but with less energy.  These compounds are said to have a high [[Wikipedia:Electrical Resistance|resistance]].  Copper has a very loose hold on some of its electrons, which can consequently have its electrons dislodge with very little energy.  Thus, copper has a low resistance.
*The unit of resistance is the Ohm, named after [[Wikipedia:Georg Ohm|Georg Ohm]].  An Ohm is the unit of resistance that will allow one Ampere to flow if an [[Wikipedia:EMF|electromotive force]] of one Volt is applied.  The symbol for an Ohm is a capital omega (Ω).

==Practical Resistors==
Two important things to know about resistors when using them are their schematic symbols and the resistor color code.  

[[Image:fixedres.png|frame|left|A Fixed Resistor]]

[[Image:3termvarres.png|frame|left|A Three Terminal Potentiometer]]

*Fixed resistors, as the name implies have a fixed resistance.
*Potentiometers have a variable resistance
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

===The Resistor Value Color Code===
[[Image:Resistor-Codes.svg|350px]]

A resistor generally has four color bands.  The first two bands give the first two digits e.g. brown, black represents &quot;10&quot;.  The third band indicates the multiplier.  This is merely the number of zeros you add to the end of the first two digits.  For example, black, brown, red represents &quot;10&quot; &quot;00&quot;, or &quot;1000 Ω&quot; or &quot;1 kΩ&quot;.

==Construction Techniques==

There are three main construction techniques used in making resistors: wirewound, carbon composition, and metal film.

*Wirewound
**As explained in this book about [[Electronics/Resistors|resistors]], the narrower a conductor, the higher its resistance.  Also, the longer it is, the higher its resistance.  Combining these two characteristics, a wirewound resistor consists of a long, thin wire wrapped in a coil.  This creates a high resistance.
**'''Pros'''
***Can be made to very close tolerances (tolerance is how close the actual value is to the listed value)
***High power handling capability
**'''Cons'''
***Bulky
***Expensive
***Highly [[Electronics/Inductors|inductive]]

*Carbon Composition
**This resistor consists of a carbon powder in a container with wires attached to it.  Its resistance can be changed when manufactured by using different concentrations of carbon in the powder.
**'''Pros'''
***Very cheap
***Non-inductive
**'''Cons'''
***Poor tolerance
***Poor stability (i.e. the value of the resistor can change considerably with time)

*Metal Film
**This resistor consists of a container with a thin metal film on it.  Its resistance at manufacture can be changed by etching the metal away in certain patterns.
**'''Pros'''
***Inexpensive
***Non-inductive
**'''Cons'''
***If stressed beyond their limits, metal film resistors tend to stop conducting entirely rather than have their resistance changed.  This is often a benefit, as in some cases no operation is preferable to unpredictable operation.


==Ohm's Law==

Ohm's Law a fundamental principle in electronics.  The law states the relationship between electromotive force, current and resistance. Knowing any two of these allows the third one to be discovered. It is expressed as &quot;E = IR&quot;, where E is the electromotive force in Volts, I is the current in Amperes, and R is the resistance in Ohms.    

Consider the following two examples.

===Examples===
&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|style=&quot;background:#AAAAAA&quot;|You are wiring a motor to a 12 V battery.  The only wire you have is rated for 10 A.  If the motor has a resistance of 1Ω:&lt;br&gt;1. What will the current be?&lt;br&gt;2. Will you be able to use the wire you have?
|}

''Answer:''  
#The voltage and resistance are known.  The current must be found.  From Ohm's Law, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I} = \frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{R}} = \frac{12 \mathrm{V}}{1 \Omega} = 12 \mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt;
#No.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|style=&quot;background:#AAAAAA&quot;|A circuit requires a current of 2.5 mA.  If the circuit is powered by a 5 V battery, what must the resistance be?
|}

''Answer:''

From Ohm's Law, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R} = \frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{I}} = \frac{5 \mathrm{V}}{2.5 \mathrm{mA}} = 2 \mathrm{k\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice in this case that milliamps were used instead of Amps.  We are allowed to do this because we used kilohms as the unit of resistance ( 1 mA = 0.001 A).

==Series and Parallel Combinations of Resistors==

[[Image:Seriesmeasure.png|center|Resistors in Series]]

This image shows a schematic of two resistors in series.  This is a series arrangement because the resistors are aligned head to tail; the current going through one resistor goes through both.  The two most important aspects of this circuit are


#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot} = I_1 = I_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot} = E_1 + E_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total current and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total voltage''

The current and voltage equations are determined from [[Wikipedia:Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]].  

[[Image:Parmeasure.png|center|Resistors in Parallel]]

This image shows a schematic of two resistors in parallel.  This is a parallel arrangement because the tails of the resistors are connected to each other and the heads are connected to each other.  The two most important aspects of this circuit are:

#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot} = E_1 = E_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot} = I_1 + I_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total current and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total voltage''

Once again, the current and voltage equations are determined from Kirchhoff's laws.

===Effective Resistance of Series and Parallel Combinations===

The effective resistance of combinations of resistors can be determined by Ohm's Law.  In the serial case, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}} = \sum_n{E_n}&lt;/math&gt; , while &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}}=\mathrm{I}_n&lt;/math&gt; for all n.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}_n=I\times \mathrm{R}_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}} = \sum_n{I\times R_n} = I\sum_n{R_n}&lt;/math&gt;.  Dividing voltage by current gives resistance, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{tot} = \sum_n{R_n}&lt;/math&gt; .

In the parallel case, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}} = \sum_n{I_n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}}=\mathrm{E}_n&lt;/math&gt; for all n.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{tot}= {\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}} \over \mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}}} = {\mathrm{E} \over {\sum_n{\mathrm{E} \over{\mathrm{R}_n}}}} = {1 \over {\sum_n{1 \over \mathrm{R_\mathrm{n}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Voltage Drops===

A voltage drop is the voltage across a component.  In the example of the two resistors in series above, the voltage drop across &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R_1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_1}.&lt;/math&gt;  By changing the value of a resistor, the voltage drop across it can be changed, allowing a variable voltage to be created from a fixed voltage.

==Power==

Resistors restrict the flow of electricity.  However, the energy expended doing so must go somewhere.  In the case of resistors, the energy is radiated as heat.  This is what heats up the filament in a light bulb or the heating elements in a toaster.  There is a limit to how much power a resistor can dissipate safely.  As a rule, the bigger (in size) the resistor, the more power it can dissipate.

Power is measured in Watts (abbreviated W), with one Watt equal to one Joule per second.  In electronics, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{EI}.&lt;/math&gt;  This permits calculation of the power dissipated by a resistor.

#If voltage and current are known, then the power is simply their product.
#If voltage and resistance is known, then:
#: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{EI} = \mathrm{E} \times \frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{R}} = \frac{\mathrm{E^2}}{\mathrm{R}}.&lt;/math&gt;
#If current and resistance are known, then:
#:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{EI} = \mathrm{IR} \times \mathrm{I} = \mathrm{{I^2}R}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The month of December holds one of the most celebrated holidays in the world. Although Christmas is extremely popular, do we really know the story behind this celebration? Indeed, many questions go unanswered when it comes to Christmas. Today we are going to explore those questions and answers. We are going to look into many controversial aspects of Christmas, including things such as dates, customs, and traditions, so join me in this marvelous exploration of Christmas.

      <comment>/* Was Jesus born on December 25? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Was Jesus born on December 25? ==
The Bible doesn't explicitly state the date of Jesus' birth, but it does give clues. Luke 2:8-14 speaks of shepherds living outdoor and tending to a flock of sheep. The text reads, &quot;And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.&quot; Scholars of the Bible have concluded that this would be an unlikely practice in the month of December, for the weather conditions would be too cold to live outside or tend to a flock of sheep.



_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Book of Luke tells us that John the Baptist was 6 months older than Jesus, [Luke 1:26]. The book also tells us when John was conceived so it is possible to approximate the time of John's birth...and that of Jesus. 

John's father, [[Wikipedia:Zechariah|Zechariah]], served as a priest in the division of [[Wikipedia:Abijah|Abijah]], [Luke 1:5]. His priestly duty entailed one week of temple service every year plus three more weeks during the three yearly festivals. 

His division was the eighth so his period of temple service began in the eighth week of the year, [I Chronicles 24:10]. The Hebrew year, being lunar, began in the spring around late March early April. The eighth week would then generally fall around the first of June the way we show the months of the year on our calendar.

[[Wikipedia:Luke|Luke]] 1:23-24 tells us that Elizabeth, John's mother, became pregnant right after [[Wikipedia:Zechariah|Zechariah]]'s service in the temple. This would have been mid June....approximately. This means that [[Wikipedia:John the Baptist|John the Baptist]] would have been born around mid March....or close to [[Wikipedia:Passover|Passover]]. Jesus would have been conceived in John's sixth gestational month by the [[Wikipedia:Holy Spirit|Holy Spirit]], [Luke 1:26] which would have been December....so Jesus would have been born around the middle of September. This event would have probably taken place about the time of the last [[Wikipedia:Hebrew|Hebrew]] Holiday of [[Wikipedia:Sukkot|Sukkot]],([[Wikipedia:Feast of Tabernacles|Feast of Tabernacles]]). Since everyone was expected to travel to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts this is probably the real reason why there was no room in the inn. 

During the Feast Days the normal population of Jerusalem, 120,000, would probably swell to well over 1,500,000 folks. This would not be the case in the Month of December as there were no annual Feast Days then. [[Wikipedia:Bethlehem|Bethlehem]], being a &quot;suburb&quot; of [[Wikipedia:Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] would likely fill up quickly with the overflow. This time would also be consistent with the shepherds still in the fields during September. The weather in [[Wikipedia:Israel|Israel]] during December can be quite cold so flocks are usually brought into shelter no later than the middle of October. 

The 25th of December date is not scriptural and as you can see by the above evidence is not likely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Another aspect of Christmas that receives much criticism is its traditions. Traditions such as kissing under [[Wikipedia:mistletoe|mistletoe]] are very popular, but have no biblical reference at all. Bill McLain wrote in his book, “There are many legends about mistletoe. One Scandinavian legend states that [[Wikipedia:Loki|Loki]], the god of destruction, killed [[Wikipedia:Baldur|Baldur]], the god of peace, by shooting him with an arrow made from mistletoe. Other gods and goddesses were saddened by Baldur’s death and asked that his life be restored, which it was. In appreciation, his mother [[Wikipedia:Frigga|Frigga]] hung up the mistletoe and promised to kiss all who passed under it. Because of this, mistletoe became the symbol of both forgiveness and love.” There are also a few other beliefs of mistletoe from around the world. During the [[Wikipedia:Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], people would hang mistletoe over doors and on their ceilings to scare off evil spirits and prevent witches from entering. In addition, there is an old superstition that if you place a twig of mistletoe under your pillow you will not have any nightmares.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is safe to say that the Christmas tree is one of the most recognized symbols of Christmas, yet the origins of the Christmas tree are not clear. There is a legend that Saint Boniface started the custom of the Christmas tree in Germany around the eighth century. It is said that Saint Boniface found a group of pagans worshipping an oak tree and became angry; consequently, he proceeded to cut down the Oak tree. Immediately a small fir tree is said to have sprouted from the middle of the oak stump and reached to the sky. Thus, [[Wikipedia:Saint Boniface|Saint Boniface]] told the onlookers that this would be their holy tree because it was evergreen, a symbol of everlasting life. 

Historically, an oak tree named ''Irminsul'' (meaning Great Pillar) was in fact [[Wiktionary:venerate|venerated]] by the [[Wikipedia:Saxon|Saxon]] tribes of Germany as the symbol of their chief god, [[Wikipedia:Tiu|Tiu]], also known as [[Wikipedia:Saxnot|Saxnot]].  Located in the vicinity of the modern town of [[Wikipedia:Goettingen|Goettingen]], the Irminsul was destroyed on the orders of the Frankish emperor [[Wikipedia:Charlemagne|Charlemagne]] during the late 8th century CE, as part of a military campaign to subdue the Saxons and convert them to Christianity.

Although many versions of the story exist, many authorities believe that the true origins come from ancient [[Wikipedia:Egypt|Egypt]]. Bill McLain writes, “On December 21, the shortest day of the year, ancient Egyptians decorated their homes with green palm branches to symbolize life’s triumph over death.” Before [[Wikipedia:Christianity|Christianity]], plants and trees that remained green throughout the year were believed to have special meaning for people in winter. Bill McLain continues explaining, “Romans used evergreens to decorate their homes during the winter festival of [[Wikipedia:Saturnalia|Saturnalia]], which honored [[Wikipedia:Saturn|Saturn]], the god of farming.” In addition, [[Wikipedia:Ancient Druids|Ancient Druids]], a member of an order of priests in ancient Gaul and Britain who appear in Welsh and Irish legend as prophets and sorcerers, were known to place evergreen branches over doors to frighten away evil spirits.

People decorate the trees with baubles and tinsel to make it look really pretty to impress guests.  Lights are put up outside houses as well to impress people in the cars driving past.

Hallo, 

ich habe das Modul [[Komplexe Zahlen]] in die deutschsprachigen Wikibooks übertragen. Wenn du dem Bild [[:Image:Komplex1.JPG]] und [[:Image:Komplex2 1.JPG]] noch eine Lizenzangabe hinzufügen könntest, könnte ich die Bilder auch kopieren. Würde mich freuen dich bald in der deutschsprachigen Wikibooks begrüßen zu können. Gruß -- [[User:Daniel B|Daniel]] 22:50, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Hallo,

:das Kästchen reicht leider nicht aus. Du musst nochmals explizit angeben, dass du die Bilder unter die GUN FDL stellst (ist zugegeben etwas verwirrend). Genaueres erfährst du unter [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Bilder]. Hier in den englischsprachigen Wikibooks ist dies etwas anders, da hier auch Bilder verwendet werden dürfen, die unter Fair – Use stehen. Diese sind allerdings weit eingeschränkter nutzbar als GNU FDL Bilder. Deshalb achten wir in den deutschsprachigen Wikibooks sehr darauf, dass die Bilder unter der GNU FDL oder Public Domain gestellt werden.

:Bei mir gab es keine Probleme den Kurs zu löschen. Hab das mal in den deutschsprachigen Wikibooks gemacht (ich hoffe ich hab nicht zuviel gelöscht bzw. das richtige gelöscht).

:Zu deiner Frage ob die Kurse auf deiner Seite interessant sind: Ich kann hier nur für die deutschsprachigen Wikibooks sprechen. Aber generell würde ich sagen: auf jeden Fall. Auf der Diskussionsseite solltest du dann noch einen Vermerk machen, dass du selbst der Autor bist und den Text unter die GNU FDL stellst (z.B. &quot;Ich selbst bin Autor dieses Kurses und stelle hiermit den Kurs unter die GNU FDL&quot; oder so ähnlich). Dies ist natürlich nur für die Kopie von (eigenen) Webinhalten ins Wikibooks notwendig.

:Beiträge solltest du nur auf den entsprechenden landessprachigen Wikibooks machen, da ansonsten beispielsweise jeder nach Beiträgen zu   [[komplexe Zahlen | komplexen Zahlen]] auf der deutschsprachigen Wikibooks sucht. Möglicherweise sind hier noch einige deutschsprachige Beiträge, die aber alle noch aus der Zeit vor der Auftrennung in die nationalen Wikibooks stammen, als es nur das internationale Projekt gab.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The standard Omelette shouldn't include any fillings. See [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=omelette m-w.com].

:Right now we've got (at least) three Omelette recipes. Being an omelette purist is not the first thing I would worry about. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

I think the omelette pages need to be revised. I propose one description (not recipe) of what an omelette is on the Omelette page (with a redirect from [[Cookbook:Omelet]]). Some short descriptions (with pictures, perhaps, like on the [[Cookbook:Melon]] page) of typical omelets, French, Japanese/Asian, Spanish and links to specififc recipes. What's described here seems like a french omelet, as does the [[Cookbook:Omelet]], so those two recipes should be merged into one French Omelet recipe (with soime additional info).
We should also decide on whether to use ''omelette'' or ''omelet''. ''Omelette'' is more popular according to google, but I think ''Omelet'' is better for non-french omelettes.

::Agreed re:centralizing this as a &quot;type&quot; of food. I'd almost like to suggest using the category page for this purpose. Since Omelette is more popular, it's probably the one we should use, but we should definitely have a redirect to the other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">MySQL is a free, widely used SQL engine. It can be used as a fast database as well as a rock-solid &lt;abbr title=&quot;Database Management System&quot;&gt;DBMS&lt;/abbr&gt; using a modular engine architecture.

The purpose of this wikibook is to provide a practical knowledge on using the database from two points of view:
* '''application developer''': learn about SQL basics, phpMyAdmin, query optimization
* '''system administrator''': learn about installation, security, maintenance, failover, high availability

      <text xml:space="preserve">A cache is a collection of duplicate data, where the original data is expensive to fetch or compute (usually in terms of access time) relative to the cache. In PHP caching is used to minimize page generation time. PHP basically has two main types of caching: 'output caching' and 'parser caching'. PHP 'output caching' saves a chunk of data somewhere which can later be read by another script faster than it can generate it. 'Parser caching' is specific feature. PHP is a scripting language and code is not compiled or optimized to a particular computer. Every PHP file must be parsed and that takes time. This type of time minimization is 'parser caching'.

==parser caching==
===include caching===
Example:

File:class.test.php

 &lt;?php
 class test{
  function hello(){
     echo &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;;
  }
 }
 echo &quot;Class loaded\n&quot;; ?&gt;

File:program.php

 &lt;?php
 require_once(&quot;class.test.php&quot;);
 $obj1 = new test;
 $obj1-&gt;hello();
 require_once(&quot;class.test.php&quot;);
 $obj2 = new test;
 $obj2-&gt;hello(); ?&gt;

output:

 Class loaded
 Hello world!
 Hello world!

===array caching===
Example:

File:program.php

 &lt;?php
 global $sum_cache; 
 $sum_cache=array();
 function sum($nr){
  global $sum_cache;
  if($sum_cache[$nr])
   {
   echo &quot;sum(&quot;.$nr.&quot;)=&quot;.$sum_cache[$nr].&quot; from cache\n&quot;;
   return $sum_cache[$nr];
   }
  if($nr&lt;=0)
   {
   $sum_cache[$nr]=0;
   }
  else
   {
   $sum_cache[$nr]+=sum($nr-1)+$nr;
   }
  echo &quot;sum(&quot;.$nr.&quot;)=&quot;.$sum_cache[$nr].&quot; computed\n&quot;;
  return $sum_cache[$nr];
  }
 sum(3);
 sum(4);
 ?&gt;

output:

 sum(0)=0 computed
 sum(1)=1 computed
 sum(2)=3 computed
 sum(3)=6 computed
 sum(3)=6 from cache
 sum(4)=10 computed

===session caching===

example:

file:program.php
 &lt;?php
 session_start();
 function find_my_name()
  {
  //perhaps some time-consuming database queries
  return &quot;Bill&quot;; 
  }
 if(isset($_SESSION[&quot;hello&quot;]))
  {
  echo &quot;cached\n&quot;;
  session_destroy();
  }
 else
  {
  echo &quot;computed\n&quot;;
  $_SESSION[&quot;hello&quot;]=&quot;My Name is &quot;.find_my_name().&quot;.\n&quot;;
  }
 echo $_SESSION[&quot;hello&quot;];
 ?&gt;

output:
 computed
 My Name is Bill.

output after refresh:
 cached
 My Name is Bill.

===shared variables===
Example

file:program.php
 &lt;?php
 class test{
  var $list=array();
  function load_list()
   {
   //some less timeconsuming database querys
   $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 1&quot;;
   $this-&gt;list[1][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 2&quot;;
   $this-&gt;list[2][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 3&quot;;
   }
  function load_element_detail(&amp;$data){
   //some very timeconsuming database querys
   $data[&quot;big&quot;]=&quot;added big info, maybe structure of objects&quot;;
   }
  function get_element($nr){
   return $this-&gt;list[$nr];
   }
  function print_element($nr){
   echo &quot;\$this-&gt;list[&quot;.$nr.&quot;][\&quot;info\&quot;]=\&quot;&quot;.$this-&gt;list[$nr][&quot;info&quot;].&quot;\&quot;\n&quot;;
   echo &quot;\$this-&gt;list[&quot;.$nr.&quot;][\&quot;big\&quot;]=\&quot;&quot;.$this-&gt;list[$nr][&quot;big&quot;].&quot;\&quot;\n&quot;;
   }
  }
 $obj = new test;
 $obj-&gt;load_list();
 $obj-&gt;print_element(0);
 $element=&amp;$obj-&gt;get_element(0);
 $obj-&gt;load_element_detail($element);
 $obj-&gt;print_element(0);
 ?&gt;

output:

 $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 1&quot;
 $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;big&quot;]=&quot;&quot;
 $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 1&quot;
 $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;big&quot;]=&quot;added big info, maybe structure of objects&quot;

==output caching==

&lt;br&gt;
'''NOTE''': It's also appropriate with close friends (ones who you would use &quot;你&quot; (nǐ) instead of &quot;您&quot; (nín) with) to greet with &quot;哎&quot; (aì), the closest equivalent in English being &quot;Hey&quot;. This can precede or even take place of the traditional &quot;你好&quot; greeting, and partially serves as an attention-getter. However, if the pronunciation of &quot;哎&quot; (aì) is stretched/lengthened, it may sound as if you are complaining about something, which uses the same word.

=== Vocabulary ===
* 嗨  / hài = hi
* 去  / qù = go
* 哪儿 （哪兒） / nǎr = where
* 图书馆 (圖書館） / túshūguǎn = library
* 再见 （再見 / zàijiàn = bye, goodbye (literally: see you again)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hallo Daniel,

ich, Franzjosefmehr, Komplexe_Zahlen, weiss nicht, was mit den Lizenzen gemeint ist. Alle Bilder wurden von mir erzeugt und ich geben sie zum allgemeinen Gebrauch frei. Ich habe die Bilder nochmals &quot;hochgeladen&quot; und dabei das Lizenzkaestchen angehakt.

Am Ende meines Textes erscheint eine Testseite aus meinem Russisch-Kurs (http://geocities.com/franzjosefmehr), die ich gerne geloescht haette. Da sie aber auf der Edit-Page nicht erscheint, weiss ich nicht, was ich tun soll. Hast Du eine Idee?

Auf meiner Seite findest Du einige Kurse, die ich eventuell nach WikiPedia transportieren moechte. Schau doch mal, ob das interessant waere.

Ich bin ein lange pensionierter Oberstudienrat und wohne seit 8 Jahren in Brasilien.

Vielen  Dank fuer Deine Muehen, Franzjosefmehr</text>

'''Cheddar cheese''' is a firm yellow cheese made from cow's milk. It is probably the most popular cheese in the United Kingdom and comes in a range of qualities from mass-produced sandwich filler and mousetrap bait to matured farmhouse cheese. Cheddar takes its name from a village in Somerset, England, but is now made throughout the world, particularly in English speaking areas.

'''Red Leicester''' is an orange coloured cow's milk cheese, originally from Leicestershire in England. It has a firm texture, which makes it suitable for grating, and it is a good choice for use in [[Cookbook:Cheese on Toast|cheese on toast]] or with a baked [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]. At its best, it has a slightly nutty taste.</text>

'''Cheese on toast''' - a simple concept but easy to get wrong. Thick cut [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] is your first requirement. Toast one side of it under a medium [[Cookbook:Grilling|grill]]. While it's browning, grate some cheese. You need a firm fleshed, strong flavoured cheese. Lightly toast the other side of the bread, just enough to warm it, then spread the grated cheese over it. You can add pickles, finely chopped onion, or even some crushed walnuts at this stage. Grill the cheesy side of the bread until the cheese is bubbling and brown. Eat quickly, but be careful, as the cheese will be tongue-burningly hot!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi -- wikibooks is for textbooks, so I humbly suggest that this material might be better suited for an article in Wikipedia.  --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 20:28, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Yes you are right, focusing on Christmas is too narrow. What I will do is create a book about Paganism, and add a chapter about how Paganism influences on western holidays. While I am at it, ill include other holydays that have pagan traits. --[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 00:32, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)
----

Zoohouse, I like your work here. Please keep up the great work. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 22:07, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Thank you [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] :)

== Moving The Pagan Beliefs Surrounding Christmas ==

I have been thinking, maybe we should move this book to ''Pagan Beliefs Surrounding Western. Holidays''
What do you folks think? Any suggestions? --[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 03:47, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

==Nice work, why not Wikipedia==
To reiterate Waxmop's point, while your content is great, Wikibooks is just for textbooks. If this book covered how to celebrate Christmas the Pagan way, it then would be a textbook. But as it is now, it's just information on the subject. If you move your writing over to Wikipedia, more people will read it, as the encyclopedia is higher trafficked.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

----

But if I were to write showing how western holidays are based on pagan belifs, whouldn't it be a textbook? --[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 20:46, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

----

Sure, in some sense, any elaborate explanation of any subject could be considered a textbook.  So, under that definition, all material should be included in the wikibooks page.  However, in practice, the term textbook has taken on a particular meaning in the wikibooks context.  The most popular projects fit any of the following criteria:

* The work teaches you how to do something, like play a game, or speak a foreign language,
* The work is an alternative to textbooks used in some mainstream educational curriculum, like US history.

I don't see how your work fits either.  Meanwhile your work does look similar to the myriad paganism articles already under development on wikipedia.  You're more likely to attract other contributors there than here.  Nobody is going to force you to relocate, but you're going against the spirit of the site.  --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 21:54, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)


----

I dont seem to be able to find myriad paganism articles... Can you point me to the right direction? --[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 17:20, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)


----

This is what Wikipedia had to say about Wikibooks: &quot;The project is a collection of free textbooks, manuals, and other texts, with supporting book-based texts, that is written collaboratively on this website.&quot;

Wikibooks was opened so to &quot;bring education to humanity and reduce the costs and other limitations on learning materials.&quot; 
I dont see how I am going against the spirit of the site.
--[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 17:38, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I say this could belong on both Wikipedia and wikibooks, however, this work would do much better on wikipedia due to popularity. It doesn't take much to transwiki anyway. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 00:32, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

[[Wikipedia:Christmas]] already has information on these pagan beliefs, including possibly some information not in this book. This book seems too long to move to Wikipedia, so I would keep at Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:03, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

----
What the *bleep* do those interpretations add to this all? They flatten everything out in a very moralistic way. I say, get rid of 'em. (IP 130.89.xx.xxx)

:If you do not like the interpretations, try to add better ones. If we remove the interpretations, then we will need to move this page to a different wiki, because Wikibooks does not allow fiction. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:17, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

== What is this? ==

I am very confused with this page.  I caught it because it is one of the most heavily edited Wikibook modules on this project, yet it is not listed on any bookshelf, and the primary reference is on the VfD forum (in the archive).  If not for that, nor on a few user talk pages, this would have been an orphaned book module.  I very curious over how anybody has even found this page except through a Google search.

Since it survived a VfD already, I'm going to ask more politely to try and figure out what this is and why does it belong on Wikibooks?  Keep in mind that Wikibooks is not a web hosting service, and it seems as though this page is being maintained almost exclusively by a group totally outside of the Wikibooks community, although [[User:Kernigh]] does seem to be involved, as are a few other old-timers on Wikibooks.

In addition, because there are some others participating, if it were to be put on a bookshelf, where do you think it ought to go?  Literature?  Games (aka grouped together with [[Puzzles]] and [[Puzzles:Riddles|Riddles]])?  Religion?  All three?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:41, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

: As far as I can tell this is a collection of sayings by a religious figure together with annotations (thus making it unsuitable for Wikisource), but I may be wrong. So yes Religion is likely the correct category. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:44, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

:: Comment from [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]: I have occasionally edited this module. I probably discovered it through [[Special:Recentchanges]], because editors tend to flood Recentchanges by editing it section-by-section. From what I know, Nasrudin is a fictitious figure, invented for the purpose of including him in jokes. It is intended for (educational) humour; Nasrudin does not seem to be particularily smart.

:: If this page only contained jokes, it would be all-fiction and outside [[WB:WIW|the scope of Wikibooks]]. However, it also contains random interpretations; there appear to be no established interpretations that one can site. This might invoke an obscure &quot;no original ideas&quot; clause in [[WB:WIW]], but somehow I think that was meant to apply to entire books or sections, such as a book inventing a new language or religion, not to applications of existing concepts such as [[Nasrudin]] or [[Bourne Shell Scripting]] or even [[Zoph]] (when software developers put their manual on Wikibooks). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:53, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

== Interpretations? ==
Are these interpretation from Sufi philosophy? If so, could someone kindly direct us to a source pertaining to these Sufi interpretations?

Thanks,
amesoliman 17:18, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:Interpreting a Nasrudin story is kinda like interpreting a Zen koan. Or, to plagiarize the Tao, &quot;The Nasrudin story that can be interpreted is not a Nasrudin story.&quot; (See 'Guest of Honor' interpretations to view my attempt at a Nasrudin story interpretation in the spirit of Nasrudin.) But of course, this is just my interpretation of Nasrudin stories ... [[User:JohnElder|John Elder]] 11:04, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== Needs Serious Cleaning Up ==

I'm now going to remove some of the obviously false interpretations (yes, I know, it's all relative and they're all equally valid - in theory). For example the one with the Jewish Mother, the whole story of the biker bar, &quot;you can't sing&quot; etc. Please supply me with a valid argument for NOT removing these ridiculous interpretations - Wikigeek at gmail, 2 september 2007

== Nasreddin ==

Not that I want to offend any Wikibookians by passing over their judgement for that of Wikipedians, but I was wondering if editors would accept moving this page to [[Nasreddin]]. That is the name Wikipedia has settled and I think [[w:Talk:Nasreddin#Title|their argument]] is good and valid. (That, and it's the name for the character I know from my childhood...) --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:20, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

Yes please, remove away.  The interpretations muddle the sharp wit of the stories themselves.  Let each his own interpretation find.  --jsleuth, 20:47, 12 June 2008</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''{{Data Structures/ChapNav}}

Computers can store and process vast amounts of data. Formal data structures enable a programmer to mentally structure large amounts of data into conceptually manageable relationships. 

Sometimes we use data structures to allow us to do more: for example, to accomplish fast searching or sorting of data. Other times, we use data structures so that we can do ''less'': for example, the concept of the stack is a limited form of a more general data structure.  These limitations provide us with guarantees that allow us to reason about our programs more easily. Data structures also provide guarantees about algorithmic complexity — choosing an appropriate data structure for a job is crucial for writing good software.

Because data structures are higher-level abstractions, they present to us operations on groups of data, such as adding an item to a list, or looking up the highest-priority item in a queue. When a data structure provides operations, we can call the data structure an '''abstract data type''' (sometimes abbreviated as ADT). Abstract data types can minimize dependencies in your code, which is important when your code needs to be changed. Because you are abstracted away from lower-level details, some of the higher-level commonalities one data structure shares with a different data structure can be used to replace one with the other.

Our programming languages come equipped with a set of built-in types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, that allow us to work with data objects for which the machine's processor has native support. These built-in types are abstractions of what the processor actually provides because built-in types hide details both about their execution and limitations.

For example, when we use a floating-point number we are primarily concerned with its value and the operations that can be applied to it. Consider computing the length of a hypotenuse:

   let ''c'' := sqrt(''a'' * ''a'' + ''b'' * ''b'')

The machine code generated from the above would use common patterns for computing these values and accumulating the result. In fact, these patterns are so repetitious that high-level languages were created to avoid this redundancy and to allow programmers to think about ''what'' value was computed instead of ''how'' it was computed.

Two useful and related concepts are at play here:
* '''Encapsulation''' is when common patterns are grouped together under a single name and then parameterized, in order to achieve a higher-level understanding of that pattern. For example, the multiplication operation requires two source values and writes the product of those two values to a given destination. The operation is parameterized by both the two sources and the single destination.
* '''Abstraction''' is a mechanism to hide the implementation details of an abstraction away from the users of the abstraction. When we multiply numbers, for example, we don't need to know the technique actually used by the processor, we just need to know its properties.

A programming language is both an abstraction of a machine and a tool to encapsulate-away the machine's inner details. For example, a program written in a programming language can be compiled to several different machine architectures when that programming language sufficiently encapsulates the user away from any one machine.

In this book, we take the abstraction and encapsulation that our programming languages provide a step further: When applications get to be more complex, the abstractions of programming languages become too low-level to effectively manage. Thus, we build our own abstractions on top of these lower-level constructs. We can even build further abstractions on top of those abstractions. Each time we build upwards, we lose access to the lower-level implementation details. While losing such access might sound like a bad trade off, it is actually quite a bargain: We are primarily concerned with solving the problem at hand rather than with any trivial decisions that could have just as arbitrarily been replaced with a different decision. When we can think on higher levels, we relieve ourselves of these burdens.

Each data structure that we cover in this book can be thought of as a single unit that has a set of values and a set of operations that can be performed to either access or change these values. The data structure itself can be understood as a set of the data structure's operations together with each operation's properties (i.e., what the operation does and how long we could expect it to take).

===The Node===
The first data structure we look at is the node structure. A node is simply a container for a value, plus a pointer to a &quot;next&quot; node (which may be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;).

{{DS:ADT|Node&amp;lt;Element&amp;gt;|
&lt;tt&gt;'''make-node'''(Element ''v'', Node ''next''): Node&lt;/tt&gt;
:Create a new node, with ''v'' as its contained value and ''next'' as the value of the next pointer

&lt;tt&gt;'''get-value'''(Node ''n''): Element&lt;/tt&gt;
:Returns the value contained in node ''n''

&lt;tt&gt;'''get-next'''(Node ''n''): Node&lt;/tt&gt;
:Returns the value of node ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s next pointer

&lt;tt&gt;'''set-value'''(Node ''n'', Element ''v'')&lt;/tt&gt;
:Sets the contained value of ''n'' to be ''v''

&lt;tt&gt;'''set-next'''(Node ''n'', Node ''new-next''): Node&lt;/tt&gt;
:Sets the value of node ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s next pointer to be ''new-next''

All operations can be performed in time that is &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of the &quot;Element&quot; type can be: numbers, strings, objects, functions, or even other nodes. Essentially, any type that has values at all in the language.}}

The above is an abstraction of a ''structure'':

   structure '''node''' {
     element value     ''// holds the value''
     node next         ''// pointer to the next node; possibly null''
   }

In some languages, structures are called ''records'' or ''classes''. Some other languages provide no direct support for structures, but instead allow them to be built from other constructs (such as ''tuples'' or ''lists'').

Here, we are only concerned that nodes contain values of some form, so we simply say its type is &quot;element&quot; because the type is not important. In some programming languages no type ever needs to be specified (as in dynamically typed languages, like Scheme, Smalltalk or Python). In other languages the type might need to be restricted to integer or string (as in statically typed languages like C). In still other languages, the decision of the type of the contained element can be delayed until the type is actually used (as in languages that support generic types, like C++ and Java). In any of these cases, translating the pseudocode into your own language should be relatively simple.

Each of the node operations specified can be implemented quite easily:

 ''// Create a new node, with v as its contained value and next as
 // the value of the next pointer''
 function '''make-node'''(''v'', node ''next''): node
   let ''result'' := new node {''v'', ''next''}
   return ''result''
 end
 
 ''// Returns the value contained in node n''
 function '''get-value'''(node ''n''): element
   return ''n''.value
 end
 
 ''// Returns the value of node n's next pointer''
 function '''get-next'''(node ''n''): node
   return ''n''.next
 end
 
 ''// Sets the contained value of n to be v''
 function '''set-value'''(node ''n'', ''v'')
   ''n''.value := ''v''
 end
 
 ''// Sets the value of node n's next pointer to be new-next''
 function '''set-next'''(node ''n'', ''new-next'')
   ''n''.next := ''new-next''
 end

Principally, we are more concerned with the operations and the implementation strategy than we are with the structure itself and the low-level implementation. For example, we are more concerned about the time requirement specified, which states that all operations take time that is &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;. The above implementation meets this criteria, because the length of time each operation takes is constant. Another way to think of constant time operations is to think of them as operations whose analysis is not dependent on any variable. (The notation &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; is mathematically defined in the next chapter. For now, it is safe to assume it just means constant time.)

Because a node is just a container both for a value and container to a pointer to another node, it shouldn't be surprising how trivial the node data structure itself (and its implementation) is.

===Building a Chain from Nodes===
Although the node structure is simple, it actually allows us to compute things that we couldn't have computed with just fixed-size integers alone.

But first, we'll look at a program that doesn't need to use nodes. The following program will read in (from an input stream; which can either be from the user or a file) a series of numbers until the end-of-file is reached and then output what the largest number is and the average of all numbers:

 program(input-stream ''in'', output-stream ''out'')
   let ''total'' := 0
   let ''count'' := 0
   let ''largest'' := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   
   while has-next-integer(''in''):
     let ''i'' := read-integer(''in'')
     ''total'' := ''total'' + ''i''
     ''count'' := ''count'' + 1
     ''largest'' := max(''largest'', ''i'')
   repeat
    
   println ''out'' &quot;Maximum: &quot; ''largest''
   
   if ''count'' != 0:
     println ''out'' &quot;Average: &quot; (''total'' / ''count'')
   fi
 end

But now consider solving a similar task: read in a series of numbers until the end-of-file is reached, and output the largest number and the average of all numbers that evenly divide the largest number. This problem is different because it's possible the largest number will be the last one entered: if we are to compute the average of all numbers that divide that number, we'll need to somehow remember all of them. We could use variables to remember the previous numbers, but variables would only help us solve the problem when there aren't too many numbers entered.

For example, suppose we were to give ourselves 200 variables to hold the state input by the user. And further suppose that each of the 200 variables had 64-bits. Even if we were very clever with our program, it could only compute results for &lt;math&gt;2^{64\cdot 200}&lt;/math&gt; different types of input. While this is a very large number of combinations, a list of 300 64-bit numbers would require even more combinations to be properly encoded. (In general, the problem is said to require ''linear space''. All programs that need only a finite number of variables can be solved in ''constant space''.)

Instead of building-in limitations that complicate coding (such as having only a constant number of variables), we can use the properties of the node abstraction to allow us to remember as many numbers as our computer can hold:

 program(input-stream ''in'', output-stream ''out'')
   let ''largest'' := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   let ''nodes'' := null
   
   while has-next-integer(''in''):
     let ''i'' := read-integer(''in'')
     ''nodes'' := '''make-node'''(''i'', ''nodes'') ''// contain the value i,''
                                  ''// and remember the previous numbers too''
     ''largest'' := max(''largest'', ''i'')
   repeat
   println ''out'' &quot;Maximum: &quot; ''largest''
 
   ''// now compute the averages of all factors of largest''
   let ''total'' := 0
   let ''count'' := 0
   while ''nodes'' != null:
     let ''j'' := '''get-value'''(''nodes'')
     if ''j'' divides ''largest'':
       ''total'' := ''total'' + ''j''
       ''count'' := ''count'' + 1
     fi
     ''nodes'' := '''get-next'''(''nodes'')
   repeat
   if ''count'' != 0:
     println ''out'' &quot;Average: &quot; (''total'' / ''count'')
   fi
 end

Above, if ''n'' integers are successfully read there will be ''n'' calls made to '''make-node'''. This will require ''n'' nodes to be made (which require enough space to hold the ''value'' and ''next'' fields of each node, plus internal memory management overhead), so the memory requirements will be on the order of &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, we construct this chain of nodes and then iterate over the chain again, which will require &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; steps to make the chain, and then another &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; steps to iterate over it.

Note that when we iterate the numbers in the chain, we are actually looking at them in reverse order. For example, assume the numbers input to our program are 4, 7, 6, 30, and 15. After EOF is reached, the ''nodes'' chain will look like this:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DataStructuresLinkedListofN.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Such chains are more commonly referred to as ''linked-lists''. However, we generally prefer to think in terms of ''lists'' or ''sequences'', which aren't as low-level: the linking concept is just an implementation detail. While a list can be made with a chain, in this book we cover several other ways to make a list. For the moment, we care more about the abstraction capabilities of the node than we do about one of the ways it is used.

The above algorithm only uses the make-node, get-value, and get-next functions. If we use set-next we can change the algorithm to generate the chain so that it keeps the original ordering (instead of reversing it).

{{TODO|pseudocode to do so; also TODO; should probably think of compelling, but not too-advanced, use of set-value.}}

 program (input-stream ''in'', output-stream ''out'')
   let ''largest'' := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   let ''nodes'' := null
   
   while has-next-integer (''in''):
     let ''i'' := read-integer (''in'')
     if (''nodes'' == null)
       ''nodes'' := '''make-node'''(''i'', null) ''// construct first node in the list''
     else
       ''nodes'' := '''set-next''' (''nodes'', '''make-node''' (''i'', null)) ''// append new node to the end of the list
     ''largest'' := max(''largest'', ''i'')
   repeat
   println ''out'' &quot;Maximum: &quot; ''largest''
 
   ''// now compute the averages of all factors of largest''
   let ''total'' := 0
   let ''count'' := 0
   while ''nodes'' != null:
     let ''j'' := '''get-value'''(''nodes'')
     if ''j'' divides ''largest'':
       ''total'' := ''total'' + ''j''
       ''count'' := ''count'' + 1
     fi
     ''nodes'' := '''get-next'''(''nodes'')
   repeat
   if ''count'' != 0:
     println ''out'' &quot;Average: &quot; (''total'' / ''count'')
   fi
 end

===The Principle of Induction===
The chains we can build from nodes are a demonstration of the principle of mathematical induction:

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''Mathematical Induction'''&lt;br&gt;
# Suppose you have some property of numbers &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;
# If you can prove that when &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; holds that &lt;math&gt;P(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; must also hold, then
# All you need to do is prove that &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; holds to show that &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; holds for all natural &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

For example, let the property &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; be the statement that &quot;you can make a chain that holds &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; numbers&quot;. This is a property of natural numbers, because the sentence makes sense for specific values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;:

* you can make a chain that holds 5 numbers
* you can make a chain that holds 100 numbers
* you can make a chain that holds 1,000,000 numbers

Instead of proving that we can make chains of length 5, 100, and one million, we'd rather prove the general statement &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; instead. Step 2 above is called the '''Inductive Hypothesis'''; let's show that we can prove it:

* Assume that &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; holds. That is, that we can make a chain of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements. Now we must show that &lt;math&gt;P(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; holds.
* Assume &lt;code&gt;''chain''&lt;/code&gt; is the first node of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-element chain. Assume &lt;code&gt;''i''&lt;/code&gt; is some number that we'd like to add to the chain to make an &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; length chain.
* The following code can accomplish this for us:
 let ''bigger-chain'' := '''make-node'''(''i'', ''chain'')
* Here, we have the new number &lt;code&gt;''i''&lt;/code&gt; that is now the contained value of the first link of the &lt;code&gt;''bigger-chain''&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;''chain''&lt;/code&gt; had &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements, then &lt;code&gt;''bigger-chain''&lt;/code&gt; must have &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; elements.

Step 3 above is called the '''Base Case''', let's show that we can prove it:

* We must show that &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; holds. That is, that we can make a chain of one element.
* The following code can accomplish this for us:
 let ''chain'' := '''make-node'''(''i'', null)

The principle of induction says, then, that we have proven that we can make a chain of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements for all value of &lt;math&gt;n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. How is this so? Probably the best way to think of induction is that it's actually a way of creating a formula to describe an infinite number of proofs. After we prove that the statement is true for &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt;, the base case, we can apply the inductive hypothesis to that fact to show that &lt;math&gt;P(2)&lt;/math&gt; holds. Since we now know that &lt;math&gt;P(2)&lt;/math&gt; holds, we can apply the inductive hypothesis again to show that &lt;math&gt;P(3)&lt;/math&gt; must hold. The principle says that there is nothing to stop us from doing this repeatedly, so we should assume it holds for all cases.

Induction may sound like a strange way to prove things, but it's a very useful technique. What makes the technique so useful is that it can take a hard sounding statement like &quot;prove &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and break it into two smaller, easier to prove statements. Typically base cases are easy to prove because they are not general statements at all. Most of the proof work is usually in the inductive hypothesis, which can often require clever ways of reformulating the statement to &quot;attach on&quot; a proof of the &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; case.

You can think of the contained value of a node as a base case, while the next pointer of the node as the inductive hypothesis. Just as in mathematical induction, we can break the hard problem of storing an arbitrary number of elements into an easier problem of just storing one element and then having a mechanism to attach on further elements.

===Induction on a Summation===
The next example of induction we consider is more algebraic in nature:

Let's say we are given the formula &lt;math&gt;\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and we want to prove that this formula gives us the sum of the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; numbers. As a first attempt, we might try to just show that this is true for 1
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(1)(1+1)}{2} = 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;,
for 2
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(2)(2+1)}{2} = 3 = 1 + 2&lt;/math&gt;,
for 3
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(3)(3+1)}{2} = 6 = 1 + 2 + 3&lt;/math&gt;
and so on, however we'd quickly realize that our so called proof would take infinitely long to write out! Even if you carried out this proof and showed it to be true for the first billion numbers, that doesn't nescessarily mean that it would be true for one billion and one or even a hundred billion. This is a strong hint that maybe induction would be useful here.

Let's say we want to prove that the given formula really does give the sum of the first n numbers using induction. The first step is to prove the base case; i.e. we have to show that it is true when n = 1. This is relatively easy; we just substitute 1 for the variable n and we get (&lt;math&gt;\frac{(1)(1+1)}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;), which shows that the formula is correct when n = 1.

Now for the inductive step. We have to show that if the formula is true for j, it is also true for j + 1. To phrase it another way, assuming we've already proven that the sum from 1 to (j) is &lt;math&gt;\frac{((j))((j)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we want to prove that the sum from 1 to (j+1) is &lt;math&gt;\frac{((j+1))((j+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that those two formulas came about just by replacing n with (j) and (j+1) respectively.

To prove this inductive step, first note that to calculate the sum from 1 to j+1, you can just calculate the sum from 1 to j, then add j+1 to it. We already have a formula for the sum from 1 to j, and when we add j+1 to that formula, we get this new formula: &lt;math&gt;\frac{((j))((j)+1)}{2}+(j+1)&lt;/math&gt;. So to actually complete the proof, all we'd need to do is show that &lt;math&gt;\frac{((j))((j)+1)}{2}+(j+1) = \frac{((j+1))((j+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can show the above equation is true via a few simplification steps:


&lt;math&gt;\frac{((j))((j)+1)}{2}+(j+1) = \frac{((j+1))((j+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{(j)(j+1)}{2}+j+1 = \frac{(j+1)(j+1+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{(j)(j+1)}{2}+\frac{2(j+1)}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{(j)(j+1)+2(j+1)}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{j^2+j+2j+2}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{j^2+3j+2}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Graphs==
A '''graph''' is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vertices (also called nodes) &lt;math&gt;\{v_1, v_2,\dots,v_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and a set of edges  &lt;math&gt;\{e_1, e_2,\dots,e_m\}&lt;/math&gt;.  An edge is a pair of vertices &lt;math&gt;\{v_i, v_j\}\ i,j \in \{1..n\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The two vertices are called the edge ''endpoints''.  Graphs are ubiquitous in computer science.  They are used to model real-world systems such as the Internet (each node represents a router and each edge represents a connection between routers); airline connections (each node is an airport and each edge is a flight); or a city road network (each node represents an intersection and each edge represents a block).  The wireframe drawings in computer graphics are another example of graphs.  

A graph may be either ''undirected'' or ''directed''.  Intuitively, an undirected edge models a &quot;two-way&quot; or &quot;duplex&quot; connection between its endpoints, while a directed edge is a one-way connection, and is typically drawn as an arrow.  A directed edge is often called an ''arc''.  Mathematically, an undirected edge is an unordered pair of vertices, and an arc is an ordered pair.  For example, a road network might be modeled as a directed graph, with one-way streets indicated by an arrow between endpoints in the appropriate direction, and two-way streets shown by a pair of parallel directed edges going both directions between the endpoints.  You might ask, why not use a single ''undirected'' edge for a two-way street.  There's no theoretical problem with this, but from a practical programming standpoint, it's generally simpler and less error-prone to stick with all directed or all undirected edges.

An undirected graph can have at most &lt;math&gt;\left (
   \begin{array}{c}
   n+1 \\ 2
   
   \end{array}
   \right )&lt;/math&gt; edges (one for each unordered pair), while a directed graph can have at most &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; edges (one per ordered pair).  A graph is called ''sparse'' if it has many fewer than this many edges (typically &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; edges), and ''dense'' if it has closer to &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; edges.  A '''multigraph''' can have more than one edge between the same two vertices.  For example, if one were modeling airline flights, there might be multiple flights between two cities, occurring at different times of the day.

A '''path''' in a graph is a sequence of vertices &lt;math&gt;\{ v_{i_1}, v_{i_2}, \dots , v_{i_k} \}&lt;/math&gt; such that there exists an edge or arc between consecutive vertices.  The path is called a '''cycle''' if &lt;math&gt;v_{i_1} \equiv v_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;.  An undirected acyclic graph is equivalent to an undirected tree.  A directed acyclic graph is called a '''DAG'''.  It is not necessarily a tree.

Nodes and edges often have associated information, such as ''labels'' or ''weights''.  For example, in a graph of airline flights, a node might be labeled with the name of the corresponding airport, and an edge might have a weight equal to the flight time.  The popular game &quot;[[w:Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon|Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon]]&quot; can be modeled by a labeled undirected graph. Each actor becomes a node, labeled by the actor's name. Nodes are connected by an edge when the two actors appeared together in some movie. We can label this edge by the name of the movie.  Deciding if an actor is separated from Kevin Bacon by six or fewer steps is equivalent to finding a path of length at most six in the graph between Bacon's vertex and the other actors vertex.  (This can be done with the breadth-first search algorithm found in the companion [[Computer_Science:Algorithms|Algorithms]] book. The Oracle of Bacon at the University of Virginia has actually implemented this algorithm and can tell you the path from any actor to Kevin Bacon in a few clicks[http://www.cs.virginia.edu/oracle/].)

===Directed Graphs===
[[Image:Directed.svg|125px|thumb|A directed graph.]]
The number of edges with one endpoint on a given vertex is called that vertex's '''degree'''. In a directed graph, the number of edges that point ''to'' a given vertex is called its '''in-degree''', and the number that point ''from'' it is called its '''out-degree'''.  Often, we may want to be able to distinguish between different nodes and edges. We can associate labels with either. We call such a graph '''labeled'''.

[TODO: also need undirected graph abstraction in that section, and also find a better set of operations-- the key to finding good operations is seeing what the algorithms that ''use'' graphs actually ''need'']
&lt;/div&gt;
===Undirected Graphs===
[[Image:Undirected.svg|thumb|125px|An undirected graph.]]
In a directed graph, the edges point from one vertex to another, while in an '''undirected graph''', they merely connect two vertices.
===Weighted Graphs===
We may also want to associate some cost or weight to the traversal of an edge. When we add this information, the graph is called '''weighted'''. An example of a weighted graph would be the distance between the capitals of a set of countries.

Directed and undirected graphs may both be weighted.  The operations on a weighted graph are the same with addition of a weight parameter during edge creation:
&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;Directed Graph Operations&quot;&gt;
'''Weighted Graph Operations (an extension of undirected/directed graph operations)'''
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''make-edge'''(vertex ''u'', vertex ''v'', weight ''w''): edge&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Create an edge between ''u'' and ''v'' with weight ''w''. In a directed graph, the edge will flow from ''u'' to ''v''.
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Graph Representations ===
==== Adjacency Matrix Representation ====
An '''adjacency matrix''' is one of the two common ways to represent a graph.  The adjacency matrix shows which nodes are '''adjacent''' to one another.  Two nodes are adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.  In the case of a directed graph, if node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, there is an edge from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, if &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, you can get from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; by traversing one edge.  For a given graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes, the adjacency matrix will have dimensions of &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt;.  For an unweighted graph, the adjacency matrix will be populated with boolean values.

For any given node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, you can determine its adjacent nodes by looking at row &lt;math&gt;\left( i , \left[ 1..n \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt; of the adjacency matrix.  A value of true at &lt;math&gt;\left( i , j \right)&lt;/math&gt; indicates that there is an edge from node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and false indicating no edge.  In an undirected graph, the values of &lt;math&gt;\left( i, j \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left( j, i \right)&lt;/math&gt; will be equal.  In a weighted graph, the boolean values will be replaced by the weight of the edge connecting the two nodes, with a special value that indicates the absence of an edge.

The memory use of an adjacency matrix is &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Adjacency List Representation====
The adjacency list is another common representation of a graph. There are many ways to implement this adjacency representation.
One way is to have the graph maintain a list of lists, in which the first list is a list of indices corresponding to each node in the graph. Each of these refer to another list that stores a the index of each adjacent node to this one. It might also be useful to associate the weight of each link with the adjacent node in this list.

Example:
An undirected graph contains four nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4. 1 is linked to 2 and 3. 2 is linked to 3. 3 is linked to 4.

1 - [2, 3]

2 - [1, 3]

3 - [1, 2, 4]

4 - [3]

It might be useful to store the list of all the nodes in the graph in a hash table. The keys then would correspond to the indices of each node and the value would be a reference to the list of adjacent node indices.

Another implementation might require that each node keep a list of its adjacent nodes.

=== Graph Traversals ===
==== Depth-First Search====
Start at vertex v, visit its neighbour w, then w's neighbour y and keep going until reach 'a dead end' then iterate back and visit nodes reachable from second last visited vertex and keep applying the same principle.


 [TODO: depth-first search -- with compelling example]

 // Search in the subgraph for a node matching 'criteria'. Do not re-examine 
 // nodes listed in 'visited' which have already been tested.
 GraphNode depth_first_search(GraphNode node, Predicate criteria, VisitedSet visited) {
  // Check that we haven't already visited this part of the graph
  if (visited.contains(node)) {
    return null;
  }
  visited.insert(node);
  // Test to see if this node satifies the criteria
  if (criteria.apply(node.value)) {
    return node;
  }
  // Search adjacent nodes for a match
  for (adjacent in node.adjacentnodes()) {
    GraphNode ret = depth_first_search(adjacent, criteria, visited);
    if (ret != null) {
      return ret;
    }
  }
  // Give up - not in this part of the graph
  return null;
 }

 Breadth-First Search 

Breadth first search visits the nodes neighbours and then the unvisited neighbours of the neighbours, etc. If it starts on vertex a it will go to all vertices that have an edge from a. If some points are not reachable it will have to start another BFS from a new vertex.

{{TODO|queue implemented as an array: circular and fixed-sized}}

== Stacks and Queues ==
=== Stacks ===
A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought as linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack. The basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set as a stack of plates or books where you can only take the top item off the stack in order to remove things from it. This structure is used all throughout programming.

The basic implementation of a stack is also called a LIFO (Last In First Out) to demonstrate the way it accesses data, since as we will see there are various variations of stack implementations.

There are basically three operations that can be performed on stacks . They are
1) inserting an item into a stack (push).
2) deleting an item from the stack (pop).
3) displaying the contents of the stack(pip).
{{clear}}
[[File:Data stack.svg]]

{{NOTE|Depending on the language and implementation the data structure may share the name with an abstract data type that support all of the data structure characteristics.}}

Below are some of operations a '''stack data type''' normally supports:
&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;Stack&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; Operations&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;Stack&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; Operations'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''push'''(&lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds an item onto the stack.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''top'''():item-type&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the last item pushed onto the stack.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''pop'''()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the most-recently-pushed item from the stack.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-empty'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be popped and there is no top item.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-full'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be pushed.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-size'''():Integer&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the number of elements on the stack.
&lt;/dl&gt;

All operations except &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; can be performed in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time. &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; runs in at worst &lt;math&gt;O(N).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


==== Linked List Implementation ====
The basic linked list implementation is one of the easiest linked list implementations you can do.  Structurally it is a linked list.
 type Stack&lt;item_type&gt;
   data list:Singly Linked List&lt;item_type&gt;
 
   constructor()
     list := new Singly-Linked-List()
   end constructor

Most operations are implemented by passing them through to the underlying linked list.
When you want to '''push''' something onto the list, you simply add it to the front of the linked list. The previous top is then &quot;next&quot; from the item being added and the list's front pointer points to the new item.
   method push(new_item:item_type)
     list.prepend(new_item)
   end method

To look at the '''top''' item, you just examine the first item in the linked list.
   method top():item_type
     return list.get-begin().get-value()
   end method

When you want to '''pop''' something off the list, simply remove the first item from the linked list.
   method pop()
     list.remove-first()
   end method

A check for emptiness is easy.  Just check if the list is empty.
   method is-empty():Boolean
     return list.is-empty()
   end method

A check for full is simple. Linked lists are considered to be limitless in size.
   method is-full():Boolean
     return False
   end method

A check for the size is again passed through to the list.
   method get-size():Integer
     return list.get-size()
   end method
 end type

A real Stack implementation in a published library would probably re-implement the linked list in order to squeeze the last bit of performance out of the implementation by leaving out unneeded functionality. The above implementation gives you the ideas involved, and any optimization you need can be accomplished by inlining the linked list code.

&lt;!-- Removed C++. Move this to appendix
Here is a C++ sample code for this:
 struct Stack_Element_T {
   int data;
   struct Stack_Element_t *next;
 };
 
 class Stack
 {
  public:
    Stack()
      {
       _top = NULL;
       _size = 0;
      }
    void push(int data);
    int pop(void);
    bool isEmpty(void)
      {
       return (_top == NULL);
      }
    bool isFull(void)
      {
       return false;
      }
    unsigned int getSize()
      {
       return _size;
      }
 
  private:
    Stack_Element_T *_top;
    unsigned int _size;
 };
 
 void Stack::push(int data)
 {
  Stack_Element_T *new_element;
 
  if(!_top){
    _top = new Stack_Element_T;
    _top-&gt;data = data;
    _top-&gt;next = NULL;
  }
  else{
    new_element = new Stack_Element_T;
    new_element-&gt;data = data;
    new_element-&gt;next = _top;
    _top = new_element;
  }
 
  _size++;
 }
 
 int Stack::pop(void)
 {
   int return_value = _top-&gt;data;
   Stack_Element_T *old_top;
 
   old_top = _top;
   _top = _top-&gt;next;
 
   delete old_top;
 
   _size--;
 
   return return_value;
 } --&gt;

===== Performance Analysis =====

In a linked list, accessing the first element is an &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; operation because the list contains a pointer that checks for empty/fullness as done here are also &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;.
depending on what time/space tradeoff is made. Most of the time, users of a Stack do not use the &lt;code&gt;getSize()&lt;/code&gt; operation, and so a bit of space can be saved by not optimizing it.

Since all operations are at the top of the stack, the array implementation is now much, much better. 

   public class StackArray implements Stack
   {
       protected int top;
       protected Object[] data;
       ...
   }

The array implementation keeps the bottom of the stack at the beginning of the array. It grows toward the end of the array. 
The only problem is if you attempt to push an element when the array is full. If so 

    Assert.pre(!isFull(),&quot;Stack is not full.&quot;);
will fail, raising an exception. 
Thus it makes more sense to implement with Vector (see StackVector) to allow unbounded growth (at cost of occasional O(n) delays). 

Complexity: 

All operations are O(1) with exception of occasional push and clear, which should replace all entries by null in order to let them be garbage-collected. Array implementation does not replace null entries. The Vector implementation does.

=== Applications of Stacks ===

[[File:Stack of books.jpg|thumb|Stack of books]]

Using stacks, we can solve many applications, some of which are listed below.










====Converting a decimal number into a binary number====
The logic for transforming a decimal number into a binary number is as follows:

     * Read a number
     * Iteration (while number is greater than zero)
               1. Find out the remainder after dividing the number by 2
               2. Print the remainder
               3. Divide the number by 2
     * End the iteration

However, there is a problem with this logic. Suppose the number, whose binary form we want to find is 23. Using this logic, we get the result as 11101, instead of getting 10111.

To solve this problem, we use a stack. We make use of the ''LIFO'' property of the stack. Initially we ''push'' the binary digit formed into the stack, instead of printing it directly. After the entire digit has been converted into the binary form, we ''pop'' one digit at a time from the stack and print it. Therefore we get the decimal number is converted into its proper binary form.

'''Algorithm:'''

    1. Create a stack
    2. Enter a decimal number, which has to be converted into its equivalent binary form.
    3. iteration1 (while number &gt; 0)
          3.1 digit = number % 2
          3.2 Push ''digit'' into the stack
          3.3 If the stack is full
               3.3.1 Print an error
               3.3.2 Stop the algorithm
          3.4 End the ''if'' condition
          3.5 Divide the number by 2
    4. End ''iteration1''
    
    5. iteration2 (while stack is not empty)
          5.1 Pop ''digit'' from the stack
          5.2 Print the ''digit''
    6. End iteration2
    7. STOP

====Towers of Hanoi====
[[Image:Tower of Hanoi.jpeg|300px|thumb|Towers of Hanoi]]
One of the most interesting applications of stacks can be found in solving a puzzle called Tower of Hanoi. According to an old Brahmin story, the existence of the universe is calculated in terms of the time taken by a number of monks, who are working all the time, to move 64 disks from one pole to another. But there are some rules about how this should be done, which are:
# You can move only one disk at a time.
# For temporary storage, a third pole may be used.
# You cannot place a disk of larger diameter on a disk of smaller diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dromey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dromey|first=R.G|title=How to Solve it by Computer|publisher=Prentice Hall of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here we assume that  A is first tower, B is second tower  &amp; C is third tower.

'''Output : (when there are 3 disks)'''

Let ''1'' be the smallest disk, ''2'' be the disk of medium size and ''3'' be the largest disk.

The C++ code for this solution can be implemented in two ways:

=====First Implementation (Without using Stacks)=====
Here we assume that  A is first tower, B is second tower  &amp; C is third tower. (B is the intermediate)

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void TowersofHanoi(int n, int a, int b, int c)
{
    //Move top n disks from tower a to tower b, use tower c for intermediate storage.
    if(n &gt; 0)
    {
        TowersofHanoi(n-1, a, c, b);   //recursion
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot; Move top disk from tower &quot; &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; &quot; to tower &quot; &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; endl ;
        //Move n-1 disks from intermediate(b) to the source(a) back
        TowersofHanoi(n-1, c, b, a);   //recursion
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Data structures, Algorithms and Applications in C++ by Sartaj Sahni&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Second Implementation (Using Stacks)=====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Global variable , tower [1:3] are three towers
arrayStack&lt;int&gt; tower[4];
void TowerofHanoi(int n)
{
    // Preprocessor for moveAndShow.
    for (int d = n; d &gt; 0; d--)        //initialize
        tower[1].push(d);              //add disk d to tower 1
    moveAndShow(n, 1, 2, 3);           /*move n disks from tower 1 to tower 3 using 
                                       tower 2 as intermediate tower*/  
}

void moveAndShow(int n, int a, int b, int c)
{
    // Move the top n disks from tower a to tower b showing states.
    // Use tower c for intermediate storage.
    if(n &gt; 0)
    {
        moveAndShow(n-1, a, c, b);     //recursion
        int d = tower[x].top();        //move a disc from top of tower x to top of 
        tower[x].pop();                //tower y
        tower[y].push(d);
        showState();                   //show state of 3 towers
        moveAndShow(n-1, c, b, a);     //recursion
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

However complexity for above written implementations is O(&lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;). So it's obvious that problem can only be solved for small values of n (generally n &lt;= 30). 
In case of the monks, the number of turns taken to transfer 64 disks, by following the above rules, will be 18,446,744,073,709,551,615; which will surely take a lot of time!!

====Expression evaluation and syntax parsing====
Calculators employing [[W:reverse Polish notation|reverse Polish notation]] use a stack structure to hold values. Expressions can be represented in prefix, postfix or infix notations. Conversion from one form of the expression to another form may be accomplished using a stack. Many compilers use a stack for parsing the syntax of expressions, program blocks etc. before translating into low level code. Most of the programming languages are [[W:context-free grammar|context-free languages]] allowing them to be parsed with stack based machines.

=====Evaluation of Infix Expression which is not fully parenthesized=====

'''Input:''' (2 * 5 - 1 * 2) / (11 - 9)

'''Output:''' 4

'''Analysis:''' There are five types of input characters which are:
                * Opening brackets
                * Numbers
                * Operators
                * Closing brackets
                * New line character (\n)

We do not know what to do if an operator is read as an input character.
By implementing the priority rule for operators, we have a solution to this problem.

The ''Priority rule'' we should perform comparative priority check if an operator is read, and then push it. If the stack ''top'' contains an operator of prioirty higher than or equal to the priority of the input operator, then we ''pop'' it and print it. We keep on perforrming the prioirty check until the ''top'' of stack either contains an operator of lower priority or if it does not contain an operator.

'''Data Structure Requirement for this problem:''' A character stack and an integer stack

'''Algorithm:'''

    1. Read an input character
    2. Actions that will be performed at the end of each input
       Opening brackets              (2.1)  ''Push'' it into stack and then Go to step (1)  
       Digit                         (2.2)  ''Push'' into stack, Go to step (1)
       Operator                      (2.3)  Do the comparative priority check
                                     (2.3.1) if the character stack's ''top'' contains an operator with equal
                                              or higher priority, then ''pop'' it into op
                                              ''Pop'' a number from integer stack into op2
                                              ''Pop'' another number from integer stack into op1
                                            Calculate op1 op op2 and ''push'' the result into the integer
                                            stack
      Closing brackets              (2.4)  ''Pop'' from the character stack
                                    (2.4.1) if it is an opening bracket, then discard it and Go to
                                            step (1)
                                    (2.4.2) To op, assign the popped element
                                            ''Pop'' a number from integer stack and assign it op2
                                            ''Pop'' another number from integer stack and assign it
                                            to op1
                                            Calculate ''op1'' ''op'' ''op2'' and push the result into the integer
                                            stack
                                            Convert into character and ''push'' into stack
                                            Go to the step (2.4)
     New line character            (2.5)  Print the result after popping from the stack
                                          ''STOP''

'''Result:'''  The evaluation of an infix expression that is not fully parenthesized is printed as follows:

====Rearranging railroad cars====
=====Problem Description===== 
It's a very nice application of stacks. Consider that a freight train has '''''n''''' railroad cars. Each to be left at different station. They're numbered 1 through n &amp; freight train visits these stations in order n through 1. Obviously, the railroad cars are labeled by their destination.To facilitate removal of the cars from the train, we must rearrange them in ascending order of their number(i.e. 1 through n). When cars are in this order , they can be detached at each station. We rearrange cars at a shunting yard that has '''''input track''''', '''''output track''''' &amp; '''''k''''' holding tracks between input &amp; output tracks(i.e. '''''holding track'''''). 

=====Solution Strategy=====
To rearrange cars, we examine the cars on the the input from front to back. If the car being examined is next one in the output arrangement , we move it directly to '''''output track'''''. If not , we move it to the '''''holding track''''' &amp; leave it there until it's time to place it to the '''''output track'''''. The holding tracks operate in a LIFO manner as the cars enter &amp; leave these tracks from top. When rearranging cars only following moves are permitted:
* A car may be moved from front (i.e. right end) of the input track to the top of one of the '''''holding tracks''''' or to the left end of the output track.
* A car may be moved from the top of '''''holding track''''' to left end of the '''''output track'''''.
The figure shows a shunting yard with '''''k''''' = 3, holding tracks '''''H1''''', '''''H2''''' &amp; '''''H3''''', also '''''n''''' = 9. The '''''n''''' cars of freight train begin in the input track &amp; are to end up in the output track in order 1 through '''''n''''' from right to left. The cars initially are in the order 5,8,1,7,4,2,9,6,3 from back to front. Later cars are rearranged in desired order.    

=====A Three Track Example===== 
[[File:Railroadcars2.png|thumb|Railroad cars example]]
*Consider the input arrangement from figure , here we note that the car 3 is at the front, so it can't be output yet, as it to be preceded by cars 1 &amp; 2. So car 3 is detached &amp; moved to holding track '''''H1'''''.
*The next car 6 can't be output &amp; it is moved to holding track '''''H2'''''. Because we have to output car 3 before car 6 &amp; this will not possible if we move car 6 to holding track '''''H1'''''.
*Now it's obvious that we move car 9 to '''''H3'''''.
The requirement of rearrangement of cars on any holding track is that the cars should be preferred  to arrange in ascending order from top to bottom. 
*So car 2 is now moved to holding track H1 so that it satisfies the previous statement. If we move car 2 to H2 or H3, then we've no place to move cars 4,5,7,8.'''''The least restrictions on future car placement arise when the new car λ is moved to the holding track that has a car at its top with smallest label Ψ such that λ &lt; Ψ. We may call it an assignment rule to decide whether a particular car belongs to a specific holding track.''''' 
*When car 4 is considered, there are three places to move the car H1,H2,H3. The top of these tracks are 2,6,9.So using above mentioned Assignment rule, we move car 4 to H2.
*The car 7 is moved to H3.
*The next car 1 has the least label, so it's moved to output track.
*Now it's time for car 2 &amp; 3 to output which are from H1(in short all the cars from H1 are appended to car 1 on output track).
The car 4 is moved to output track. No other cars can be moved to output track at this time.
*The next car 8 is moved to holding track H1.
*Car 5 is output from input track. Car 6 is moved to output track from H2, so is the 7 from H3,8 from H1 &amp; 9 from H3.


==== Quicksort ====

Sorting means arranging a group of elements in a particular order. Be it ascending or descending, by cardinality or alphabetical order or variations thereof.  The resulting ordering possibilities will only be limited by the type of the source elements. 

Quicksort is an algorithm of the ''divide and conquer'' type. In this method, to sort a set of numbers, we reduce it to two smaller sets, and then sort these smaller sets.

This can be explained with the help of the following example:

Suppose '''A''' is a list of the following numbers:

[[File:Quicksort1.pdf|500px]]

In the reduction step, we find the final position of one of the numbers. In this case, let us assume that we have to find the final position of 48, which is the first number in the list.

To accomplish this, we adopt the following method. Begin with the last number, and move from right to left. Compare each number with 48. If the number is smaller than 48, we stop at that number and swap it with 48.


In our case, the number is 24. Hence, we swap 24 and 48.

[[File:Quicksort2.pdf|500px]]

The numbers 96 and 72 to the right of 48, are greater than 48.  Now beginning with 24, scan the numbers in the opposite direction, that is from left to right. Compare every number with 48 until you find a number that is greater than 48. 

In this case, it is 60. Therefore we swap 48 and 60.

[[File:Quicksort3.pdf|500px]]

Note that the numbers 12, 24 and 36 to the left of 48 are all smaller than 48. Now, start scanning numbers from 60, in the right to left direction. As soon as you find lesser number, swap it with 48.

In this case, it is 44. Swap it with 48. The final result is:

[[File:Quicksort4.pdf|500px]]

Now, beginning with 44, scan the list from left to right, until you find a number greater than 48.

Such a number is 84. Swap it with 48. The final result is:

[[File:Quicksort5.pdf|500px]]

Now, beginning with 84, traverse the list from right to left, until you reach a number lesser than 48. We do not find such a number before reaching 48. This means that all the numbers in the list have been scanned and compared with 48. Also, we notice that all numbers less than 48 are to the left of it, and all numbers greater than 48, are to it's right.

The final partitions look as follows:

[[File:Quicksort6.pdf|500px]]

Therefore, 48 has been placed in it's proper position and now our task is reduced to sorting the two partitions.
This above step of creating partitions can be repeated with every partition containing 2 or more elements. As we can process only a single partition at a time, we should be able to keep track of the other partitions, for future processing.

This is done by using two '''stacks''' called LOWERBOUND and UPPERBOUND, to temporarily store these partitions. The addresses of the first and last elements of the partitions are pushed into the LOWERBOUND and UPPERBOUND stacks respectively. Now, the above reduction step is applied to the partitions only after it's boundary values are ''popped'' from the stack.

We can understand this from the following example:

Take the above list A with 12 elements. The algorithm starts by pushing the boundary values of A, that is 1 and 12 into the LOWERBOUND and UPPERBOUND stacks respectively.  Therefore the stacks look as follows:

     LOWERBOUND:  1                   UPPERBOUND:  12

To perform the reduction step, the values of the stack top are popped from the stack. Therefore, both the stacks become empty.

     LOWERBOUND:  {empty}                UPPERBOUND: {empty}

Now, the reduction step causes 48 to be fixed to the 5th position and creates two partitions, one from position 1 to 4 and the other from position 6 to 12. Hence, the values 1 and 6 are pushed into the LOWERBOUND stack and 4 and 12 are pushed into the UPPERBOUND stack.

     LOWERBOUND:  1, 6                   UPPERBOUND: 4, 12

For applying the reduction step again, the values at the stack top are popped. Therefore, the values 6 and 12 are popped. Therefore the stacks look like:

     LOWERBOUND:  1                      UPPERBOUND: 4

The reduction step is now applied to the second partition, that is from the 6th to 12th element.

[[File:Quicksort7.pdf|500px]]

After the reduction step, 98 is fixed in the 11th position. So, the second partition has only one element. Therefore, we push the upper and lower boundary values of the first partition onto the stack. So, the stacks are as follows:

     LOWERBOUND:  1, 6                   UPPERBOUND:  4, 10

The processing proceeds in the following way and ends when the stacks do not contain any upper and lower bounds of the partition to be processed, and the list gets sorted.

==== The Stock Span Problem ====
[[File:Stockspan.pdf|325px|thumb|The Stockspan Problem]]
In the stock span problem, we will solve a financial problem with the help of stacks.

Suppose, for a stock, we have a series of ''n'' daily price quotes, the ''span'' of the stock's price on a particular day is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days for which the price of the stock on the current day is less than or equal to its price on that day.

===== An algorithm which has Quadratic Time Complexity =====

'''Input:''' An array ''P'' with ''n'' elements

'''Output:''' An array ''S''  of ''n'' elements such that P[i] is the largest integer k such that k &lt;= i + 1 and P[y] &lt;= P[i] for j = i - k + 1,.....,i

'''Algorithm:'''

        1. Initialize an array P which contains the daily prices of the stocks
        2. Initialize an array S which will store the span of the stock
        3. '''for''' i = 0 to i = n - 1
                3.1 Initialize k to zero
                3.2 Done with a ''false'' condition
                3.3 '''repeat'''
                      3.3.1 if ( P[i - k] &lt;= P[i)] then
                                Increment k by 1
                      3.3.2 else
                                Done with ''true'' condition
                3.4 Till (k &gt; i) or done with processing
                      Assign value of k to S[i] to get the span of the stock
        4. Return array S

Now, analyzing this algorithm for running time, we observe:

*We have initialized the array S at the beginning and returned it at the end. This is a constant time operation, hence takes ''O''(n) time

*The ''repeat'' loop is nested within the ''for'' loop. The ''for'' loop, whose counter is ''i'' is executed n times. The statements which are not in the repeat loop, but in the for loop are executed ''n'' times. Therefore these statements and the incrementing and condition testing of i take ''O''(n) time.

*In repetition of i for the outer for loop, the body of the inner ''repeat'' loop is executed maximum i + 1 times. In the worst case, element S[i] is greater than all the previous elements. So, testing for the if condition, the statement after that, as well as testing the until condition, will be performed i + 1 times during iteration i for the outer for loop. Hence, the total time taken by the inner loop is ''O''(n(n + 1)/2), which is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n^2 &lt;/math&gt;)

The running time of all these steps is calculated by adding the time taken by all these three steps. The first two terms are ''O''(&lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;) while the last term is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n^2 &lt;/math&gt;). Therefore the total running time of the algorithm is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n^2 &lt;/math&gt;).

===== An algorithm that has Linear Time Complexity =====

In order to calculate the span more efficiently, we see that the span on a particular day can be easily calculated if we know the closest day before ''i'' , such that the price of the stocks on that day was higher than the price of the stocks on the present day. If there exists such a day, we can represent it by h(i) and initialize h(i) to be -1.

Therefore the span of a particular day is given by the formula,
s = i - h(i).

To implement this logic, we use a stack as an abstract data type to store the days i, h(i), h(h(i)) and so on. When we go from day i-1 to i, we pop the days when the price of the stock was less than or equal to p(i) and then push the value of day ''i'' back into the stack.

Here, we assume that the stack is implemented by operations that take ''O''(1) that is constant time. The algorithm is as follows:

'''Input:''' An array P with ''n'' elements and an empty stack N

'''Output:''' An array ''S''  of ''n'' elements such that P[i] is the largest integer k such that k &lt;= i + 1 and P[y] &lt;= P[i] for j = i - k + 1,.....,i

'''Algorithm:'''

        1. Initialize an array P which contains the daily prices of the stocks
        2. Initialize an array S which will store the span of the stock
        3. '''for''' i = 0 to i = n - 1
                3.1 Initialize k to zero
                3.2 Done with a ''false'' condition
                3.3 '''while not''' (Stack N is empty or done with processing)
                      3.3.1 if ( P[i] &gt;= P[N.top())] then
                                Pop a value from stack N
                      3.3.2 else
                                Done with ''true'' condition
                3.4 if Stack N is empty
                         3.4.1 Initialize h to -1
                3.5 else
                         3.5.1 Initialize stack top to h
                         3.5.2 Put the value of h - i in S[i]
                         3.5.3 Push the value of i in N 
        4. Return array S

Now, analyzing this algorithm for running time, we observe:

*We have initialized the array S at the beginning and returned it at the end. This is a constant time operation, hence takes ''O''(n) time

*The ''while'' loop is nested within the ''for'' loop. The ''for'' loop, whose counter is ''i'' is executed n times. The statements which are not in the repeat loop, but in the for loop are executed ''n'' times. Therefore these statements and the incrementing and condition testing of i take ''O''(n) time.

*Now, observe the inner while loop during ''i'' repetitions of the for loop. The statement ''done with a true condition'' is done at most once, since it causes an exit from the loop. Let us say that t(i) is the number of times statement ''Pop a value from stack N'' is executed. So it becomes clear that ''while not (Stack N is empty or done with processing)'' is tested maximum t(i) + 1 times.

*Adding the running time of all the operations in the while loop, we get:


:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}t(i) +  1&lt;/math&gt; 

*An element once popped from the stack N is never pushed back into it. Therefore,


:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}t(i)&lt;/math&gt;

So, the running time of all the statements in the while loop is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;)

The running time of all the steps in the algorithm is calculated by adding the time taken by all these steps. The run time of each step is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). Hence the running time complexity of this algorithm is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Queues ===
A queue is a basic data structure that is used throughout programming.  You can think of it as a line in a grocery store.  The first one in the line is the first one to be served.Just like a queue.

A queue is also called a FIFO (First In First Out) to demonstrate the way it accesses data.

&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;Queue&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; Operations&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;Queue&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; Operations'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''enqueue'''(&lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds an item onto the end of the queue.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''front'''():item-type&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the item at the front of the queue.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''dequeue'''()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the item from the front of the queue.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-empty'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be dequeued and there is no front item.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-full'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be enqueued.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-size'''():Integer&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the number of elements in the queue.
&lt;/dl&gt;

All operations except &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; can be performed in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time. &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; runs in at worst &lt;math&gt;O(N).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


==== Linked List Implementation ====
The basic linked list implementation uses a singly-linked list with a tail pointer to keep track of the back of the queue.
 type Queue&lt;item_type&gt;
   data list:Singly Linked List&lt;item_type&gt;
   data tail:List Iterator&lt;item_type&gt;
 
   constructor()
     list := new Singly-Linked-List()
     tail := list.get-begin() # null
   end constructor

When you want to '''enqueue''' something, you simply add it to the back of the item pointed to by the tail pointer.  So the previous tail is considered next compared to the item being added and the tail pointer points to the new item. If the list was empty, this doesn't work, since the tail iterator doesn't refer to anything
  method enqueue(new_item:item_type)
    if is-empty()
      list.prepend(new_item)
      tail := list.get-begin()
    else
      list.insert_after(new_item, tail)
      tail.move-next()
    end if
  end method

The '''front''' item on the queue is just the one referred to by the linked list's head pointer
   method front():item_type
     return list.get-begin().get-value()
   end method

When you want to '''dequeue''' something off the list, simply point the head pointer to the previous from head item.  The old head item is the one you removed of the list. If the list is now empty, we have to fix the tail iterator.
   method dequeue()
     list.remove-first()
     if is-empty()
       tail := list.get-begin()
     end if
   end method

A check for emptiness is easy.  Just check if the list is empty.
   method is-empty():Boolean
     return list.is-empty()
   end method

A check for full is simple.  Linked lists are considered to be limitless in size.
   method is-full():Boolean
     return False
   end method

A check for the size is again passed through to the list.
   method get-size():Integer
     return list.get-size()
   end method
 end type

   _head = _head-&gt;next;
 
   delete old_head;
 
   _size--;

 }--&gt;

===== Performance Analysis =====

In a linked list, accessing the first element is an &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; operation because the list contains a pointer directly to it. Therefore, enqueue, front, and dequeue are a quick &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; operations.

The checks for empty/fullness as done here are also &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

The performance of &lt;code&gt;getSize()&lt;/code&gt; depends on the performance of the corresponding operation in the linked list implementation. It could be either &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, depending on what time/space tradeoff is made. Most of the time, users of a Queue do not use the &lt;code&gt;getSize()&lt;/code&gt; operation, and so a bit of space can be saved by not optimizing it.

=== Deques ===
A Deque is a homogeneous list of elements in which insertions and deletion operations are performed on both the ends. &lt;br /&gt;
Because of this property it is known as double ended queue i.e. Deque
&lt;br /&gt;
Deque has two types:&lt;br /&gt;
# Input restricted queue: It allows insertion at only one end&lt;br /&gt;
# Output restricted queue: It allows deletion at only one end

A heap is an efficient semi-ordered data structure for storing a collection of orderable data. A min-heap supports two operations:
   INSERT(heap, element)
   element REMOVE_MIN(heap)
(we discuss min-heaps, but there's no real difference
between min and max heaps, except how the comparison
is interpreted.)

This chapter will refer exclusively to binary heaps, although different types of heaps exist. The term binary heap and heap are interchangeable in most cases. A heap can be thought of as a tree with parent and child. The main difference between a heap and a binary tree is the heap property. In order for a data structure to be considered a heap, it must satisfy the following condition (heap property): 

:If ''A'' and ''B'' are elements in the heap and ''B'' is a child of ''A'', then key(''A'') &amp;le; key(''B'').

(This property applies for a min-heap. A max heap would have the comparison reversed). 
What this tells us is that the minimum key will always remain at the top and greater values will be below it. Due to this fact, heaps are used to implement priority queues which allows quick access to the item with the most priority. Here's an example of a min-heap: 
[[Image:binary-heap.png|thumb|300px|right]]
A heap is implemented using an array that is indexed from 1 to N,
where N is the number of elements in the heap.

At any time, the heap must satisfy the heap property
   array[n] &lt;= array[2*n]   // parent element &lt;= left child
and
   array[n] &lt;= array[2*n+1] // parent element &lt;= right child
whenever the indices are in the arrays bounds.

==Compute the extreme value==
We will prove that &lt;code&gt;array[1]&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum element in the heap.
We prove it by seeing a contradiction if some other element is less than the first element.
Suppose &lt;code&gt;array[i]&lt;/code&gt; is the first instance of the minimum,
with &lt;code&gt;array[j] &gt; array[i]&lt;/code&gt; for all &lt;code&gt;j &lt; i&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;i &gt;= 2&lt;/code&gt;.
But by the heap invariant array, &lt;code&gt;array[floor(i/2)] &lt;= array[i]&lt;/code&gt;:
this is a contradiction.

Therefore, it is easy to compute &lt;code&gt;MIN(heap)&lt;/code&gt;:
  
   MIN(heap)
      return heap.array[1];

==Removing the Extreme Value==
To remove the minimum element, we must adjust the heap
to fill &lt;code&gt;heap.array[1]&lt;/code&gt;.  This process is called ''percolation''.
Basically, we move the hole from node i to either node &lt;code&gt;2i&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;2i+1&lt;/code&gt;.
If we pick the minimum of these two, the heap invariant will be maintained;
suppose &lt;code&gt;array[2i] &lt; array[2i+1]&lt;/code&gt;.  Then &lt;code&gt;array[2i]&lt;/code&gt; will be moved to &lt;code&gt;array[i]&lt;/code&gt;,
leaving a hole at &lt;code&gt;2i&lt;/code&gt;, but after the move &lt;code&gt;array[i] &lt; array[2i+1]&lt;/code&gt;, so the heap invariant is maintained.
In some cases, &lt;code&gt;2i+1&lt;/code&gt; will exceed the array bounds, and we are forced to percolate &lt;code&gt;2i&lt;/code&gt;.  In other cases,
&lt;code&gt;2i&lt;/code&gt; is also outside the bounds: in that case, we are done.


Therefore, here is the remove algorithm:


 #define LEFT(i) (2*i)

 #define RIGHT(i) (2*i + 1)  

 REMOVE_MIN(heap)
 {  
     savemin=arr[1];
     arr[1]=arr[--heapsize];
     i=1;
     while(i&lt;heapsize){
         minidx=i;
         if(LEFT(i)&lt;heapsize &amp;&amp; arr[LEFT(i)] &lt; arr[minidx])
             minidx=LEFT(i);
         if(RIGHT(i)&lt;heapsize &amp;&amp; arr[RIGHT(i)] &lt; arr[minidx]) 
             minidx=RIGHT(i);
         if(minidx!=i){
             swap(arr[i],arr[minidx]);
             i=minidx;            
         }
         else 
             break;
     }
 }

Why does this work?
    If there is only 1 element ,heapsize becomes 0, nothing in the array is valid.
    If there are 2 elements , one min and other max, you replace min with max.
    If there are 3 or more elements say n, you replace 0th element with n-1th element. 
    The heap property is destroyed. Choose the 2 childs of root and check which is the minimum.
    Choose the minimum among them , swap it . Now subtree with swapped child is looses heap property.
    If no violations break.

==Inserting a value into the heap==
A similar strategy exists for INSERT:  just append the element to the array,
then fixup the heap-invariants by swapping.
For example if we just appended element N,
then the only invariant violation possible involves that element,
in particular if &lt;math&gt;array[floor(N/2)] &gt; array[N]&lt;/math&gt;,
then those two elements must be swapped and
now the only invariant violation possible is between
  array[floor(N/4)]  and  array[floor(N/2)]
we continue iterating until N=1 or until the invariant is satisfied.
 
 INSERT(heap, element)
    append(heap.array, element)
    i = heap.array.length
    while (i &gt; 1)
      {
        if (heap.array[i/2] &lt;= heap.array[i])
          break;
        swap(heap.array[i/2], heap.array[i]);
        i /= 2;
      }

==TODO==
  Merge-heap: it would take two max/min heap and merge them and return a single heap. O(n) time.
  Make-heap: it would also be nice to describe the O(n) make-heap operation
  Heap sort: the structure can actually be used to efficiently sort arrays
  Treaps: heaps where elements can be deleted by name&lt;noinclude&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Make-heap would make use a function heapify

 //Element is a data structure//
Make-heap(Element Arr[],int size) 
{
    for(j=size/2;j&gt;0;j--)
        {
            Heapify(Arr,size,j);
        }
}

Heapify(Element Arr[],int size,int t)
{
    L=2*t;
    R=2*t+1;
    if(L&lt;size )
    {
        mix=minindex(Arr,L,t);
        if(R&lt;=size)
            mix=minindex(Arr,R,mix);
    }
    else
        mix=t;

    if(mix!=t)
    {
        swap(mix,t);
        Heapify(Arr,size,mix);
    }
}

minindex returns index of the smaller element

==Applications of Priority Heaps==
In 2009, a smaller Sort Benchmark was won by OzSort, which has a paper describing lucidly how to use a priority heap
as the sorting machine to produce merged parts of large (internally) sorted sections . If a sorted section took M memory
and the sorting problem was k x M big, then take  sequential sections of each of the k sections of size M/k , at a time, so they
fit in M memory ( k * M/k = M ), and feed the first element of each of k sections to make a k sized priority queue, and as the top element
is removed and written to an output buffer, take the next element from the corresponding section. This means elements may need
to be associated with a label for the section they come from. When a M/k-sized section is exhausted, load in the next
M/k sized minisection from the original sorted section stored on disc. Continue until all minisections in each of the
k sections on disc have been exhausted. 

(As an example of pipelining to fill up disc operational delays, there are twin output buffers, so that once an output buffer is full
one gets written the disc while the other is being filled.)

This paper showed that a priority heap is more straightforward than
a binary tree, because elements are constantly being deleted, as well as added, as a queuing mechanism for a k way merge, and has
practical application for sorting large sets of data that exceed internal memory storage.

A mathematical set has a fairly simple interface and can be implemented in a surprising number of ways.

&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;Set&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; ADT&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;Set&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ADT'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''contains'''(&lt;var&gt;test-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type):Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if &lt;var&gt;test-item&lt;/var&gt; is contained in the Set.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''insert'''(&lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds &lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt; into the set.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''remove'''(&lt;var&gt;item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes &lt;var&gt;item&lt;/var&gt; from the set. If &lt;var&gt;item&lt;/var&gt; wasn't in the set, this method does nothing.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''remove'''(&lt;var&gt;item-iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the item referred to by &lt;var&gt;item-iter&lt;/var&gt; from the set.

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-begin'''():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Allows iteration over the elements in the Set.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-end'''():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Also allows iteration over the elements in the Set.

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''union'''(&lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt;:Set&lt;item-type&gt;):Set&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns a set containing all elements in either this or the &lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt; set. Has a default implementation.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''intersect'''(&lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt;:Set&lt;item-type&gt;):Set&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns a set containing all elements in both this and the &lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt; set. Has a default implementation.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''subtract'''(&lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt;:Set&lt;item-type&gt;):Set&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns a set containing all elements in this but not the &lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt; set. Has a default implementation.

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-empty'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be popped and there is no top item.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-size'''():Integer&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the number of elements in the set.
&lt;/dl&gt;

All operations can be performed in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;/div&gt;

==List implementation==

There are several different ways to implement sets. The simplest, but in most cases least efficient, method is to simply create a linear list (an array, linked list or similar structure) containing each of the elements in the set. For the most basic operation, testing membership, a possible implementation could look like
 '''function''' ''contains''('''List'''&lt;'''T'''&gt; list, '''T''' member)
     '''for''' item '''in''' list
         '''if''' item == member
             '''return''' True
     '''return''' False

To add new members to this set, simply add the element to beginning or end of the list. (If a check is done to ensure no duplicate elements, some other operations may be simpler.) Other operations can be similarly implemented in terms of simple list operations. Unfortunately, the membership test has a worst-case running time of &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; if the item is not in the list, and even an average-case time of the same, assuming the item is equally likely to be anywhere in the list. If the set is small, or if frequently accessed items can be placed near the front of the list, this may be an efficient solution, but other options can have a faster running time.

Assuming elements can be ordered and insertions and deletions are rare, a list guaranteed to be in sorted order with no duplicate elements can be much more efficient. Using an ordered list, the membership test can be efficient to the order of &lt;math&gt;O(log n)&lt;/math&gt;. Additionally, union, intersection and subtraction can be implemented in linear time, whereas they would take quadratic time with unordered lists.

==Bit array implementation==

For certain data, it may be more practical to maintain a bit array describing the contents of the set. In this representation, there is a 1 or 0 corresponding to each element of the problem domain, specifying whether the object is an element of the set. For a simple case, assume that only integers from 0 to n can be members of the set, where n is known beforehand. This can be represented by a bit array of length n+1. The ''contains'' operation is simple:
 '''function''' ''contains''('''BitArray''' array, '''Int''' member)
     '''if''' member &gt;= ''length''(array)
        '''return''' False
     '''else if''' array[member] == 1
        '''return''' True
     '''else'''
        '''return''' False

To add or remove an element from this sort of set, simply modify the bit array to reflect whether that index should be 1 or 0. The membership runs in exactly &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; (constant) time, but it has a severely restricted domain. It is possible to shift the domain, going from m to n with step k, rather than 0 to n with step 1 as is specified above, but there is not much flexibility possible here. Nevertheless, for the right domain, this is often the most efficient solution. 

==Associative array implementation==
Associative arrays--that is, hash tables and binary search trees, represent a heavyweight but general representation of sets. Binary trees generally have &lt;math&gt;O(log n)&lt;/math&gt; time implementations for lookup and mutation for a particular key, and hash tables have a &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; implementation (though there is a higher constant factor). Additionally, they are capable of storing nearly any key type. The membership test is trivial: simply test if the potential set member exists as a key in the associative array. To add an element, just add the set member as a key in the associative array, with a dummy value. In optimized implementations, instead of reusing an existing associative array implementation, it is possible to write a specialized hash table or binary tree which does not store values corresponding to keys. Values are not meaningful here, and they take up a constant factor of additional memory space.

Hashtables use a lot of memory but can be very fast searches, in linear time.

In general you should use the data structure that best fits what you want to do, rather than trying to find the most efficient way. 

  [TODO:]
  Use asymptotic behaviour to decide, most importantly seeing how the
  structure will be ''used'': an infrequent operation does not need to be
  fast if it means everything else will be much faster


  [TODO:]
  Can use a table like this one to compare the asymptotic behaviour of every
  structure for every operation on it.

  [TODO:]
  Can also add a table that specifies the best structure for some specific need
  e.g. For queues, double linked. For stacks, single linked. For sets, hash tables. etc...

  [TODO:]
  Could also contain table with space complexity information (there is a significative cost
  in using hashtables or lists implemented via arrays, for example).&lt;noinclude&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The structure of the Italian verb system is very coherent and intelligible.  If one understands that the structure can be perceived as a chart of interrelated concepts, a great deal of the mystery about Italian verb structure disappears.
In order to gain an understanding of the structure of the system, one should determine answers to the following questions:
What is the congugation category of the verb (1st, 2nd or 3rd)?
What is the behavior of the verb (regular or irregular)?
What is the voice category of the verb (Active or Passive)?
What is the mood category (Indicative, Subjunctive, Conditional, or Imperative)?
What is the tense category (Any of 17 tenses assigned to the various moods)?
What is the number category (Singular or Plural)?
What is the person category (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)?

== Asymptotic Notation ==

=== Introduction ===
A problem may have numerous algorithmic solutions. In order to choose the best algorithm for a particular task, you need to be able to judge how long a particular solution will take to run.  Or, more accurately, you need to be able to judge how long two solutions will take to run, and choose the better of the two.  You don't need to know how many minutes and seconds they will take, but you do need some way to compare algorithms against one another.

''Asymptotic complexity'' is a way of expressing the ''main component'' of the cost of an algorithm, using idealized units of computational work.  Consider, for example, the algorithm for sorting a deck of cards, which proceeds by repeatedly searching through the deck for the lowest card.  The asymptotic complexity of this algorithm is the ''square'' of the number of cards in the deck.  This quadratic behavior is the main term in the complexity formula, it says, e.g., if you double the size of the deck, then the work is roughly quadrupled.  

The exact formula for the cost is more complex, and contains more details than are needed to understand
the essential complexity of the algorithm.  With our deck of cards, in the worst case, the deck would start out reverse-sorted, so our scans would have to go all the way to the end.  The first scan would involve scanning 52 cards, the next would take 51, etc.  So the cost formula is 52 + 51 + ..... + 2.  generally, letting N be the number of cards, the formula is 2 + ... + N, which equals &lt;math&gt;((N) \times (N + 1) / 2) - 1 = ((N^2 + N) / 2) - 1 = (1/2)N^2 + (1/2)N - 1&lt;/math&gt;.  But the &lt;math&gt;N^2&lt;/math&gt; term dominates the expression, and this is what is key for comparing algorithm costs.  (This is in fact an ''expensive'' algorithm; the best sorting algorithms run in sub-quadratic time.)

Asymptotically speaking, in the limit as N tends towards infinity, 2 + 3 + .,,,.. + N gets closer and closer to the pure quadratic function (1/2)N^2.  And what difference does the constant factor of 1/2 make, at this level of abstraction?  So the behavior is said to be &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now let us consider how we would go about ''comparing'' the complexity of two algorithms.   Let f(n) be the cost, in the worst case, of one algorithm, expressed as a function of the input size n, and g(n) be the cost function for the other algorithm.  E.g., for sorting algorithms, f(10) and g(10) would be the maximum number of steps that the algorithms would take on a list of 10 items.  If, for all values of n&amp;nbsp;&gt;=&amp;nbsp;0, f(n) is less than or equal to g(n), then the algorithm with complexity function f is strictly faster.  But, generally speaking, our concern for computational cost is for the cases with large inputs; so the comparison of f(n) and g(n) for small values of n is less significant than the &quot;long term&quot; comparison of f(n) and g(n), for n larger than some threshold.

Note that we have been speaking about ''bounds'' on the performance of algorithms, rather than giving exact speeds.  The actual number of steps required to sort our deck of cards (with our naive quadratic algorithm) will depend upon the order in which the cards begin.  The actual time to perform each of our steps will depend upon our processor speed, the condition of our processor cache, etc., etc.  It's all very complicated in the concrete details, and moreover not relevant to the essence of the algorithm.
----

=== The O Notation ===
==== Definition ====
The O(''pronounced as: big-oh'') is the formal method of expressing the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.  It's a measure of the longest amount of time it could possibly take for the algorithm to complete.  

More formally, for non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', if there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for all integers &lt;math&gt;n&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''cg(n)'', then ''f(n)'' is Big O of ''g(n)''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''O(g(n))''&quot;.  If graphed, ''g(n)'' serves as an upper bound to the curve you are analyzing, ''f(n)''.

Note that if ''f'' can take on finite values only (as it should happen normally) then this definition implies that there exists some constant ''C'' (potentially larger than ''c'') such that for all values of ''n'', ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''Cg(n)''. An appropriate value for ''C'' is the maximum of ''c'' and &lt;math&gt; \max_{1\le n\le n_0} f(n)/g(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Theory Examples ====
So, let's take an example of Big-O.  Say that f(n) = 2n + 8, and g(n) = &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Can we find a constant &lt;math&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, so that 2n + 8 &lt;= &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;?  The number 4 works here, giving us 16 &lt;= 16.  For any number n greater than 4, this will still work.  Since we're trying to generalize this for large values of n, and small values (1, 2, 3) aren't that important, we can say that f(n) is generally faster than g(n); that is, f(n) is bound by g(n), and will always be less than it.

It could then be said that f(n) runs in O(&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;) time: &quot;f-of-n runs in Big-O of n-squared time&quot;.

To find the upper bound - the Big-O time - assuming we know that f(n) is equal to (exactly) 2n + 8, we can take a few shortcuts.  For example, we can remove all constants from the runtime; eventually, at some value of c, they become irrelevant.  This makes f(n) = 2n.  Also, for convenience of comparison, we remove constant multipliers; in this case, the 2.  This makes f(n) = n.  It could also be said that f(n) runs in O(n) time; that lets us put a tighter (closer) upper bound onto the estimate.

====Practical Examples====
O(n): printing a list of n items to the screen, looking at each item once.

O(ln n): also &quot;log n&quot;, taking a list of items, cutting it in half repeatedly until there's only one item left.

O(&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;): taking a list of n items, and comparing every item to every other item.
----

=== ''Big-Omega Notation'' ===
For non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', if there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for all integers &lt;math&gt;n&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''cg(n)'', then ''f(n)'' is omega of ''g(n)''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Omega;(g(n))''&quot;.

This is almost the same definition as Big Oh, except that &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''cg(n)''&quot;, this makes ''g(n)'' a lower bound function, instead of an upper bound function.  It describes the '''best that can happen''' for a given data size.
----
==== Theta Notation ====
For non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', ''f(n)'' is theta of ''g(n)'' if and only if ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''O(g(n))'' and ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Omega;(g(n))''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Theta;(g(n))''&quot;.

This is basically saying that the function, ''f(n)'' is bounded both from the top and bottom by the same function, ''g(n)''.
----
The theta notation is denoted by Q.

==== Little-O Notation ====
For non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', ''f(n)'' is little o of ''g(n)'' if and only if ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''O(g(n))'', but ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Theta;(g(n))''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''o(g(n))''&quot;.

This represents a loose bounding version of Big O.  ''g(n)'' bounds from the top, but it does not bound the bottom.
----
====Little Omega Notation====
For non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', ''f(n)'' is little omega of ''g(n)'' if and only if ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Omega;(g(n))'', but ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Theta;(g(n))''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;omega;(g(n))''&quot;.

Much like Little Oh, this is the equivalent for Big Omega.  ''g(n)'' is a loose lower boundary of the function ''f(n)'';  it bounds from the bottom, but not from the top.
----
=== How asymptotic notation relates to analyzing complexity ===

Temporal comparison is not the only issue in algorithms. There are space issues as well. Generally, a trade off between time and space is noticed in algorithms. Asymptotic notation empowers you to make that trade off. If you think of the amount of time and space your algorithm uses as a function of your data over time or space (time and space are usually analyzed separately), you can analyze how the time and space is handled when you introduce more data to your program.

This is important in data structures because you want a structure that behaves efficiently as you increase the amount of data it handles.  Keep in mind though that algorithms that are efficient with large amounts of data are not always simple and efficient for small amounts of data.  So if you know you are working with only a small amount of data and you have concerns for speed and code space, a trade off can be made for a function that does not behave well for large amounts of data.

=== A few examples of asymptotic notation ===

Generally, we use asymptotic notation as a convenient way to examine what can happen in a function in the worst case or in the best case.  For example, if you want to write a function that searches through an array of numbers and returns the smallest one:

 function '''find-min'''(array ''a''[1..''n''])
   let ''j'' := &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   for ''i'' := 1 to ''n'':
     ''j'' := min(''j'', ''a''[''i''])
   repeat
   return ''j''
 end

Regardless of how big or small the array is, every time we run '''find-min''', we have to initialize the ''i'' and ''j'' integer variables and return ''j'' at the end.  Therefore, we can just think of those parts of the function as constant and ignore them.

So, how can we use asymptotic notation to discuss the '''find-min''' function?  If we search through an array with 87 elements, then the ''for'' loop iterates 87 times, even if the very first element we hit turns out to be the minimum.   Likewise, for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements, the for loop iterates &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times.  Therefore we say the function runs in time &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

What about this function:

 function '''find-min-plus-max'''(array ''a''[1..''n''])
   ''// First, find the smallest element in the array''
   let ''j'' := &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;;
   for ''i'' := 1 to ''n'':
     ''j'' := min(''j'', ''a''[''i''])
   repeat
   let ''minim'' := ''j''
   
   ''// Now, find the biggest element, add it to the smallest and''
   j := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;;
   for ''i'' := 1 to ''n'':
     ''j'' := max(''j'', ''a''[''i''])
   repeat
   let ''maxim'' := ''j''
   
   ''// return the sum of the two''
   return ''minim'' + ''maxim'';
 end

What's the running time for '''find-min-plus-max'''? There are two ''for'' loops, that each iterate &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times, so the running time is clearly &lt;math&gt;O(2n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because 2 is a constant, we throw it away and write the running time as &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Why can you do this? If you recall the definition of Big-O notation, the function whose bound you're testing can be multiplied by some constant. If ''f(x)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''2x'', we can see that if ''g(x)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'', then the Big-O condition holds. Thus &lt;math&gt;O(2n) = O(n)&lt;/math&gt;. This rule is general for the various asymptotic notations.

== List Structures and Iterators ==
We have seen now two different data structures that allow us to store an ordered sequence of elements. However, they have two very different interfaces. The array allows us to use &lt;code&gt;get-element()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set-element()&lt;/code&gt; functions to access and change elements. The node chain requires us to use &lt;code&gt;get-next()&lt;/code&gt; until we find the desired node, and then we can use &lt;code&gt;get-value()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set-value()&lt;/code&gt; to access and modify its value. Now, what if you've written some code, and you realize that you should have been using the other sequence data structure? You have to go through all of the code you've already written and change one set of accessor functions into another. What a pain! Fortunately, there is a way to localize this change into only one place: by using the '''List''' Abstract Data Type (ADT).

&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;List&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; ADT&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;List&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ADT'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-begin'''():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the ''list iterator'' (we'll define this soon) that represents the first element of the list. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-end'''():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the list iterator that represents one element past the last element in the list. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''prepend'''(&lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds a new element at the beginning of a list. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''insert-after'''(&lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;, &lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''remove-first'''()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the element at the beginning of a list. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''remove-after'''(&lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the element immediately after &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-empty'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if there are no elements in the list. Has a default implementation. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-size'''():Integer&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the number of elements in the list. Has a default implementation. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-nth'''(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;:Integer):item-type&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the nth element in the list, counting from 0. Has a default implementation. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''set-nth'''(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;:Integer, &lt;var&gt;new-value&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Assigns a new value to the nth element in the list, counting from 0. Has a default implementation. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The '''iterator''' is another abstraction that encapsulates both access to a single element and incremental movement around the list. Its interface is very similar to the node interface presented in the introduction, but since it is an abstract type, different lists can implement it differently.
&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;List Iterator&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; ADT&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ADT'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-value'''():item-type&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the value of the list element that this iterator refers to.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''set-value'''(&lt;var&gt;new-value&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Assigns a new value to the list element that this iterator refers to.

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''move-next'''()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Makes this iterator refer to the next element in the list.
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''equal'''(&lt;var&gt;other-iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;):Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if the other iterator refers to the same list element as this iterator.
&lt;/dl&gt;
All operations run in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;/div&gt;

There are several other aspects of the List ADT's definition that need more explanation. First, notice that the &lt;code&gt;get-end()&lt;/code&gt; operation returns an iterator that is &quot;one past the end&quot; of the list. This makes its implementation a little trickier, but allows you to write loops like:
 var iter:List Iterator := list.get-begin()
 while(not iter.equal(list.get-end()))
  # Do stuff with the iterator
  iter.move-next()
 end while

Second, each operation gives a worst-case running time. Any implementation of the List ADT is guaranteed to be able to run these operation at least that fast. Most implementations will run most of the operations faster. For example, the node chain implementation of List can run &lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Third, some of the operations say that they have a default implementation. This means that these operations can be implemented in terms of other, more primitive operations. They're included in the ADT so that certain implementations can implement them faster. For example, the default implementation of &lt;code&gt;get-nth()&lt;/code&gt; runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; because it has to traverse all of the elements before the nth. Yet the array implementation of List can implement it in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; using its &lt;code&gt;get-element()&lt;/code&gt; operation. The other default implementations are:
 abstract type List&lt;item-type&gt;
  method is-empty()
   return get-begin().equal(get-end())
  end method
 
  method get-size():Integer
   var size:Integer := 0
   var iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt; := get-begin()
   while(not iter.equal(get-end()))
    size := size+1
    iter.move-next()
   end while
   return size
  end method
 
  helper method find-nth(n:Integer):List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
   if n &gt;= get-size()
    error &quot;The index is past the end of the list&quot;
   end if
   var iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt; := get-begin()
   while(n &gt; 0)
    iter.move-next()
    n := n-1
   end while
   return iter
  end method
 
  method get-nth(n:Integer):item-type
   return find-nth(n).get-value()
  end method
 
  method set-nth(n:Integer, new-value:item-type)
   find-nth(n).set-value(new-value)
  end method
 end type

=== Syntactic Sugar ===
Occasionally throughout this book we'll introduce an abbreviation that will allow us to write, and you to read, less pseudocode. For now, we'll introduce an easier way to compare iterators and a specialized loop for traversing sequences.

Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;equal()&lt;/code&gt; method to compare iterators, we'll overload the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operator. To be precise, the following two expressions are equivalent:
 &lt;var&gt;iter1&lt;/var&gt;.equal(&lt;var&gt;iter2&lt;/var&gt;)
 &lt;var&gt;iter1&lt;/var&gt; == &lt;var&gt;iter2&lt;/var&gt;

Second, we'll use the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; keyword to express list traversal. The following two blocks are equivalent:
 var &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;&lt;var&gt;item-type&lt;/var&gt;&gt; := &lt;var&gt;list&lt;/var&gt;.get-begin()
 while(not &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; == &lt;var&gt;list&lt;/var&gt;.get-end())
  &lt;var&gt;operations on iter&lt;/var&gt;
  &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;.move-next()
 end while

 for &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; in &lt;var&gt;list&lt;/var&gt;
  &lt;var&gt;operations on iter&lt;/var&gt;
 end for

=== Implementations ===

In order to actually use the List ADT, we need to write a ''concrete'' data type that implements its interface. There are two standard data types that naturally implement List: the node chain described in the Introduction, normally called a Singly Linked List; and an extension of the array type called a Vector, which automatically resizes itself to accommodate inserted nodes.

==== Singly Linked List ====
 type Singly Linked List&lt;item-type&gt; implements List&lt;item-type&gt;
&lt;var&gt;head&lt;/var&gt; refers to the first node in the list. When it's null, the list is empty.
   data head:Node&lt;item-type&gt;

Initially, the list is empty.
   constructor()
     head := null
   end constructor
 
   method get-begin():Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
     return new Sll-Iterator(head)
   end method
 
The &quot;one past the end&quot; iterator is just a null node. To see why, think about what you get when you have an iterator for the last element in the list and you call &lt;code&gt;move-next()&lt;/code&gt;.
   method get-end():Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
     return new Sll-Iterator(null)
   end method
 
   method prepend(new-item:item-type)
     head = make-node(new-item, head)
   end method
 
   method insert-after(iter:Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;, new-item:item-type)
     var new-node:Node&lt;item-type&gt; := make-node(new-item, iter.node().get-next())
     iter.node.set-next(new-node)
   end method
 
   method remove-first()
     head = head.get-next()
   end method
 
This takes the node the iterator holds and makes it point to the node two nodes later.
   method remove-after(iter:Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)
     iter.node.set-next(iter.node.get-next().get-next())
   end method
 end type
If we want to make &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; operation, we can add an Integer data member that keeps track of the list's size at all times. Otherwise, the default &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; implementation works fine.

An iterator for a singly linked list simply consists of a reference to a node. 
 type Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
   data node:Node&lt;item-type&gt;
 
   constructor(_node:Node&lt;item-type&gt;)
     node := _node
   end constructor

Most of the operations just pass through to the node.
   method get-value():item-type
     return node.get-value()
   end method
 
   method set-value(new-value:item-type)
     node.set-value(new-value)
   end method
 
   method move-next()
     node := node.get-next()
   end method

For equality testing, we assume that the underlying system knows how to compare nodes for equality. In nearly all languages, this would be a pointer comparison.
   method equal(other-iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;):Boolean
     return node == other-iter.node
   end method
 end type

==== Vector ====
Let's write the Vector's iterator first. It will make the Vector's implementation clearer.
 type Vector Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
   data array:Array&lt;item-type&gt;
   data index:Integer
 
   constructor(my_array:Array&lt;item-type&gt;, my_index:Integer)
     array := my_array
     index := my_index
   end constructor
 
   method get-value():item-type
     return array.get-element(index)
   end method
 
   method set-value(new-value:item-type)
     array.set-element(index, new-value)
   end method
 
   method move-next()
     index := index+1
   end method
 
   method equal(other-iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;):Boolean
     return array==other-iter.array and index==other-iter.index
   end method
 end type

We implement the Vector in terms of the primitive Array data type. It is inefficient to always keep the array exactly the right size (think of how much resizing you'd have to do), so we store both a &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;, the number of logical elements in the Vector, and a &lt;code&gt;capacity&lt;/code&gt;, the number of spaces in the array. The array's valid indices will ''always'' range from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;capacity-1&lt;/code&gt;.
 type Vector&lt;item-type&gt;
   data array:Array&lt;item-type&gt;
   data size:Integer
   data capacity:Integer

We initialize the vector with a capacity of 10. Choosing 10 was fairly arbitrary. If we'd wanted to make it appear less arbitrary, we would have chosen a power of 2, and innocent readers like you would assume that there was some deep, binary-related reason for the choice.
   constructor()
     array := create-array(0, 9)
     size := 0
     capacity := 10
   end constructor
 
   method get-begin():Vector-Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
     return new Vector-Iterator(array, 0)
   end method

The end iterator has an index of &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;. That's one more than the highest valid index.
   method get-end():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
     return new Vector-Iterator(array, size)
   end method

We'll use this method to help us implement the insertion routines. After it is called, the &lt;code&gt;capacity&lt;/code&gt; of the array is guaranteed to be at least &lt;code&gt;new-capacity&lt;/code&gt;. A naive implementation would simply allocate a new array with exactly &lt;code&gt;new-capacity&lt;/code&gt; elements and copy the old array over. To see why this is inefficient, think what would happen if we started appending elements in a loop. Once we exceeded the original capacity, each new element would require us to copy the entire array. That's why this implementation at least doubles the size of the underlying array any time it needs to grow.
   helper method ensure-capacity(new-capacity:Integer)
If the current capacity is already big enough, return quickly.
     if capacity &gt;= new-capacity
       return
     end if
Now, find the new capacity we'll need,
     var allocated-capacity:Integer := max(capacity*2, new-capacity)
     var new-array:Array&lt;item-type&gt; := create-array(0, allocated-capacity - 1)
copy over the old array,
     for i in 0..size-1
       new-array.set-element(i, array.get-element(i))
     end for
and update the Vector's state.
     array := new-array
     capacity := allocated-capacity
   end method

This method uses a normally-illegal iterator, which refers to the item one before the start of the Vector, to trick &lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt; into doing the right thing. By doing this, we avoid duplicating code.
   method prepend(new-item:item-type)
     insert-after(new Vector-Iterator(array, -1), new-item)
   end method

&lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt; needs to copy all of the elements between &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; and the end of the Vector. This means that in general, it runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time. However, in the special case where &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; refers to the last element in the vector, we don't need to copy any elements to make room for the new one. An append operation can run in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time, plus the time needed for the &lt;code&gt;ensure-capacity()&lt;/code&gt; call. &lt;code&gt;ensure-capacity()&lt;/code&gt; will sometimes need to copy the whole array, which takes &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time. But much more often, it doesn't need to do anything at all.

&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; margin:0 2em&quot; title=&quot;List&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; ADT&quot;&gt;
'''Amortized Analysis'''&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, if you think of a series of append operations starting immediately after &lt;code&gt;ensure-capacity()&lt;/code&gt; increases the Vector's capacity (call the capacity here &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;), and ending immediately after the next increase in capacity, you can see that there will be exactly &lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{2}=O(C)&lt;/math&gt; appends. At the later increase in capacity, it will need to copy &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; elements over to the new array. So this entire sequence of &lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{2}&lt;/math&gt; function calls took &lt;math&gt;\frac{3C}{2}=O(C)&lt;/math&gt; operations. We call this situation, where there are &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; operations for &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; function calls &quot;''amortized'' &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time&quot;.
&lt;/div&gt;
   method insert-after(iter:Vector Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;, new-item:item-type)
     ensure-capacity(size+1)
This loop copies all of the elements in the vector into the spot one index up. We loop backwards in order to make room for each successive element just before we copy it.
     for i in size-1 .. iter.index+1 step -1
       array.set-element(i+1, array.get-element(i))
     end for
Now that there is an empty space in the middle of the array, we can put the new element there.
     array.set-element(iter.index+1, new-item)
And update the Vector's size.
     size := size+1
   end method
 
Again, cheats a little bit to avoid duplicate code.
   method remove-first()
    remove-after(new Vector-Iterator(array, -1))
   end method
 
Like &lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;remove-after&lt;/code&gt; needs to copy all of the elements between &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; and the end of the Vector. So in general, it runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time. But in the special case where &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; refers to the last element in the vector, we can simply decrement the Vector's size, without copying any elements. A remove-last operation runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
   method remove-after(iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)
     for i in iter.index+1 .. size-2
       array.set-element(i, array.get-element(i+1))
     end for
     size := size-1
   end method
 
This method has a default implementation, but we're already storing the size, so we can implement it in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time, rather than the default's &lt;math&gt;O(N).&lt;/math&gt;
   method get-size():Integer
     return size
   end method

Because an array allows constant-time access to elements, we can implement &lt;code&gt;get-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set-nth()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, rather than the default implementation's &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt;
   method get-nth(n:Integer):item-type
     return array.get-element(n)
   end method
 
   method set-nth(n:Integer, new-value:item-type)
     array.set-element(n, new-value)
   end method
 end type

=== Bidirectional Lists ===
{{TODO|This is very terse. It should be fleshed out later.}}

Sometimes we want to move backward in a list too.

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-empty'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True iff there are no elements in the list. Has a default implementation. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.

&lt;/dl&gt;
All operations run in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Doubly Linked List Implementation ===
{{TODO|Explain this:
It is part of linked lists that can show the connectivity between the list.
}}

=== Vector Implementation ===
The vector we've already seen has a perfectly adequate implementation to be a Bidirectional List. All we need to do is add the extra member functions to it and its iterator; the old ones don't have to change.

 type Vector&lt;item-type&gt;
   ... # already-existing data and methods

Implement this in terms of the original &lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt; method. After that runs, we have to adjust &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;'s index so that it still refers to the same element.
   method insert(iter:Bidirectional List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;, &lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)
     insert-after(new Vector-Iterator(iter.array, iter.index-1))
     iter.move-next()
   end method

Also implement this on in terms of an old function. After &lt;code&gt;remove-after()&lt;/code&gt; runs, the index will already be correct.
   method remove(iter:Bidirectional List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)
     remove-after(new Vector-Iterator(iter.array, iter.index-1))
   end method
 end type

=== Tradeoffs ===

    set(pos, val), get(pos), remove(pos), append(val)
      [Perhaps discuss operations on Nodes, versus operations on the List
      itself: example, Nodes have a next operation, but the List itself has
      a pointer to the head and tail node, and an integer for the number of
      elements. This view would work well in both the Lisp and OO worlds.]
  Doubley linked list
  Vectors (resizeable arrays)
}}

In order to choose the correct data structure for the job, we need to have some idea of what we're going to *do* with the data.

* Do we know that we'll never have more than 100 pieces of data at any one time, or do we need to occasionally handle gigabytes of data ?
* How will we read the data out ? Always in chronological order ? Always sorted by name ? Randomly accessed by record number ?
* Will we always add/delete data to the end or to the beginning ? Or will we be doing a lot of insertions and deletions in the middle ?

We must strike a balance between the various requirements.
If we need to frequently read data out in 3 different ways, pick a data structure that allows us to do all 3 things not-too-slowly. Don't pick some data structure that's unbearably slow for *one* way, no matter how blazingly fast it is for the other ways.

Often the shortest, simplest programming solution for some task will use a linear (1D) array.

If we keep our data as an ADT, that makes it easier to temporarily switch to some other underlying data structure, and objectively measure whether it's faster or slower.

=== Advantages / Disadvantages ===
For the most part, an advantage of an array is a disadvantage of a linked-list, and vice versa. 

*Array Advantages (vs. Link-Lists)
# ''Index'' - '''Fast access to every element in the array using an index []''', not so with linked list where elements in beginning must be traversed to your desired element.
# ''Faster'' - In general, It is '''faster to access an element in an array''' than accessing an element in a linked-list.
*Link-Lists Advantages (vs. Arrays)
# ''Resize'' - '''Can easily resize the link-list by adding elements''' without affecting the majority of the other elements in the link-list.
# ''Insertion'' - '''Can easily insert an element in the middle of a linked-list,''' (the element is created and then you code pointers to link this element to the other element(s) in the link-list).

Side-note: - '''How to insert an element in the middle of an array'''.
If an array is not full, you take all the elements '''after''' the spot or index in the array you want to insert, and move them forward by 1, then insert your element.
If the array is already full and you want to insert an element, you would have to, in a sense, 'resize the array.'  A new array would have to be made one size larger than the original array to insert your element, then all the elements of the original array are copied to the new array taking into consideration the spot or index to insert your element, then insert your element.

==Trees==
A '''tree''' is a non-empty set one element of which is designated the root of the tree while the remaining elements are partitioned into non-empty sets each of which is a subtree of the root.

Tree nodes have many useful properties.  The '''depth''' of a node is the length of the path (or the number of edges) from the root to that node.  The '''height''' of a node is the longest path from that node to its leaves.  The height of a tree is the height of the root. A '''leaf node''' has no children -- its only path is up to its parent.

See the [[../Tree Axioms|axiomatic development of trees]] and its consequences for more information.

Types of trees:

'''Binary:''' Each node has zero, one, or two children.  This assertion makes many tree operations simple and efficient.

'''Binary Search:''' A binary tree where any left child node has a value less than its parent node and any right child node has a value greater than or equal to that of its parent node.

===Traversal===
Many problems require we visit the nodes of a tree in a systematic way: tasks such as counting how many nodes exist or finding the maximum element. Three different methods are possible for binary trees: ''preorder'', ''postorder'', and ''in-order'', which all do the same three things: recursively traverse both the left and right subtrees and visit the current node. The difference is when the algorithm visits the current node:

'''preorder''': Current node, left subtree, right subtree (DLR)

'''postorder''': Left subtree, right subtree, current node (LRD)

'''in-order''': Left subtree, current node, right subtree (LDR)

'''levelorder''': Level by level, from left to right, starting from the root node.

&amp;#42; Visit means performing some operation involving the current node of a tree, like incrementing a counter or checking if the value of the current node is greater than any other recorded.

===Sample implementations for Tree Traversal===

 '''preorder'''(node)
   visit(node)
   '''if''' node.left  ≠ '''null then''' preorder(node.left)
   '''if''' node.right ≠ '''null then''' preorder(node.right)

 '''inorder'''(node)
   '''if''' node.left  ≠ '''null then''' inorder(node.left)
   visit(node)
   '''if''' node.right ≠ '''null then''' inorder(node.right)

 '''postorder'''(node)
   '''if''' node.left  ≠ '''null then''' postorder(node.left)
   '''if''' node.right ≠ '''null then''' postorder(node.right)
   visit(node)

 '''levelorder'''(root)
   queue&lt;node&gt; q
   q.push(root)
   '''while''' not q.empty '''do'''
      node = q.pop
      visit(node)
      '''if''' node.left  ≠ '''null then''' q.push(node.left)
      '''if''' node.right ≠ '''null then''' q.push(node.right)

===Examples of Tree Traversals===

[[Image:bstreesample.jpg]]

 '''preorder:'''  50,30, 20, 40, 90, 100
 '''inorder:''' 20,30,40,50, 90, 100

===Balancing===
When entries that are already ''sorted'' are stored in a tree, all new records will go the same route, and the tree will look more like a list (such a tree is called a degenerate tree). Therefore the tree needs balancing routines, making sure that under all branches are an equal number of records. This will keep searching in the tree at optimal speed.  Specifically, if a tree with ''n'' nodes is a degenerate tree, the longest path through the tree will be n nodes; if it is a balanced tree, the longest path will be ''log n'' nodes.

[[Algorithms/Left_rotation]]: This shows how balancing is applied to establish a priority heap invariant in  a [[w:Treap|Treap]], a data structure which has the queueing performance of a heap, and the key lookup performance of a tree. A balancing operation can change the tree structure while maintaining another order, which is binary tree sort order. The binary tree order is left to right, with left nodes' keys less than right nodes' keys, whereas the priority order is up and down, with higher nodes' priorities greater than lower nodes' priorities. Alternatively, the priority can be viewed as another ordering key, except that finding a specific key is more involved. 

The balancing operation can move nodes up and down a tree without affecting the left right ordering.
&lt;!--[[Media:left_rotation.svg]]--&gt;

'''[[w:AVL_tree|AVL]]:''' A balanced binary search tree according to the following specification: the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

'''[[w:Red_black_tree|Red-Black Tree]]:''' A balanced binary search tree using a balancing algorithm based on colors assigned to a node, and the colors of nearby nodes.

''' [[w:AA_tree|AA Tree]]:''' A balanced tree, in fact a more restrictive variation of a red-black tree.

===Binary Search Trees===
A typical binary search tree looks like this:

[[Image:bstreesample.jpg]]

====Terms====
'''Node''' Any item that is stored in the tree.
'''Root''' The top item in the tree. (50 in the tree above)
'''Child''' Node(s) under the current node. (20 and 40 are children of 30 in the tree above)
'''Parent''' The node directly above the current node. (90 is the parent of 100 in the tree above)
'''Leaf''' A node which has no children. (20 is a leaf in the tree above)

====Searching through a binary search tree====
To search for an item in a binary tree:

# Start at the root node
# If the item that you are searching for is less than the root node, move to the left child of the root node, if the item that you are searching for is more than the root node, move to the right child of the root node and if it is equal to the root node, then you have found the item that you are looking for.
# Now check to see if the item that you are searching for is equal to, less than or more than the new node that you are on.  Again if the item that you are searching for is less than the current node, move to the left child, and if the item that you are searching for is greater than the current node, move to the right child.
# Repeat this process until you find the item that you are looking for or until the node doesn't have a child on the correct branch, in which case the tree doesn't contain the item which you are looking for.

=====Example=====
[[Image:bstreesearchexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to find the node 40...'''

# The root node is 50, which is greater than 40, so you go to 50's left child.
# 50's left child is 30, which is less than 40, so you next go to 30's right child.
# 30's right child is 40, so you have found the item that you are looking for :)

====Adding an item to a binary search tree====
# To add an item, you first must search through the tree to find the position that you should put it in.  You do this following the steps above.
# When you reach a node which doesn't contain a child on the correct branch, add the new node there.



'''For example, to add the node 25...'''

# The root node is 50, which is greater than 25, so you go to 50's left child.
# 50's left child is 30, which is greater than 25, so you go to 30's left child.
# 30's left child is 20, which is less than 25, so you go to 20's right child.
# 20's right child doesn't exist, so you add 25 there :)

====Deleting an item from a binary search tree====
''It is assumed that you have already found the node that you want to delete, using the search technique described above.''

=====Case 1: The node you want to delete is a leaf=====
[[Image:bstreedeleteleafexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to delete 40...'''

* Simply delete the node!

=====Case 2: The node you want to delete has one child=====
# Directly connect the child of the node that you want to delete, to the parent of the node that you want to delete.

[[Image:bstreedeleteonechildexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to delete 90...'''

* Delete 90, then make 100 the child node of 50.

=====Case 3: The node you want to delete has two children=====
To delete a node, you first have to find the child node, called the &quot;successor&quot; or the &quot;replacing node&quot;, that will replace the deleted node. This can be done in one of two ways, which are essentially a mirror image of each other.
# Find the left-most node in the right subtree of the node being deleted. After you have found the node you want to delete, go to its right node, then for every node under that, go to its left node until the node has no left node; that node will be the successor.
# Find the right-most node in the left subtree of the node being deleted. After you have found the node you want to delete, go to its left node, then for every node under that, go to its right node until the node has no right node; that node will be the successor.

The following examples use the first algorithm, that is, the successor is the left-most node in the right subtree of the node to be deleted.

[[Image:bstreefindsuccessorexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to delete 30'''

# The right node of the node which is being deleted is 40.
# (From now on, we continually go to the left node until there isn't another one...) The first left node of 40, is 35.
# 35 has no left node, therefore 35 is the successor!

=====Case 1: The successor is the right child of the node being deleted=====

# Directly move the child to the right of the node being deleted into the position of the node being deleted.
# As the new node has no left children, you can connect the deleted node's left subtree's root as it's left child.

[[Image:bstreedeleterightchildexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to delete 30'''

# Move 40 up to where 30 was.
# 20 now becomes 40's left child.

=====Case 2: The successor isn't the right child of the node being deleted=====
''This is best shown with an example

[[Image:bstreedeletenotrightchildexample.jpg]]

'''To delete 30...'''

# Move the successor into the place where the deleted node was and make it inherit both of its children.  So 35 moves to where 30 was and 20 and 40 become its children.
# Move the successor's (35's) right subtree (if it exists) to where the successor was.  So 37 becomes the left child of 40.

===== Node deletion =====
In general, remember that a node's left subtree's right-most node is the closest node on the left, 
and the right subtree's left-most node is the closest node on the right, and either one of these
can be chosen to replace the deleted node. The only complication is when the replacing node (i.e., the successor)
has a child subtree on the same side as the successor's side of the deleted node; in that case, 
the easiest thing to do is to always move the same-side subtree of the successor into the position vacated by the successor (i.e., the child of the successor's parent) even if the subtree is empty.

=== red-black trees ===
A red black tree is a self-balancing tree structure that uses a color attribute , and can be modelled as 2-3-4 tree , which is a sub-class of B tree (below). A black node with one red node can be seen as linked together as a 3-node , and a black node with 2 red child nodes can be seen as a 4-node.

4-nodes are '''split''' , producing a two node, and the middle node made red, which turns a parent of the middle node which has no red child from a 2-node to a 3-node, and turns a parent with one red child into a 4-node (but this doesn't occur with always left red nodes). 

A in-line arrangement of two red nodes, is '''rotated''' into a parent with two red children, a 4-node, which is later '''split''', as described before. 

       A  &lt;small&gt;right rotate&lt;/small&gt;            &lt;small&gt;'split 4-node'&lt;/small&gt;   |&lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt; / \    --&gt;        B           ---&gt;    B
     B               &lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt;/ \&lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt;               / \
 &lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt; / \               C   A               C   A
   C   D                 /                   /
                        D                   D

An optimization mentioned by Sedgewick is that all right inserted red nodes are left rotated to become left red nodes, so that only inline left red nodes ever have to be rotated right before splitting. AA-trees (above) by Arne Anderson , described in a paper in 1993 , seem an earlier exposition of the simplification, however he suggested right-leaning 'red marking' instead of left leaning , as suggested by Sedgewick, but AA trees seem to have precedence over left leaning red black trees. It would be quite a shock if the Linux CFS scheduler was described in the future as 'AA based'.

In summary, red-black trees are a way of detecting two insertions into the same side, and levelling out the tree before things get worse . Two left sided insertions will be rotated, and the two right sided insertions, would look like two left sided insertions after left rotation to remove right leaning red nodes. 
Two balanced insertions for the same parent could result in a 4-node split without rotation, so the question arises as to whether a red black tree could be attacked with serial insertions of one sided triads of a &lt; P &lt; b , and then the next triad's P' &lt; a. 

Python illustrative code follows

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
RED = 1
BLACK = 0
class Node:
  def __init__(self, k, v):
   # all newly inserted node's are RED 
   self.color = RED

   self.right = None

class RBTree:

    self.root = self._insert(self.root, k,v)

  def _insert(self,  n , k, v):
	if n is None:

	if k &lt; n.k :

        elif k &gt; n.k :
		n.right = self._insert(n.right, k, v)
                if n.right.color is RED:
			#always on the left red's
			#left rotate
			tmp = n.right
			n.right = tmp.left
			tmp.left = n
			n = tmp

                        #color rotation is actually a swap
			tmpcolor = n.color
			n.color = n.left.color
			n.left.color = tmpcolor
			
	if n.left &lt;&gt; None and n.left.left &lt;&gt; None and n.left.left.color == RED and n.left.color == RED:
		# right rotate in-line reds
		print &quot;right rotate&quot;

		n.right.color = tmpcolor

		if n.left &lt;&gt; None: print n.left.color, n.color, n.right.color

	# no need to test, because after right rotation, will need to split 3-node , as right rotation has brought red left grandchild to
        #become left red child, and left red child is now red right child
        #so there are two red children.

        #if n.left &lt;&gt; None and n.right &lt;&gt; None and n.left.color == RED and n.right.color == RED:

=== B Trees ===
===== Executive Summary =====
* Whereas binary trees have nodes that have two children, with the left child and all of its descendants less than the &quot;value&quot; of the node, and the right child and all of its children more than the &quot;value&quot; of the node, a B-tree is a generalization of this.
* The generalization is that instead of one value, the node has a list of values, and the list is of size n ( n &gt; 2 ). n is chosen to optimize storage , so that a node corresponds in size to a block for instance. This is in the days before ssd drives, but searching binary nodes stored on ssd ram would still be slower than searching ssd ram for a block of values, loading into normal ram and cpu cache, and searching the loaded list.
* At the start of the list, the left child of the first element of the list has a value less than the first element , and so do all its children. To the right of the first element, is a child which has values more than the first element's value, as do all of its children, but also less than the value of the second element. Induction can be used , and this holds so for the child between element 1 and 2, 2 and 3, ... so on until n-1 and nth node.
* To insert into a non-full B tree node, is to do a insertion into a sorted list. 
* In a B+ tree, insertions can only be done in leaf nodes, and non-leaf nodes hold copies of a demarcating value between adjacent child nodes e.g. the left most value of an element's right child's list of nodes.
* Whenever a list becomes full e.g. there are n nodes, the node is &quot;split&quot;, and this means making two new nodes, and passing the demarcating value upto the parent. (written by armchair wa-r who has never implemented a database. :P beat you to it).

B Trees were described originally as generalizations of binary search trees , where a binary tree is a 2-node B-Tree, the 2 standing for two children, with 2-1 = 1 key separating the 2 children. Hence a 3-node has 2 values separating 3 children, and a N node has N children separated by N-1 keys. 

A classical B-Tree can have N-node internal nodes, and empty 2-nodes as leaf nodes, or more conveniently,
the children can either be a value or a pointer to the next N-node, so it is a union. 

The main idea with B-trees is that one starts with a root N-node , which is able to hold N-1 entries,
but on the Nth entry, the number of keys for the node is exhausted, and the node can be split into two
half sized N/2 sized N nodes, separated by a single key K, which is equal to the right node's leftmost key,
so any entry with key K2 equal or greater than K goes in the right node, and anything less than K goes in the left. When the root node is split, a new root node is created with one key, and a left child and a right child. Since there are N children but only N-1 entries, the leftmost child is stored as a separate pointer.
If the leftmost pointer splits, then the left half becomes the new leftmost pointer, and the right half and separating key is inserted into the front of the entries.

An alternative is the B+ tree which is the most commonly used in database systems, because only values are stored in leaf nodes, whereas internal nodes only store keys and pointers to other nodes, putting a limit
on the size of the datum value as the size of a pointer. This often allows internal nodes with more entries able to fit a certain block size, e.g. 4K is a common physical disc block size. Hence , if a B+ tree internal node is aligned to a physical disc block, then the main rate limiting factor of reading a block of  a large index from disc because it isn't cached in a memory list of blocks is reduced to one block read.

A B+ tree has bigger internal nodes, so is more wider and shorter in theory than an equivalent B tree which
must fit all nodes within a given physical block size, hence overall it is a faster index due to greater fan out and less height to reach keys on average.

Apparently, this fan out is so important, compression can also be applied to the blocks to increase the number of entries fitting within a given underlying layer's block
size (the underlying layer is often a filesystem block).

Most database systems use the B+ tree algorithm, including postgresql, mysql, derbydb, firebird, many Xbase index types, etc.

Many filesystems also use a B+ tree to manage their block layout (e.g. xfs, NTFS, etc).

Transwiki has a java implementation of a B+ Tree which uses traditional arrays as key list and value list. 

Below is an example of a B Tree with test driver, and a B+  tree with a test driver. The memory / disc management is not included, but a usable hacked example can be found 
at [[/Hashing Memory Checking Example/]].

This B+ tree implementation  was written out of the B Tree , and the difference from the transwiki B+ tree is that it tries to use the semantics of SortedMap and SortedSet already present in the standard Java collections library. 

Hence , the flat leaf block list of this B+ implementation can't contain blocks that don't contain any data, because the ordering depends on the first key of the entries, so a leaf block needs to be created with its first entry.

==== A B+ tree java example ====

Experiments include timing the run ( e.g. time java -cp . btreemap.BPlusTreeTest1 ) , using an external blocksize + 1 sized leaf block size, so that
this is basically the underlying entries TreeMap only , vs , say,  400 internal node size, and 200 external node size .
Other experiments include using a SkipListMap instead of a TreeMap.

A '''hash table''', or a '''hash map''', is a data structure that associates ''keys'' with ''values''. The primary operation it supports efficiently is a ''lookup'': given a key (e.g. a person's name), find the corresponding value (e.g. that person's telephone number). It works by transforming the key using a [[w:hash function|hash function]] into a ''hash'', a number that the hash table uses to locate the desired value.

[[Image:HASHTB08.svg|thumb|362px|right|A small phone book as a hash table.]]

=== Time complexity and common uses of hash tables ===
Hash tables are often used to implement [[w:associative array|associative array]]s, [[w:Set (computer science)|sets]] and [[w:cache|cache]]s. Like [[w:array|array]]s, hash tables provide constant-time [[w:Big-O notation|O(1)]] lookup on average, regardless of the number of items in the table. However, the rare worst-case lookup time can be as bad as O(''n''). Compared to other associative array data structures, hash tables are most useful when large numbers of records of data are to be stored.

Hash tables may be used as in-memory data structures. Hash tables may also be adopted for use with [[w:persistent data structure|persistent data structure]]s; database indexes commonly use disk-based data structures based on hash tables.

Hash tables are used to speed-up string searching in many implementations of [[Data Compression/Dictionary compression#hash tables|data compression]].

In [[w:computer chess|computer chess]], a hash table is generally used to implement the [[w:transposition table|transposition table]].

=== Choosing a good hash function ===
A good hash function is essential for good hash table performance. A poor choice of hash function is likely to lead to ''clustering'', in which probability of keys mapping to the same hash bucket (i.e. a ''collision'') is significantly greater than would be expected from a random function. Nonzero probability of collisions is inevitable in any hash implementation, but usually the number of operations to resolve collisions scales linearly with the number of keys mapping to the same bucket, so excess collisions will degrade performance significantly. In addition, some hash functions are computationally expensive, so the amount of time (and, in some cases, memory) taken to compute the hash may be burdensome.

Choosing a good hash function is tricky. The literature is replete with poor choices, at least when measured by modern standards. For example, the very popular multiplicative hash advocated by Knuth in The Art of Computer Programming (see reference below) has particularly poor clustering behavior. However, since poor hashing merely degrades hash table performance for particular input key distributions, such problems commonly go undetected.

The literature is similarly sparse on the criteria for choosing a hash function. Unlike most other fundamental algorithms and data structures, there is no universal consensus on what makes a &quot;good&quot; hash function. The remainder of this section is organized by three criteria: simplicity, speed, and strength, and will survey algorithms known to perform well by these criteria.

Simplicity and speed are readily measured objectively (by number of lines of code and CPU benchmarks, for example), but strength is a more slippery concept. Obviously, a [[w:Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash function]] such as SHA-1 would satisfy the relatively lax strength requirements needed for hash tables, but their slowness and complexity makes them unappealing. In fact, even a cryptographic hash does not provide protection against an adversary who wishes to degrade hash table performance by choosing keys all hashing to the same bucket. For these specialized cases, a [[universal hash function]] should be used instead of any one static hash, no matter how sophisticated.

In the absence of a standard measure for hash function strength, the current state of the art is to employ a battery of [[Statistics|statistical]] tests to measure whether the hash function can be readily distinguished from a random function. Arguably the most important such test is to determine whether the hash function displays the [[avalanche effect]], which essentially states that any single-bit change in the input key should affect on average half the bits in the output. Bret Mulvey advocates testing the ''strict avalanche condition'' in particular, which states that, for any single-bit change, each of the output bits should change with probability one-half, independent of the other bits in the key. Purely additive hash functions such as [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] fail this stronger condition miserably.

Clearly, a strong hash function should have a [[uniform distribution]] of hash values. Bret Mulvey proposes the use of a chi-squared test for uniformity, based on [[power of two]] hash table sizes ranging from 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;. This test is considerably more sensitive than many others proposed for measuring hash functions, and finds problems in many popular hash functions.

Fortunately, there are good hash functions that satisfy all these criteria. The simplest class all consume one byte of the input key per iteration of the inner loop. Within this class, simplicity and speed are closely related, as fast algorithms simply don't have time to perform complex calculations. Of these, one that performs particularly well is the Jenkins One-at-a-time hash, adapted here from [http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html an article by Bob Jenkins], its creator.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  uint32 joaat_hash(uchar *key, size_t len)
  {
    uint32 hash = 0;
    size_t i;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
    {
        hash += key[i];
        hash += (hash &lt;&lt; 10);
        hash ^= (hash &gt;&gt; 6);
    }
    hash += (hash &lt;&lt; 3);
    hash ^= (hash &gt;&gt; 11);
    hash += (hash &lt;&lt; 15);
    return hash;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:JenkinsOneAtATime-3.svg|thumb|255px|right|Avalanche behavior of Jenkins One-at-a-time hash over 3-byte keys]]

The avalanche behavior of this hash shown on the right. The image was made using Bret Mulvey's AvalancheTest in his [http://bretm.home.comcast.net/hash/11.html Hash.cs toolset]. Each row corresponds to a single bit in the input, and each column to a bit in the output. A green square indicates good mixing behavior, a yellow square weak mixing behavior, and red would indicate no mixing. Only a few bits in the last byte are weakly mixed, a performance vastly better than a number of widely used hash functions.

Many commonly used hash functions perform poorly when subjected to such rigorous avalanche testing. The widely favored [[Fowler Noll Vo hash|FNV]] hash, for example, shows many bits with no mixing at all, especially for short keys. See the [http://bretm.home.comcast.net/hash/6.html evaluation of FNV] by Bret Mulvey for a more thorough analysis.

If speed is more important than simplicity, then the class of hash functions which consume multibyte chunks per iteration may be of interest. One of the most sophisticated is &quot;lookup3&quot; by Bob Jenkins, which consumes input in 12 byte (96 bit) chunks. Note, though, that any speed improvement from the use of this hash is only likely to be useful for large keys, and that the increased complexity may also have speed consequences such as preventing an optimizing compiler from inlining the hash function. Bret Mulvey analyzed an [http://bretm.home.comcast.net/hash/7.html earlier version, lookup2], and found it to have excellent avalanche behavior.

One desirable property of a hash function is that conversion from the hash value (typically 32 bits) to an bucket index for a particular-size hash table can be done simply by masking, preserving only the lower k bits for a table of size 2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; (an operation equivalent to computing the hash value [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] the table size). This property enables the technique of incremental doubling of the size of the hash table - each bucket in the old table maps to only two in the new table. Because of its use of XOR-folding, the FNV hash does not have this property. Some older hashes are even worse, requiring table sizes to be a prime number rather than a power of two, again computing the bucket index as the hash value modulo the table size. In general, such a requirement is a sign of a fundamentally weak function; using a prime table size is a poor substitute for using a stronger function.

=== Collision resolution ===
If two keys hash to the same index, the corresponding records cannot be stored in the same location. So, if it's already occupied, we must find another location to store the new record, and do it so that we can find it when we look it up later on.

To give an idea of the importance of a good collision resolution strategy, consider the following result, derived using the [[w:Birthday_paradox#Generalization|birthday paradox]]. Even if we assume that our hash function outputs random indices [[w:Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly distributed]] over the array, and even for an array with 1 million entries, there is a 95% chance of at least one collision occurring before it contains 2500 records.

There are a number of collision resolution techniques, but the most popular are ''chaining'' and ''open addressing''.

==== Chaining ====

[[Image:HASHTB32.svg|thumb|362px|right|Hash collision resolved by chaining.]]

In the simplest chained hash table technique, each slot in the array references a [[linked list]] of inserted records that collide to the same slot. Insertion requires finding the correct slot, and appending to either end of the list in that slot; deletion requires searching the list and removal.

Chained hash tables have advantages over open addressed hash tables in that the removal operation is simple and resizing the table can be postponed for a much longer time because performance [[w:graceful degradation|degrades more gracefully]] even when every slot is used. Indeed, many chaining hash tables may not require resizing at all since performance degradation is linear as the table fills. For example, a chaining hash table containing twice its recommended capacity of data would only be about twice as slow on average as the same table at its recommended capacity.

Chained hash tables inherit the disadvantages of linked lists. When storing small records, the overhead of the linked list can be significant. An additional disadvantage is that traversing a linked list has poor [[w:Locality of reference|cache performance]].

Alternative data structures can be used for chains instead of linked lists. By using a [[w:Self-balancing binary search tree|self-balancing tree]], for example, the theoretical worst-case time of a hash table can be brought down to O(log ''n'') rather than O(''n''). However, since each list is intended to be short, this approach is usually inefficient unless the hash table is designed to run at full capacity or there are unusually high collision rates, as might occur in input designed to cause collisions. [[Dynamic array]]s can also be used to decrease space overhead and improve cache performance when records are small.

Some chaining implementations use an optimization where the first record of each chain is stored in the table. Although this can increase performance, it is generally not recommended: chaining tables with reasonable load factors contain a large proportion of empty slots, and the larger slot size causes them to waste large amounts of space.

==== Open addressing ====
[[Image:HASHTB12.svg|thumb|362px|right|Hash collision resolved by linear probing (interval=1).]]
Open addressing hash tables can store the records directly within the array. A hash collision is resolved by ''probing'', or searching through alternate locations in the array (the ''probe sequence'') until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table. Well known probe sequences include:

; [[linear probing]] : in which the interval between probes is fixed—often at 1,
; [[quadratic probing]] : in which the interval between probes increases linearly (hence, the indices are described by a quadratic function), and
; [[double hashing]] : in which the interval between probes is fixed for each record but is computed by another hash function.

The main tradeoffs between these methods are that linear probing has the best cache performance but is most sensitive to clustering, while double hashing has poor cache performance but exhibits virtually no clustering; quadratic hashing falls in-between in both areas. Double hashing can also require more computation than other forms of probing.  Some open addressing methods, such as
[[last-come-first-served hashing]] and [[cuckoo hashing]] move existing keys around in the array to make room for the new key. This gives better maximum search times than the methods based on probing.

A critical influence on performance of an open addressing hash table is the ''load factor''; that is, the proportion of the slots in the array that are used. As the load factor increases towards 100%, the number of probes that may be required to find or insert a given key rises dramatically. Once the table becomes full, probing algorithms may even fail to terminate. Even with good hash functions, load factors are normally limited to 80%. A poor hash function can exhibit poor performance even at very low load factors by generating significant clustering. What causes hash functions to cluster is not well understood, and it is easy to unintentionally write a hash function which causes severe clustering. 

===== Example pseudocode =====

The following [[w:pseudocode|pseudocode]] is an implementation of an open addressing hash table with linear probing and single-slot stepping, a common approach that is effective if the hash function is good. Each of the '''lookup''', '''set''' and '''remove''' functions use a common internal function '''findSlot''' to locate the array slot that either does or should contain a given key.

  '''record''' pair { key, value }
  '''var''' ''pair array'' slot[0..numSlots-1]
  
  '''function''' findSlot(key)
      i := hash(key) modulus numSlots
      '''loop'''
          '''if''' slot[i] is not occupied '''or''' slot[i].key = key
              '''return''' i
          i := (i + 1) modulus numSlots
  
  '''function''' lookup(key)
      i := findSlot(key)
      '''if''' slot[i] is occupied   ''// key is in table''
          '''return''' slot[i].value
      '''else'''                     ''// key is not in table''
          '''return''' not found     
  
  '''function''' set(key, value)
      i := findSlot(key)
      '''if''' slot[i] is occupied
          slot[i].value := value
      '''else'''
          '''if''' the table is almost full
              rebuild the table larger ''(note 1)''
              i := findSlot(key)
          slot[i].key   := key
          slot[i].value := value

Another example showing open addressing technique. Presented function is converting each part(4) of an Internet protocol address, where NOT is bitwise NOT, XOR is bitwise XOR, OR is bitwise OR, AND is bitwise AND and &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are shift-left and shift-right:

  ''// key_1,key_2,key_3,key_4 are following 3-digit numbers - parts of ip address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx''
  '''function''' ip(key parts)
      j := 1
      '''do'''
          key := (key_2 &lt;&lt; 2)
          key := (key + (key_3 &lt;&lt; 7))
          key := key + (j OR key_4 &gt;&gt; 2) * (key_4) * (j + key_1) XOR j
          key := key AND _prime_	''// _prime_ is a prime number''
          j := (j+1) 
      '''while''' collision
      '''return''' key

; note 1 : Rebuilding the table requires allocating a larger array and recursively using the '''set''' operation to insert all the elements of the old array into the new larger array. It is common to increase the array size [[exponential growth|exponentially]], for example by doubling the old array size.

  '''function''' remove(key)
      i := findSlot(key)
      '''if''' slot[i] is unoccupied
          return   ''// key is not in the table''
      j := i
      '''loop'''
          j := (j+1) modulus numSlots
          '''if''' slot[j] is unoccupied
              '''exit loop'''
          k := hash(slot[j].key) modulus numSlots
          '''if''' (j &gt; i '''and''' (k &lt;= i '''or''' k &gt; j)) '''or'''
             (j &lt; i '''and''' (k &lt;= i '''and''' k &gt; j)) ''(note 2)''
              slot[i] := slot[j]
              i := j
      mark slot[i] as unoccupied

; note 2 : For all records in a cluster, there must be no vacant slots between their natural hash position and their current position (else lookups will terminate before finding the record). At this point in the pseudocode, ''i'' is a vacant slot that might be invalidating this property for subsequent records in the cluster. ''j'' is such as subsequent record. ''k'' is the raw hash where the record at ''j'' would naturally land in the hash table if there were no collisions. This test is asking if the record at ''j'' is invalidly positioned with respect to the required properties of a cluster now that ''i'' is vacant.

Another technique for removal is simply to mark the slot as deleted. However this eventually requires rebuilding the table simply to remove deleted records. The methods above provide O(1) updating and removal of existing records, with occasional rebuilding if the high water mark of the table size grows.

The O(1) remove method above is only possible in linearly probed hash tables with single-slot stepping.  In the case where many records are to be deleted in one operation, marking the slots for deletion and later rebuilding may be more efficient.

==== Open addressing versus chaining ====
Chained hash tables have the following benefits over open addressing:
* They are simple to implement effectively and only require basic data structures.
* From the point of view of writing suitable hash functions, chained hash tables are insensitive to clustering, only requiring minimization of collisions. Open addressing depends upon better hash functions to avoid clustering. This is particularly important if novice programmers can add their own hash functions, but even experienced programmers can be caught out by unexpected clustering effects.
* They degrade in performance more gracefully. Although chains grow longer as the table fills, a chained hash table cannot &quot;fill up&quot; and does not exhibit the sudden increases in lookup times that occur in a near-full table with open addressing. (''see right'')
* If the hash table stores large records, about 5 or more words per record, chaining uses less memory than open addressing.
* If the hash table is sparse (that is, it has a big array with many free array slots), chaining uses less memory than open addressing even for small records of 2 to 4 words per record due to its external storage.

[[Image:Hash table average insertion time.png|thumb|right|362px|This graph compares the average number of cache misses required to lookup elements in tables with chaining and linear probing. As the table passes the 80%-full mark, linear probing's performance drastically degrades.]]

For small record sizes (a few words or less) the benefits of in-place open addressing compared to chaining are:
* They can be more space-efficient than chaining since they don't need to store any pointers or allocate any additional space outside the hash table. Simple linked lists require a word of overhead per element.
* Insertions avoid the time overhead of memory allocation, and can even be implemented in the absence of a memory allocator.
* Because it uses internal storage, open addressing avoids the extra indirection required for chaining's external storage. It also has better [[w:locality of reference|locality of reference]], particularly with linear probing. With small record sizes, these factors can yield better performance than chaining, particularly for lookups.
* They can be easier to [[w:serialization|serialize]], because they don't use pointers.

On the other hand, normal open addressing is a poor choice for large elements, since these elements fill entire cache lines (negating the cache advantage), and a large amount of space is wasted on large empty table slots. If the open addressing table only stores references to elements (external storage), it uses space comparable to chaining even for large records but loses its speed advantage.

Generally speaking, open addressing is better used for hash tables with small records that can be stored within the table (internal storage) and fit in a cache line. They are particularly suitable for elements of one word or less. In cases where the tables are expected to have high load factors, the records are large, or the data is variable-sized, chained hash tables often perform as well or better.

Ultimately, used sensibly any kind of hash table algorithm is usually fast ''enough''; and the percentage of a calculation spent in hash table code is low. Memory usage is rarely considered excessive. Therefore, in most cases the differences between these algorithms is marginal, and other considerations typically come into play.

==== Coalesced hashing ====
{{main|Coalesced hashing}}

A hybrid of chaining and open addressing, coalesced hashing links together chains of nodes within the table itself. Like open addressing, it achieves space usage and (somewhat diminished) cache advantages over chaining. Like chaining, it does not exhibit clustering effects; in fact, the table can be efficiently filled to a high density. Unlike chaining, it cannot have more elements than table slots.

==== Perfect hashing ====
{{main|Perfect hashing}}

If all of the keys that will be used are known ahead of time, and there are no more keys that can fit the hash table, [[perfect hashing]] can be used to create a perfect hash table, in which there will be no collisions. If [[minimal perfect hashing]] is used, every location in the hash table can be used as well.

Perfect hashing gives a hash table where the time to make a lookup is constant in the worst case. This is in contrast to chaining and open addressing methods, where the time for lookup is low on average, but may be arbitrarily large. There exist methods for maintaining a perfect hash function under insertions of keys, known as [[dynamic perfect hashing]]. A simpler alternative, that also gives worst case constant lookup time, is [[cuckoo hashing]].

==== Probabilistic hashing ====
Perhaps the simplest solution to a collision is to replace the value that is already in the slot with the new value, or slightly less commonly, drop the record that is to be inserted. In later searches, this may result in a search not finding a record which has been inserted. This technique is particularly useful for implementing caching.

An even more space-efficient solution which is similar to this is use a [[w:bit array|bit array]] (an array of one-bit fields) for our table. Initially all bits are set to zero, and when we insert a key, we set the corresponding bit to one. False negatives cannot occur, but [[false positives]] can, since if the search finds a 1 bit, it will claim that the value was found, even if it was just another value that hashed into the same array slot by coincidence. In reality, such a hash table is merely a specific type of [[w:Bloom filter|Bloom filter]].

=== Table resizing ===

With a good hash function, a hash table can typically contain about 70%&amp;ndash;80% as many elements as it does table slots and still perform well. Depending on the collision resolution mechanism, performance can begin to suffer either gradually or dramatically as more elements are added. To deal with this, when the load factor exceeds some threshold, we allocate a new, larger table, and add all the contents of the original table to this new table. In [[Java programming language|Java]]'s HashMap class, for example, the default load factor threshold is 0.75.

This can be a very expensive operation, and the necessity for it is one of the hash table's disadvantages. In fact, some naive methods for doing this, such as enlarging the table by one each time you add a new element, reduce performance so drastically as to make the hash table useless. However, if we enlarge the table by some fixed percent, such as 10% or 100%, it can be shown using [[amortized analysis]] that these resizings are so infrequent that the average time per lookup remains constant-time. To see why this is true, suppose a hash table using chaining begins at the minimum size of 1 and is doubled each time it fills above 100%. If in the end it contains ''n'' elements, then the total add operations performed for all the resizings is:

:1 + 2 + 4 + ... + ''n'' = 2''n'' - 1.

Because the costs of the resizings form a [[geometric series]], the total cost is O(''n''). But we also perform ''n'' operations to add the ''n'' elements in the first place, so the total time to add ''n'' elements with resizing is O(''n''), an amortized time of O(1) per element.

On the other hand, some hash table implementations, notably in [[real-time system]]s, cannot pay the price of enlarging the hash table all at once, because it may interrupt time-critical operations. One simple approach is to initially allocate the table with enough space for the expected number of elements and forbid the addition of too many elements. Another useful but more memory-intensive technique is to perform the resizing gradually:
* Allocate the new hash table, but leave the old hash table and check both tables during lookups.
* Each time an insertion is performed, add that element to the new table and also move ''k'' elements from the old table to the new table.
* When all elements are removed from the old table, deallocate it.
To ensure that the old table will be completely copied over before the new table itself needs to be enlarged, it's necessary to increase the size of the table by a factor of at least (''k'' + 1)/''k'' during the resizing.

[[Linear hashing]] is a hash table algorithm that permits incremental hash table expansion.  It is implemented using a single hash table, but with two possible look-up functions.

Another way to decrease the cost of table resizing is to choose a hash function in such a way that the hashes of most values do not change when the table is resized. This approach, called [[consistent hashing]], is prevalent in disk-based and distributed hashes, where resizing is prohibitively costly.

=== Ordered retrieval issue ===
Hash tables store data in pseudo-random locations, so accessing the data in a sorted manner is a very time consuming operation. Other data structures such as [[self-balancing binary search tree]]s generally operate more slowly (since their lookup time is O(log ''n'')) and are rather more complex to implement than hash tables but maintain a sorted data structure at all times. See [[Associative_array#Efficient_representations|a comparison of hash tables and self-balancing binary search trees]].

=== Problems with hash tables ===
Although hash table lookups use constant time on average, the time spent can be significant. Evaluating a good hash function can be a slow operation. In particular, if simple array indexing can be used instead, this is usually faster.

Hash tables in general exhibit poor [[locality of reference]]&amp;mdash;that is, the data to be accessed is distributed seemingly at random in memory. Because hash tables cause access patterns that jump around, this can trigger [[CPU cache|microprocessor cache]] misses that cause long delays. Compact data structures such as arrays, searched with [[linear search]], may be faster if the table is relatively small and keys are cheap to compare, such as with simple integer keys. According to [[Moore's Law]], cache sizes are growing exponentially and so what is considered &quot;small&quot; may be increasing. The optimal performance point varies from system to system; for example, a trial on [[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]] shows that its hash tables outperform linear search in all but the most trivial cases (one to three entries).

More significantly, hash tables are more difficult and error-prone to write and use. Hash tables require the design of an effective hash function for each key type, which in many situations is more difficult and time-consuming to design and debug than the mere comparison function required for a [[self-balancing binary search tree]]. In open-addressed hash tables it's even easier to create a poor hash function.

Additionally, in some applications, a [[black hat]] with knowledge of the hash function may be able to supply information to a hash which creates worst-case behavior by causing excessive collisions, resulting in very poor performance (i.e., a [[denial of service attack]]). In critical applications, either [[universal hashing]] can be used or a data structure with better worst-case guarantees may be preferable. For details, see Crosby and Wallach's ''[http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf Denial of Service via Algorithmic Complexity Attacks]''.

=== Other hash table algorithms ===
'''Extendible hashing''' and '''linear hashing''' are hash algorithms that are used in the context of database algorithms used for instance in index file structures, and even primary file organization for a database. Generally, in order to make search scalable for large databases, the search time should be proportional log N or near constant, where N is the number of records to search. Log N searches can be implemented with tree structures, because the degree of fan out and the shortness of the tree relates to the number of steps needed to find a record, so the height of the tree is the maximum number of disc accesses it takes to find where a record is.
However, hash tables are also used, because the cost of a disk access can be counted in units of disc accesses, and often that unit is a block of data. Since a hash table can, in the best case, find a key with one or two accesses, a hash table index is regarded as generally faster when retrieving a collection of records during a join operation e.g. 
 SELECT * from customer, orders where customer.cust_id = orders.cust_id and cust_id = X
i.e. If orders has a hash index on cust_id, then it takes constant time to locate the block that contains record locations for orders matching cust_id = X. (although, it would be better if the value type of orders was a list of order ids, so that hash keys are just one unique cust_id for each batch of orders, to avoid unnecessary collisions). 

Extendible hashing and linear hashing have certain similarities: collisions are accepted as inevitable and are part of the algorithm where blocks or buckets of collision space is added ; traditional good hash function ranges are required, but the hash value is transformed by a dynamic address function : in '''extendible hashing''',
a bit mask is used to mask out unwanted bits, but this mask length increases by one periodically, doubling the
available addressing space ; also in extendible hashing, there is an indirection with a directory address space, the directory entries being paired with another address (a pointer ) to the actual block containing the key-value pairs; the entries in the directory correspond to the bit masked hash value (so that the number of entries is equal to maximum bit mask value + 1 e.g. a bit mask of 2 bits, can address a directory of 00 01 10 11, or 3 + 1 = 4).  

In '''linear hashing''', the traditional hash value is also masked with a bit mask, but
if the resultant smaller hash value falls below a 'split' variable, the original hash value is masked with
a bit mask of one bit greater length, making the resultant hash value address recently added blocks. The split variable ranges incrementally between 0 and the maximum current bit mask value e.g. a bit mask of 2, or in the terminology of linear hashing, a &quot;level&quot; of 2, the split variable will range between 0 to 3. When the split variable reaches 4, the level increases by 1, so in the next round of the split variable, it will range between 0 to 7, and reset again when it reaches 8. 

The split variable incrementally allows increased addressing space, as new blocks are added; the decision to add a new block occurs whenever a key-and=value is being inserted, and overflows the particular block the key-and-value's key hashes into. This overflow location may be completely unrelated to the block going to be split pointed to by the split variable. However, over time, it is expected that given a good random hash function that distributes entries fairly evenly amongst all addressable blocks,
the blocks that actually require splitting because they have overflowed get their turn in round-robin fashion as the split value ranges between 0 - N where N has a factor of 2 to the power of Level, level being the variable incremented whenever the split variable hits N. 

New blocks are added one at a time with both extendible hashing, and with linear hashing.
 
In '''extendible hashing''',  a block overflow ( a new key-value colliding with B other key-values, where B is the size of a block) is handled by checking the size of the bit mask &quot;locally&quot;, called the &quot;local depth&quot;, an attribute which must be stored with the block. The directory structure, also has a depth, the &quot;global depth&quot;. If the local depth is less than the global depth, then the local depth is incremented, and all the key values are rehashed and passed through a bit mask which is one bit longer now, placing them either in the current block, or in another block. 
If the other block happens to be the same block when looked up in the directory, a new block is added, and the directory entry for the other block is made to point to the new block. Why does the directory have entries where two entries point to the same block ? This is because if the local depth '''is equal to'''  the global depth of the directory, this means the bit mask of the directory does not have enough bits to deal with an increment in the bit mask length of the block, and so the directory must have its bit mask length incremented, but this means the directory now doubles the number of addressable entries. Since half the entries addressable don't exist, the directory simply copies the pointers over to the new entries e.g. if the directory had entries for 00, 01, 10, 11, or a 2 bit mask, and it becomes a 3 bit mask, then 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 become the new entries, and  00's block address go to 000 and 001 ; 01's pointer goes to 010 and 011, 10 goes to 100 and 101 and so on.  And so this creates the situation where two directory entries point to the same block. Although the block that was going to overflow, now can add a new block by redirecting the second pointer to a newly appended block, the other original blocks will have two pointers to them. When it is their turn to split, the algorithm will check local vs global depth and this time find that the local depth is less, and hence no directory splitting is required, only a new block be appended, and the second directory pointer moved from addressing the previous block to addressing the new block.

In '''linear hashing''', adding a similarly hashed block does not occurs  immediately when a block overflows, and therefore an overflow block is created to be attached to the overflowing block. However, a block overflow is a signal that more space will be required, and this happens by splitting the block pointed to by the &quot;split&quot; variable, which is initially zero, and hence initially points to block zero. The splitting is done by taking all the key-value pairs in the
splitting block, and its overflow block(s), hashing the keys again, but with a bit mask of length current level + 1. This will result in
two block addresses, some will be the old block number, and others will be
 a2 = old block number + ( N times 2 ^ (level) )

;Rationale
Let m  = N times 2 ^ level ; if h is the original hash value, and old block number = h mod m, and now the new block number is h mod ( m * 2 ), because m * 2 = N times 2 ^ (level+1), then the new block number is either h mod m if (h / m) is even so dividing h/m by 2 leaves a zero remainder and therefore doesn't change the remainder, or the new block number is ( h mod m )  + m because h / m is an odd number, and dividing h / m by 2 will leave an excess remainder of m, + the original remainder. ( The same rationale applies to extendible hashing depth incrementing ).

As above, a new block is created with a number a2, which will usually occur at +1 the previous a2 value. 
Once this is done, the split variable is incremented, so that the next a2 value will be again old a2 + 1. In this way, each block is covered by the split variable eventually, so each block is preemptively rehashed into extra space, and new blocks are added incrementally. Overflow blocks that are no longer needed are discarded, for later garbage collection if needed, or put on an available free block list by chaining.  

When the split variable reaches ( N times 2 ^ level ), level is incremented and split variable is reset to zero. 
In this next round, the split variable will now traverse from zero to ( N times 2 ^ (old_level + 1 ) ), 
which is exactly the number of blocks at the start of the previous round, but including all the blocks created by the previous round.

==== A simple inference on file storage mapping of linear hashing and extendible hashing ====
As can be seen, extendible hashing requires space to store a directory which can double in size. 

Since the space of both algorithms increase by one block at a time, if blocks have a known maximum size or fixed size, then it is straight forward to map the blocks as blocks sequentially appended to a file. 

In extendible hashing, it would  be logical to store the directory as a separate file, as doubling can be accommodated by adding to the end of the directory file. The separate block file would not have to change, other than have blocks appended to its end. 

Header information for linear hashing doesn't increase in size :  basically just the values for 
N, level, and split need to be recorded, so these can be incorporated as a header into a fixed block size linear hash storage file.
 
However, linear hashing requires space for overflow blocks, and this might best be stored in another file,
otherwise addressing blocks in the linear hash file is not as straight forward as multiplying the block number by the block size and adding the space for N,level, and split. 

 
In the next section, a complete example of linear hashing in Java is given, using a in memory implementation of linear hashing, and code to manage blocks as files in a file directory, the whole contents of the file directory representing the persistent linear hashing structure.

=== Implementations ===
While many programming languages already provide hash table functionality (see ''[[Associative array#Language support|language support for associative arrays]]''), there are several independent implementations worth mentioning.
* [http://goog-sparsehash.sourceforge.net/ Google Sparse Hash] The Google SparseHash project contains several hash-map implementations in use at Google, with different performance characteristics, including an implementation that optimizes for space and one that optimizes for speed. The memory-optimized one is extremely memory-efficient with only 2 bits/entry of overhead.
* [https://launchpad.net/libmct MCT] provides hashtables similar to Google's &lt;code&gt;dense_hash_map&lt;/code&gt;, but without restriction on contained values; it also comes with exception safety and support for C++0x features.
* A number of runtime languages and/or standard libraries use hash tables to implement their support for associative arrays because of their efficiency.

==== A python implementation of extendible hashing ====
The file - block management routines aren't there, so this could be added in to make this a real implementation of a database hash index.

A full page is split according to the (local depth)th bit, first by collecting all the directory indices pointing to the full page, updating the pointers according to
the d bit being 0 or 1 corresponding to first and second new pages, then reloading all the key-values after hashing each key and using the d bit of each hash to see which page to allocate to. The local depth of each new page is one greater than the old page's local depth, so that the next d bit can be used next time when splitting.

==== A Java implementation of linear hashing ====
( usable for simple database indexing of arbitrary size, (almost ?) )
 
This code evolved out of a need for a bigger Java HashMap. Originally, a Java HashMap standard object was used as a Map
to index a heap like database file ( DBF format). But then, a file was encountered with so many records that the OutOfMemoryError
was being thrown, so linear hashing seemed like a reasonably simple algorithm to use as a disk based index scheme. 

Initially, linear hashing was implemented behind the Java Map interface, mainly the put(k,v) and get(k,v) methods. Generics was used, in order
not to get too involved in the key and value details. 

====== debugging to achieve functionality ======
Custom dumps to System.err was used to verify that blocks were being created, filled, and overflow blocks were of expected number if they existed ( no. = 1 ).
This was all done in a purely in-memory implementation.

Later, the standard Java decoupling was introduced, where the original LHMap2 class accepted listeners to events, such as when a block was needed. The listener was then implemented as a block file manager, loading blocks into the block list of the memory LHMap2 object whenever a null block was encountered on the block list,
and checking whether virtual machine runtime free memory was low, and retiring blocks using just a basic first-to-last-listed cache removal algorithm
(not least recently used (LRU), not least often used ) by saving them to disk file, and then actively invoking the system garbage collector.

Because an application use case existed, which was to externally index a large DBF table, this use case was used as the main test harness for the algorithm implementation.

Each block is a file in this implementation, because blocks are variably sized here to account for generics and variable sized key and value pairs, and overflow blocks are conceptual, not actual as on disc storage, because the block's contents and that of its overflow bucket(s), are saved as a list of alternating keys and values in this implementation. Methods for saving and loading to Object streams was used in a standard java customized object persistence way by implementing the Externalizable interface
in the Block data class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

:関東弁 (''kantouben'') is generally regarded as standard Japanese. It seems to only differ, however, in slang used and some pronunciation. Nevertheless, it is a dialect in its own right, especially when compared to the other variations of Japanese, and will be treated here as such. It, as all other dialects discussed, will be compared with standard Japanese.

== Pronunciation ==
:There are few major differences in pronunciation. One worth noting appears in the [[Japanese:Hougen:Tokyo|Tokyo-ben]] section.

== Intonation ==
 (no sources found yet)

== grammar constructs ==
=== negative form ===
The negative form used in the Kanto region is the one used in standard. I list it here because it is different when compared to negative forms of other areas.
* ～ない is the negative imperfect tense verb ending, and
* ～なかった is the negative perfective tense verb ending.
  example: 行かない　（いかない） will not go

=== need to... ===
Because the construct of &quot;need to&quot; is just a combination of the negative form of a verb and another word, it is really just a matter of the difference in negative forms. However, as these constructs are often contracted, it is worth noting the differences. The standard &quot;need to&quot; form looks like the following:
* ～なくては　いけない/ならない/だめ/etc...
* ～なければ　いけない/ならない/だめ/etc...
and in Kanto they are contracted, respectively, as follows:
* ～なくちゃ　いけない/ならない/だめ/etc...
* ～なきゃ　いけない/ならない/だめ/etc...

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello,

I've got a degree in electronics and have been programming as a hobby on and off for a few years. I've been designing and building small robots are a hobby for the last few years.

I've been contributing to the [[Robotics]] Wikibook for about a half year now. Started the [[Theoretical_Mechanics]] wikibook to supplement the [[Robotics]] wikibook sence there wasn't a complete wikibook on this subject. I've also just started the [[Software_engineering]] Wikibook. The latter just started so doesn't contain much at the moment.

{{Japanese related|content|
* [[Japanese/Numbers]]}}
Counting the days of the month is really pretty simple — with a few exceptions. The first ten days generally follow the &quot;native Japanese&quot; counting stems. After the tenth of the month, all but the ''14th'', ''20th'' and ''24th'' follow the more basic Chinese-derived counting stems.

The first of the month is an exception, and simply must be memorized as such:
*１日　ついたち

The second through tenth of the month follow the same native Japanese counting stems as used when counting generic items ({{furi|一|ひと}}つ,　{{furi|二|ふた}}つ,　{{furi|三|みっ}}つ, {{furi|四|よっ}}つ) or people ({{furi|一|ひ}}{{furi|人|とり}}, {{furi|二|ふ}}{{furi|人|たり}}). The ending &quot;〜か&quot; is simply one of the readings for the character for &quot;日&quot;.
*２日　ふつか
*３日　みっか
*４日　よっか
*５日　いつか
*６日　むいか
*７日　なのか
*８日　ようか
*９日　ここのか
*１０日　とおか

The rest of the days of the month, generally follow the normal pattern using the counters &quot;いち&quot;, &quot;に&quot;, &quot;さん&quot;, etc., and the ending &quot;〜か&quot; is replaced with &quot;〜にち&quot;. The numbers 14 and 24 use &quot;〜よっか&quot;, not &quot;〜よんにち&quot; as one might assume from the pattern, and 20 uses &quot;はつか&quot;, not &quot;にじゅうにち&quot;.

== Periods of days ==

* &quot;前&quot; (まえ), which generally means &quot;before&quot; or &quot;in front of&quot;, is used to indicate an amount of time ago.
* &quot;〜間&quot; (かん) is used to indicate a length of time. It is usually dropped when unambiguous.

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | {{furi|３日|みっか}}{{furi|前|まえ}}に{{furi|東京|とうきょう}}に{{furi|来|き|ました}}。 || I came to Tokyo three days ago.
|-
| {{furi|冬休|ふゆやす|み}}は{{furi|１０日間|とおかかん}}です。 || Winter holidays are ten days long.
|}

When periods of time are expressed in terms of &quot;nights&quot;, the counter &quot;泊&quot; (はく) which means &quot;night&quot; or &quot;overnight&quot; in the context of staying somewhere, is affixed to the normal &quot;いち&quot;, &quot;に&quot;, &quot;さん&quot;, etc.

The same character is also used for the word &quot;泊まる&quot; (とまる) which means &quot;to stay&quot; or &quot;to stay over&quot;. As in English, this can be combined with &quot;days&quot;, which is then read as the days of the week (&quot;いっか&quot;, &quot;ふつか&quot;, &quot;みっか&quot;, &quot;よっか, etc.).

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | {{furi|旅館|りょかん}}に{{furi|２泊|にはく}}した。 || I stayed at a ryōkan (Japanese-style inn) for two nights.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often in [[Wikipedia:Physics|Physics]] or [[Wikipedia:Engineering|Engineering]] it is necessary to use a [[calculus]] operation known as [[Calculus/Differentiation|differentiation]].  Unlike textbook mathematics, the differentiated functions are data generated by an experiment or a computer code.


Begin with the [[Wikipedia:Taylor_series|Taylor series]] as seen in Equation 1.

&lt;math&gt; f(x+h) = f(x) + f^{'}(x)h + \frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!}h^{2}+\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!}h^{3}+ \cdots \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Next by cutting off the Taylor series after the fourth term and evaluating it at h and -h yields Equations (2) and (3).

&lt;math&gt; f(x+h) = f(x) + f^{'}(x)h + \frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!}h^{2} +\frac{f^{(3)}(c_{1})}{3!}h^{3} \quad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(x-h) = f(x) - f^{'}(x)h + \frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!}h^{2} - \frac{f^{(3)}(c_{2})}{3!}h^{3} \quad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

Then by subtracting Equation (2) by Equation (3) yields.

&lt;math&gt;f(x+h) - f(x-h) = 2f^{'}(x)h + \frac{f^{(3)}(c_{1})}{3!}h^{3} + \frac{f^{(3)}(c_{2})}{3!}h^{3}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Central Difference ===

&lt;math&gt;f^{'}(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h} + O(h^{2})&lt;/math&gt;

=== Forward Difference ===

&lt;math&gt;f^{'}(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} + O(h)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Backward Difference ===

&lt;math&gt;f^{'}(x) = \frac{f(x)-f(x-h)}{h} + O(h)&lt;/math&gt;

== Second Derivative ==

The second order derivatives can be obtained by adding equations (2) and (3) (if properly expanded to include the fourth-derivative-term):

&lt;math&gt;f^{''}(x) = \frac{f(x+h) - 2 f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2} + O(h^2)&lt;/math&gt;

== High Order Derivatives ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">This module is already a bit long, but here are some more things that might be worth covering. (Perhaps accompanied by splitting the chapter!)
*Duplex (full, half, simplex)
*Baud rate detection
*RJ-45 connectors
*Using a breakout box
*Note that RS-232 uses unbalanced circuits, so twisted pair cables aren't useful
**Baluns can be used to balance the circuits for longer distance transmission
**RS-422 is similar to RS-232, but has the advantage of balanced circuits

-----------

Note that RJ-45 connectors are not standardized in regard to RS-232 protocols.  There are some devices that use them, and there are enough wires with a Cat-5 line that makes it at least in theory possible to do RS-232 over Cat-5 with RJ-45 connectors, but it is not commonly done that way.  In fact, the only &quot;standard connector&quot; specified by RS-232 is the DB-25 connector.

== Discrepancies - Possible Errors ==

* According to the [[Wikipedia:D-subminiature|D-subminiature]] article, '''DE-9''' is the correct name of the 9 pin D-shell connector. Links are now added for the D-shell connectors, but each instance of [[Wikipedia:DB-9|DB-9]] should perhaps be replaced with [[Wikipedia:DE-9|DE-9]] (possibly with a note about this common misnomer using a reference to [[Wikipedia:DB-9]].)
* RS-232 signal levels are described more precisely in [[Wikipedia:RS-232#Voltage_levels]] than in this [[Serial_Programming:RS-232_Connections#Wiring_Pins_Explained]]. The signal levels are not always +15V and -15V. Consider replacing parts of this section with a reference to [[Wikipedia:RS-232]].
* The claim that the handshake signals use negative voltage to indicate &quot;Ready&quot; contradicts my experience. The [[Wikipedia:RS-232#Voltage_levels]] descriptions about &quot;negative voltage has the functional significance of OFF&quot; and &quot;positive has the function ON&quot; also support my experience that e.g. [[Wikipedia:DTR|''Data Terminal Ready'']] is positive when the [[Wikipedia:DTE|DTE]] is ready and negative otherwise.

:: Be '''bold''' in editing this if you see factual errors.  The information I have put in comes from more technical books related to the subject rather than any &quot;hands-on&quot; experience of messing with the voltages directly on a circuit design level.  I would like to see these changes, however, be based on something concrete and formal specs.

:: The +15V and -15V signals '''are''' a part of traditional RS-232 specifications, however.  This admittedly is an older spec, and there are ranges of voltages to consider, with newer serial drivers going more toward the +/-5V range or less due to their use in embedded devices.  Still, if you were trying to hook something up to a 30 year old industrial controller using RS-232 connectors, expect the 15V line voltage, or even higher.

:: My experience when trying to purchase electronic components, parts, and cables, the suppliers understand the term DB-9.  Until you mentioned the possible term DE-9, I had honestly never even heard of it.  I guess from a purest viewpoint it should be called a DE-9 connector, and the Wikipedia article explains it pretty clearly.  Thanks for the education (although the term DB-9 should also be used in the description somewhere with brief explaination...due to suppliers not really understanding this idea either).

:: It should also be obvious that I was not using the Wikipedia content as source material for this module.  I will try and do some cleanup as well based on that source.  If you add anything from other sources, make sure that you note it on the external references area (even from dead-tree sources...include ISBN number instead).   [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 8 July 2005 18:04 (UTC)

* According to http://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/RS-232_specs.html and http://www.arcelect.com/rs232.htm the last sentence in Databits has to be changed in:&lt;BR&gt;
The least significant bit (LSB) is transmitted first in this sequence of bits to form a character.

::Thanks for the tip with the LSB/MSB change.  That was an oversight on my part, and in retrospect, it should have been obvious.  It also makes all forms of RS-232 data compatable at least on the bit level to start with, where the format of the bits is the same for all bit size transmissions except for just the number of bits actually transmitted.  A logical way to organize the protocol.  That and a simple mistake in the writing, so thanks for catching the mistake.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:07, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

== Merging ==
What is the purpose of merging this module with the almost empty module [[Serial Programming:RS-232 Technical Manual]] (less then ten sentences in the module)? Shouldn't the almost empty module better be removed and references to it replaced with references to this module?

:As the original author of this module, I strongly disagree with the premise that this module should be abandoned in favor of another Wikibook.  There is a purpose and goal that I have in mind, particularly that I've put into the [[Serial Programming:Introduction and OSI Model|introduction to this Wikibook]].  This is a multi-chapter book about serial data programming, which the RS-232 Technical Manual is really a totally seperate item.  This is not Wikipedia where you can have one and only one article about a particular subject.  IMHO, a separate Wikibook that goes into even more depth would be useful, although one I'm not willing to write at the moment.

:This other Wikibook started as a part of an editorial conflict me regarding the direction of this Wikibook about serial programming.  I am not making a Wikiproject that points to serial programming references, but instead I'm trying to write a book.  This distinction is somehow lost on some people, and don't understand the differences between Wikibooks and Wikipedia.  As a book, I am trying to go into detail about a subject, and build on that knowledge in subsequent chapters.  This is not an easy thing to do, although I am grateful for all of the assistance that has been rendered so far to improve these chapters I've already written.

:In short, I don't see why the two Wikibooks can't be made for this subject.  The Technical Manual is to be more of a reference guide, and this Wikibook is to be an introduction to the subject.  In short, I am trying to teach ''about'' serial programming, and it is my intention to turn this into a textbook.  Those are two very different goals and need to be written very differently.  That they may have some similar content is besides the point.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:00, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

== Where is it? (Hardware flow control description) ==

'''This is a part of the &quot;Hardware&quot; flow control protocol that will be explained below'''

At least the checked URL ?
Two URL's below tells opposite voltage's meaning &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go&quot;.

http://www.camiresearch.com/Data_Com_Basics/RS232_standard.html

http://www.taltech.com/TALtech_web/resources/intro-sc.html#Synch

PS: This seems to claim 0=go, 1=stop also, but it is not said frankly:  http://www.hw-server.com/rs232_signals.html#t6

:I guess I need to simply pull out an oscilloscope and find out for myself with a difinitive answer from the real world.  I would venture to bet that both + voltage and - voltage being asserted as a logical &quot;1&quot; does occur.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:55, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When using numerical methods or algorithms and computing with finite precision, errors of approximation or rounding and truncation are introduced. It is important to have a notion of their nature and their order. A newly developed method is worthless without an error analysis. Neither does it make sense to use methods which introduce errors with magnitudes larger than the effects to be measured or simulated. On the other hand, using a method with very high accuracy might be computationally too expensive to justify the gain in accuracy.

== Accuracy and Precision ==

Measurements and calculations can be characterized with regard to their accuracy and precision. Accuracy refers to how closely a value agrees with the true value.  Precision refers to how closely values agree with each other. The following figures illustrate the difference between accuracy and precision.  In the first figure, the given values (black dots) are more accurate; whereas in the second figure, the given values are more precise.  The term ''error'' represents the imprecision and inaccuracy of a numerical computation.

[[File:Accuracy of given values.png|thumb|300px|left|Accuracy]]
[[File:Precision of given values.png|thumb|300px|right|Precision]]

==Absolute Error==

The error between two values is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{abs}= \left \| \tilde{x} - x \right \| \quad , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denotes the exact value and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}&lt;/math&gt; its approximation.

==Relative Error==

The relative error of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute error relative to the exact value. Look at it this way: if your measurement has an error of  &amp;plusmn; 1 inch, this seems to be a huge error when you try to measure something which is 3 in. long. However, when measuring distances on the order of miles, this error is mostly negligible. The definition of the relative error is

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{rel} = \frac{\left \| \tilde{x} - x \right \|}{\left \| x \right \|} \quad . &lt;/math&gt;

==Sources of Error==
In a numerical computation, error may arise because of the following reasons:
* Truncation error

* Roundoff error

===Truncation Error===
Truncation error refers to the error in a method, which occurs because some series (finite or infinite) is truncated to a fewer number of terms. Such errors are essentially algorithmic errors and we can predict the extent of the error that will occur in the method.

===Roundoff Error===
Roundoff error occurs because of the computing device's inability to deal with certain numbers. Such numbers need to be rounded off to some near approximation which is dependent on the word size used to represent numbers of the device.

Tetum is one of the two official languages of East Timor ''(Timor L'este)'', the other one being Portuguese. It is worth noting that a significant number of people also speak Indonesian, English, Cantonese, or one the other 15 indigenous languages.

For several centuries, East Timor was a Portuguese colony, because of that fact Tetum gained many similarities to that language. Eventually, East Timor was annexed by Indonesia. After a protracted fight for independence, the people was allowed to chose via a referendum. Independence was finally gained and East Timor became the first democracy of the new millennium.

Durante vários séculos, Timor Leste foi uma colónia portuguesa, por esse motivo, o Tétum adquiriu varias similaridades com essa língua. Por último, o Timor Leste foi anexado pela Indonésia. Após uma prolongada luta pela independência, foi permitido ao povo fazer a sua escolha por via de um referendo. A independência foi finalmente ganha e Timor Leste tornou-se na primeira democracia do novo milenário.

[[/Introduction|'''Introduction''' - Ancient Egypt]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''The fifth century BC historian Herodotus called Egypt &quot;the gift of the Nile,&quot; meaning that the country would not exist without its river.  Surrounded to east and west by inhospitable desert, and to the south by rough and rocky badlands and high country, Egypt was long an isolated country that gave rise to a unique kingdom in ancient times.''
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[Image:50%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Geography|'''Section 1''' - Geography]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''The Nile is the principal feature of Egyptian geography, which made it in ancient times a nation rarely more than twelve miles wide from east to west — but more than 600 miles long from north to south.  However, the black land of Egypt, and the mineral wealth of the surrounding deserts, made Egypt prosperous and mighty from its earliest days up to the days of the Roman empire.''
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt|'''Section 2''' - Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Egypt, like all nations, did not emerge full-grown onto the world stage.  Archaeological investigations have demonstrated that several cultures emerged and thrived on the banks of the Nile River, before two kingdoms managed to take hold of the land, and eventually unite under a single royal standard.''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[Image:25%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Old Kingdom|'''Section 3''' - The Old Kingdom]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Once Egypt was united under a single monarch, a period of great order and stability began, which was to last for almost a thousand years.  Protected from outside forces by impassible desert, and immune to change because of the orderly, predictable nature of life in ancient Egypt, the first dynasties were able to erect the pyramids as monuments to their god-kings.''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Middle Kingdom|'''Section 4''' - The Middle Kingdom]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Drought, famine, and the rise of an aristocracy helped bring about the end of the Old Kingdom and usher in a period of new prosperity, in which nobles and ordinary citizens began to share in Egypt's wealth.  The appearance of foreign invaders, the Hyksos, also changed and renewed Egyptian culture.''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/New Kingdom|'''Section 5''' - The New Kingdom]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''The resurgence of Egyptian power after the pharaohs of the 18th  Dynasty drove out the Hyksos led to Egyptian imperialism and major building programs that proclaimed the might of the pharaohs, and the gods who watched over them.  However, new ideas in religion and political changes in the wider world tended to limit Egyptian power in unexpected ways.''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Late Period and Ptolemaic Egypt|'''Section 6''' - Late Period and Ptolemaic Egypt]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Successive waves of invasion — by Kushites, Assyrians, Persians, and Greeks — made Egypt a land of outward looking leadership and inward-looking commoners, and widened the divide between governors and governed.''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Roman and Byzantine Egypt|'''Section 7''' - Roman and Byzantine Egypt]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Egypt became the breadbasket of two successive empires, but the very nature of its wealth — in agriculture and critical products — made it a tempting target to Persian and Islamized Arab alike.''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Decline|'''Section 8''' - Decline]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''insert summary here''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Egyptology|'''Section 9''' - Egyptology]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Waves of visitors from Europe brought a madness for things Egyptian back to the salons and coffeehouses of Europe.  Italian tourists made off with the corpse of St. Mark for Venice; British forces stole the Rosetta Stone from Napoleon, who stole it from the wall of a peasant hut; and Howard Carter wasted a British lord's money for years before finding the only unlooted tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh.''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Pyramids|'''Section 10''' - Pyramids]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''They rank as some of the largest human-built structures on the planet, and yet their 'only' function seems to be as tombs for rulers of the second, third and fourth dynasties of Egypt during the Old Kingdom.  What are they, and how were they built?''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Pharaohs|'''Section 11''' - Pharaohs]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Gods, kings, ordinary men, a few women, and strangely inter-related... the pharaohs of Egypt have probably had more prestige and mystery than any other rulers in world history.  Who were they, and what did they do?''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Tutmask.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Culture|'''Section 12''' - Culture]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Egypt is a land of huge statues, deep tombs, and a confusing, contradictory culture.  Their obsession with the afterlife winds up explaining an enormous amount to us today about how they lived, worked and played.''

[[../Rome/Introduction|'''Introduction''' - Ancient Rome]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''The Roman civilization achieved greatness through a culture that borrowed, begged and stole the best elements of many other societies, while welding them together with a common legal and military structure.  Arguments about the parallels between ancient Rome and modern society arise regularly; hence the study of ancient Rome may prove instructive.''

&lt;/big&gt;

''The Etruscans lived in the region of modern Tuscany in Italy.  In contact with both Phoenicians and Greeks, they developed an interesting culture that made several important contributions to the Latin society in which Rome appeared.''

[[../Rome/Origins|'''Section 2''' - Origins of Rome]] &lt;small&gt;800-500 BCE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

''Beginning as a collection of villages near an important river crossing, Rome became a united city-state eager to dominate its neighbors as part of a strategy for security and prosperity.''

&lt;/big&gt;

''After throwing out the Etruscan royal family, a group of prominent families established a new constitution — one which enabled the new state to assume a leading role in the affairs of the Italian peninsula.''

&lt;/big&gt;

''Between 509 BC and 394 BC, Rome came to dominate the Italian peninsula, and began to assume important diplomatic and military functions in the wider Mediterranean world.''

[[../Rome/PunicWars|'''Section 5''' - The Punic Wars]] &lt;small&gt;264-146 BCE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

''Between 264 and 146 BC, the Romans fought three wars with their great rivals, the Carthaginians.  These two early superpowers had different cultural values, different military strengths, and different political aims.  Both states sought to rule the Mediterranean, and neither could accept the others' survival.''

[[../Rome/Crisis|'''Section 6''' - Republic to Empire]]&lt;small&gt;146 BCE - 27 CE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

''Now unchallenged in the Mediterranean, Rome found domestic disputes among the great men, great families and great classes of society to be the ruling force in her politics.  These disputes broke out of the Curia and into a series of open civil wars, which led to the collapse of the Republic and the rise of the Empire.''

[[../Rome/Empire 1|'''Section 7''' - The Early Empire]] &lt;small&gt;27 CE - 305 CE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

''The new political model of the Empire demonstrated its value rapidly.  The Emperors maintained control of the city only haphazardly, while the provinces remained relatively stable.  As the Empire grew, the problems of succession and leadership kept recurring, and Diocletian decided to find some other solution.  His failures led to a new era in Roman society.''

[[../Rome/Empire 2|'''Section 8''' - The Later Empire]] &lt;small&gt;305 CE - 450 CE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

''Now the Emperors had to contend with a new religion as well as resurgent enemies on the frontiers.  Christianity had made great gains in the previous three centuries, and now the Romans had to embrace a formerly-persecuted faith.  At the same time, political and economic changes on the fringes of the Empire, and growing weaknesses within were pushing the Empire toward collapse.''

[[../Rome/Collapse|'''Section 9''' - The Fall of Rome]]&lt;small&gt;400 CE - 600 CE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

''Many theories abound explaining why Rome fell: barbarian invasions, dried-up trade, economic failures, hard currency fleeing the country, lead in the water, adoption of the Christian faith, and failure to adopt Christian values completely. In this section we look at some of the reasons for Rome's collapse, and examine some of the reasons why it continued to exert a strong hold on the Western imagination.''

'''Introduction''' - Mesopotamia

&lt;/big&gt;

''Mesopotamia is an ancient Greek word meaning &quot;land between the rivers&quot;.  Between 5000 BCE and 500 BCE, it was home to successive waves of cultures, borrowing and cooperating with one another for resources, ideas and culture, as well as competing with one another militarily for land and prestige.''

'''Section 2''' - First Civilizations

&lt;/big&gt;

''Near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers on the Persian Gulf is a marshy, low-lying region that in ancient times was the home of the first cities — the land of Sumer.  Here, the city-states of Ur, Uruk and others competed for land, power, and prestige while trying to fend off barbarians.  These cities became the ancient Greece of the region — providing written language, architecture, religion, and cultural norms to the societies that followed.''

'''Section 3''' - The Amorites and Babylon

&lt;/big&gt;

''Babylon was the first city-state to assemble a true kingdom around itself in Mesopotamia.  Located at a point not far from modern-day Baghdad, the Babylonians used the river for communication and control in a wide empire that spread across the river valleys.''

'''Section 4''' - Upper Mesopotamia

&lt;/big&gt;

''Assyria was named after its first capital, Assur, and referred to an area of Northern Mesopotamia, as opposed to the Southern Mesopotamia of Sumer, Akkad and Babylonia.''

'''Section 5''' - [[/Neo-Assyrian Empire|The Neo-Assyrian Empire]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Assyria believed in military domination of its enemies.  The kings of Assyria conquered lands from the Hittites, Egyptians, and Medes, as well as all the minor kingdoms between.  They rate negative attention in sources as widely spread as the Bible and Hittite archives for their cruelty and villainy.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gustar only uses the third person singular and plural forms, along with a direct object pronoun: me, te, le, nos, os, les. For example:

Me gusta el perro. ''I like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Me gustan los perros. ''I like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;
Te gusta el perro. ''You like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Te gustan los perros. ''You like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;
Le gusta el perro. ''She like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Le gustan los perros. ''She like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;


Nos gusta el perro. ''We like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Nos gustan los perros. ''We like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;
Vos gusta el perro. ''You like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Vos gustan los perros. ''You like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;
Les gusta el perro. ''They like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Les gustan los perros. ''They like the dogs.''


There are several verbs like this, such as encantar, fascinar, importar, chocar, and flipar, and are referred to as ''gustar-type verbs''

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure how detailed this book is going to be in general, but it seems like color should probably be discussed beyond the level of  fundamental color theory.  I'd be interested in seeing a very very basic introduction to what color is (light-wise) and a brief discussion of psychological function and even basic interaction (like complimentary colors).  Much beyond fundamental color theory, though, and it might make more sense to put it into different sections.  --[[User:Mstults|Matt S]] 08:45, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)


==EFL?==
Hi, I got to this article from the Teaching English as a Foreign Language Lesson plan article under the &quot;Beginner&quot; heading. I feel like it may be misplaced as the content of this article doesn't seem to address the teaching of English at all! I'm not sure how to change it, hopefully this will be brought to the attention of the proper authorities. [[User:Telor|Telor]] ([[User talk:Telor|talk]]) 08:51, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

== Wikibook rename proposal ==
I'm putting up the proposal to rename this book from Colors to &quot;Color Theory&quot;. Colors seems too generic and abrangent to properly describe what is/should be covered. If anyone has a better title please put it forward...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:23, 5 February 2011 (UTC)

== About this wikibook ==
This page is a stub of what pretends to be a future module dealing with the rules governing the Grammar according to Transformational theories. We may also add the new theories of the Minimalist Program.

As long as this module is a stub, I would prefer to keep it under my user page. But I encourage you to modify, contribute and discuss whatever you consider necessary. And if you want to contribute but you don't like the book to be under my user-page, we may consider moving it.

I am a Spanish native speaker, but I have studied this theory applied only to English language. I'd like to study the transformational principles applied to Spanish language, and then, I'd begin a Spanish wikibook about this topic. 

I'd be very grateful to those English speaking wikicontributors who may check my mistakes. Thank you :)

=== The problem of the branching representation ===
I just discovered that we can use branching nodes to represent the examples, have a look [http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex here], we may also use the box '''[  ]''' symbology and/or pictures created by us and uploaded to Commons.

== Contents ==

=== What is the transformational grammar? ===

The transformational grammar is a mathematically powerful grammar based on the theory of language described by [[w:Noam Chomsky]]. More information in [[w:Transformational grammar]].

=== Categorial information ===
The syntactic category of a word determines its distribution in the syntactic structure.

==== Word level categories ====
A adjective

ADV adverb

D determiner

N noun

P preposition

V verb

==== Phrasal level categories ====
AP adjectival phrase

(ADVP adverbial phrase) Its existence is discussed.

DP determiner phrase (According to Santorini and Kroch)

NP noun phrase

PP prepositional phrase

VP verbal phrase

IP inflectional phrase

CP complementizer phrase

=== Constituency tests ===
*Preposing: only phrasal constituents may undergo preposing.

 1.a.*People at Wikimedia Embassy we have a list with.
   b. At meta:Wikimedia Embassy we have a list with people. (''Example taken from [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Volunteers_wanted:_Wikimedia_Embassy])

Constituency vs. adjunct tests


=== Phrase markers ===
*Hierarchic structure

In the transformational grammar, it is proposed that the constituents of a clause are hierarchically structured. 

*Branch
*Node and branching node

The node is the point where two (or more) branches are connected.

*Dominance
*Exhaustive dominance
*Immediate dominance
*Precedence
*Immediately precedence
*'''C-command''': (see also coindexing) 
:A c-command B iff (if and only if) the node that immediately dominates A also dominates B and neither A dominates B, nor B dominates A.
*
=== Phrase structure rules ===
''(More information about this topic in Wikipedia's article [[w:Phrase_structure_rules]])
 '''XP''' → (W) '''X(')''' (Y)


==== Phrase structure in a NP ====

*Determiner rule:

 N&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;→ D N' (According to Radford (2003))

*Adjunct rule:

 N'→ N' PP

*Complement rule

 N' → N PP

=== Argument structure and Theta-role ===
The arguments are participants selected by the predicate. Each argument receives a theta role assigned by the predicate and, each theta role needs to be assigned to one and only one argument.


==== Theta or semantic roles ====

#Theme
#Agent 
#Cause 
#Locative
#Source 
#Goal
#Experiencer
#Benefactive
#Instrument
#Manner
#Reason
#Time

=== X' theory ===
(Initially extracted from [[w:X-bar theory|X-bar theory]]).

'''X-bar theory''' is a component of [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory which attempts to identify syntactic features common to all languages. The theory claims that there are certain structural similarities among all phrasal categories of all languages. The letter X is used to signify an arbitrary lexical category for  the [[w:head (linguistics)|head]] of the phrase (instead of, for example, N for [[w:noun|noun]] or V for [[w:verb|verb]]) in order to allow a generic description.

X-bar theory adds additional levels of hierarchy to more traditional [[w:phrase structure rules|phrase structure rules]] using the phrasal constituent called an X-bar. 

The head, X, is said to combine with a [[w:complement|complement]] to form an X-bar, and an [[w:adjunct]] is said to combine with an X-bar to form another X-bar. Finally, an X-bar is said to combine with a [[w:specifier|specifier]] to form the top level of the phrase, the X Phrase (or XP). [In this way, complements are distinguished from adjuncts by the fact that a complement has an X as a sister, whereas an adjunct has X-bar as a sister.]

These rules can be formalized as follows:
* XP --&gt; (specifier), X-bar '' An X Phrase consists of an optional specifier and an X-bar, in either order.''
* (X-bar --&gt; X-bar, adjunct) '' An X-bar may consist of an X-bar and an adjunct, in either order.''
* X-bar --&gt; X, (complement...) '' An X-bar consists of an X and any number of complements, in either order.''

Note, the adjuct rule is itself optional.

=== Subcategorization frame ===
The subcategorization frame shows the constituents selected or subcategorized by a lexical item. The number of constituents subcategorized depends on the valency of the lexical item. For example, the verb &quot;give&quot; is trivalent (or three place predicate). Thus, it is associated with three arguments.

 The three Wise Men give many presents to the children.
 The three Wise Men give the children many presents.

 give: [___ NP PP(to)]
       [___ NP NP] (see Dative shift)


=== Selectional restrictions ===
Predicates impose certain semantic restrictions to the arguments selected. For example, in 1. the predicate &quot;overtake&quot; may select the NP &quot;a cyclist&quot; as an argument, but it cannot select the NP &quot;a smile&quot; :

 1. a. The car driver overtook a cyclist.
    b.*The car driver overtook a smile.

=== Transformations ===

*Structure-Preserving Hypothesis

The transformations are structure-preserving. Thus, when a constituent moves to a new position, the constituent must keep the same category as it was.

==== Deep and Surface structure ====


==== NP raising ====
The NP raises to SpecIP position to cover subject requirements and to obtain a compatible case.

==== V-I or I-V movement ====

There are two significant and different hypotheses used to explain the process of inflectional affixation in English verbs. While Chomsky suggested that the inflectional element lowers to V position, also called '''affix lowering''', others have suggested that the V rises to I position.


===== NICE properties =====
NICE is an acronym used to distinguish the main verbs from the auxiliary and modal verbs.

*'''N'''egation 
 [IP I''(i)'' do [NEGP not [VP ''t(i)'' scream]]].
(Do support in order to fulfill the VI movement requirement when lexical, because lexical verb ''scream'' cannot undergo VI movement).
 *[IP I''(i)'' scream''(j)'' [NEGP not [VP ''t(i)'' ''t(j)'']]].
The ungrammaticality of this example shows that lexical verbs cannot undergo V-I movement and they need do-support, as it is shown in the previous grammatical example.

*'''I'''nversion (in interrogative sentence formation). 
 [CP Do''(i)''[IP you''(j)''  ''t(i)''[VP''t(j)'' scream]]]?
(I-C movement)

*'''C'''
*'''E'''llipsis

Only verbs in the inflectional domain may undergo these properties. That is why we cannot apply them to lexical verbs, because the lexical verbs stay always in the lexical domain. When a V-I movement is needed, then it undergoes do insertion.

==== I-C movement ====
I-C, Inflectional to Complementizer domain movement takes place in:
*Semiindirect speech
*Direct questions (see the example above in Inversion, of NICE properties).
*Subordinate clauses.

=== Functional domain ===

==== Inflectional phrase (IP) ====

*Modal verbs and auxiliary verbs.
Modal verbs are generated in the functional domain, as it is proved in the next examples:

:*Negation: (the particle of negation, in English, may only occur between the IP and the VP.

 1  a. The wikipedians should not despise other users.
    b.*The wikipedians not should despise other users.
:*Sentential adverbs: (sentential adverbs are those adverbs which, according to Radford, are immediately dominated by the Sentence node.

 2  a. [IP The wikipedians(i) necessarily should [VP (i) respect other users]].
    b. *[IP The wikipedians(i) should [VP (i) respect necessarily other users]].

Modal verbs may co-occur in the same clause with one or more auxiliary verbs:

 3  a. The wikipedians should have respected other users.
    b. The wikipedians should have been respected by other users.

However, modal verbs may not co-occur in the same clause with other modal verbs, as it is shown in an ungrammatical sentence like:

 4  *The wikipedians must should respect other users.

=== Complementizer domain ===

==== Wh- movement ====

*Wh- base generation

 1 a. [CP What(''h'') do(''i'') [IP you(''j'') ''t(i)''[VP ''t(j)'' like ____(what)''t(k)''?]]]
                                         

*Complex NP constraint.
The Complex NP is a Noun Phrases whose head is modified by a relative clause or by a Noun Complement Clause. Wh- movement out of a Complex NP leads to ungrammaticality, because there is no way to extract an element out of a Complex NP. That is the reason why Complex NPs are called islands.

*Wh-island constraint
In the same way, no constituent can undergo extraction from a subordinate clause whose CP  by a WH- word.


*Head Movement constraint
*Adjacency and the Boundary theory

=== Glosary of terms ===

*A adverb
*AP adverbial phrase
*Complement-adjunct tests.
*Constituency rules.
*Constituency tests.
*DP Determiner phrase
*NP Noun phrase
*PP Prepositional phrase
*VP Verbal phrase

Serves 12

==Procedure==
#Mix quickly in the food processor the sugar and lemon rind.
#Add eggs and blend until it becomes a nice cream.
#Continue blending while slowly adding the oil.
#Blend until well mixed and add vanilla.
#In a separate bowl sift the dry ingredients all together (flour, allspice, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon).
#Mix the dry ingredients slowly into the batter blending until it becomes a nice thick cream.
#Add grated apples and blend quickly into batter just to mix. Be sure not to overblend and shred the apples too much.
#Add raisins and pulse the processor as to just mix them in and not shred them.
#Bake for 55 minutes at approximately [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|320°F (160°C)]] or until sticking a knife into center comes out clean.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use Set Notation?==
Let's have a discussion about just using set notation for big-O. I think instead of saying that
:&lt;math&gt;O(n\lg n)\le O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = O(g(n))&lt;/math&gt;
We should use the set notation only:
:&lt;math&gt;O(n\lg n)\subset O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;f(n)\in O(g(n))&lt;/math&gt;
We could still define what the &quot;=&quot;s notation means, and mention that it's also used. But it would be nice to avoid these notational issues and follow the &quot;newer&quot; trend and adopt the set notation. We still would say &quot;T(n) is O(n)&quot; instead of &quot;T(n) is in O(n)&quot;, because &quot;is&quot; in English is commonly understood to be in only one direction, not both.
--[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:39, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)

''Introduction to Algorithms'' by Thomas Cormen, et. al. (ISBN 0-262-03293-7) explains its use of = by pointing out that sometimes we will want to say &lt;math&gt;3n^2+2n-17 = 3n^2+\Theta(n)&lt;/math&gt; or even &lt;math&gt;3n^2+\Theta(n) = \Theta(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;, which don't work if we just replace = with &amp;isin;. So it's probably better to keep = and just explain what it means.

:Good point, we shouldn't get too far off the beaten path. We could leave the set interpretation as just a side note. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:16, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Anyway, in order to understand any of this, readers need a basic understanding of set theory, or at least its notation. [[Discrete_mathematics/Set_theory]], [[Wikipedia:Naive set theory]], and [[Wikipedia:Set]] all have basic summaries of the needed notation which could be copied here. I like [[Wikipedia:Naive set theory]]'s best. Was there any resolution to the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Approach_to_Mathematics_Wikibooks]]?
--[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 01:36, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Hey Jyasskin: BTW, Thanks for your contributions. There was no resolution with how to handle Mathematics books (and the like). For this book I'd like to see it be as self-contained as possible (it assumes the sister book on Data Structures, however it doesn't assume all of Data Structure book's content either). I think it would be safe to assume some knowledge of descrete math, but we wouldn't want to demonstrate, say, the continuum hypothesis.
:Also, we'd probably want to use more examples than the wikipedia. For example, defining some natural sets along with the notation right away just so the material won't seem so abstract. A section on Set Theory right after the Mathematical Definitions sounds good. (Or perhaps you might like set theory first, to introduce relations too, which the Mathematical Definitions section uses). [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:16, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Little-o vs. Small-o ==

I always called what you call &quot;small-o&quot; &quot;little-o.&quot;

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Little-oNotation.html
:That makes sense. Thanks. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:50, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

== Undefined Logical Negation symbol under types of relations ==

In describing the different types of relations, the logical negation symbol is used, for instance in defining irreflexive. However nowhere before that point or around it a suitable interpretation of that symbol is provided. Besides the interpretation is going to depend on the particular relation being defined and its set. --[[User: Balbir Thomas|Balbir Thomas]] 17:00, 21 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the wiki-world of Policy Debate! Whether you are a novice, varsity debater, or college hot shot, this book can hopefully be of use.  One of the most exciting things about debate is the initial socialization process of the activity. Learning the open-ended rules, the debate jargon, and how to spin your pen around your thumb!  Although we can't learn everything online, this repository is the perfect place for an introduction to debate, basic debate theory, and advice about debate.  And, heck, because of the limitless and easily maintainable Wiki format, it can eventually expand into argument lists, citelists, and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Co-ordinates are a way of describing position. In two dimensions, positions are given in two perpendicular directions, ''x'' and ''y''.

==Linear Equations==

===Straight lines===
A straight line has a fixed gradient. The gradient of a line and its y intercept are the two pieces of information that distinguish one line from another line.

===Equations of a straight line===
The most common form of a straight line is y = mx + c. m is the gradient of the line, and c is the point at which the line intercepts the y-axis. When c is 0, the line passes through the origin (0,0).
Other forms of the equation are x = a, used for vertical lines of an infinite gradient and y = b is used for horizontal lines with a zero gradient. Also some equations are commonly written as:  px + qy + c = 0. 
You can also use the equation y-y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=m(x-x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

===Gradient of a line===
The steepness of a line can be measured by its gradient, which is the change in the y direction divided by the change in the x direction. The letter m is used to denote the gradient. The formula to find a gradient is: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}&lt;/math&gt;  
As a side note &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta = m\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Point-Gradient Form===
The equation of a line having the co-ordinate &lt;math&gt;\left(x_1,y_1\right)&lt;/math&gt; and having a gradient of m is: &lt;math&gt;y-y_1=m\left(x - x_1\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Then you simply rearrange the equation into the form y = mx + c.

===Parallel lines===
A pair of lines are parallel (the symbol is &lt;math&gt;\|&lt;/math&gt; ). If their gradients are equal, &lt;math&gt;m_1 = m_2\,&lt;/math&gt;.  So in order to find  the equation of a parallel line you need the slope of the original line and one set of co-ordinates on the parallel line. Then you use the Point-Gradient formula to find the equation of the parallel line.

===Perpendicular lines===
A pair of lines are perpendicular (the symbol is &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;) if the product of their gradients is &lt;math&gt;m_1 \times m_2=-1&lt;/math&gt;, . So if you need the equation of a line perpendicular to another line, all you need to do is replace the gradient m with the negative reciprocal of m.

So for example if line 1 is y = 2x +3 and you need to find the line perpendicular to this that goes through the point (0,1), then the gradient m = -1/2 (because 2 x -1/2 = -1).
 
This gives y = -x/2 +c. 

Putting the known point (0,1) into this equation gives :

1= -0/2 +c which gives c = 1

so the equation is y = 1- x/2.

===Distance between two points===
Using the co-ordinates of two points, it is possible to calculate the distance between them using Pythagoras' theorem.
The distance d between any two points &lt;math&gt;A(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is given by: 
&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Mid-point of a line===

When the co-ordinate of two points are known, the mid-point is the point halfway between those two points. For any two points A&lt;math&gt;({x_1},{y_1})&lt;/math&gt; and B&lt;math&gt;({x_2},{y_2})&lt;/math&gt;, the co-ordinates of the mid-point of AB can be found by &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {{x_1} + {x_2}}{2}, \frac {{y_1} + {y_2}}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Intersection of lines===

Any two straight lines will meet at a point, as long as they are not parallel. You can find the point of intersection simply by solving the two [[../Equations#Simultaneous_equations|equations simultaneously]]. This is also true for curves, although non linear curves may intersect at multiple points or not at all and usually require different methods to solve.

==Curves==

To sketch a graph of a curve, all you need to know is the general shape of the curve and other important pieces of information such as the x and y intercepts and the points of any maxima and minima.

===Curves in the form &lt;math&gt;y=x^n&lt;/math&gt;===
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
|[[Image:Y%3D2.svg|400px]] || [[Image:Y%3DX.svg|400px]]
|-
|Degree 0 - Constant - &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. In this case y=2 || Degree 1 - Linear - &lt;math&gt;ax + b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;mx + c&lt;/math&gt;. In this case y = x.
|-
| [[Image:Y%3DX%5E2.svg|400px]] ||[[Image:Y%3DX%5E3.svg|400px]]
|-
|Degree 2 - Quadratic - &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; . In this case y = &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; || Degree 3 - Cubic - &lt;math&gt;ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d&lt;/math&gt;. In this case y = &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}
Note: That all the odd powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; share the same general shape, moving from bottom-left to top-right, and that all the even powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; share the same &quot;bucket&quot; shaped curve.

===Curves in the form &lt;math&gt;y=\frac {1} {x^n}&lt;/math&gt;===

Just like earlier, curves with an even powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; all have the same general shape, and those with odd powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; share another general shape.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
|[[Image:Y%3D1x.svg|400px]] || [[Image:Y%3D1x%5E2.svg|400px]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| [[Image:Y%3D1x%5E3.svg|400px]] ||[[Image:Y%3D1x%5E4.svg|400px]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{x^3}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{x^4}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

All curves in this form do not have a value for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {0}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined. There are '''asymptotes''' on the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis, where the curve moves towards the y axis increasingly slowly but will never actually touch.

===Curves in the form &lt;math&gt;y=\sqrt x&lt;/math&gt;===
[[Image:Sqrt(x).svg]]&lt;p&gt;
All curves in this form will not have values for x &lt; 0. They will all have the same general shape.

===Intersection of lines and curves===

When a line intersects with a curve, it is possible to find the points of intersection by substituting the equation of the line into the equation of the curve. If the line is in the form &lt;math&gt;y = mx + c&lt;/math&gt;, then you can replace any instances of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;mx + c&lt;/math&gt;, and then expand the equation out and then [[../Equations|factorise]] the resulting quadratic.

===Intersection of curves===

The same method can be used as for a line and a curve. However, it will only work in simple cases. When an algebraic method fails, you will need to resort to a graphical or [[A-level Mathematics/OCR/C3/Numerical Methods|Numerical Method]]. In the exam, you will only be required to use algebraic methods.

===Graphical Rules===
In many cases it is easy to obtain a graph from a prexisting graph using these rules.
====Reflection====
# &lt;math&gt;y = -f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a reflection of &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; through the x axis.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (-x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a reflection of &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; through the y axis.

====Stretching====
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (bx \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is stretched away from the y-axis if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; b &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt; and stretched towards the y-axis if &lt;math&gt;b &gt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;. In both cases the change is by b units.
# &lt;math&gt;y = af \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is stretched towards the x-axis if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; a &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt; and stretched away from the x-axis if &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;. In both cases the change is by a units.

====Translations====
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x - h \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by h units to the right.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x + h \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by h units to the left.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right ) + k\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by k units upwards.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right ) - k\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by k units downwards.

==The Circle==
A circle is a set of all points in a plane that are a fixed distance r away from a given point called the center. The distance r is the radius of a circle.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:CircleAnnotated.png]]&lt;p&gt;
The two basic laws of circles are:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Area = \pi r^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Circumference = 2 \pi r\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties of a circle===
A radius always bisects a chord if they are perpendicular to each other.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:RadiusandCord.png]]&lt;p&gt;
If any point on the circumference of the circle is connected to the diameter, it forms a right triangle.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:CircleRightTriangle.png]]&lt;p&gt;
If a radius is drawn and then a tangent is drawn from that point. Then the radius and tangent line will be perpendicular to each other.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:RadiusTangent.png]]&lt;p&gt;

===Equation of a Circle===
The standard equation of a circle is:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This will always give us a circle centered around the origin (0,0). If we want a circle with a center at (h,k) we use the following formula.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left (x - h \right )^2 + \left (y - k \right )^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However you can not graph either of these equations with a calculator. You will need to split it into two equations, but the graph will not be perfect, because x is undefined when x = 0 and when &lt;math&gt;(x -h)^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;: 
&lt;math&gt;y =+ \sqrt{r^2 - \left ( x - h \right )^2} + k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y =- \sqrt{r^2 - \left ( x - h \right )^2} + k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Here is how &lt;math&gt;\left (x - 5 \right )^2 + \left (y - 8 \right )^2 = 2^2&lt;/math&gt; would look graphed:&lt;p&gt;

      <comment>/* Why Use PHPEclipse? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">PHPEclipse is a set of plugins for the [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse Framework] which provide and integrated IDE for [http://www.php.net/ PHP] developers. Eclipse, and PHPEclipse are written in Java, and will run on all graphical desktop environments. PHPEclipse is Open Source software, freely available under the [http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html Common Public Licence].

==Why Use PHPEclipse?==

There are several decent Integrated Development Environments available for PHP web development, each with their own pros and cons. So what stands out about PHPEclipse?

'''Eclipse is a Consistent and Mature Platform'''

The Eclipse Platform provides users with a consistent user interface paradigm. A software development IDE is one of the more complex desktop applications most of us are likely to use, and so the time required for a developer to become efficient with a particular IDE can be significant. Eclipse doesn't reduce this time, but it does provide a consistent interface approach which need only be learnt once in order to develop efficiently with a wide range of programming languages and tools. As part of this approach, Eclipse provides detailed documentation and tutorials on all it's generic functionality, allowing plugin projects, such as PHPEclipse, to focus only on their areas specific to their domain. By learning to use Eclipse as a development platform, or learning to develop your own plug-in tools for eclipse, you are acquiring a useful and flexible skill.

'''PHPEclipse is Cross Platform'''

PHP web development is performed by developers using many different operating systems and desktop environments. As PHPEclipse is available on any system which can run Java, it is an ideal choice when a single IDE is desired by a group of developers spread across a range of different environments.

'''Eclipse Provides a Wealth of Mature Development Tools'''

Eclipse provides an array of important development tools such as CVS integration, project wide text searching and manipulation. A large range of third party plugins is available for Eclipse (both free and commercial).

==Feature Overview==

===PHPEclipse Features===

* PHP, HTML, XML and CSS Syntax Highlighting
* Code completion
* Javascript Editor (?)
* Integrated web browser preview
* Integrated control of Apache &amp; MySQL servers (if using XAMP distribution) (?)
* Some PHPUnit Integration (?)
* Integrated MySQL client view using Quantum DB (?)
* HTMLTidy integration (?)

(?) indicates that I haven't yet tried this out

===Useful Eclipse Features===

* CVS Integration
* Search across files
* Task list

[[Movie_Making_Manual/Writing|Writing | Previous]]

=Rewriting=

Over 80% of your time on any screenplay will be spent on rewrites.  So much of screenwriting is about structure that you may have the story in the first few weeks while the rest of the time is spent reworking the script so the story works on the screen.

After you have plowed through and have a first draft script of 90-130 pages the best thing to do probably is to get a little distance from the screenplay so you can evaluate it objectively.  This is probably best done by laying the script aside for a few weeks and doing something else then returning to it with fresh eyes.

==Top-Down Rewriting==

Beginning writers assume that the rewriting process consists of going through the script line by line and fixing any typos or grammatical errors. After a couple of such passes they're bored and the screenplay is still weak.

To be efficient and really make progress requires being more organized and starting with the big picture. Make a series of passes through your screenplay, each time concentrating on one or two elements.

Start with the most important elements of any story such as: Is the hero really appealing and heroic? Is the villain really evil? Is there a powerful and credible conflict? Are the characters great, real, alive, right and consistent?

Strengthening these big elements might result in major restructuring of the screenplay. Only after they have been addressed is the time right to work down to issues such as spelling and grammar. Take a break for a few days at any point if necessary to get a fresh perspective.

[http://screenwriting.4filmmaking.com/script-rewriting.html A detailed rewriting strategy discussion]

=='Spitballing'==

This rather strange term comes from William Goldman's books. It means getting together with another writer and discussing your script and coming up with ideas to solve problems you are having.

It's essential to discover whether or not your story, characters, dramatic conflict, is working. A screenplay is both a sales document for the film and the blueprint, a set of instructions to the director and the actors.  An outside viewpoint is essential if you want to know if your script is going to be successful.

==Script Editors==

A good script editor is invaluable. Professional editors and coverage experts can be located by searching the web and through ads in screenwriting magazines, however the cost can be prohibitive for independent filmmakers.

Another option is to enlist friends that are avid novel readers and particularly anal-retentive at spelling and grammar. Even the most successful professional writers value the feedback of their trusted friends. If the writing is interesting enough, friends will feel compensated by just getting to be the first to read the new work and share in the creative process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The process of installing PHPEclipse has several stages. This is because PHP development with PHPEclipse relies upon a number of different pieces of software. If you already use your machine for PHP development, chances are that you will have some of these items already installed. Even if this is the case, make sure you have at least a brief glance at the items below to ensure that you have the required versions installed. The installation process should be followed in the order provided in this manual. The optional items are of course optional, but are strongly recommended.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is used to run all programs written in the Java programming language. Java 2 is required to run both Eclipse and PHPEclipse. Chances are that you will already have this installed. If not, or if you are not sure, visit Sun's [http://java.com/en/download/ Java Download Site], which will provide you with what you need (or inform you if you already have Java 2) for any operating system.

If you are using a platform with its own software management system (such as many linux distributions), you may wish to use your package management system to install Java rather than the Sun download site.

Third party Java Runtime Environments (such as [http://www.blackdown.org/ Blackdown]) are also available, and may well run this software. Feedback on this is welcome. Our current experience is that Blackdown will not successfully run Eclipse (under Gentoo Linux, Nov 2004).

      <text xml:space="preserve">With Java installed, the Eclipse Platform can now be downloaded and installed. In order to use PHP Eclipse, Eclipse version 3.0 or greater is required. You can download eclipse from the [http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/ Eclipse Download Page]. You will want to install the Latest Release, which at the time of writing is 3.0.1. This will install the Eclipse SDK. Eclipse is also available as a Platform Runtime Binary, but this will not let you use the debugging features.

Although in general Java applications are platform independent, Eclipse uses the SWT ([http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-SWT-Design-1/SWT-Design-1.html Standard Widget Toolkit]), which provides native look and feel on a range of platforms. This allows much better integration into your desktop than the normal generic Java widgets. This means, however, that you need to select the correct release of Eclipse for your operating system. A range of different downloads are provided on the download page for your selected release version. Windows and Mac users can simply select the only version for their platform. Linux users need to select the appropriate download for their architure and desktop environement.

&lt;font color=maroon&gt;Under Linux, eclipse is available for both the Motif and GTK graphical toolkits. GTK is ideal for making eclipse look like your other Gnome applications. No Eclipse version is available for QT (the KDE graphical toolkit) due to the way in which QT is licenced. KDE users will probably want to grab the GTK version. Additionally, you may find it easier to install the Eclipse SDK using your distribution's package management system. For example, under Gentoo Linux, the package dev-util/eclipse-sdk works fine with PHPEclipse.&lt;/font&gt;

To install the and Eclipse SDK zip file downloaded from eclipse.org, simple extract the file to the desired location (eg: C:\Program Files). The file contains a single directory called eclipse. To run eclipse, simple execute the eclipse file in this directory. For example, under MS Windows (if installed to the location above), then you would execute &quot;C:\Program Files\eclipse\eclipse.exe&quot;. A shortcut could be created for this location.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About Dante==
Dante (1265–1321) was born in Florence. His mother died when he was five or six, and his father, Alighiero di Bellincione, remarried to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. Dante married Gemma, and had at least three children. When he was about twenty years old, Dante met Beatrice Portinari, but not much is known of this relationship. Upon her death in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature.

In 1301, Dante was sentenced to exile and never returned to Florence again during his life. His remains lay in the Church of Santa Apollinare at Ravenna.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To install PHPEclipse, first download the latest version from SourceForge at [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57621&amp;package_id=70009 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57621&amp;package_id=70009]. The latest version will be the one at the top of the list displayed on the download page. At the time of writing, it is version 1.1.3 (filename PHPEclipse1.1.3-2005-01-29.zip). This file is platform independent.

The PHPEclipse zip files must be extracted in the same directory in which you installed Eclipse. It contains two directories, ''plugins'' and ''features'', and these must add to the plugins and features in your existing eclipse directory.

'''Note: Eclipse 3.x caches all plugin.xml files into a single repository for quicker loading. If you used eclipse before installing PHPeclipse, you should start eclipse once with the -clean option. This -clean forces Eclipse to rebuild that repository. This applies to anything that is installed into eclipse by unzipping it into its plugins folder.'''
&lt;br /&gt;
This plugin can be replaced by a similar plugin the '''Php Developer Tools (PDT)''', more here http://wiki.eclipse.org/PDT/Installation

      <comment>/* Installing AMP Using the XAMPP Distribution */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Most PHP developers find it easiest to work with a running web server on their local machine. This allows you to test your work as you go, without having to upload it to a hosting environment. Therefore, it's suggested that at this point you install Apache, PHP, and (if you are using it), MySQL. This step is required if you plan to use the php debugger. Together these tools are often referred to as AMP (or AMPP if you include Perl as well as PHP). 

==Installing AMP Using the XAMPP Distribution==

XAMPP is a software bundle which includes everything you need to install Apache/MySQL/PHP/Perl in one go. It's available for Windows, Linux and Solaris. Particularly on a Windows machine, this is definitely the fastest way to get up and running with these tools, as someone else has done the integration  and configuration work for you. Under Linux, it may be a quick solution to set up, will not be as easy to automatically maintain (or integrate with other packages) as if you installed these tools separately with your distribution's package management system (such as: apt, YaST, emerge, or up2date). This is covered in the next section.

To install XAMPP, visit their website at [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html]. Select your operating system ([http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html Windows], [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html Linux] or [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-solaris.html Solaris]), and then follow the simple installation instructions found on that page.

Note:  Since Apache needs to be able to run your php files against php, your workspace, which contains all of your php files, must be in the Apache web root (htdocs folder).  By default, this is C:\apachefriends\xampp\htdocs , but may vary depending on where you install XAMPP to.  The setting can also be configured in httpd.conf

      <comment>/* Functions with parameters */  fixed typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you've ever done any programming in a different environment than the shell, you're probably familiar with the following scenario: you're writing your program, happily typing away at the keyboard, until you notice that

* you have to repeat some code you typed earlier because your program has to perform exactly the same actions in two different locations; or
* your program is just too ''long'' to understand anymore.

In other words, you've reached the point where it becomes necessary to divide your program up into modules that can be run as separate subprograms and called as often as you like. Working in the Bourne Shell is no different than working in any other language in this respect. Sooner or later you're going to find yourself writing a shell script that's just too long to be practical anymore. And the time will have come to divide your script up into modules.

==Named functions==
Of course, the easy and obvious way to divide a script into modules is just to create a couple of different shell scripts &amp;mdash; just a few separate text files with executable permissions. But using separate files isn't always the most practical solution either. Spreading your script over multiple files can make it hard to maintain. Especially if you end up with shell scripts that aren't really meaningful unless they are called specifically from one other, particular shell script.

Especially for this situation the Bourne Shell includes the concept of a ''named function'': the possibility to associate a name with a command list and execute the command list by using the name as a command. This is what it looks like:

{{bcode:Example|''name'' '''()''' ''command group''
|Where ''name'' is a text string&lt;br/&gt;
and ''command group'' is any grouped command list (either with curly braces or parentheses)}}

This functionality is available throughout the shell and is useful in several situations. First of all, you can use it to break a long shell script up into multiple modules. But second, you can use it to define your own little macros in your own environment that you don't want to create a full script for. Many modern shells include a built-in command for this called ''alias'', but old-fashioned shells like the original Bourne Shell did not; you can use named functions to accomplish the same result.

==Creating a named function==
===Functions with a simple command group===
Let's start off simply by creating a function that prints &quot;Hello World!!&quot;. And let's call it &quot;hw&quot;. This is what it looks like:

{{code:Basic|Hello world as a named function|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;hw() {
&gt;  echo 'Hello World!!';
&gt;}&lt;/source&gt;}}

We can use exactly the same code in a shell script or in the interactive shell &amp;mdash; the example above is from the interactive shell. There are several things to notice about this example. First of all, we didn't need a separate keyword to define a function, just the parentheses did it. To the shell, function definitions are like extended variable definitions. They're part of the environment; you set them just by defining a name and a meaning.

The second thing to note is that, once you're past the parentheses, all the normal rules hold for the command group. In our case we used a command group with braces, so we needed the semicolon after the echo command. The string we want to print contains exclamation points, so we have to quote it (as usual). And we were allowed to break the command group across multiple lines, even in interactive mode, just like normal.

Here's how you use the new function:
{{code:Output|Calling our function|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ hw&lt;/source&gt;|Hello World!!|}}

===Functions that execute in a separate process===
The definition of a function takes a command group. ''Any'' command group. Including the command group with parentheses rather than braces. So if we want, we can define a function that runs as a subprocess in its own environment as well. Here's hello world again, in a subprocess:

{{code:Basic|Hello world as a named function|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;hw() ( echo 'Hello World!!' )&lt;/source&gt;}}

It's all on one line this time to keep it short, but the same rules apply as before. And of course the same environment rules apply as well, so any variables defined in the function will not be available anymore once the function ends.

===Functions with parameters===
If you've done any programming in a different programming language you know that the most useful functions are those that take parameters. In other words, ones that don't always rigidly do the same thing but can be influenced by values passed in when the function is called. So here's an interesting question: can we pass parameters to a function? Can we create a definition like

{{bcode:Example|functionWithParams (ARG0, ARG1) { ''do something with ARG0 and ARG1'' } }}

And then make a call like 'functionWithParams(Hello, World)'? Well, the answer is simple: no. The parenthese are just there as a flag for the shell to let it know that the previous name is the name of a function rather than a variable and there is no room for parameters.

Or actually, it's more a case of the above being the simple answer rather than the answer being simple. You see, when you execute a function you are executing a command. To the shell there's really very little difference between executing a named function and executing 'ls'. It's a command like any other. And it may not be able to have parameters, but like any other command it can certainly have ''command line arguments''. So we may not be able to define a function with parameters like above, but we can certainly do this:

{{code:Output|Functions with command-line arguments
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ repeatOne () { echo $1; }
$ repeatOne 'Hello World!'&lt;/source&gt;
|Hello World!
|}}

And you can use any other variable from the environment as well. Of course, that's a nice trick for when you're calling a function from the command line in the interactive shell. But what about in a shell script? The positional variables for command-line arguments are already taken by the arguments to the shell script, right? Ah, but wait! Each command executed in the shell (no matter how it was executed) has its '''own''' set of command-line arguments! So there's no interference and you can use the same mechanism. For example, if we define a script like this:

{{code:Basic|function.sh: A function in a shell script
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh

myFunction() {
  echo $1
}

echo $1
myFunction
myFunction &quot;Hello World&quot;
echo $1&lt;/source&gt;}}

Then it executes exactly the way we want:

{{code:Output|Executing the function.sh script
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ . function.sh 'Goodbye World!!'&lt;/source&gt;
|Goodbye World!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hello World&lt;br/&gt;
Goodbye World!|}}

===Functions in the environment===
We've mentioned it before, but let's delve a little deeper into it now: what are functions exactly? We've hinted that they're an alias for a command list or a macro and that they're part of the environment. But what ''is'' a function exactly?

A function, as far as the shell is concerned, is just a very verbose variable definition. And that's really all it is: a name (a text string) that is associated with a value (some more text) and can be replaced by that value when the name is used. Just like a shell variable. And we can prove it too: just define a function in the interactive shell, then give the 'set' command (to list all the variable definitions in your current environment). Your function will be in the list.

Because functions are really a special kind of shell variable definition, they behave exactly the same way &quot;normal&quot; variables do:

*Functions are defined by listing their name, a definition operator and then the value of the function. Functions use a different definition operator though: '()' instead of '='. This tells the shell to add some special considerations to the function (like not needing the '$' character when using the function).
*Functions are part of the environment. That means that when commands are issued from the shell, functions are also copied into the copy of the environment that is given to the issued command.
*Functions can also be passed to new subprocesses if they are marked for export, using the 'export' command. Some shells will require a special command-line argument to 'export' for functions (bash, for instance, requires you to do an 'export -f' to export functions).
*You can drop function definitions by using the 'unset' command.

Of course, when you use them functions behave just like commands (they are expanded into a command list, after all). We've already seen that you can use command-line arguments with functions and the positional variables to match. But you can also [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Files and streams|redirect]] input and output to and from commands and pipe commands together as well.

Todo: write about Okinawa being a linguistic relative of Japanese, ww2-era efforts to get rid of the language, etc...

== ウチナーグチ vs 琉球語 vs 沖縄弁 ==
ウチナーグチ (''uchinaa guchi'') is the term that the people of Okinawa use when referring to their own language. This translates as &quot;Okinawa mouth&quot; or &quot;Okinawa language&quot;.

琉球語 (''ryuukyuugo'') is the word in standard Japanese that refers to the language of Okinawa (the &quot;Ryuukyuu kingdom&quot;, which is often spelled &quot;Ryukyu&quot;).

沖縄弁 (''okinawa-ben'') is the word for just the dialect of Okinawa. In other words, the way people from Okinawa speak Japanese.

Todo: expand this some more

== words ==
* アラン　(''aran'') : disagree
* デイジ (''deiji'') : serious
* マアサン (''maasan'') : delicious
* メンソーレ (''mensoore'') : welcome
* ウチナ (''uchina'') : Okinawa
* チュ (''chu'') : Person
* 海人: ウミンチュ (''uminchu'') : Person of the sea
* チュラ (''chura'') : pretty
* ヤナ (''yana'') : ugly
* チュラカギ / ヤナカギ (''churakagi / yanakagi'') : pretty person / ugly person

In the Okinawan dialect, it is possible to have words or names that begin with ん, which you will never see in standard 日本語.
* んたまぎる

It is also common to use phonemes that are not part of the normal (ひらがな) Japanese language (though you may see them in 外来語), such as とぅ, てぃ, and ぐぁ
* とぅい (''tui'') : bird.
* とぅんふぁ (''tunfa'') : a weapon used in Okinawan martial arts.
* やまとぅ (''yamatu'') : mainland Japan
* てぃち (''tichi'') : one thing (counter)
* いんぐぁ (''ingua'') : puppy

      <comment>XML is stricter than HTML</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is based loosely on HTML.  XML is used mainly to store and transfer information from one protocol or language to another.  The code for XML is very open, you can create your own tags though they must follow the syntax rules of XML which are very similar to but stricter than HTML.  For Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;my_info&gt;
    &lt;my_name&gt;Jeremy&lt;/my_name&gt;
    &lt;my_hair_color&gt;Blonde&lt;/my_hair_color&gt;
 &lt;/my_info&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, the structure is almost identical to that of HTML, but you are able to define your own tags.

* Stative
* Habitual
* Incomplete actions

While Japanese grammar doesn't always correspond to what we know from English, they both use auxiliary verbs in many circumstances.

Continuous tenses in English use the auxiliary verbs '''am''', '''are''', '''is''', '''was''' and '''were'''.

The Japanese language has a similar auxiliary verb '''いる''' with the ～て form of the verb.  

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Politeness of the 〜て form'''
! colspan=&quot;1&quot; | !! Non-past tense !! Past Tense 
|-
! Polite
| +います || +いました
|-
! Plain
| +いる || +いた
|}

== Uses ==

=== Continuous Actions ===
{{wikipedia|Continuous and progressive aspects}}
When speaking of continuous actions that occur in the present or occurred in the past, the form has the same meaning as the English continuous tense.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | past/non-past tense 
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | English
|-
! Plain || Polite
|-
| テレビを{{furi|見|み|ている}}。
| テレビを{{furi|見|み|ています}}。
|  I am watching television.
|-
| {{furi|音楽|おんがく}}を{{furi|聞|き|いている}}。
| {{furi|音楽|おんがく}}を{{furi|聞|き|いています}}。
| I am listening to music.
|-
| {{furi|雑誌|ざっし}}を{{furi|読|よ|んでいる}}。
| {{furi|雑誌|ざっし}}を{{furi|読|よ|んでいます}}。
|  I am reading a magazine.
|-
| {{furi|宿題|しゅくだい}}をしていた。
| {{furi|宿題|しゅくだい}}をしていました。
| I was doing my homework.
|-
| {{furi|友達|ともだち}}と{{furi|食|た|べていた}}。
| {{furi|友達|ともだち}}と{{furi|食|た|べていました}}。
| I was eating with a friend.
|}

=== Incomplete tasks ===

When you take the present-negative conjugation of いる, you're left with a sense an action not taking place.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | past/non-past tense 
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | English
|-
! Plain || Polite 
|-
| テストの勉強していない || テストの勉強していません||  I haven't done any studying for the test.
|-
|{{furi|宿題|しゅくだい}}をしていない
| まだ{{furi|宿題|しゅくだい}}をしていません
| I haven't done the homework yet.
|}

=== Habitual ===

This form may also be used to describe a habitual activity.  

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;padding-left: 2em; width: 50%;&quot; | USAトゥデーの新聞を読んでいます。
| I read the USA Today newspaper.
|}

=== Stative vs Non-stative verbs ===
Much like English, there are verbs that describe a state of the subject, rather than an action.  These type of verbs are called [[w:stative verbs|stative verbs]].  You may want to think of these as actions that started in the past, arrived to a state, and this state persists to the present.

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;padding-left: 2em; width: 50%;&quot; | 図書館は今、開いています。
| The library is open.
|}

=== くる, いく, and かえる ===
When the verbs くる, いく, and かえる are used in the ～て in conjuction with the auxiliary verb いる, they're translated as '''has come''', '''has gone''', and '''has returned''', respectively.

== Exceptions ==

There are some irregular cases with this form.  

# You can use the word 知っています, but not 知っていません.  Instead, you'll use the negative form of masu - 知りません.
# You also can't use ある, いる, and 要る in the ～ている form at all.  The same can be said with potential forms of verbs (e.g., 話せる).

== Colloquial Variations ==
When speaking at a high speed, sometimes syllables are dropped from words to make them easier to say. Colloquial variations of the continuous forms exist and are recognized in the Japanese language. While they are not used in proper writing, these forms are used in every day conversation, especially among friends and family.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;  
! colspan=&quot;1&quot; | !! Standard !! Colloquial variation 
|-
! Plain
| {{furi|電車|でんしゃ}}に{{furi|乗|の|っている}}
| {{furi|電車|でんしゃ}}に{{furi|乗|の|ってる}}
|-
! Polite 
| {{furi|電車|でなしゃ}}に{{furi|乗|の|っています}}
| {{furi|電車|でんしゃ}}に{{furi|乗|の|ってます}}
|}

All the sentences mean &quot;I am riding the train.&quot; Notice that the two sentences on the right have simply dropped the い　from いる／います. By dropping the い, the sentence becomes easier to say quickly. This is a standard colloquial form of the continuous tense, and it works with the non-past continuous and the past continuous. The above example is the present continuous, so let's see an example of the past continuous:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;1&quot; | !! Standard !! Colloquial variation 
|-
! Plain 
| {{furi|妹|いもうと}}と{{furi|遊|あそ|んでいた}}
| {{furi|妹|いもうと}}と{{furi|遊|あそ|んでた}}
|-
! Polite 
| {{furi|妹|いもうと}}と{{furi|遊|あそ|んでいました}}
| {{furi|妹|いもうと}}と{{furi|遊|あそ|んでました}}
|}

Once again, the い was dropped, which forms the colloquial variation. Just remember to use the standard form when writing, but when speaking, the colloquial version will be OK when speaking among friends. However, when speaking to someone of higher status, you may wish to use the standard polite 
form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the past several centuries, Christian Theologians point to the story of Adam and Eve as the Origin of Sin. This story proceeds that after God created Adam and Eve he also gave them instruction not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. A serpent, identified later in the Bible as Satan, persuaded Eve to eat of the fruit of this tree which God told them not to eat. She gave some fruit to Adam, and he also ate of it. They gained the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and then knew they were naked and were ashamed, and hurried to clothe themselves. God found them and, because they had disobeyed Him, cast them out of the Garden of Eden.  Mercifully, He also bestowed the gift of death, so that they would not live forever, separated from Himself.

This sin is believed to have been transmitted down the generations, a sin which only the sacrifice of Jesus could rectify. The Bible says that sin entered the world through one man, Adam. Sin is nothing more than disobedience of God. It is often argued that God created evil, but that could not be, since God is perfect.&lt;ref&gt;This is human logic. Human logic would also conclude that if you give power to do evil to a force when the force had no such power before, then you have created evil.&lt;/ref&gt;  He created mankind with free will, which included the ability to choose to disobey Him.  Without that ability to choose, man could never have chosen to love God; rather, we would have been like little wind-up dolls that always say, &quot;i love you&quot;, without really meaning it.  With Adam's choice&lt;ref&gt;''''However, Adam was not present when Eve  picked the fruit. There is nothing to say that she ever told him where the fruit came from. Therefore, Adam may have eaten without ever knowing from where it came. There is a second version of Genesis embedded within the other. One version merely observes that Adam and Eve left the Garden. All of this seems like a thin branch many would argue to claim God would separate us from God for such acts. Perhaps, only we can choose to separate ourselves. If we do, it's speculative what can happen, but without that choice,(rejecting God) God loves us.&lt;/ref&gt;, sin entered the world and with it death.''''

We are born with the stain of that original sin, and our nature is to satisfy ourselves rather than obey God.  But God cannot tolerate sin or be in its presence.  We sinners have to have another way of getting to God's abode, which we call heaven.  God so loved the (people in the) world that He gave His only Son to die a sacrificial death, to atone for man's sins, and to provide the redemption that man needs in order to get to heaven and live forever in God's presence.  But He placed a condition on that redemption:  believe in Jesus as the Savior, the One capable of forgiving one's sins.  That belief leads to repentance and a desire to please God.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose==
Can someone explain to me what direction they think this book is intended to take? I'd be happy to help out, but I'd don't think the goal is clear.  Is this intended to be a history of, introduction to, user guide for, or something else altogether? I think making real progress on a useful book would go better is a direction were to be given. --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 04:33, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Author==
Why does it say that the Linux &quot;Operating System&quot; was written by Linux Torvalds?
No disrespect to the man, but he did not write the operating system.
That was started by Richard Stallman 5 years before Linus started working on his kernel.

Linux is a kernel of an operating system.

Unless someone has any objections, I would like to modify this article.
:Since early November of this year the opening line has been: 
:''Linux is a Unix-like open source '''kernel''' written by Linus Torvalds...''
:So I'm not clear on what your concern is. --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 16:57, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::From a Linux developer who's been following Linux for over a decade... '''NO.'''

::The GNU project was indeed started first, and Linux (the whole thing) does indeed use some tools from the GNU project. The X and BSD projects are even older, and the GNU project uses parts of them. Heck, the GNU kernel uses large chunks of Linux kernel code for hardware drivers, filesystem support, and networking. If we are to believe that it is somehow right to give credit in the ''name'' of an OS, then why is GNU not crediting Linux for providing Hurd with life support? Why is GNU not crediting X or BSD?

::GNU/Linux is a very obvious attempt to latch onto success. This is being done very rudely and forcefully, without getting concensus from the actual developers. This goes on at many levels, including the OS names used to configure projects that use the auto* tools. In no way did the GNU project write the Linux OS. Parts of the GNU OS were found suitable for Linux, just as parts of BSD were found suitable for GNU.

::BTW, OS kernels do not traditionally have distinct names. They are &quot;the kernel&quot; or &quot;the exec&quot;.

::Finally, we have the simple facts of marketing. At least in English, &quot;GNU&quot; is a very ugly sounding word. The &quot;/&quot; looks complicated and hostile. Humans have emotional responses to sounds, like it or not.

::[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:43, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::Reading the GNU philosophies when talking about them is as important as reading the manual for a program.
:::[[User:A thing|A thing]] 05:01, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:::The filename of the kernel is linux-''version''.tar.bz2. The simlink to the source is /usr/src/linux. The kernel image is usually stored, or the simlink is /boot/vmlinuz. Besides, calling it only Linux makes it seem as if it is made as one giant product. Unlike Windows, a distribution is actually a zillion independent projects being either pressed, or burned onto a series of CDs.

::::Well, as I said: &quot;OS kernels do not traditionally have distinct names.&quot; As for the zillion independent projects, I'd say that's a good argument ''against'' the &quot;GNU/&quot; crud. My own independent project, procps, does not support the GNU kernel (Hurd) at all. Some of the old and important projects, like X, predate the whole GNU idea. Lots of recent (and not-so-recent) code is coming from BSD. Even the so-called &quot;GNU&quot; projects, like gcc and glibc, are mainly supported by Linux vendors and embedded systems companies. The true history of Linux is that the ''kernel'' was written, and then people like Theodore T'so and H. J. Lu went around to various places (BSD, GNU, alt.sources usenet archives, etc.) grabbing what was needed to have a userspace. In general, the early core developers of Linux have never accepted &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; as a legit term. Many have objected. Today the term is even an abuse of the Linux trademark registered to Linus Torvalds. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:23, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::::Also, uname --kernel-name prints &quot;Linux&quot;, while uname --operating-system, prints &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;. Tools that are estential to GNU/Linux, like coreutils, gcc, glibc, bash, where all originaly created by the GNU project. Also, the whole philosphy came from the GNU project. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 03:39, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::Guess why the &quot;--operating-system&quot; option was invented. As I said above, this recent political power grab is &quot;being done very rudely and forcefully&quot;. By this I mean things like the uname command. Some tools, essential to '''Linux'''&amp;reg;, were created by the BSD project, yet we do not call the OS BSD/Linux. All of the &quot;GNU&quot; tools you mention have been primarily developed by Linux distributers. If you go back prior to the Linux effort, these tools were trivial junk. It would have been nearly as easy to use BSD code, but by chance, FSF &quot;GNU&quot; tools were chosen. Only a small part of the philosophy comes from the GNU project; BSD is older and wasn't even the first. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:24, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::::::So? How much of the kernel do you think was written by Linux Torvalds? Not much. But he's givin credit because he started it. Besides, RMS can do what you said, because the FSF distributes the coreutils package that contains uname. And yes, GNU/Linux uses part of BSD, just like every other opearting system does. Waddya mean only a little bit of the philosphy comes from GNU? The kernel uses the GNU GPL. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 14:26, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::::It doesn't matter how much of Linux&amp;reg; was written by Linus. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that an operating system name is an appropriate place to be giving ''anyone'' credit. Linus didn't name his own OS, and even if he had, so what? The name is a good-sounding marketable name in most (all?) languages. &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; is an abomination, purely political, created because RMS was sore about his Hurd project being upstaged by Linux. RMS is jealous and whiny, and should be treated as such. The GNU GPL is only a codification of prior existing philosophy. RMS didn't invent the idea. Sure, we can give him credit for getting a lawyer to write things up, but ''not'' in the operating system name. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:57, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::::Note that Windows is not called Bill/Windows, and MacOS is not called SteveOS. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:57, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::::Suppose you wrote an OS, and your friend named it Reubal. Then a few other friends help you port some BSD code to run on your system, along with whatever else they can find. Years later, when Reubal is having major success, Marshall Kirk McKusick rudely and jealously demands that you call your OS &quot;Reubsdal&quot; to give himself credit. Your friends ridicule this offensive idea. Marshall Kirk McKusick then starts telling everyone that your OS is really named BSD/Reubal. Soon, many outsiders start to believe this tale. After all, if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:57, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::::P.S. The X Windows System isn't really part of the operating system, it's a program that's run on it, similar to how one might run WinRAR on Windows. Sure, it's estential for every user, but it's not part ot the core of the operating system. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 03:43, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::Even Richard Stallman considers X to be part of a GNU operating system. Part of his claim to owning the right to rename Linux&amp;reg; is that he himself had the idea to cobble together a complete system from X, BSD, and more. When a crowd of Linux hackers (H. J. Lu and Theodore T'so in particular) did this, Richard Stallman felt that his idea had been stolen. Well, the idea was obvious, and Richard Stallman didn't patent it. Even AT&amp;amp;T and Sun were doing this with commercial UNIX&amp;reg;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:24, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Naming issues aside, just count the times someone says that the Linux '''Operating System''' was firstly written by Linus Torvalds and you will know what is unfair in this discussion. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:57, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

== Joining [[Guide to UNIX]]? ==

I added [[Linux]] to the table of contents for [[Guide to UNIX]].
*I had wanted a Guide to UNIX/BSD page. I found and expanded a [[BSD]] stub.
*I noticed that the Linux module was mostly links. My idea is that this page is not [[wikipedia:Linux|the Wikipedia article]], nor [[Linux For Newbies]], nor [[Linux software howtos]], nor [[BSD bookshelf]]. I made this module analogous with BSD module.
*Thus I decided to use this page instead of making a Guide to UNIX/Linux page.
[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:59, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
: I propose renaming [[Linux]] to [[Guide to UNIX/Linux and GNU]]. Comment here. [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:06, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
:: Moved, minus the political nonsense. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:06, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
::: Good. Call it [[Guide to UNIX/Linux]] because it is not about GNU. [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:18, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

After the move, [[Linux]] still redirected to here. I tried to make [[Linux]] point to [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf#Linux]] instead so people who type &quot;Linux&quot; and click Go would see the list of Wikibooks for Linux. However, automatic redirect drops the part after #... So now I am expecting that readers going to [[Linux]] will see [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf]] and be able to find the Linux section. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:35, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

The '''begin''' keyword in [[Ada Programming|Ada]] is almost synonymous with the &lt;tt&gt;{&lt;/tt&gt; in [[Programming:C|C]]/[[Programming:C_plus_plus|C++]]/[[Programming:Java|Java]].  In the paradigm of structured programming languages, a keyword or symbol is often needed to delimit the beginning of the body from the element (i.e. if, elsif, for loop, while loop) to which it pertains.

For the case of subprograms, packages, tasks and blocks this word is {{Ada/kw|begin}}.

For example
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Some_Procedure {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Do_Something;
     Do_Something_Else;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Some_Procedure;

The '''begin''' keyword is always closed with the {{Ada/keyword|end}} keyword. The opposite is not true in Ada.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Burning CDs and DVDs with K3B  ==

K3B ([http://www.k3b.org/Website: k3b.org]) is a CD and DVD burner for Linux. Technically, it is a front-end for some of the commands given in the &quot;using the console&quot; section below.

K3B requires [[w:KDE|KDE]] (see also [[Using KDE|KDE how-to]]) to run.

== Burning CDs and DVDs with Brasero ==

Brasero ([http://projects.gnome.org/brasero/ gnome.org]) is a popular GTK+ CD burning software. It is part of the GNOME project. 

==Burning CDs and DVDs using xcdroast==
xcdroast ([http://www.xcdroast.org/]) is an alternative front end to cdrtools, which does not require KDE. Similarly to K3B and other such programs, it acts as a front end to automate commands which would normally be entered from the console.

== Burning CDs and DVDs using the Console ==

=== 1. Make an ISO Image ===

An [[w:ISO image|ISO Image]] is a file which contains all the data required on the CD or DVD - that is, all the files plus the directory structure. An ISO file is about the same size as all the files it is created from.

There are several ISO formats available, 

To make the ISO in Linux, use '''mkisofs''. mkisofs has many options to control how to handle CD and DVD creation - these include how linux-style filenames are converted to work for Windows and Apple Mac, and options for creation of a boot-cd. However, the standard command is:

; mkisofs -r -o ''&lt;file&gt;'' ''&lt;dir&gt;''

The easiest way to make an CD/DVD image is to copy all the files required in a new directory, such as &quot;myproject&quot;. Then just run the command
 mkisofs -r -o /tmp/myimage.iso myproject
to create the image. The image size should not be larger than the size of the CD (~ 700MB) or DVD (~ 4.4GB).

Note also that the FAT32 file system can only manage files of less than 4GB (which is less than the maximum DVD size)

=== 2. Identify a CD drive ===

To burn the CD or DVD, we'll use ''cdrecord''. The following command lists all the CD-R and DVD-R drives. and provides an address (a SCSI-style address)
 cdrecord -scanbus

=== 3. Burn the CD ===
Burn the CD or DVD with:
 cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=''&lt;dev&gt;'' [blank=fast] -data  ''&lt;cd_image&gt;''
Use blank=fast to clear all data from a CD-RW. cd_image is the ISO file created in step 1.

Example:
 cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,6,0 -data  /tmp/myimage.iso

== Creation of Video DVDs ==

For DVDs to work in a DVD player, the movies and file structure must be very specific. A guide to creating a DVD video is given at [http://wiki.videolan.org/ VideoLan Wiki] - see [http://wiki.videolan.org/How_to_Create_a_DVD Making a DVD Video with VLC].

== Comparative ==

The main methods of constructing comparative sentences use the words &quot;より&quot; and &quot;{{furi|方|ほう}}&quot;. They can be used individually or together. The former indicates inferiority while the latter superiority (but note that ''superiority'' can indicate &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;cheaper&quot;, &quot;smaller&quot;, etc).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;superior object&gt; の方が &lt;inferior object&gt; より &lt;adjective&gt; です
|}

Let's look at a few examples asserting that pizza (ピザ) is more delicious than sushi ({{furi|寿司|すし}}). Take the noun that is superior (in this case, more delicious) and affix &quot;の{{furi|方|ほう}}が&quot; to it. Then, take the inferior noun and append it with &quot;より&quot;:
{{Japanese example|
: ピザの方が寿司より
}}
This essentially means &quot;Pizza is more than sushi.&quot; but we have yet to explain in what fashion pizza out-does sushi. In this case, we are describing how delicious so we choose &quot;おいしい&quot;. To be polite, we will add the polite copula &quot;です&quot; to the end of the sentence.
{{Japanese example|
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''より'''おいしいです。
}}
The adjective can be changed to anything you'd like.
{{Japanese example|
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''より'''{{furi|臭|くさ|い}}です。// Pizza is smellier than sushi.
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''より'''{{furi|安|やす|い}}です。// Pizza is cheaper than sushi.
}}

=== Variations ===
It doesn't matter which part comes first; &quot;〜の方が&quot; or &quot;〜より&quot; so the following are both grammatically correct:
{{Japanese example|
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''より'''おいしいです。
: 寿司'''より'''ピザ'''の方が'''おいしいです。
}}
The adjective, however, must always come last with the copula.

One may drop one of &quot;より&quot; or &quot;の方&quot; when the comparison is clear from context.
{{Japanese example|
: そのピザはおいしいですか？ — Is that pizza tasty?
: はい、でも寿司の方がおいしかったです。 — Yes, but the sushi was tastier.
: はい、寿司よりです。 — Yes, better than the sushi.}}

Though it is not standard, &quot;の方が&quot; can be replaced with &quot;は&quot;. Some people may find this easier to remember.

Instead of &quot;より&quot;, you can say &quot;よりも&quot;. This is mostly restricted to speech and adds emphasis. Others may use it simply because they like to say it instead of plain &quot;より&quot;. You can choose for yourself which you'd like to use.
{{Japanese example|
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''よりも'''おいしいですよ！
}}

There is also &quot;もっと&quot; which means &quot;more&quot; or &quot;to a greater degree&quot;.
{{Japanese example|
: 一緒だともっと楽しいです。 — It's more enjoyable together.}}

== Superlative ==

In Japanese one can express the superlative by stating that it is &quot;''the most ~''&quot;, or that is &quot;''more ~ than anything/anyone''&quot;.

=== The most ~ ===

Depending on formality, you may use &quot;もっとも&quot; or &quot;一番&quot; (いちばん, ''e.'' number one). The superlative is formed by prepending this to the adjective.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| style=&quot;color:gray&quot; | (&lt;subject&gt; は/が) || もっとも&lt;br /&gt;一番 || &lt;adjective&gt; || です&lt;br /&gt;だ || 。
|}
{{Japanese example|
: 一番おいしい // The most delicious.
: 一番{{furi|高|たか|い}} // The most expensive (or The highest).
: 一番{{furi|長|なが|い}} // The longest.
: 一番{{furi|悲|かな|しい}} // The saddest.
}}
With a subject:
{{Japanese example|
: 一番{{furi|素敵|すてき|な}}{{furi|人|ひと}}です。 // The greatest person.
: {{furi|彼女|かのじょ}}にとって、{{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|一番|いちばん}}{{furi|素敵|すてき|な}}{{furi|人|ひと}}です。// From my girlfriend's point of view, I am the greatest person.
}}
You can also modify a noun by placing it after the adjective. Take a look at these examples:
{{Japanese example|
: この{{furi|小説|しょうせつ}}は一番{{furi|有名|ゆうめい}}です。 // This novel is the most famous.
: これは一番{{furi|有名|ゆうめい|な}}{{furi|小説|しゅうせつ}}です。 // This is the most famous novel.
: その{{furi|映画|えいが}}は一番{{furi|悲|かな|しい}}です。// That movie is the saddest.
: それは一番{{furi|悲|かな|しい}}{{furi|映画|えいが}}です。// That is the saddest movie.
}}

=== More than anything ===
This method has two forms with the same structure, but a different word depending on whether it refers to something that is animate or inanimate.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! animate
| &lt;Name, pronoun or creature&gt; || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | は || {{furi|誰|だれ}} || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | より (Adjective) です。
|-
! inanimate
| &lt;Noun&gt; || {{furi|何|なに}}
|}
Instead of just &quot;{{furi|何|なに}}より&quot;or &quot;{{furi|誰|だれ|より}}&quot;, you can say &quot;{{furi|何|なに}}よりも&quot; or &quot;{{furi|誰|だれ}}よりも&quot;. It's up to you which form you choose to use. Here are some examples!
{{Japanese example|
: お{{furi|母|かあ}}さん'''は誰より'''{{furi|恋|こい|しい}}です。 // I miss my mother more than anyone.
: この{{furi|手紙|てがみ}}'''は何より'''{{furi|大切|たいせつ}}です！ // This letter is more important to me than anything!
: この{{furi|歌|うた}}'''は何よりも'''きれいですね。 // This song is prettier than anything, isn't it?
}}

== Computing in Japanese ==

=== Windows ===
It is necessary to do some minor changes in order to displaying Japanese text.

==== Windows 2000/XP ====
For Windows 2000/XP reading support, you will need to install a [[Wikipedia:Unicode|Unicode]] typeface, such as 'Code2000' or [[Wikipedia:Arial|Arial]] Unicode MS. Both will cover nearly all of the non-Latin scripts used throughout Wikipedia.

For input support, you will need to install the East Asian language files. You can do this from the 'Control Panel'. Open the 'Regional and Language Options' and navigate to the 'Languages' tab. Minimally, you will want to check the box for 'Install files for East Asian languages', though you may wish to also install the complex script files, too. Clicking 'Apply' will install the 'Arial Unicode MS', 'MS Mincho' and 'MS Gothic' families of fonts. All of these fonts contain the [[Wikipedia:Hiragana|Hiragana]] and [[Wikipedia:Katakana|Katakana]] scripts, as well as a substantial majority of the Kanji characters most commonly used. 

Depending on how your computer was initially setup, you may need the original source CD to complete the installation. Your computer will prompt you to insert the CD if it is necessary

If this does not work you can also download and install the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=24A66277-CD9F-4332-A6F1-52B85A6470BD&amp;displaylang=en&amp;Hash=VQCJ9MB Office XP Tool: Japanese Language Pack] from the Microsoft website.

==== Inputting Japanese Text ====

In the 'Regional and Language Options' Control Panel applet, choose the 'Languages' tab. Ensure that the 'Install files for East Asian languages' checkbox is selected. Click the 'Details...' button. Click the 'Add' button and choose 'Japanese'. Click the 'OK' buttons as necessary to close all dialog boxes.

To test the new settings, open any Unicode-enabled text processing application, such as [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]]. Press the combination ''[Alt]+[Shift]'' on your keyboard until 'JP' replaces 'EN' in the new section of your taskbar. To input hiragana, enter the Japanese input mode by pressing ''[Alt]+[~]''.

Type a Japanese word using romaji keys (e.g. &quot;''nihongo''&quot;) and either press ''[Enter]'' to leave that text in hiragana (e.g. &quot;にほんご&quot;), [F7] to change the text into katakana, or ''[Spacebar]'' then ''[Enter]'' to choose an alternative version containing kanji (e.g. &quot;日本語&quot;).

To return to English input mode, press ''[Alt]+[~]'' again.

=== Windows 95/98/ME ===
To install a Japanese typeface, simply open '''Internet Explorer''' and open a web page coded in Japanese. An Install-on-Demand window should appear, asking to install Japanese text support. After completing this install, the Japanese page should display correctly. (Please note: Wikibooks is not coded in Japanese. Try [http://www.google.co.jp/ Google in Japanese].)

== Mac OS X ==
Apple computers display Japanese characters out of the box, and are capable of inputting Japanese characters very simply. To do so, open up System Preferences (located in the &quot;Dock&quot;) or click the Apple icon in the top left of your display and click 'System Preferences...'. Next, select 'International' and then the 'Input Menu' tab. Scroll down until you see 'Kotoeri' and check the box to the left of it. This will by default enable the input methods 'Hiragana', 'Katakana' and 'Romaji'.

To switch between your normal input and Hiragana quickly you can do one of two things. The first way to do this is to enable the input menu in the menu bar (you do this by checking the box next to 'Show input menu in menu bar' in the same place described previously), this will put a flag in the upper right part of your display. To change between input methods click the flag and select the new method. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard combination Command + Space Bar to switch between methods, although this is problematic in Apple's new operating system Tiger as this is also the shortcut for Spotlight. There are also direct shortcuts of Ctrl-Shift-; for Romaji, Ctrl-Shift-J for Hiragana, and Ctrl-Shift-K for Katakana.

Please note, while in the Hiragana input method you can temporarily switch to Katakana by holding down the shift key in much the same way that you temporarily hold down the shift key to type capital letters in English.

== X11 (GNU/Linux, UNIX-like, etc.) ==
For displaying Japanese, you will need the correct fonts selected. Please refer to your distribution's documentation for more on that.

You will need a helper application for inputting Japanese characters. The most prominent are:
* [http://code.google.com/p/uim/ uim]
* [http://www.scim-im.org/ SCIM]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humans divide objects which they observe into categories.  According to one definition, Philosophy is the discipline of how humans determine these categories, communicate about them and interact with them. 

Aesthetics is the sub-discipline of philosophy which acknowledges that humans interact with their environment in the context of sensual experiences.  

These experiences include color and sound.  A question which is fair game for Aesthetics might be: &quot;What combinations of notes sound good together?&quot;  This is an old question and may demonstrate various trends in philosophy.  The answer to this question changes over time.  The categories of which chords sound good and which sound bad have changed over time.  

Another similar question is which colors look good together.  This is completely analogous to the above question about musical harmonies.  One may also ask which colors or sounds may easily be distinguished. 

A philosopher who is inclined towards linguistics may take the result of these inquiries and ask what languages are possible given the combinations of symbols such as colors or harmony rather than the symbols of distinguishable vocal utterances.

You should read the excellent Irving Stone books about Van Gogh (&quot;Lust for Life&quot;) and Michelangelo (&quot;The Agony and the Ecstacy&quot;) what you will take from them is a new appreciation of the learning process and development of the artist.  Both of these men accepted that it would take them years to get to grips with their media -- as not only did they want to master their mediums but both were revolutionizing them, taking both painting and sculpture into unexplored territories.  The realisation both artists had was that not only would the development take time but that they also needed to live life along the way.

Peter Biskind (a close observer of filmmakers and filmmaking) said that, apart from a few exceptional cases (Welles, Tarantino), it takes at least five to ten years for a director to learn this art/craft.  Sometimes it seems like we can be in a huge rush to get there: we make a couple of shorts and then want to make a feature with a big budget.  Michelangelo spent years drawing, working with wax and clay before being trusted with expensive marble.

Go a bit easy on yourself if a few years into your film career you have not made something with which you are hugely pleased; this is a complex art form requiring many technical skills and a lot of knowledge and experience, and the tools are in the midst of a huge revolution.  Expect things to take awhile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Microeconomics?==

'''Microeconomics''' is how people deal with money, time, and resources. Microeconomics deals with the individual aspect of it while ''macroeconomics'' deals with aggregates at the level of an entire economy (e.g. total demand or total supply of goods in the national economy).  Microeconomics deals with the economic interactions of a specific person, a single entity or a company. These interactions, which mainly are buying and selling goods, occur in markets. In other words Microeconomics is the study of individual market. For instance an economist may study the market for compact discs, the firms that sell compact discs and any other groups that influence the price and availability of compact discs, such as the government. 

The branch of economics that analyzes the market behavior of individual consumers and firms in an attempt to understand the decision-making process of firms and households. It is concerned with the interaction between individual buyers and sellers and the factors that influence the choices made by buyers and sellers. In particular, microeconomics focuses on patterns of supply and demand and the determination of price and output in individual markets (e.g. coffee industry).

There are two main concepts that we need to understand in Microeconomics that form the basis of not only Microeconomics, but all economic theory. The concepts are supply and demand, and scarcity. With just these two concepts, we can understand almost all human economic behavior. Or Microeconomics is field of economics is broken down into two distinct areas of study: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics looks at the smaller picture and focuses more on basic theories of supply and demand and how individual businesses decide how much of something to produce and how much to charge for it. People who have any desire to start their own business or who want to learn the rationale behind the pricing of particular products and services would be more interested in this area.

Macroeconomics, on the other hand, looks at the big picture (hence &quot;macro&quot;). It focuses on the national economy as a whole and provides a basic knowledge of how things work in the business world. For example, people who study this branch of economics would be able to interpret the latest Gross Domestic Product figures or explain why a 6% rate of unemployment is not necessarily a bad thing. Thus, for an overall perspective of how the entire economy works, you need to have an understanding of economics at both the micro and macro levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Preface==

Monetary economics is the study of the money market in an economy - the market which, in most macroeconomic models, is represented by the supply of savings available to meet the demand for investment. In the basic macroeconomic models, this market is assumed to clear, by means of an equilibrium interest rate. However, in most countries residing in the real world, the interest rate is managed by the central bank, simply because the money market tends not to clear on its own. The ability to set the interest rate has become a powerful economic management tool in the arsenal of finance ministers throughout the world today, but there are some instances where countries have voluntarily given it up.

This document will attempt to define the nebulous item often labelled as 'money' by economists. It will then set out the factors affecting the demand and supply of money in an economy, and explore the reasons why the money market does not clear. This document will then move on to monetary policy and global monetary economic history - the practice and ramifications of 'real world' monetary economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Money?==

It is useful when defining the entity 'money' to look at what 'money' is used for, at least according to economists. There are 3 generally accepted uses of money:

# As a medium of exchange
# As a unit of account
# As a store of value

We can then approach the question of exactly what 'money' is by taking 'money' to mean that entity which we can use to fulfil the functions of 'money', as defined above. It is then possible to measure money in the real world, making decisions as to what form of monetary balance would meet our criteria of what 'money' is. Moreover, this approach enables us to section the money market along the various lines defined by the different motives to hold money, increasing the flexibility of our analytic model.

This section will look at each function of money in turn, and examine how each function affects the definition of money. We then look at the practical measurement of money in the real world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Money as a Unit of Account==

===The Classical Function of Money===
Classical economists modelled the demand for money in terms of its use as a unit of account. Money can be used to denote the value of goods, enabling participants in a transaction to measure the value of the transaction item in a common factor. This reduces transaction costs, especially information costs, as there is less possibility of adverse selection.

Under a barter system with no common unit of accounting, a successful transaction depends on the occurrence of a coincidence of wants. This could be surmounted by one party giving credit to another, that is, for the party to accept payment in kind in the future for a good sold today. Even if there were no credit risk (i.e. payment could be strictly enforced) the selling party would still have to gather information regarding the future worth of the good he is contracted to be paid in. 

In addition, the selling party would have to know the values of all goods in the economy, denominated in the values of every other good. This causes the information costs required to trade to rise significantly.

====Example - the generalised case of n commodities====

If there are 2 commodities in the economy, for trade to take place only one price need be known by the trading parties. If there are 3 commodities, the price of commodity A in terms of commodities B and C must be known, and the price of commodity B in terms of commodity C, giving a total of 3 prices. And so on, as the number of commodities rises. For &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; commodities the number of prices is given by: 


&lt;math&gt;{n(n-1)} \over 2&lt;/math&gt;


Given the presence of a universal denominator of value however, the number of prices that must be known is reduced to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. (Meltzer, 1998)

===The Price Level===

Transactions denominated in a common unit of account would determine prices, and it would then be possible to aggregate these prices into a price level for the economy. Given the price level, it is therefore possible to determine inflation. Here money does not affect the real value of the transactions in the economy. Money would therefore be said to be neutral, if the unit of account function were the only function of money in the economy.

===The Standard of Deferred Payment===

A related function is the standard of deferred payment, whereby money is defined as that entity used to specify future payments for current transactions. Here there is a relation to the store of value function, as the nominal value of money now and at the payment time in the future is invariant, making the contracted future payment affected by the interest rate. Of course, the real value of the future payment is also affected by inflation.

===Money under the Unit of Account Function===

Put simply, anything that enables transactions to be valued. The definition of money used here can constitute the money stock, bank deposits, etc etc. There is a slight distinction between the money stock defined under the function of money as a means of exchange and the function of money as a unit of account, as prices need not be defined in the currency used as a means of exchange. However in this case an exchange rate between the currency used as a means of account and the currency used as a means of exchange must be known. The money stock is the amount of money as defined under the means of exchange function.

====Example - The island of Yap====

On the island of Yap in Micronesia, large stones were used as money. Due to the problems associated with transporting such stones, islanders soon moved to an exchange system whereby claims on the stones were used in a transaction. Here the unit of account was the stones, while the means of exchange was the claims (written down on paper). However, there was a well defined exchange rate between claim and stone.

The money supply here does not encompass both the stock of claims and the stock of stones however. It consists of the stock of stones, or the stock of claims as defined by the exchange rate between claim and stone.

==Money as an Asset==

===Money and Bonds===

To analyse this motive for holding money properly we need to distinguish between 'money' and 'bonds'. Bonds here are defined as any sort of asset that pays interest, while money does not pay any interest income. We further assume that the asset allocation choice is purely between money and bonds, that is, a person can only hold either money or bonds, implying that holding money incurs a cost - that of interest income foregone.

===The Speculative Motive===

Economic agents who hold money for this motive hold it because there is the price of money is invariant to the rate of interest, unlike bonds. It protects the agent from any risk associated with changes in the interest rate.

In this instance, money acts as a store of value, allowing the agent to transfer real purchasing power from the present to the future (assuming inflation is zero). Bonds are not as useful as money here because their value changes with fluctuations in the interest rate.

===Money under the Asset Function===

So what constitutes money under this definition? Essentially, anything that doesn't pay interest income, but can be used as a store of wealth, and does not change its nominal value under changes in interest rates. In this case, interest bearing bank deposits are not counted as money. The definition of money is likely to be confined to the money stock and non-interest bearing bank deposits.

==Money as a Means of Exchange==

===The Transactions and Precautionary Motives===

These motives for holding money were initially postulated by Keynes. The transactions motive is simply that money is required in order to make transactions, and therefore any economic agent who wants to make transactions will want to hold money.

The precautionary motive is related to the transactions motive. In an economy where there is uncertainty regarding the timing of economic transactions, i.e. agents are not certain when they will be able, or want, to make a transaction, an economic agent will want to hold a certain amount of money at all times in order to have some on hand each time he decides to make a transaction.
It also means holding of money for a certain purpose like: paying salary/wages to the workers, primarily intended to meet expenditures of the company.

===Money under the Means of Exchange Function===

Here, anything that can be used in a transaction can be considered money. This definition is fairly broad, encompassing the money stock, bank deposits, mutual funds, funds deposited in checking accounts, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Face modelling is a fun and skillful way of creating detailed characters. Here is a simple step by step process of starting to create a head model and being able to edit the object on both sides simultaneously. It requires skillful mastery to model a realistic head model with full Materials/Texture Mapping. 

This method is just one of many different techniques for making a head. In this method, we will start with a circle and extrude it to create the head shape, and also apply mirroring so we can make a nice symmetrical head and only do half the work.

Other techniques may be to start with a cube or circle, but most techniques will use the mirroring trick described here.

==Creating the outline==
# Start with an empty space and Switch to side view. ('''NUM3''')
# Add simple circle mesh with 8 vertices (Press '''SPACE'''; select MESH&gt;CIRCLE) Adjust slider to 8.
# Now you are looking at the profile view of a basic 8 vertex circle. Select each vertex and use the [G=Grab] key to spread each vertex carefully to create a Contour outline for the side view of a head. You may also '''WKEY''' &gt; '''Subdivide''' to subdivide each segment to add more vertices for more detail.

Once you have completed your Contour Profile in step 3, we'll turn our two-dimensional circle into 3D.

==Extruding and mirroring==
'''Make sure you set up the mirror correctly before continuing.'''
# Switch to FRONT VIEW ('''NUM1''').
# Deselect all of the circle ('''AKEY'''). Next, press '''EKEY''' to extrude and choose &quot;Only Edges&quot;. Use '''XKEY''' to extrude the circle's contour profile along the X axis.
# Move the mouse to the left a reasonable distance and click to fix the new points. This will create an open-ended prism of your defined face shape.
# Switch to Object mode ('''Tab'''), and select the object.
# Now, use '''ALT'''+'''DKEY''' to duplicate the object as a link. Now any changes you make to the original will affect the duplicate and vice versa.
# With the duplicate still selected, hit '''CTRL'''+'''MKEY''' &gt; '''Z axis''' to flip the duplicate about the Z axis. Now any changes made to one will affect the other in reverse. Thus you have two sides of the head which you can edit at the same time.
# Drag the duplicate so that it is lined up with the original, and their centres are exactly touching (even zoom in very far to make sure of this fact).
# Now model one side of the head until you are happy with it. Even if you apply smoothing, there will be an ugly crease/seam down the centre. Don't worry about this just yet!

(What can you do about this line down the middle...do you weld it at some point? JHS 12/24/2005)
(If you apply the subsurf modifier then weld the inside vertices it goes away. 9/13/2006)

==Modeling the Head==

(THIS AREA MUST BE FILLED) 5-26-08

==Merging the sides and removing the seam==
# Switch into Object mode ('''Tab''') and select both sides of the head
# Join the objects with '''CTRL'''+'''JKEY''' each pair of close vertices and press '''ALT'''+'''MKEY'''-&gt;'''At Center''' to merge them
# To view it in subsurfaced mode, switch into Object mode ('''Tab'''), press '''Add Modifier''' in the buttons window, and select '''Subsurf'''. You can adjust the amount of subsurfacing using the '''Levels''' and '''Render Levels''' sliders. To get rid of the body look of the model, press '''Set Smooth''' in the Links and Materials section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==An Extemp Tournament Step by Step==

===The Draw===

Before every round, you will be with the other extempers in the draw room, usually a library or other large room. This is where you will select your topic. A judge or tournament official sits at the head of the room and calls out speakers at seven minute intervals. (“First speakers, please come draw”, etc.) When your number is called, walk up to the table and draw three questions from the envelope or off the table. Look at all three questions and decide which one you are best prepared to answer. Return the other two and walk back to your table.

===Preparing the Speech===

You have thirty minutes to prepare a speech, beginning from when you were called up to the table. Don't panic! It really is not as bad as it seems. As you walk back to your table, go to the extemp tubs and take out any folders you think might help you answer the question. Return to your speech-writing place and start working. Look over the evidence and familiarize yourself with the topics. Decide how to answer the question and create three points. Add sources to your speech, tie it to your point, and create impacts. Finally, create your intro and conclusion.
Now, you're ready to practice the speech. Find a relatively quiet corner in the prep room and start practicing your speech. Don't worry if you make any mistakes : that's what practice is for. Don't worry about memorizing the speech word-for-word, but do memorize your points, your introduction and conclusion, and your sources, so that you can effectively deliver the speech from memory.

===A Few Prep Tips===

*Many people will tell you that you should spend X number of minutes writing and Y number of minutes preparing your speech. Don't listen to them. When you feel like you're done writing your speech, start to practice it. Develop your own habits that help you.
*Become an “expert” in one or two topic areas, so that you always know you can take a question about those topics. Be familiar, however, with everything, just in case you have to answer a different question.
*NEVER, NEVER, NEVER write out the whole speech. All you need is introduction, three points, support for those points, and conclusion. That provides the most value for every minute of your time.
*Be sure to write out a blank outline on your paper BEFORE the draw. You'd be surprised how much time it saves.
*Get a timer and keep your own prep time. The extemp room manager will announce time at infrequent intervals, but it is always better to always know how much time is remaining.

===Giving the speech===

Before the draw, you'll have checked to see what room you are delivering the speech in. Perhaps you'll have even gone there beforehand so you know where it is. At any rate, when your 30 minutes has expired, walk to the room. Wait outside until the speaker in the room is finished. If you have extra time, continue practicing your speech. When they leave, follow in behind them, leaving your notes outside. As you enter the room, the judge will be finishing the ballot from the last speaker. Walk up to him or her and hand them the question silently. They will confirm your name or speaker code and write the question on your ballot. Ask what kind of time signals they will be giving. Before you start, ask whether or not the judge is ready. When they acknowledge you, start. 
Give your speech. Don't worry about getting phrasings exactly like you had them in practice, the judge will never know. Be sure to make eye contact with the judge and anyone else who may be in the room. Make hand gestures when appropriate to add emphasis to your speech. As you see the one minute remaining signal, wrap up your final point and move into your conclusion. Ideally, your speech will be 6:30, but should be somewhere between 6 and 7 minutes. When your speech is finished, wait for the judge to dismiss you and respond appropriately. Do not say “Thank you for judging” or shake the judge's hand. But do be polite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Structure of an Extemp Speech==

===Introduction===

 
College too expensive? Have kids? Or do you just not have the time?

====Connection====
There are many reasons why Americans today cannot fully complete or receive a college education.

====Question====
So are online degrees as good as on campus degrees?

====Answer====
Most certainly so, yes.

====Preview your points====
Because of convience, cost, and the level of acceptance.

===Point 1 (''Convience'')===

====Present Evidence (stuff from the articles)==== 
If you have a family to feed, and errands to do during some points in your average day, attend college on a campus would be impossible. - USN &amp; WR


====Tie evidence to point====

This is amazing to the America as a whole! A working adult can obtain a college education online from home without interrupting those attendees who have a busy schedule and lifestyle.

====Impact – why is this important?====

===Point 2 (''Cost'')===
	Book costs have gone up 186% between 1986 and 2004. The average cost for a student buying all the textbooks needed for an on-campus education costs $900. Jason Turgeon, a Northeastern University student had to buy a textbook for $160. Overall he paid $500 for several textbooks for his classes. He is receiving an education via an on campus University. However, if young Jason attended an online University, he could go to textbookrevolution.org and download all his textbooks onto his computer or laptop FREE. As for cost of education, enrollment into an accredited online university costs $2540 less than on campus tuition.


An online education greatly reduces the cost for books and materials than that of an on campus education. You wouldn't need to go buy textbooks from a store for a total that could top $1000, you could just go to a legitimate and legal website and download the textbooks for free. Your tuition would be a low cost, and you wouldn't have to pay for room and board.

===Point 3 (''Other nations are ineffective at creating a solution'')===
	Just like pt. 1

===Conclusion===

====Question / Answer====
Repeat them just like in the introduction (''So, when answering the question, Will there ever be peace in the Middle East?, the answer is obviously no.'')

====Repeat Points====
Just like the preview (''Because the Israeli military is too aggressive, there is a lot of antisemitism in the region, and other nations are ineffective at creating a solution.'')

====Tie back to attention getter====
Remind us once again of the opening of the speech and close it off. (''So, the Middle East has become a lot like the playground at recess.  Unfortunately, the kids at recess are a lot more likely to find a solution to their problems, and the Middle East is destined to be a conflict based more on hatred then disagreement.'')

===Speech time===
Maximum 7 minutes, shoot for 6:30

      <text xml:space="preserve">“'''Life''' has many different meanings, as outlined in any dictionary. It is not possible to find one universal definition covering all meanings. The best one can hope for is to find a common denominator for all these different meanings.“

Biology is centered around the phenomenon of life. As it is mostly concerned with the scientific study of life forms, biology does not lend itself to a definition of what life actually is. There are at least as many definitions of life as there are biology text books (of authors that do not simply reproduce what they have read somewhere else before). There is consensus, however, that there is no single property that delineates living from non-living systems. Life seems to rather express itself in a variety of attributes that are common to all living beings.

These commonalities include:

#The exhibition of some kind of order (via a process of self-organization). For some authors this is the most remarkable aspect of life, as the general tendency within the universe is the reduction of order (i.e., an increase degrees of freedom or, physically speaking, entropy). Hence, they characterize life as negentropy - a phenomenon that temporarily and locally counteracts the universal trend of increasing entropy.
#Movement/Growth/Development. That is, existence of a certain nonstationarity of biological systems over time. This includes the finite nature of an individual's existence.
#Reaction/Adaptation. This evolution is another most central aspect of life. Darwinian evolution is, however, not restricted to living beings (e.g., cultural evolution).
#Energy conversion/Metabolism. While this is certainly an important aspect of life (and not directly delineable from point 1), there are some biological organisms (e.g.. virii, viroids, prions that do not show any metabolism. For some authors this is reason enough to declare that a virus is a non-living entity (whose scientific study nonetheless falls into the domain of biology).
#Reproduction. All known life forms (with the disputable exception of prions maybe) are based on a genetic code, with DNA as its material basis. Virus particles also consist of DNA, but are incapable of sustaining a metabolism (and hence reproduction) of their own.

Life is characterized by diversity - a product of its evolution. Thus, &quot;life&quot; is an abstraction of all living phenomena that share a common origin.

[[Image:NCI_bacon.jpg|thumb|right|Fried American bacon.]]
'''Bacon''' is made by brining and cold smoking or drying the sides, back or belly of [[Cookbook:pork|pork]]. There are several kinds of bacon:

Bacons made from the belly:
*American bacon
*English streaky bacon
*Italian bacon ([[Cookbook:pancetta|pancetta]])

Bacons made from the pork butt:
*English gammon

Bacons made from the back:
*Canadian bacon
*English back bacon
*Irish bacon

Bacons made from the back of a hog are much leaner, and do not taste the same as bacons made from the pork belly. Bacon made from the back of the belly are fatter than bacon made from the front of a belly.

Because it is cured, bacon tends to keep for a very long time. 

==American bacon==
American bacon is made by curing the meat in a brine made of sugar, salt, pepper and other assorted spices for at least three days, and then cold smoking &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; it. 

==Pancetta==
Pancetta is made by removing the skin and seasoning the meat with salt, pepper and other spices such as juniper berries, muscot nuts, cloves and cinnamon. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It is cured for two weeks and then rolled up and packed into a skin much like salami. Like many sausages high in fat, pancetta is hard to cut.

      <comment>/* Drying the film */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Setting up a black and white dark room==

You can easily build an inexpensive darkroom in your own home. You need a room that can block all exterior light and has ventilation (e.g. an exhaust fan).  Having a sink is nice, but not necessary since rinsing can be done out of the darkroom. You should have counter space to hold at least three 11x14 inch trays four if you don't have a sink, an enlarger and room for a paper box and tools. The layout should be a progressive line from the enlarger to the solution trays to the sink.

===Equipment===

; Enlarger : should be as good a manufacturer as you can find. Bargains can be found because many amateur photographers are selling darkroom equipment in favour of digital gear.
; Lens : the focal length of an enlarger lens is a determined by the film format you use. 35mm film requires a 50mm, 120 film a 70mm. Most lenses are now of good quality.  CAD and plastic technology has helped a great deal.  Perfectionists will prefer expensive lenses.  Many are available on the web or at quality used camera stores.
; Timer : any kind of clock will do for this task, but it is important to remember that you must be able to see the hands in the dark. It is still easy to buy a triple timer which will automatically time the duration of each chemical stage.  A clock that integrates safe lights is usually very handy.  check the used camera stores.  
; Exposure monitor : Hard to find, but worth it. An exposure monitor will allow you to gain a ball park exposure for your prints, without needing to make endless teststrips.

===Sealing the darkroom===

If you think you have sealed the darkroom so no outlise light enters, then turn on all possible lights, make sure it is a sunny day, then take a cup of tea into the darkroom and wait for about ten minutes.  Your eyes will adjust to the darkness, and you can see the leaks.  Fix them.  They can fog your negatives and paper.  No Kidding.

==Developing Film==
===Before you start===
In order to start developing film there are several things that you will require:
*Either a darkroom, or any other type of container that seals light (such as a Changing Bag.)
*Chemicals; such as:
-Film developer: (such as D-76, [HC 110,] Fixer, Photo Flo)
-Paper developer: (such as Kodak Dektol, Stopbath, Fixer)
*Scissors
*Cartridge opener for 35 mm film, if you do not use plastic screw-in cartridges. (Such as the ones you buy with film loaded in them.)
*Light-Tight Tank
*Film Reels
*A Drying Rack or Printer Dryers.
*A film squeegee to takes drops of water off the film. (Optional, drying rack is good enough.)

If you have everything you need, start by checking that your solutions &amp; water are room temperature.

Water temperature is an issue.  Variations in temperature will change the speed of chemical actions on film.   A five minute development at 68 degrees (F) will be very different from a 72  or 62 degrees development.  There are expensive water temperature meters that can be installed that will automatically keep the water temperature steady.  Otherwise you will have to be alert to temperature changes and manage as best you can.

What you could do is make a revolving chart for your different room temperatures to see how long your development time will be.

===Loading the film into the tank===
Start by setting the equipment and solutions for development at the ready in your darkroom.  Try to keep them in a predictable place and order so you use the right stuff at the right time. Place the parts of the developing tank in good order so you can find them in the dark.  Once the cartridge is open, you cannot turn on any standard or safe lights until the film is once again in a lightproof container (hopefully the development tank).  You might want to take a test drive with some test strips.  Take your scissors and cut the curved part of the film. Be careful not to cut too much, because that might spoil the negatives later on, won't fit into your camera, or is just a waste of, what could be, a good picture.

Afterwards, roll the film using the reel. It is a bit hard to explain how to do this in words, but after you do it several times you will understand it.  Again, practice in the light with some Practice Film.

Then, when the film is rolled on the reel, put the reel on the pole, put the pole in the tank, put the seal on the top of the tank and close the tank using the cap provided with the tank.  You can turn the lights on now.

Once you have done this, you may proceed to the next step.

===Developing Film===
Developing needs to be standardized.  Your time starts when you start pouring in the developer. If you find the results are okay - them keep up your standards.  If a bit underdeveloped add time, if overdeveloped, use less time than recommended.  Again - this is assuming you have temperature control.

*Comments: &quot;For one, you can't change the development time because, A.) You don't know how your film is gonna look UNTIL you're FINISHED. Unless, you wanna ruin your film by opening the tank then, sure. B.) The time isn't always going to be the same, again, depending on the temperature. C.) Under exposing or over exposing doesn't always depend on the time or temperature, it could be your camera, OR just YOU.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

Begin by pouring clean water of 68 degrees, into the tank.  This softens the emulsion and prepares for a more uniform acceptance of the developer.  Put the lid on the tank and then invert it several times.  Discard the water.  Try and get as much out as possible.

*Comments: &quot;For one, it's NOT ALWAYS gonna be 68 degrees. Two, the water has nothing to do with 'softening the emulsion &amp; preparation for a more 'uniform acceptance''. You use water between D-76 &amp; Stop-Bath to be sure all the chemicals are washed off, completely. NEVER use water AFTER Photo Flo. Photo Flo is used to wash off the residues from the chemicals. Using water after Photo Flo will totally defeat the purpose of even using Photo Flo in the first place. Three, Invert ?? It's called 'Agitate'.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

Set your clock or watch your watch for a beginning time, and pour the developer into the tank.  Invert the tank according to the film manufacturer's instructions or to your standardization.  Too much agitation will retard development,  to little will create different intensities of development in different areas of the film.  So you are looking for uniformity without interrupting the development process too much.  The development time is usually suggested by the film maker's recommendation for particular developers.  Look to the developer paperwork, the film paper work, or go onto the film or developer maker's web sites.  At the end of the development period discard the developer.  Many people retain the developer and you can certainly reuse what you have, but the depletion of its chemical action can happen quickly and steadily - making it more difficult to establish your own development standards.  The choice is yours, or our economic concerns.

*Comments: &quot;Developer ? There's multiple developers. Be specific. The first developer for developing film is, D-76. Invert=AGITATE. GET IT RIGHT. No, just because they're Manufacturer's doesn't mean they're always right on the instructions. You can never be too sure. Go with the gut, go with what you KNOW. Just.. Listen to Mr. Woodard. Good job, you put agitation. Surprised you didn't put invertation. It'll make my film retarded ?? O.o WRONG. It will SLOW DOWN development. No, it's not depended on the film maker's recommendations on how long you should develop. It's based on the TEMPERATURE. Don't go anywhere online, look up everything in a Photography book. Such as, Guide to Photography. NEVER DISCARD YOUR DEVELOPERS. YOU CAN RE-USE THEM UNTIL THEY GO BAD. POUR THEM INTO A JUG OR SOMETHING ! DEVELOPERS ARE EXPENSIVE. If chemicals are ever weak, double the development time. When D-76 is weak, it turns black/dark. Stop-Bath turns into a red/purple color when weak. Dektol turns black, as well.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

This process alters the film emulsion and the chemical interact with the silver in the black and white film.  Your waste will contain metal and should be disposed of properly.

*Comments: &quot;Wow, surprisingly you got that correct. Congratulations.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

After emptying the tank quickly pour in stop-bath.  This will stop most of the development and should be done as quickly as possible to help standardize your development time.  The stop bath is usually about 30 seconds.  discard or retain the stop and pour in the fixer.  This finalizes the development and stabilizes (fixes) the negatives so they will be viewable in light and preserved.  Empty the tank of fixer and wash the film.  I usually open the tank and place it under the faucet.  Temperature is not as critical here, but keeping a 68 degree discipline is always a good idea.

*Comments: &quot;One, you don't use Stop-Bath for developing film. That's for making a print. You use Fixer for your second chemical in this process. YOU DON'T USE STOP-BATH AND FIXER ?!?! WANNA RUIN YOUR FILM ?! No, DON'T USE STOP-BATH WHEN DEVELOPING FILM. Why do you think it &quot;fixes&quot; ? BECAUSE YOU USE FIXER ! Fixer fixes &amp; Stop-Bath stops !! NEVER open your tank after FIXER. YOU ONLY OPEN IT AFTER YOU HAVE PROPERLY USED PHOTO FLO !! Temperature is EVERYTHING.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

===Drying the film===

Once the film is cleaned, hang (clips are available at better camera stores) it on a line in a still, dust proof area (hopefully your darkroom is sealed tight so it is a good place to dry film.  If you use a bathroom for drying - close the door, turn off the exhaust fan, and try to keep people out for a while.  Place a clip on the bottom of the roll to keep some tension on the film so it does not dry in a twisted form.  When sufficiently dry - go away and let it dry some more.

Once it is really dry, cut the film into strips that can be placed into plastic sleeves designed for the purpose.  You now have a finished negative  in a well protected negative sleeve.

You may wish to begin a catalog of negatives.  If you take a lot of pictures, you will quickly be frustrated by a messy collection.  Use names, dates, key pictures, or events like &quot;the local town fair&quot; to help you retrieve the negatives you want.   Keeping the contact sheet sleeves in an album helps.

==Making Contact Sheets==

If you have full page plastic sleeves, you entire roll is probably in one plastic sleeve.  Keep the negatives in the sleeve - less handling means fewer fingerprints or damages.  

You will need to do a couple of test strips until you know how much time at what f stop on the lens produces a good exposure for development.  If you do not have a meter (see above) then the next best method is test-strips.  As follows:

Run your enlarger up the support to a high level.  Turn on your enlarger, open the lens to its most open position and focus the lens to the base of the enlarger.  The edge of the frame will sharpen when you are in focus.  You may wish to use an easel or place duct tape on the base in the outline of a piece of paper.  You want to be able to put the photo paper and the sleeve of negatives in a standard place to assure complete exposure of the negatives.  

Turn off all lights, put a fresh 8 x 10 sheet of photo paper on the base or easel, and then place the negatives on the paper.  Put a plate of clean glass on top of the negtives to assure flatness.  

To make a test strip place a thick piece of cardboard larger than 8 x 10 or some other material to block all the light.  Turn on your time clock for one minute.  Stop down the lens to a low setting smaller f/stop = higher number = less light).  At standard intervals - say 10 seconds - move the cardboard about an inch.  You may  get six or so strips.  After the complete page is exposed - place the cardboard over the whole page and turn off your enlarger.  You can then begin to develop the photo paper. (See below)  What will eventually happen is that you will find one of these strips to do a pretty good job of reproducing the photo you took.  That &quot;strip&quot; will be your time exposure.  If it were the fourth strip - then you would expose the negatives at 40 seconds at that f/stop, and you can now redo the above without having to make a strip sheet and develop the full sheet for a true contact sheet.  Test over.  If the strip is too dark - either change the f/stop to a smaller aperture or reduce the time exposure.  If it is too light, add time or open up the lens to let out more light.   Use 5 sceond increments - 20 - or whatever it takes to get you to a standard with which you are comfortable.  Keep adjusting until you get some good exposures.

If you take standard negatives, develop the strips the same way, and keep a good eye on your temperatures and times, you can just go ahead and assume your time and exposure settings are okay and you won't have to do a test strip anymore.  

==Making Prints==
Print making is the fun part.  Using a handy can of air - make sure there is no dust on the negative or the lens of the enlarger.  Place a negative in the negative carrier and place it in the enlarger.  Focus the print on the easel of base (focus scopes are great here for focusing.  You adjust the lens focus until you can see the grain of the negative on the easel). After reading your exposure or making a test strip of a single negative, you have the proper f/stop and exposure time for this one negative.  I usually try to have at least 30 seconds for exposure so I can dodge or burn.  A quick exposure does not give you time to improve the print.  If you need more time, stop down the lens.  One change down will double the exposure time.  

(You will probably want to do a test strip on each negative.  Sacrificing a piece of paper for a test strip will save you many sheets of 8x10's.)

My timer turns on the enlarger and turns off the safe light. Then when the timer stops, it turns the safe light back on.  (I do not have any lights on when I open up my box of photo paper.)  [If you find your safe lights cause fog in your print, do not turn them on until the development process is well along.]  Take your test contact sheet print, turn on the timer and immerse the print in the developer solution  - which should be the first tray to the right of the enlarger.  Gently agitate the print by tapping it with the side of your developer tongs so it keeps getting exposed to good chemicals for a well distributed process.  You should begin to see the print emerge.  After the end of the recommended development time for that developer, paper and temperature, lift the print out and let developer drip off the paper. Place it in the stop bath - the second tray to the right of the enlarger.  After that time is up, lift the paper, let it drip into the stop bath and place the paper into the fixer - the third tray to the right of the enlarger.  After the recommended fixing time, place the paper in the wash bath with running water at about 68 degrees, and let it wash for a long time.  You can turn on standard lights after the fixing is done.  

Making a print is the same process as the test strip - but without making strips.  Depending on the paper you buy, you can further adjust the print by altering the contrast of the paper, using different paper, different developers, adding toners, etc.

When I process, I use 5 trays.  One developer, one stop bath, two fixers and a toner bath - usually selenium toner with photoflo.  Portraits can be enhanced by sepia toner as well.  Then I go to the wash.  A plastic washer is a good purchase.  They can hold a few prints, will hook up to your faucet, and agitate the prints while they are washing.  a squeege helps limit water spots on the paper.  

After a thorough washing, place the prints on a drying surface.  They will curl and stuff, but heat mounting them will straighten them out.  You can back them to savage board with wax paper that does a great mounting job.  I used to back the prints with a sheet of like kind photo paper - that makes it more archival and less prone to damage by age - but paper prices are kind of steep now.  The number one enemy of photos is sulphur.  Those yellow stains in old photos are probably sulfur - which comes from wood frames or impure backing material.  Good luck.

When designing your robot there are plenty of programs to help. Ranging from a simple tool to print wheel encoders, through CAD drawing programs up to mechanical simulation programs.

== 2D CAD==

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Autocad2000.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;Autocad 2000&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

e.g. AutoCAD. This type of software is used to turn a rough sketch into a nice professional drawing. This type of drawing is standardized for readability. (Meaning every different type of line has a particular meaning. Solid lines are visible edges, dashed lines are hidden edges, line-dash-line lines are center lines. Standards also include methods of dimensioning and types of views presented in a drawing.) Of course you're free to use your own standards, but using an industrial standard, such as ANSI or ISO,  makes it easier to share your plans with other people around the world. While it may somewhat more tedious to make a drawing using 2D software, the results are generally better than using 3D solid modeling software. Solid modelers still have problems translating 3D models into 2D drawings and adding proper notation to standards.

*Freeware CAD software: [http://www.cadstd.com/ CADstd]
*Professional CAD software: [http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=2704278 AutoCAD]

*GPL CAD software: [http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad.html QCad] [[Wikipedia:QCad]]
* GPL vector drawing software: [[Inkscape]] [[Wikipedia:Inkscape]]

==Solid Modeling==
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Inventor 5.3 drawing.png|&lt;center&gt;Inventor 5.3 Drawing a Schematic on a part&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

e.g. SolidWorks or [[Pro_Engineer | Pro/Engineer]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Pro_Engineer Pro/Engineer] ([[Wikipedia:Pro/ENGINEER]]).
A newer way to draw parts and machines. With solid modeling you &quot;build&quot; the parts in 3D, put them together in an assembly and then let the software generate the 2D drawings (sounds harder than it is).  The major advantage over 2D CAD programs is you can see the complete part/machine without actually building it in real life. Mistakes are easily found and corrected in the model. These 3D models are not yet completely standardized though there is a standard for digital data. At this time the 2D drawings this software generates do not conform completely to industrial standards. The 2D paper drawing is still the communication tool of preference in industry and clarity of intent is very important. Solid modeling software tend to generate overly complex drawing views with overly simplified dimensioning methods that likely do not correctly convey the fit, form or function of the part or assembly.

==Pneumatic &amp; Hydraulic Simulation==
[http://www.festo.com Festo] has a demo version of both a pneumatic and a hydraulic simulation program. Look for FluidSIM Pneumatiek and FluidSIM Hydraulica. (Pick country; click on industrial automatisation; and use the search field to the right.)&lt;BR&gt;
Limitations: Can't save nor print. Most of the didactic material isn't included.

Software to draw electronics schematics and designing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). These packages contain software to draw the schematic, libraries with symbols, and software to draw the PCBs (with autorouter).

In no particular order:

*Freeware: [http://www.cadsoft.de/ Eagle] is commonly used by beginners for their projects because a limited version is available for free.  The toolset is well integrated and has a large hobbiest user base.  However, once you progress beyond basic designs, you need to pay for the full version.

*Open Source: The open-source [http://geda.seul.org/ gEDA Project] has produced a mature suite of applications for electronics design, including: a schematic capture program, attribute manager, netlister supporting over 20 netlist formats, analog and digital simulation, PCB layout with autorouter, and Gerber viewer.  The project was started in 1997 to write EDA tools useful for personal robotics projects, but as of this writing the tools are also used by hobbiests, students, educators, and professionals for many different design tasks.  The suite runs best on Linux and OSX, although Windows ports of some apps have been made.

* Open Source: [[Kicad]], [[wikipedia: Kicad]] includes schematic capture and PCB layout

*Open Source: [http://www.freepcb.com/ Free PCB] is a mature Windows only open source PCB drafting tool.

==µControllers==

===Programming Languages===

There are many different programming languages available for µControllers:
*Assembly: Every µcontroller can be programmed in Assembly. However the differences between µcontrollers can be huge. Assembly gives you the most power of the µcontroller but this power comes with a price: Hard to learn and (almost)no code reuse.&lt;BR&gt; Assembly code is in essence translated machine code. It provides only the instruction set of the processor: add, subtract, &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; multiply, move data between registers and/or memory, conditional jumps. No loops, complex selection or build in I/O as in C/C++, Basic, Pascal, ...&lt;BR&gt; The disadvantage is that you have to implement everything yourself (lots of work even for the most simple programs).&lt;BR&gt; The advantage is that you have to implement everything yourself (programs can be written extremely efficient both in speed and size).&lt;BR&gt;This language is intended for advanced users and is usually only used as an optimisation for code in tight loops or for pushing the performance of a limited device to the edge of its abilities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Reasons to learn it: 
**Teaches you how the computer works on its lowest level.
**Provides high speed code which consumes little memory.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reasons to avoid it:
**Limited use.
**Non-portable.
**very hard to master.&lt;br&gt;Freeware: [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2725 AVR]

*C: C offers power but is much more portable than Assembly. For most µcontrollers there is a C compiler available. The differences between µcontrollers is smaller here, except for using hardware.&lt;BR&gt; Learning C is much easier than learning Assembly, still C isn't an easy language to learn from scratch. However these days there are very good books available on this subject.
**Freeware:[http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?module=FreaksTools&amp;func=viewItem&amp;item_type=tool&amp;item_id=560 GCC Tools for AVR Studio Software]

*Basic: For many µcontrollers there are special flavours of Basic available. This is the easiest and fastest way to code µcontrollers, however you'll have to sacrifice some power. Still modern basic compilers can produce very impressive code.
**Limited Freeware/payware:[http://www.mcselec.com/bascom-avr.htm Bascom AVR] Very good Basic compiler for AVR. Limited to 4Kb programs. There is also a version available for the 8051 µcontrollers.
**Limited Freeware/payware:[http://www.xcprod.com/titan/XCSB/download.html XCSB] PIC Basic compiler. Lite version. No 32-bit integer and floating point support. (OS/2 WARP, Win95, Win98, Win2K, XP and Linux)
*Forth:   
**[http://wiki.forthfreak.net/index.cgi?PFAVR PFAVR] (GPL) Needs external RAM.
**[http://wiki.forthfreak.net/index.cgi?ByteForth ByteForth] Dutch and works without external RAM, there is also a building book (Dutch only for now) available for Ushi our robotic project.

===Programmers===
After you've written your program, you need to get it into your µcontroller. If you use C or Basic you'll have to compile it. Then use a programmer to upload the code into the µcontroller. There are several different methods for this last step.
*External programmers: This is a device that's connected to a PC. You'll plug the µcontroller IC, EEPROM or other memory IC in its socket and let the PC upload the code. Afterwards you plug the IC in its circuit and test it. Can be time consuming when updating your program after debugging.
*ISP In System Programming: The board with the µcontroller has a special connector to connect to a PC. Hook up the cable, download code, test and repeat. More modern method. Only disadvantage: it consumes some boardspace. Not all µcontrollers support this.
*[[Wikiversity:Embedded_System_Engineering#bootloaders|Bootloader]], also called &quot;self-programming&quot;: The CPU accepts a new program through any available connection to a PC (no special connector needed), then programs itself. Not all µcontrollers support this. And you also need some other programming method, to get the initial bootloader programmed in (telling it exactly which connector to watch for a new program, the baud rate, etc.).

===Debuggers===
Modern µcontrollers have on-chip debug hardware called [[:w:JTAG]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Classical Quantity Theory of Money==

===History===

This theory was described comprehensively by Irving Fisher (1911), in the book ''The Purchasing Power of Money''. It is the classical view of how money is used in the economy, and what variables it affects.

===Fisher's Model===

Consider a closed economy. In every transaction, the value of sales and the value of purchases must match. Therefore, even when scaled up to the aggregate level, the value of payments must equal the value of receipts.


&lt;math&gt;P_t \equiv R&lt;/math&gt;


But &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt;, the value of payments, must be equal to the number of transactions multiplied by the average price they take place at. &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the value of receipts, must be equal to the amount of money in the economy multipled by the average number of times it circulates (or, the ''velocity'' of money).

This gives us an identity:


&lt;math&gt; PT \equiv M_sV_T &lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is simply the price level and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of transactions.  &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt; is the supply of money in the economy, and &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt; is termed the velocity of transaction.

===An Evaluation===

====Inflation====

Consider now the behaviour of these variables in the real world. The money supply is of course exogenously determined (by the government / central bank). We can assume that in equilibrium the market clears and therefore the supply of money &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the demand for money &lt;math&gt;M_d&lt;/math&gt;.

Fisher further assumed that the volume of transactions &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; would be relatively stable at long run equilibrium, and that the velocity of money &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt; would also be invariant in the short run. This would then give us the following equation:


&lt;math&gt;M_dV_T = PT \,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;P = {M_dV_T \over T}&lt;/math&gt;


It can be seen that any change to the price level is wholly induced by changes to the exogenous variables. If we consider &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; invariant over the short run, the rate of change in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is entirely due to the rate of change in &lt;math&gt;M_d&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the rate of inflation in the economy is entirely due to changes in the money supply. The equilibriating mechanism is the change in money demand.

====The Neutrality of Money====

Consider the basic equation of the model.


&lt;math&gt;M_dV_T = PT \,&lt;/math&gt;


We then have:


&lt;math&gt;{M_d \over P} = {T \over V_T}&lt;/math&gt;


If the Fisherian quantity theory is correct, then any change in &lt;math&gt;M_d&lt;/math&gt; would lead to a corresponding change in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, while the real variables, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt;, remain unchanged. This is known as the neutrality of money, a condition whereby changes to the money supply affect only nominal variables. A related, and harder condition to satisfy, is the superneutrality of money, where changes in the rate of growth of the nominal money supply influence only the rate of inflation, and the rate of depreciation of the currency in an open economy. There is no effect on any other variable.

==Marshall, Pigou and Keynes - Developments of the Classical Theory==

===History===

This preliminary version of the quantity theory was developed by Marshall and Pigou (1917) in order to extend the analysis to consider short run fluctuations in the velocity of money. In Fisherian quantity theory the velocity of money was determined exogenously.

===A change in viewpoint===

Under the Fisherian analysis an individual holds as much money as he ''needs'' in order to carry out transactions. Marshall and Pigou approached the problem slightly differently. Their version of the quantity theory determines how much money an individual ''chooses'' to hold in order to carry out transactions.

The explicit assumptions here are that the individual cannot hold more money than his stock of wealth, that he makes a choice between money, which does not pay interest income, and bonds, which do. The demand for money function therefore varies with the interest rate, the level of wealth, and the volume of transactions that said individual wishes to carry out.

The model proposed by Marshall and Pigou was simplified by assuming that the volume of transactions would be stable in the short run. This allowed the aggregate real money demand function to be equated to some proportion of the level of real income in the economy. We thus have:


&lt;math&gt;{M_d \over P} = kY&lt;/math&gt;


Rearranging:

&lt;math&gt;M_d = kPY \,&lt;/math&gt;


And:


&lt;math&gt;\left ( M_d \right ) \left ( \frac{1}{k} \right ) = PY&lt;/math&gt;


Here, the constant &lt;math&gt;k^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''income velocity'' of money, as opposed to &lt;math&gt;V_T \,&lt;/math&gt; in the Fisherian analysis, which was the ''transactions velocity of money''.

===Keynesian analysis - the introduction of the interest rate===

Keynes' contribution to the above analysis focused on defining more clearly the motives economic agents had in holding money. He defined 3 motives for holding money - the transactions motive (where agents hold money in order to make planned payments), the precautionary motive (where agents hold money against the unforeseen need to make payments) and the speculative motive (where agents make the decision to hold money according to the opportunity cost of doing so).

The speculative motive can be explained more clearly by considering the asset allocation decision between money and bonds. We defined bonds earlier as any asset that pays an income. The rate of this income is, quite clearly, the interest rate. If the interest rate is expected to fall, the price of bonds will rise, and if the interest rate is expected to rise, the price of bonds will fall.

Keynes extended the analysis by assuming that there is a range of interest rates that is considered to be the mean range, and that the interest rate would be mean-reverting towards it.

'''Frappé coffee''' is a refreshing drink of Greek origin, perfect on a summer's day.

== Ingredients ==
*1-2 spoons of instant coffee
*Tall Glass of Cold Water
*1-3 spoons of sugar (optional)
*3-5 ice cubes (optional)
*Milk (optional; condensed/evaporated milk works best)

== Procedure ==
*Put coffee and sugar in a shaker or tall glass and add a little water, just enough to cover the mixture (about 10 ml, or a couple of teaspoonfuls). 
*Shake or stir with mixer until the mixture becomes foamy.  
*Fill the glass with cold water.  
*Add ice cubes, milk (preferably evaporated or condensed milk) or cream to taste. 
*Sip with a straw.
===Variant===
Instead of shaking the initial coffee/sugar/water mix, it can also be beaten with a teaspoon.  This needs patience because takes a while to form the mix into a stiff, thick, thoroughly aerated, light brown mousse with a texture like meringue.  The advantage of this more troublesome method is that the foam produced when the rest of the water is added is richer and lasts longer.  This foam can also withstand hot water, and produce an effect akin to espresso crema.

== Types ==

* Ratio of Sugar to Coffee &gt;2/1: Frappé ''glykós''  (sweet)
* Ratio of Sugar to Coffee  1/1: Frappé ''métrios'' (medium)
* No sugar: Frappé ''skétos'' (plain)
Any of the above with milk added: ''mé gála'' (with milk),  e.g. ''Frappé glykós me gala'' or ''frappógalo''

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* You can also add Baileys or a ball of ice cream.
* Once I was in Greece I was told that the right order of mixing Frappe after making foam is ICE, MILK and than fill up the glass with  cold WATER.
* By including the ICE when shaking or stirring the coffee, it allows the foam to become more aerated and frothier. Once this has been done, you can then top up with water and/or milk.

{{Wikipedia|Knoppix}}
'''Knowing Knoppix''' is a guide to the Knoppix Linux distro for the complete beginner'''

Knoppix is an astoundingly clever product. It runs Linux completely from a CD or DVD. There is no need to install. It bypasses all the software already installed on your PC or laptop and automatically detects the hardware in your computer (subject to suitable hardware). When you've finished using Knoppix, simply restart. Your computer will return to your regular system, and it will behave as if nothing has happened. Knoppix is Free Software and open source under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).

This beginner-friendly book is designed to help with these situations:
* You can't start Windows! Disaster? Possibly not. It is often possible to rescue files using Knoppix from crashed Windows computers, even when Windows cannot be started. This guide takes you step by step through the process.
* You are curious about Linux, and you want to discover what all the fuss is about.
* You want a useful guide to help you get started with Knoppix.

[[File:Ja_da_ya.png|right|thumb|320px|A map of Japanese copula.]]
Many learners of Japanese begin their studies thinking that the language is a single standard, spoken across the whole nation. While it is true that nearly all Japanese nationals can speak the standard language, it is by no means their every day language. This long and mountainous archipelago has over the centuries given rise to a great number of dialects with their own distict accent, intonation and vocabulary.

Before the Tokugawa Shogun moved to Edo (modern day Tokyo) in 1603, the main place of government was Kyoto, and standard Japanese was the ancestor of today's Kyoto dialect. Modern standard Japanese, hyōjungo (標準語) is basically the dialect of Tokyo. This is used in schools and media throughout the country.&lt;!-- Anyone know if local stations have local dialects? --&gt;
Other varieties of Japanese are often considered provincial and like in every language, each bears connotations of archtypes.

The initial port from the OpenOffice (SWX) source is done.

I added the chapters, that not contains any text-formats and/or pictures.
Please help me to port these - the rest - chapters, because i haven't the time at the moment!

== Cleanup and Split ==

Hmm... Just a thought: Shouldn't this page be split into lots of smaller articles? It's taking way too long to load at the moment.  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 07:53, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Good idea! If you intend to do so, please have a look at recent conversions, like [[How To Build A Computer]], and the advice giving there: [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]]. Be careful not to split it up too much, a couple of sections would be fine. Also, have a look at the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:07, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::Please wait (with the layout) until i updated the text to the newest version (from 7 may), an uploaded the pictures, thanx. -- [[User:Reviczky|reviczky]] 22:40, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::It's so much text to scroll through to get to something that you could be looking for. This '''MUST''' be split into multiple sections. Updating and syncing can still happan if it is split. Smaller pages might even make your job easier. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 22:03, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

== Transwiki to Wikisource ==

I have tagged this for a transwiki to [[Wikisource:Main Page|Wikisource]]. Wikisource is a sister project of Wikibooks for source texts, which are books you copy from outside. See [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]].

&quot;Knowing Knoppix&quot; is a source text from http://www.pjls16812.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/knowing-knoppix/index.html --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:51, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

: I'm sure this book wasn't intended to be part of wikisource. It's more a textbook than most of the stuff here. Besides, it has been edited a bit since it was dumped here(mostly by me). I think it would be better to rename it as a KDE textbook or something. --[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 20:19, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I agree. This is a textbook and as such belongs on wikibooks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:30, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

I withdraw my transwiki suggestion. This book was modified, and it is one of our best books, so we should leave it here. Do not transwiki. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:07, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

I have pages on wikipedia and wiktionary, but I'm winging away from editing -pedia cos there's nothing I can do to it thats worthwhile anymore (Cleanup isnt really my style - I much prefer adding and adding more stuff). And I decided rashly to stop Witionary too, so I'm gonna give books a shot. My speciality is French, so I'm gonna see what I can do about the [[French]] book here.

# Add links releated sections of Wikibooks


I don't know much about ecology (hence me reading this wikibook) but this first chapter does not give me much confidence in what I'm reading, since it mainly appears to be quoting a text from 1961.

Im new to this site but my class is using it as an educational tool. I am excited to see if this type of teaching will be more effective then just reading out of a textbook.--[[User:JDrynan|JDrynan]] 20:11, 22 August 2007 (UTC)


I am also curious to see how much we learn from it, but it will be hard at first, I like the old fashioned textbooks.--[[User:Slevadney|Slevadney]] 00:29, 23 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe|Pho ga}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Cuisine of Vietnam]]

'''Pho Ga''' is one of the culinary gems of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnamese cuisine]], available within a mile radius of almost every person in the community of Little Saigon, a Vietnamese enclave located in Orange County, California. Although the flavors are complex, the technique is simple, and the result is delectable.  

== Ingredients ==
* &quot;Pho&quot; noodles*

=== Broth ===
* 1 small to medium [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (whole)
* 12 cups chicken broth
* 3-4 slices of fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (whole)
* 1 medium brown [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], peeled (whole)
* 1 tbsp of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] or more (to taste)
* Fish sauce, to taste*

===Seasoning Pouch===
* 1 tsp. fennel seed
* 1 tsp. peppercorns
* 3 whole star anise*
* 1-2 dried cardamom pods*
* 1/2 stick cinnamon
* 3 whole cloves

===Finishing Touches===

* Diced cilantro and green onion
* A few fresh basil leaves, torn
* Fresh bean sprouts
* Thinly sliced brown or white onion (several pieces per serving)
* Hoisin Sauce (1 tsp per serving, or to taste)*
* Lime (squeezed into broth before eating)
* Jalapeños, serranos, or other chilli peppers
* Sriracha or similar chilli sauce
* Additional fish sauce

'''Note:''' All ingredients, particularly those marked with asterisks, can be found in Asian markets and some large supermarkets

== Procedure ==
# Combine ingredients for seasoning pouch  in a small strainer or a pouch made from cheesecloth and twine.
# In a large stock pot, boil broth ingredients together with seasoning pouch until the chicken is thoroughly cooked
# Remove the chicken and strain broth back into the pot for additional simmering. Once the chicken is cool, pull apart the meat into bite sized pieces and discard bones.
# In a separate pot, boil the &quot;Pho&quot; noodles in sufficient water. Stop when they're no longer chewy (basically the way you'd boil spaghetti). Make sure you don't overdo it or the noodles will fall apart and you'll end up with porridge. When done, pour the noodles into a colander and rinse them with lukewarm water. Then, leave them to drain.  
# Once the noodles have drained, add them to a bowl. Combine the chicken, &quot;finishing touches&quot; (see above), and enough broth to cover the noodles.  Enjoy with fork (chopsticks if you want the authentic experience) and a spoon.

The study of Radiation Physics can be divided into three parts:
*Radiation Physics, which is a pure science dealing with the nature of radiation and its interactions with matter.
*Radiotherapeutic (Medical) Physics, which is an applied science dealing with the use of radiation within the Radiation Oncology department where humans (and sometimes animals) are treated
*Health Physics, which is also an applied science dealing with radiation safety, both in Radiation Oncology departments, but also in research labs, at nuclear power plants, etc.

XBLite is an offshoot of the [[XBasic]] programming language. The XBLite compiler translates programs from source form into assembly language. From this point, conventional tools build the final executable program or DLL library. The XBLite compiler will work on all Windows platforms including Win98, NT, 2000, and XP.

XBLite is a &quot;younger brother&quot; of XBasic. XBasic was developed by Max Reason to be used under MS-Windows and LINUX OSs. In 2000, he made the entire language, compiler, and PDE freely available under an Open Source GPL. The XBasic language itself has not been altered so console programs in XBasic will run identically under XBLite. The XBLite compiler is also released under the same OpenSource GPL license.

==Enhancements, post XBasic==
XBLite has been enhanced for use under Windows. It is now possible to:
# Create true command line Win32 console programs.
# Use the windows common controls for creating GUI applications.
# Easily add resources to your executable program.
# Use inline assembly language in your program.
# Modify and extend the XBasic language.
And, all of the windows common controls and common dialogs are now available to create win32 native graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

== &quot;Hello World!&quot; in XBLite ==
A common example of the language's syntax is the &quot;Hello World&quot; program:

=== A console version ===
 IMPORT  &quot;xst&quot;	 ' Standard library : required by most programs
 DECLARE FUNCTION Entry ()
 
 FUNCTION Entry ()
  PRINT &quot;Hello World!&quot;
  a$ = INLINE$ (&quot;Press Enter to quit &gt;&quot;)
 END FUNCTION
 END PROGRAM

=== A GUI version ===
 IMPORT &quot;gdi32&quot;             ' import a system library
 IMPORT &quot;user32&quot;            ' import a system library
 DECLARE FUNCTION Entry ()  ' declare function Entry()
 
 FUNCTION Entry ()          ' begin function                           
  ' display a message box  
  MessageBoxA (0, &amp;&quot;Hello World!&quot;, &amp;&quot;Hello World Window&quot;, $$MB_OK)
 END FUNCTION               ' end function
 END PROGRAM                ' end program

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello there. I'm new to Wiki and all that, but after finding Wikipedia and looking around I'm loving it.


At the moment? Well, I'm working on a rather large body of work which will hopefully be a complete IB Economics textbook for this site. I am halfway through my first year, so it's going to be a long and arduous process. Kind of the like the IB.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">who is this Proffessor James Rachels? The critisisms atributed to him are as far as I am aware as old as utilitarianism it'self and perhaps even older. Foolip, I am glad somebody else is on the case, I have done some work with historical utilitarianism, but am not so good on the modern side.

----

I applaud the work done on this wikibook, but find the quality of the section on utilitarianism to be unsatisfactory. I write this as notes to myself, so that I shall be able to come back at a later time and make improvements.
*History of Utilitarianism (Bentham, Mill, Sidgwick).
*Different types of utilitarianism: hedonistic and preference utilitarianism
*Utilitarianism and equality (Singer's equal consideration of interests)
*Utilitarianism today (mainly Peter Singer)
*Other critiques of utilitarianism (and counter-claims!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Use ==
Present Subjuntivo '''(O presente do subjuntivo)''' is used to show that some idea or action is hypothetical. It is also used to express desire, emotion, improbability, give commands, and in impersonal expressions to express opinion (i.e. É bom que '''ele seja'''.)

'''Example:''' Eu quero '''que tu''' me '''tragas''' um garfo. -&gt; I want you to bring me a fork.

== Forming ==
''Presente do Conjuntivo'' is formed from the '''singular first person of Presente do Indicativo's radical''', plus the following desinencies:

== Separation Axioms for Topological Spaces ==
{{TOC right}}

A topology on a space is a collection of subsets called ''open''. We can then ask questions such as &quot;can we separate any two distinct points in the space by enclosing them in two disjoint open sets?&quot; For the real line with its usual topology, the answer is obviously yes, but there are spaces for which this is not so. It turns out that many properties of continous maps one could take for granted depend, in fact, on one of the conditions stated below holding. Topological spaces are classified according to which such conditions, called ''separation axioms'', happen to hold.

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, and let ''x,y'' be any two distinct points in that space. The following conditions, ordered from least to most restrictive, are ones we may wish to place on &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt;:

; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : For every ''x, y'', there exists an open set ''O'' that contains one point of the pair, but not the other.

; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : For every ''x, y'', there exist open sets &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains ''x'' but not ''y'' and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains ''y'' but not ''x''.

; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : For every ''x, y'', there exist ''disjoint open sets'' &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains ''y''.  &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; spaces are also called '''Hausdorff''' spaces.

; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt; : For every ''x, y'', there exist ''disjoint closed neighborhoods'' &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' and ''y'' respectively.

; '''regular''' : If ''C'' is a closed set, and ''z'' is a point not in ''C'', there exist disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains ''C'' and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains ''z''. A topological space that is both regular and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

; '''completely regular''' : If ''C'' is a closed set, and ''z'' is a point not in ''C'', there exists a ''continuous function'' &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that ''f''(''z'')=0 and for any &lt;math&gt;w\in C&lt;/math&gt;, we have ''f''(''w'')=1 (i.e. ''f''(''C'')={1}). A topological space that is both completely regular and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3½&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

; '''normal''' : If &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are ''disjoint closed sets'', there exist disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space that is both normal and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

; '''completely normal''' : Let &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; be ''separated sets'', meaning that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)\cap B=A\cap\mathrm{Cl}(B)=\O&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exist disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space that is both completely normal and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

; '''perfectly normal''' : If &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint closed sets, there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{0\})=C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{1\})=C_2&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space that is both perfectly normal and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

NOTE: Many authors treat regular, completely regular, normal, completely normal, and perfectly normal spaces as synonyms for the corresponding ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' property.

==Relations among the Separation Properties==
The ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' separation properties (axioms) form a hierarchy, such that if ''i&gt;j'', then property  ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' implies property  ''T&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. When property ''T&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' implies ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', which in turn implies ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' was proposed after ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is designated ''T&lt;sub&gt;i½&lt;/sub&gt;''. Other implications of these properties include:
* Complete regularity always implies regularity, even without assuming ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'';
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' alone suffices to make a regular space ''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''. The full ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' property is unnecessary;
* Perfect normality implies complete normality, which in turn implies normality;
* A topological space is completely normal if and only if every subspace is normal.

==Exercises==

#Suppose that a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;. Given &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, show that &lt;math&gt;X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is open to conclude that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is closed.
#Given a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and given that for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed, show that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Some Important Theorems==

&lt;!--
===Theorem 3.1.1===
A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed for each &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''':&lt;br /&gt; Assume &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Now (by definition of &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;) for every &lt;math&gt;y_i\in X&lt;/math&gt; that is distinct from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is an open set &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; containing  &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\bigcup Y_i = X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, and (being equal to a union of opens)  &lt;math&gt;X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is open. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed.

Now if &lt;math&gt;y\in X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are distinct. Thus there is an open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by definition of &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have &lt;math&gt;y\in U\subseteq X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is open, so &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed. 


Now assume that &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed for each &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; are distinct, then &lt;math&gt;x\in X\setminus\{y\}=O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\in X\setminus\{x\}=O_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; are open sets not containing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Thus by definition, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

===Theorem 3.1.2===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; space and let &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; either does not converge in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; or it converges to a unique limit.

'''Proof'''&lt;br /&gt; Assume that &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to two distinct values &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;, there are disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

Now by definition of convergence, there is an integer &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n\geq M&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;s_n\in U&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly there is an integer &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n\geq N&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;s_n\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

Take an integer &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that is greater than both &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;s_K&lt;/math&gt; is in both &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the fact that the two sets are disjoint. Therefore &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; cannot converge to both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem 3.1.3===
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is normal.

'''Proof'''

Given any &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, and any point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, define the distance, &lt;math&gt;d(x,A)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by
&lt;math&gt;d(x,A):=\inf\{d(x,a)|a\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;d(x,a)&lt;/math&gt; is the distance function supplied by definition of a metric space.  Observe that &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto d(x,A)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

Fix closed, disjoint subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and define &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow [-1,1]&lt;/math&gt; by
&lt;math&gt;f(x):=\frac{d(x,B)-d(x,A)}{d(x,A)+d(x,B)}.&lt;/math&gt;
(Note &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; well--defined, since for any &lt;math&gt;S\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;d(x,S)=0&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the closure of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.)  Observe &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is 1 on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, -1 on &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and in the open interval &lt;math&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; elsewhere.  Also, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; continuous by the continuity of &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto d(x,A)&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}([-1,-1/2))\supset B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}((1/2,1])\supset A&lt;/math&gt; are the preimages of open sets (open in &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;, that is) and therefore open, and they're disjoint as the preimages of disjoint sets.

===Theorem 3.1.4===
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Proof'''&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; be two distinct points, and let &lt;math&gt;d=\tfrac{d(x,y)}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;B_d(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_d(y)&lt;/math&gt; are open sets which are disjoint since if there is a point &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; within both open balls, then &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)+d(x,z)&lt;\tfrac{2}{3}d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction.

===Urysohn's Lemma===
A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is normal if and only if for any disjoint closed sets &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(C_1)=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(C_2)=\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof''&lt;br /&gt;
In order to prove Urysohn's Lemma, we first prove the following result:

Let X be a topological space. X is normal if and only if for every closed set U, and open set V containing U, there is an open set S containing U whose closure is within V.

Suppose that X is normal. If V is X, then X is a set containing U whose closure is within V. Otherwise, the complement of V is a nonempty closed set, which is disjoint from U. Thus, by the normality of X, there are two disjoint open sets A and B, where A contains U and B contains the complement of V. The closure of A does not meet B because all points in B have a neighborhood that is entirely within B and thus does not meet A (since they are disjoint), so all points in B are not within the closure of A. Thus, the set A is a set containing U, and whose closure does not meet B, and therefore does not meet the complement of V, and therefore is entirely contained in V.
Conversely, take any two disjoint closed sets U and V. The complement of V is an open set containing the closed set U. Therefore, there is a set &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; containing U whose closure is within the complement of V, which is the same thing as being disjoint from V. Then the complement of V is an open set containing the closed set Cl(&lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore, there is a set &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; such that Cl(&lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;) is within the complement of V i. e. is disjoint from V. Then &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and the complement of &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are open sets which respectively contain U and V, which are disjoint.

Now we prove Urysohn's Lemma.

Let X be a normal space, and let U and V be two closed sets. Set &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; to be U, and set &lt;math&gt;U_1&lt;/math&gt; to be X.

Let &lt;math&gt;U_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; be a set containing U_0 whose closure is contained in &lt;math&gt;U_1&lt;/math&gt;. In general, inductively define for all natural numbers n and for all natural numbers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;U_{\frac{2a+1}{2^n}}&lt;/math&gt; to be a set containing &lt;math&gt;U_{\frac{a}{2^{n-1}}}&lt;/math&gt; whose closure is contained within the complement of &lt;math&gt;U_{\frac{a+1}{2^{n-1}}}&lt;/math&gt;. This defines &lt;math&gt;U_p&lt;/math&gt; where p is a rational number in the interval [0,1] expressible in the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; where a and n are whole numbers.

Now define the function &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; [0,1] to be f(p)=inf{x|&lt;math&gt;p \in U_x&lt;/math&gt;}.

Consider any element x within the normal space X, and and consider any open interval (a,b) around f(x). There exists rational numbers c and d in that open interval expressible in the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; where p and n are whole numbers, such that c&lt;f(x)&lt;d. If c&lt;0, then replace it with 0, and if d&gt;1, then replace it with 1. Then the intersection of the complement of the set &lt;math&gt;U_c&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;U_d&lt;/math&gt; is an open neighborhood of f(x) with an image within (a,b), proving that the function is continuous. 

Conversely, suppose that for any two disjoint closed sets, there is a continuous function f from X to [0,1] such that f(x)=0 when x is an element of U, and that f(x)=1 when x is an element of V. Then since the disjoint sets [0,.5) and (.5,1] are open and under the subspace topology, the inverses &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}([0,.5))&lt;/math&gt;, which contains X, and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}((.5,1])&lt;/math&gt;, which contains Y, are also open and disjoint.

==Exercises==

It is instructive to build up a series of spaces, such that each member belongs to one class, but not the next.

* The indiscrete topology is not &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T} = \{ [0,x) | x\in [0,1] \}&lt;/math&gt;, then this space is &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.
* Consider an arbitrary infinite set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and every finite subset be closed sets, and call the open sets &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Determine whether &lt;math&gt;(X, \Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, is a topological space which is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;. Hint: Consider the intersection of any two open, non-empty sets.

Verify that
* &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; (hint: use theorem 3.1.1)

==Continuity==
Continuity is the central concept of topology. Essentially, topological spaces have the minimum necessary structure to allow a definition of continuity.  Continuity in almost any other context can be reduced to this definition by an appropriate choice of topology.

=== Definition ===

Let &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; be topological spaces.

A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all open neighborhoods &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is continuous at all points in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

The function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is said to be continuous over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is continuous at all points in its domain.

&lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if for all open sets &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, its inverse &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; is also an open set.&lt;br /&gt;
''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be an open set in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Because it is continuous, for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;, there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;x\in A\subseteq f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;, since B is an open neighborhood of f(x). That implies that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; is open.&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
The inverse image of any open set under a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is also open in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be any element of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then the inverse image of any neighborhood &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;, would also be open. Thus, there is an open neighborhood &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the function is continuous.


If two functions are continuous, then their composite function is continuous. This is because if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; have inverses which carry open sets to open sets, then the inverse &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}(f^{-1}(x))&lt;/math&gt; would also carry open sets to open sets.

=== Examples ===
*Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; have the discrete topology. Then the map &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for any topology on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.
*Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; have the trivial topology. Then a constant map &lt;math&gt;g:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for any topology on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

== Homeomorphism ==
When a homeomorphism exists between two topological spaces, then they are &quot;essentially the same&quot;, topologically speaking.

=== Definition ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; be topological spaces&lt;br /&gt;
A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;is said to be a '''homeomorphism''' if and only if &lt;br /&gt;

(i)  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection&lt;br /&gt;
(ii) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(iii)&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous over &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If a homeomorphism exists between two spaces, the spaces are said to be '''homeomorphic'''

If a property of a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; applies to all homeomorphic spaces to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, it is called a '''topological property'''.

=== Notes ===
#A map may be bijective and continuous, but not a homeomorphism. Consider the bijective map &lt;math&gt;f:[0,1) \rightarrow S^1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(x)=e^{2\pi ix}&lt;/math&gt; mapping the points in the domain onto the unit circle in the plane. This is not a homeomorphism, because there exist open sets in the domain that are not open in &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;, like the set &lt;math&gt;\left[ 0,\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
#Homeomorphism is an equivalence relation

== Exercises ==
#Prove that the open interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
#Establish the fact that a Homeomorphism is an equivalence relation over topological spaces.
# (i)Construct a bijection &lt;math&gt;f:[0,1]\to [0,1]^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (ii)Determine whether this &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a homeomorphism.

== Relating the Einstein equation to Newtonian physics ==

I have not studied general relativity (but I am an engineer, so I have a reasonably good physics background) and a look at the Einstein equation baffles me.  Would anybody be able to creating an example that shows how the Einstein equation simplies to something that would be taught in a sophmore physics class.

R_ab under &quot;Vacuum Field Equations&quot; should be R_munu for consistent notation, right? I'm not confident enough to change this myself.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">THIS SECTION HAS BEEN STRONGLY EDITED DURING A &quot;THE GREAT EDIT OF 2008&quot;.
further information about the Edit can be found in the talk page.  Previous discussion material is nearly entirely irrelevant as little of the original text is left. Archival information shall be preserved below--[[User:JoliePA|JoliePA]] ([[User talk:JoliePA|talk]]) 17:13, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

== GRAMMER AND SPELLING ==

*Without doubt, grammar and spelling is rough.  It was always one of my greatest weakness  of my writing styles.  Hopefully in time it will improve.

== INTRODUCTION ==
*Introduction is rough and not succinct.

== PALEOINDIANS ==
*Considerable controversy about the Bering ice bridge theory.  Many professionals most espacially cultural linguists and anthropologists feel there were significant connections to early cultures, espacially by boats.  (which were known to exist in this early time).  Unfortunately evidence seems sketchy and proven.  This is Not a exhuastive account of 'models of migration into the American Continents'.  Thus NPOV, in my opinion demands that I include the well tested bering land bridge theory.  While it my not be the only (or even the primary (espacially in South America) it is nearly certain THAT some civilizations came to North America via the bering land bridge.  This was probably the Clovis people.  

== MAYANS AND AZTECS ==
*No talk about the end of the world and the aztec calender.  that is needless gibberish.  if the mayan did correctly forecast the end of the world in 2010; perhaps my book will barely be written (LOL).  The mayans (nor any other ancient civilization) did not study or understand the nature of asteroids. 

*Diminished tales of Human sacrifice which was needlessly sensational.  Not exactly the most important or finest accomplishment of either Mayan or Aztec civilization. (and also not isolated to those two cultures either).

*The tale about sacrificing 84,000 people is considered by most experts to be highly exagerated.  but somehow, it says something significant about Aztec culture that they claimed to kill 84,000 when they didn't.

*I fail to see the relevance of Aztec, Incan or Mayan cultures on the development of the US.  however, I am strictly following the college boards selection of topics.
 -- Shall I remove them? [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 00:28, 10 April 2014 (UTC)

== NORTH AMERICAN GROUPS (disclaimer) ==
*Discussions about a civilization, culture, tribe, or group all fall short in North America.  frequently, authors stress that these loosely allied groups fall short of many of these definitions.  Thus the Anazani could be considered, a culture, a way of life, a civilization...but not a coherent group, Nation, Tribe, or City.  Within many of these loose groups; groups such as a Nation, tribe, city DO exist they just don't include everyone.
:* the mound builders are perhaps more frustrating to describe, because they dominate a huge area and time and are in places and at time more (and less) unified.

*One could argue that I am excessively focused on the urban centers and buildings.  these large structures are well understood cultural accomplishments that IMHO say much about the power and influence of a civilization.

== NATIVE AMERICANS AFTER EUROPEAN CONTACT ==
*The last section feels weak and unneccessary.  The college board requires that discussions of several large cultures then includes a general blurb &quot;American cultures at the time of European contact&quot;- That has me puzzled having given the history of the most significant American cultures; I have already told the reader there status at &quot;European contact&quot; (and actually briefly discussed what happens after european contact as well).  My only guess is some kind of generalized statement about what European contact did to the native american cultures as a whole.  Its weak!  any ideas would be appreciated.----

== ARCHIVE: General style issues ==

As a teacher who is considering the use of alternative textbooks (rather than those from the traditional mainstream publishers), I was disappointed by the quality of the writing. The information may be fine, but phrases like &quot;an isthmus made of land&quot; and &quot;from whence&quot; are unacceptable in an academic text. I don't mean to be so harsh, but students need all the help with grammar they can get. &quot;[A]n isthmus made of land&quot; is redundant (an isthmus is *always* made of land), as is &quot;from whence&quot; (&quot;whence&quot; essentially means &quot;from where&quot;).

You might as well write, &quot;A strip of land made of land&quot; and &quot;from from where.&quot;

I plan to make a Wikibooks account for myself when I get home tonight (writing from a cafe), but wanted to drop this note as a reminder to everybody that textbooks are typically used in academic settings, so grammatical errors stick out much more than they would in a novel or a newspaper article.

Students don't read history texts because they want to learn how to write, but for anybody whose grammar is in good shape, these sloppy mistakes reflect poorly on the authors, and therefore call into question the quality of the material.

== ARCHIVE: Non sequitur in this section ==

The paragraph copied below contains a major non sequitur, clearly the result of sloppy editing. I can't fix it because I don't know the content.

Offending paragraph:

Such evidence is made even more ambiguous by the traces of DNA that span the Pacific Ocean from Australia to Papua New Guinea, across Micronesia to east Asia. This opens the possibility of sea travel hugging the coast; unfortunately evidence of such a theory that would be left on the shores would be eliminated over time due to sustained coastal erosions and sea level changes. The DNA facts significantly negate, and arguably eliminate, the Bering Strait theory, which is not supported by any conflicting physical evidence. The flint points are used on a flatboard (like bristles on a toothbrush) on the Asian mainland, rather than mounted on spears like the Clovis points, thereby calling into question the idea of tool migration, a major source of this post-Ice-Age migration theory.

[[User:68.40.192.159|68.40.192.159]] 13:03, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

The bering strait ice bridge migration theory is now known to not be supported by any real world evidence, and also is directly contradicted by DNA and archeological evidence. The second editor seems to be refuting the points made at the beginning of the chapter, and introducing the evidence.

== ARCHIVE: Editorial material moved from main article==

The following material was moved by this author from the main article to this discussion page since it contains commentary that, although having merit, is more appropriate for discussion (the original conclusions, however, remain in the main article): The Bearing Strait hypothesis has a number of things wrong wtih it:(1) it is a bigoted, racist 19th century European egocentrist view that aboriginees were ignorant heatherns and therefore just too dumb or stupid  to construct boats to cross oceans. Contrary to this:the earliest boats have been found to date back some 30,000 years and possiblely earlier all over the world. Certainly by 20,000 years ago; boat building had reached  the point that man could cross oceans. The evidence for this comes from Japan et al. (2)Climatological(Ice cores) and wood ring studies do not support the hypothesis because it assumes that humans came down what was then a great ice field blocking easy travel further south where the Alaskan Highway is today.  (3) The theory ignores the fact that people could have used the Aleutians to arrive in North America and many Inuit still travel in such manner from Nome,Alaska back and forth from Little Diomede Island to Big Diomede.  (4)The Bearing Strait theory has a major problem in that if true then some millions of people arrived instantly all at the same time all over North, Central and South America---something not quiet possible.  Humans do not reproduce as fast as bacteria do to arrive at that population level in so short at time and would have needed modern transportation to have distributed so widely in so short of time.[[User:Lottamiata|Lottamiata]] 21:49, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

== ARCHIVE: Redundant material. ==

The following material was removed because it had been mentioned earlier in the article.  Also, some of the detail is too great for a treaty on United States history and Wikipedia links have been provided instead:  These people intermarried with  the descendents some of the first aboriginees  who were alledgely composed of about 5 men and two women. . . .  Such evidence is made even more ambiguous by the traces of DNA that span the Pacific Ocean from Australia to Papua New Guinea, across Micronesia to east Asia. This opens the possibility of sea travel hugging the coast; unfortunately evidence of such a theory that would be left on the shores would be eliminated over time due to sustained coastal erosions and sea level changes. The DNA facts significantly negate, and arguably eliminate, the Bering Strait theory, which is not supported by any conflicting physical evidence.[[User:Lottamiata|Lottamiata]] 23:20, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Economic Groups? ==


There is no mention of the interactions between groups of countries. There needs to be mentions on international organizations such as NATO, EU, AU, and the SACN.

== Suggestion: Change to International Relations? ==

Hi, if I could make a suggestion to change this book to International Relations, that could cover a much broader range of subjects. J

== That doesn't make sense ==

Diplomatic history and international relations are two different fields, although related. International relations tries to explain the actions of states and non-state actors through models and formulae. It is a division of political science. It often draws on Diplomatic history to illustrate or illuminate concepts, but exists to a large extent in the abstract.

Diplomatic history is, at its core, historical: What state did what when, and how did that lead to a certain state of world affairs? Diplomatic history is a detailed discipline, that (at its best) does not apply the broad strokes of IR.

So, no, it wouldn't be appropriate to change the name. There's already an IR wikibook anyway.

Best,

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the second example of &quot;Building a Chain from Nodes&quot; nodes are created while intergers are input, then the nodes are iterated over in a while loop. Inside the loop, the current node value is accessed--get-value(nodes)-- then the nodes object is updated--nodes := get-next(nodes)--.

It seems the while loop would exit after the first iteration as the nodes reference is still the last item added and the get-next(nodes) call would return a null. I would have expected to a reference to the first item stored and the nodes object reset to this original reference before the while loop in question was entered. Is this a typo or am I missing an obvious concept?

:The last item added is the front of the list, not the back of the list. I thought about perhaps having some &quot;head&quot; pointer and a tail pointer, but that might be more complicated than this way. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 14:31, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::Thank you, that completly clears up my confusion. I looked at the example for a long time, but missed that the first item in the list starts off with a null reference and all further items reference the previous item. I just couldn't see it. Thanks for the prompt feedback and the great resource.

In this section, the book makes reference to the term &quot;node&quot; as a data type, but isn't singly linked list the more technically correct term? I always thought a linked list was made up of nodes, but the data structure itself was called a linked list.

In the list of node operations is set-next method with return value Node. But in the implementation, there is no return value. set-next is used in the example where data are stored in not reversed order. According to this example, set-next should return Node that has been set as next in original Node.</text>

One of the most difficult parts of making a movie is the acquisition of adequate funding for production.  One method to receive the requisite monies is to bring your script concept before an entity that grants funding to third-party production houses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Refraction in a ripple tank.png|thumb|right|When light travels from one medium to another, it bends.]]

'''Refraction''' is the change in direction and phase velocity of a wave due to a change in the medium in which the wave is traveling. A wave which undergoes this phenomenon is said to have been refracted. This phenomenon is most commonly observed when a wave passes from one medium to another at any angle other than 90° or 0°. Refraction is described by Snell's law (also known as the Snell–Descartes law and the law of refraction), which states that for a given pair of media and a wave with a single frequency, the ratio of the sines of the ''angle of incidence'' ''θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''angle of refraction'' ''θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is equivalent to the ratio of phase velocities (''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'') in the two media, or equivalently, to the opposite ratio of the indices of refraction (''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1} .&lt;/math&gt;

When a wave travels across an interface and into a medium with a higher index of refraction, the wave bends towards the normal. If a wave travels across an interface and into a lower index of refraction, the wave bends away from the normal. If a wave travels across an interface and into a medium with the same index of refraction, the direction of the wave's propagation does not change. The two most common indices of refraction used when first exploring the topic of refraction are air (n=1.00029) and water (n=1.33). To simplify calculations, the index of refraction of air is typically approximated to be n=1.00 (which is actually the index of refraction of a vacuum).

[[File:Refraction internal reflection diagram.svg|thumbnail|right|Demonstration of no refraction at angles greater than the critical angle.]]
As the angle of incidence increases, the angle of refraction also increases. There comes a point in which the angle of refraction is 90° and means that the wave refracts parallel to the interface. This angle is called the ''critical angle'' and for angles greater than or equal to the critical angle, refraction does not take place and all of the light is reflected; this phenomenon is called ''total internal reflection'' and will be covered in the next section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">English is filled with phrasal verbs, which are phrases made of '''one verb''' with one or more '''other words''' (usually prepositions) that work together to form a '''single, multi-word verb'''. You need to learn these in order to speak English naturally as well as to understand natural English.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The verb “to get” can be used in many ways. It means to obtain, have or receive, and can be used sometimes in place of the verbs, “to be” and “to become”. The verb is very flexible and sometimes, when combined with other words, can take on a whole different meaning. Following is a short list of some common verb phrases using “to get”.
Note: s/b means “somebody”, s/th means “something”


== Basic ==

(to) get drunk: to drink until intoxicated with alcohol
	The college boys lived to get drunk every weekend.

(to) get in s/th: to enter (a car, a body of water, a group, trouble ...)
	Come on, get in the car so we can go.
	That boy is always getting in trouble.

(to) get lost: to lose one’s way
	Goldilocks wandered far into the forest and soon got very lost, and had no idea how to leave.

(to) get mad: to become angry
	The girl got real mad when she found out that her boyfriend had forgotten to pick her up.

(to) get off s/th: to leave, especially an elevated or isolated place such as a bus, elevator or island. Opposite of “get on”
	We were so glad to get off of that elevator after being trapped there for over two hours in the heat.

(to) get on s/th: to enter, especially public transportation or small, elevated place. Opposite of “get off”
	The little girl was afraid to get on the ride at the carnival.

(to) get out: to do fun or enriching activities
	That lady never gets out, so has no idea what is going on in this world.

(to) get rained on: to be rained on
	It was a real bummer that the picnic had gotten rained on.

(to) get together (with s/b): to meet with one or more other people
	They got together every Thursday to play cards and catch up on each other’s lives.
	Spongebob got together with Patrick to plan their escape.

(to) get up: to arise, leave the bed
	It sure was hard to get up in the morning after drinking so much the night before.

== Intermediate ==

(to) get along with s/b: refers to the quality of a relationship with someone
	I have not been getting along with my brother since he wrecked my car.

(to) get around: to be familiar with many places or things
	She needs some time to get around and see all that the city has to offer.

(to) get around to: to do something when time allows
	I’ll get in shape and pay my bills just as soon as I can get around to it.

(to) get away: to escape from work or stress to relax
	The family planned their vacations to get away from the city.

(to) get away with: to do something bad without consequence

      <text xml:space="preserve">School is a place where students, often children, go to learn. The students, also called pupils, learn in groups called classes. A teacher (or teachers) instructs (teaches) each class. Students listen to the teacher and do schoolwork while at school and then homework in the evening at home. 

== Types of schools in the United States ==
In the United States, most children go to public schools for the levels  K-12 (kindergarten &amp; grades 1-12). Public schools are operated by the local government and controlled by a local Board of Education (BOA). Members of the BOA are paid representatives who are elected in each city or township. Public schools in each community are supported by local property taxes and are free to the students. Each state, as well as the federal government, has educational regulations that the local schools must follow. 

Many people criticize the quality of learning in the local school systems, and are looking for new ways for their children to get an education. Some alternatives to public schools are private schools, magnet schools, Montessori schools, home schooling, for-profit schools and web- or Internet-based schools. 

Most private schools are Catholic schools, other Christian schools or private academies. Private schools are usually not free. Students or their families must pay tuition,  which can be very expensive. Some parents send their children to private schools to avoid the bad influences of other students. Many people hope that private schools will offer their children more attention or a better education. 

Magnet schools are public or private schools that focus on a specific area of studies, such as the visual arts, performing arts (drama), or the sciences. 

Montessori schools are learning environments where students can help direct their own studies. Students learn individually, guided by a teacher. 

Home schoolers are students who learn at home with the help of a parent or a tutor, often with religious motivations. This method has been criticized for a long time as inadequate. However, a high percentage of these students are above-average performers, demonstrating academic excellence in comparison to their peers. Some people are concerned that home schoolers miss out on socialization, but parents answer that their children get plenty of social contact at church and in the family, and at neighborhood or community events. In addition, many of these parents desire to avoid the socialization that comes specifically from most public schools, and would prefer their children only to have their socialization from the aforementioned sources.

For-profit schools are schools set up by businesses to make money. Like public schools, these schools usually receive tax money from the government. For-profit schools are relatively new and the schools only exist in a few cities.

Internet-based learning is more common among university-level courses but is starting to be used by some students at the K-12 level.

== Education ==
The goal of schools is to educate their students. Schools use teachers and teaching (didactic) materials to prepare their students with knowledge and skills for future work and life. Education is important for society to function and be productive. By law, American students are required to complete their education (go to school) through high school unless their parent or guardian signs a release note giving them permission to quit school before finishing 12th grade. The great majority of adult Americans have finished high school, and most have gone to at least some college (university-level studies). 

== People at the school ==
There are many people with many jobs at a school besides just students and teachers. The head of the school is called the principal. The principal is in charge of the teachers, administration of the school and the well-being of the students. The principal of each school answers to the superintendent of schools, who is in charge of the entire school system and works with the BOA to make sure that the students can learn effectively in a safe and positive environment. Janitors, custodians, groundskeepers and other maintenance workers clean the schools and make sure that the school grounds are clean, safe and tidy. Guidance counselors help students make decisions and counsel troubled students. The school psychologist helps when the problems are serious or abuse is involved. The school nurse helps sick students and helps assure their health. In many schools there are now police or security officers who maintain security for everyone at the school. The school secretaries help the principal, parents and students with various tasks. Teacher’s assistants are paid to help out in the classroom and often volunteers also help in the classroom in lower grades. Bus drivers pick children up from home in the morning and take them back home in the afternoon in long, yellow school buses. Substitute teachers (subs) teach or take care of classes when the regular teacher is absent. Cafeteria workers (lunch ladies) prepare and serve lunch and sometimes breakfast in the cafeteria. And sometimes other people come to visit the school to give presentations.

== Vacations ==
Students traditionally attend school for five days a week, about six or seven hours a day, for most of the year. They have vacations, or time without classes, for a few months in the summer and a few weeks around Christmas/New Year’s. Summer vacation is a favorite time for children to relax and have a good time, although they tend to complain of boredom. Others use the time for activities such as athletics, and a somewhat smaller group feels the need to do independent studies over vacations.

Schoolwork is usually made up of writing papers, reading books, doing worksheets, solving mathematical problems, researching different topics, doing special projects, and so on. Of course, the type of schoolwork that a teacher assigns to his or her students depends on the level of the class and the topic under study, as well as the preference of the teacher. Homework is sometimes called assignments, which refers to a task that is assigned.

== Classes ==
Students are divided by ages and ability levels into grades, which are usually subdivided into different groups or classes. “Class” can refer to the group of about 25 students who meet together habitually, even if together they study various topics, as is the case in lower grades. “Class” can also mean course, an academic topic or subject that lasts for a school year or part of a school year. A class of this sort only meets together certain hours of the week, for example one hour every day or three times a week. The other common meaning of the word “class” is everyone who is in the same grade level. In high school especially, the students in one grade are collectively known as a class, identified by their year of graduation. The students who graduate in 2006 are called the class of 2006.

One teacher teaches one class at a time. In lower grades, the same teacher usually has the same group of students, or class, all or most of the day. In higher grades, pupils have a different teacher for each class, or subject. Even in lower grades, specialized instructors usually  teach certain courses like art, music, and gym.

Examples of “classes” as courses are reading, general science, and computer class. Students can take classes in the following areas: math (mathematics), including pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics; sciences, including biology, chemistry, physical science, physics, and laboratories (labs); language arts including English, literature, composition, and foreign languages like French or Spanish; music including band, orchestra, and choir; social studies, health, gym, government, art, shop, accounting, and home economics, and many more, depending on the school. Other classes or periods of the day include lunch, recess, and study hall.

== Parts of the school grounds ==
The classroom is where most of the learning takes place, the office is where the principal and other school administrators and the secretary or secretaries work. The gym (gymnasium) is where students have gym class, and the locker room is nearby, where the students change clothes and shower after gym. The playground is where kids go for recess, and everyone who drives parks in the parking lot. Everyone eats lunch in the cafeteria (lunch room) except maybe the teachers, who &quot;hide&quot; in the teacher’s lounge and are believed to complain about the students. In reality, most teachers will have lunch, a discussion, and/or may grade schoolwork of the students. The cafeteria is often considered a social vice, because what often happens is that specific groups of children will sit at specific tables and permit only similar children at their table. Many can remember tables with &quot;cool&quot; people, and its opposite. Still, in some schools, this is less severe or nonexistent, while at others, extremely defined. Kids with problems (or a desire to get out of a class, as the case sometimes is,) can visit the school nurse in the nurse’s office or a guidance counselor in the guidance office. You can imagine what happens in the art, band and choir rooms. Many science rooms, especially at higher levels, have defining features, although they may vary. (ex. chemical storage, non-wood desks, tool storage, emergency features, etc.) The rooms are connected together by halls (hallways). Often, there are main hallways lined with lockers to store books and the like for the students. Many classrooms exist for teaching various subjects. Often, one teacher or group of teachers will have predominant use of the classroom for teaching, and will put posters and diagrams up throughout the room, often making the teacher(s) and/or subjects taught somewhat identifiable from a glance. As with most public establishments, there are often bathrooms throughout the school, and they are often subject to vandalism and lack of care in certain schools.

== Levels of school ==
(Preschool and daycare); ages 0-5, 3-5
Elementary school (grade school): K-5 (kindergarten and grades one through five); ages 5-11
Middle school (junior high school): Grades 6-8; ages 11-14
High school: Grades 9-12; ages 14-18

The above is not status quo as one changes schools by any means. Often children may start late or early, or may stay back and skip grades. State and Local laws usually dictate ages for starting school. In some places, it may be four years and a certain number of months before one can enter elementary schools. There are also school systems that may split up their grades as K-6 to elementary and change other grades.

=== Preschool and daycare ===
Many children attend a sort of day-care or preschool before they are old enough to go to kindergarten. Preschool is usually only a few hours a day and may not be every day. Preschool and daycare can help working mothers be free to go to work. They also can help small children begin to build social skills. Preschool is not a standard part of public education. Preschools are usually small, private institutions run in the neighborhood. 

=== Elementary school ===
Children begin school at age five or six when they enter kindergarten. Kindergarten in the United States is one year long and children typically attend half-days or every other day. Teachers are usually women and are with one class all or most of the day. Teachers’ assistants and classroom volunteers, usually parents, often help out with routine tasks in the classroom. 

Classes may be as small as fifteen students to as large as thirty-five. Both boys and girls of about the same age are taught together in the same room. Subjects include basic reading, math, writing, and cultural issues. 

Younger students tend to spend a large part of their day playing. For example, a kindergartner's play time is mixed in with time for learning basic concepts such as the alphabet, telling time, and how to read basic words. In later grades, play time is reduced to recess, an unstructured time where students can play or do sports or games for an hour or so. 

== Grading ==
Each student gets letter grades in each subject, which range from A to F with A being the best and F being the worst. Pluses (+) and minuses (-) are sometimes used to divide one letter into distinct levels. For example, “B” can be divided into B+, B and B-.

Normally, one must achieve a certain grade measured out of 100 to get a certain letter grade. The scales for what numerical grade constitutes what letter grade often differ by school and teacher(s). Usually, one must have a 92 or a 90 for an &quot;A&quot; range grade, and the letters usually change at a rate of one every ten points with some exceptions. &quot;F&quot; is usually placed at 60-72 percentage points, often at 65. Some systems might not even use &quot;E&quot; as a grade, and skip from &quot;D&quot; to &quot;F&quot; on such a scale.

A GPA (Grade Point Average) is sometimes done out of four points. Usually, achieving an &quot;A&quot; gets one a four, and anything less usually gets a lower point value. These point values are then averaged for this number. Sometimes, for more difficult levels of classes, these numbers are &quot;weighted&quot; in their point values as such.

Sometimes one will get a straight percentage grade, but it is rare to receive this without a letter grade as well.

Some schools now give &quot;L&quot; as a grade to all students, meaning &quot;learning&quot; and the practice is scorned upon. At that point, a grade doesn't matter, since one can not get something otherwise, and the system does not reward those working harder than their peers.

In order to weight assignments, many teachers at higher levels give a certain number of assignments and give them different point values. At the end of the grading period, the points earned is divided by the maximum point total and then multiplied by a hundred to give points out of one hundred.

== Discipline ==
Sometimes students misbehave and must be disciplined. Each school has its own methods, which usually include trips to the principal’s office, notes or calls home to the parents, and after-school detentions. Typical offenses are smoking, fighting, cheating, cursing (cussing or swearing), picking on (bullying) other students, inappropriate clothing (violation of dress code), inappropriate touching or displays of affection, stealing, talking back (insolence), lateness (tardiness), skipping class (cutting class), vandalism, plagiarism or otherwise causing trouble or breaking the rules. Especially serious infractions of student conduct can result in long- or short-term suspension from school, expulsion, or even court dates and jail time, although this is less likely for juvenile offenders.

Several systems of discipline exist, as stated earlier. One common system is to divide the offenses into groups, levels, or tiers. Each one of these has its own unique punishments involved. In such a system, the lowest might be a minor offense, like talking in class, and may be met with a warning, but a repeat offense will put it in the next grouping. The highest usually involves federal offenses and are met extremely seriously.

One system would involve a unique punishment for every situation, but is often difficult to figure out in a school large and/or disorderly enough to prevent a central figure from doing such things, requiring someone such as the teacher to enforce such things on a lower level and decide this. A more efficient method than this case-by-case basis would be some set of rules or a code that would mandate unique punishments for every crime.

Younger children are often subjected to a small set of simplified rules in their classrooms that the teacher places, sometimes with the help of the students. This is in addition to whatever the school requires, but often includes what the school requires, as is relevant to a young child.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Core&quot; maths is no longer the correct term. It is now called &quot;Pure&quot; and the module is no longer called C1, it is P1. Further Pure 1 is FP1 etc...
:I could swear that it was the other way around - they changed it ''from'' pure and it became '''core''' in the process. Hence schools have purchased books for &quot;Core&quot;. - [[User:Estel|Estel]] 20:39, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Estel is correct, for OCR at least. See the specification that is linked to on the actual page. [[User:Mattrix|Mattrix]] 16:21, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Further that. Estel is correct. C1~P1, C2,3,4~P2,P3 as I understand it. This is the last any person will be able to do old 'Pure', such as those who are doing further maths. Those who are doing single maths are, in my school, forced to retake equivalent core modules. Secondly, I am currently taking some Maths exams (p3,4 ; m3 ; d1), and may write something on them here. Unfortunately I have no experience of the new system, so some fiddling around may be needed. --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 22:39, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::Correction, I'm taking the edexcel syllabus, so cannot really contribute fully, other than formulae etc.
:::You should still be able to contribute if you want as the syllabi are broadly similar and you can look at the OCR specification linked to on the main page for more information. [[User:Mattrix|Mattrix]] 15:42, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Congrat Matt :D. This Wikibook is number 21 when it comes to a Google search of &quot;C1 maths OCR revision&quot; - [[User:Estel|Estel]] 15:03, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

Um well I think we should copy the syllabus as closly as possible, it clearly states CORE, and well, just leave it. --[[User:Mitchc|Mitchc]] 07:00, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

In my AQA syllabus, it is called &quot;Pure Core Maths&quot; - maybe that would be a good compromise? [[User:Guiltyspark|Guiltyspark]] 11:02, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

== Is this the correct structure? ==

I was reading in the discussion on another page that this needs to have a mulitple refrence system, so that what is covered in P1 or C1, isn't repeated all over the place. I also question the DE section, does this need its own section or should more be filled in?--[[User:Mitchc|Mitchc]] 06:46, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

:Yes a multiple reference system would be useful eventually, but will be quite difficult. I think the best strategy would be to get the book close to completion based solely on one specification, and then work on an adaption for the most similar specification, and so on. A completed book for one or two specifications is much better than a half-empty structure for lots of specifications. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 20:10, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

:: I agree with [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]], lets finish the content before we mess about with different contents pages. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 19:00, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

:I have a suggestion for an improved structure to this wikibook --- separate the contents into pure maths, mechanics, statistics, etc. Within each of these categories, we introduce the concepts in a complete manner, and highlight (colour coding perhaps?) the different demands of the specification modules. --[[User:The.ginkgo.nut|The.ginkgo.nut]] 16:24, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

:: I think this would be handier, but only once the content is much more complete. Then we can expand it to be more of a ''general'' A-level wikibook with pages linking to the exact parts you need to know for each syllabus. --[[User:Avxxv|Avxxv]] 19:26, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

Not that there's really much debate over it now, but the current structure seems to me to be the one which seems most useful, with the information broken down into the modules and topics on the OCR specification. [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 20:51, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

==  Worked problems? ==

Would it be a good idea to provide a couple of good worked problems for each section of the content? Ideally, the problems should be modeled after what might be expected in the actual exam. --[[User:The.ginkgo.nut|The.ginkgo.nut]] 01:12, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

:That's a good idea, so far, I've been using small examples to show certain concepts, but exam style answers with working would be a great help to students. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 19:59, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

== Mathematics vs. Further Mathematics ==

Briefly: should Mathematics and Further Mathematics come under the same WikiBook, as they are different courses? If not, would at least some restructuring on this page make it clearer which parts are for which? [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 20:45, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:Further mathematics requires you to take the further pure modules, and any one of the applied modules (Stats, mechanics, or decision), so there is quite a bit of overlap between both courses. I think something saying like &quot;further pure 1 + 2 and an applied module are required for the further maths course&quot; and &quot;the four core modules with two applied modules are required for a qualification in A-level mathematics&quot; should be fine.--[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 21:25, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

----

&quot;A module may only be taken as part of a Mathematics or a Further Mathematics course. A student must therefore take 6 unique modules to be awarded an AS (Advanced Subsidiary) Level qualification in Further Mathematics.&quot;

Is that true?  Can you do AS Maths and AS Further Maths, without doing A2 Maths?  Surely C3 and C4 are prerequisite for FP1.  I did the edexcel course, and did it before the P's became C's, so it may be different, but it seems odd if this is true.  Why do 2 AS's rather than 1 A-Level? [[User:Tango|Tango]] 20:59, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

:You certainly can. FP1 only requires GCSE-level maths, as it is all new (harder stuff), taught at the same time as C1 and C2. And one would rarely choose to take two AS's, the 9 module option would be more common. [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 03:49, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

::Depends on which board you are taking, It seems with OCR the maths and further maths can be taking side by side, conversly for edexcel the further maths modules are dependant upon the entire A level sylabus, and as such the modules are completely different and orderdered to the OCR modules.--[[User:82.153.238.161|82.153.238.161]] 15:17, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

== Differential Equations ==

Is this really a module for OCR? [[User:Aleksev|Aleksev]] 13:33, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

*I can't see it as a seperate module, although the subject is part of Further Pure Mathematics 3 (FP3), and Core Mathematics 4 (C4). [[User:Silverfish|Silverfish]] 17:19, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

*It is a module, I'm currently taking it. [[User:CardboardCup|CardboardCup]] 14:15, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

==High school applications==
I'm a high school teacher, and would like to contribute.  It would be useful to me if this mapped onto high school courses.  Does it, or, can we work on that?  Let me know if/how I can help! [[User:70.26.230.177|70.26.230.177]] 04:35, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
:Sure, A-levels are taken between the ages of 16-18, so I think this is the same sort of material as high school. You can have a look at the syllabus on the front page of this book to see what topics need to be covered. From there you should be able to find out which parts of the books map onto high school courses. [[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 12:40, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

== is CS1 complete? ==
All pages in CS1 are marked as complete (4 green squares), shouldnt CS1 be marked as complete on this page as well?

PS. great job with this A-level book, it looks great, so much of this stuff isnt taught in the Canadian High School Curiculum.

== Answers to textbooks ==

When I was going through the course, I did some of my homework on the computer (in LaTeX, no less), so I can assemble things like [[User:Odd_bloke]] with relative ease. I've checked out the legality of this before (it falls under 'an annotated text'). Do people think this would be a valuable addition? [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 03:52, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

== Proposed name change ==

All other books dealing with A-level subjects are styled with the first ''l'' of ''level'' being lower-case. In order to gain consistency throughout our A-level series, this book should be renamed [[A-level Mathematics]]. I trust this will be an uncontroversial change, but before asking [[User:Tsca.bot]] to help out, I thought I'd note it here to allow for any comments others may have, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:14, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
:I agree, go ahead with the change.--[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 19:03, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Uncategorised pages ==

I have added on the contents page a couple of modules that were listed as orphaned. Please either integrate these modules into this book, or alternatively mark them for deletion. Thanks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:14, 3 July 2006 (UTC)


== Broken Link ==
the Intro link appears invalid:  http://www.ocr.org.uk/Data/publications/specifications_syllabuses_and_tutors_handbooks/AS_A_Level86696.pdf

== Statistics 1 - OCR(MEI) ==

This page is currentely being edited, it is not as the query suggests, a page created in error. Could this be removed? Thanks. --[[User:Nothingtosomething|Nothingtosomething]] ([[User talk:Nothingtosomething|talk]]) 18:25, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

== A question ==

I was thinking about adding to some of the AQA AS modules (C1 and FP1). Should content be written as prose, or as a summary of course content? Does each section deserve a (sub-)page of its own, or should it all be summed together in one document?

Never done anything on Wikibooks, so any advice/thoughts would be appreciated! =D  --[[User:DTR|DTR]] ([[User talk:DTR|talk]]) 21:10, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

== Thank you ==

To whoever created this, thank you very much. It's been a big help for me whilst studying polynomials for a-level. I hope you finish the job because I'm sure others would love to use the whole thing, and I will continue to use it if other parts I now need are added.
Excellent job, big pat on the back!!</text>

      <comment>/* Learning to Count */ Fixing some grammar.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Origin of Counting ==
Perhaps, counting began when early men did something like put a stone in a bowl or a pit in the ground for each of his flock that went out to graze.  When the flock returned he would take out a stone for each returning animal. If there was a stone or stones left after the last animal returned he would know that he needed to find out what happened to that or those animals.

It is possible that he would begin to give a name for each group of stones, that is one stone, would have a name, two stones would have a name and so-forth.  It is also probable that he already had a name for numbers based on counting with fingers.  Counting on fingers might have been the beginning of dividing numbers into groups of ten.

== Learning to Count ==

Watching a three year old learn to count there a number of apparent stages.  

First they learn to repeat a series of sounds they hear
&quot;aye-bee-cee-dee...&quot; and &quot;one-two-three-four...&quot;

Second they associate the sounds &quot;one-two-three-four...&quot; with pointing at a group of objects, but don't yet make the one to one association.

Then they start to learn the one to one association between the objects and the words.

Finally they start learning the rules needed to count accurately,

# Point at each object as you say the next word.
# Point at the object only once and move to the next.
# Don't randomly select the next object, but proceed sequentially.
# Remember where you've started and what you've already counted.

=== Demonstration ===

Given a set of objects,

[[Image:Red ball.png]][[Image:Red ball.png]][[Image:Red ball.png]]
[[Image:Red ball.png]]

start at one side 

[[Image:Blue ball.png]][[Image:Red ball.png]][[Image:Red ball.png]]
[[Image:Red ball.png]]

and proceed until

...

[[Image:Blue ball.png]][[Image:Blue ball.png]] [[Image:Blue ball.png]] [[Image:Red ball.png]]

each has been counted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[w:Toki Pona|Toki Pona]]''' is a [[w:constructed language|constructed language]] designed by [[w:Canada|Canadian]] [[w:translation|translator]] and [[w:linguistics|linguist]] [[w:Sonja Elen Kisa|Sonja Elen Kisa]]. Toki Pona is a minimal language. Like a [[w:pidgin|pidgin]], it focuses on simple concepts and elements that are relatively universal among cultures. It was designed to express maximum meaning with minimum complexity. The language has 14 [[w:phoneme|phoneme]] and 118 words. It was not designed as an [[w:international auxiliary language|international auxiliary language]], but instead inspired by [[w:Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy, among other things.

The language as of 2010 has been in continuous use for about ten years, and more than 50,000 words have been written in this language by hundreds of people.  The corpus is large enough to do a field linguistics survey based on this corpus.  Please feel free to contribute to the writing of any section.  Keep in mind that this is an objective document describing toki pona usage and not a creative document of language construction.  Please briefly quote the toki pona and give due credit to all sources to support your analysis.

In sections where toki pona &quot;lacks&quot; a construction, explain what periphrasic techniques have been observed to express the same thing. Very frequently when one reads that a language lacks tense or grammar, what is being expressed is that the tense or grammar is isolating, periphrasic or lexical and not inflecting. toki pona is almost entirely isolating, so it will be tempting but incorrect to fill in all the sections with &quot;toki pona does not have comparatives, datives, etc&quot;

It is hoped that readers and contributors will both learn about field linguistics and better understand how toki pona has been used.

The solution is wrong.  The number sequence portrayed goes 3, 3-1=2,2*2+4, 4-3=1, 1*5=5, 5-6=-1,-1*6=-6...


It's nonsensical.  The number 4 is skipped, then the number 6 is repeated.

And given only the first 4 numbers of this set, there's no reason anyone would divine that pattern.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Tale of Two Cities has a number of prominent themes.  A theme is a central idea that is explored through a novel.

Rebirth is a good theme in a tale of two cities

==The unnecessary bloodshed in the revolution==
In A ''[[w:Tale of Two Cities|Tale of Two Cities]]'', [[w:Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens]] tries to convey the message that a revolution is necessary in France by using the Marquis Evrémonde as an archetype of the French aristocrats, and also by causing the reader to sympathize with the peasants.  He engages in a few exceptionally cruel acts, such as running over a child, and complaining: “‘It is extraordinary to me,…that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children.  One or the other of you is for ever in the way&quot;.

Although the revolution was so incredibly necessary due to the cruelty of the aristocrats, it is also evident that many of the revolutionaries were also equally cruel. Any rational person would certainly realize that, if anything, Darnay should be rewarded by the revolutionaries for willfully giving up the fortune that he inherited.  In addition to plotting to kill Darnay, Madame Defarge also pursues Lucie Manette, who is clearly a kind woman who poses no threat to anybody.  The only reason for pursuing her is because she is, by marriage, related to the Marquis Evrémonde.  However, these feelings against the Evrémonde's are only because of her personal issues with them, and not in the interest of the Republic.

'''Archaeology''' or archeology (American English) is the study of human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains, including architecture, artefacts, biofacts, human remains, and landscapes. The goal of archaeology is to shed light on long-term human prehistory, history, behaviour and cultural evolution. It is the only discipline which possesses the method and theory for the collection and interpretation of information about the pre-written human past, and can also make a critical contribution to our understanding of documented societies. Other subfields of anthropology supplement the findings of archaeology, especially cultural anthropology (which studies behavioural, symbolic, as well as material dimensions of culture) and physical anthropology (which includes the study of human evolution and osteology). Other disciplines also supplement archaeology, such as paleontology (the study of prehistoric life), including paleozoology, paleoethnobotany and paleobotany, geography, geology, history, art history, and classics.

Archaeology is an approach to understanding lost cultures and the mute aspects of human history, without a cut-off date: in England, archaeologists have uncovered the long-lost layouts of medieval villages abandoned after the crises of the 14th century and the equally lost layouts of 17th century parterre gardens swept away by a change in fashion. In downtown New York archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the Black burial ground.

Archaeology has been described as a craft that enlists the sciences to illuminate the humanities.

==Subdisciplines==
===Biblical Archaeology===
Focuses on the period of the bible, but embracing all of the ancient Near East and was originally concerned with validating historical events and personages from the bible.

===Classical Archaeology===
Focuses on the Classical World (Greece, Rome, and the Mediterranean).

===Historical Archaeology===
Focuses on the most recent half millennium of human existence, particularly the expansion of European powers into the rest of the world and the impacts of the industrial revolution.  Although this has become the standard meaning of historical archaeology, there are many situations where archaeology works as only one of the tools to discover the past, complementary to written or oral historical traditions.  The archaeology of Ancient Egypt, Han China and many other places is also a historical archaeology.

===Historic Site Archaeology===
In the Americas, historical archaeology, or more properly, &quot;historic site archaeology&quot; is the term generally used to encompass the archaeology of Euro-Canadian/Euro-American and aboriginal/First Nation sites dating to the period of first European settlement or later. Sites attributable to the era of European exploration from Columbus to the advent of first settlement are often deemed to be &quot;proto-Historic&quot; in age and may be further categorized as being either pre-, post-, or proto-Contact in nature (the time of &quot;Contact&quot; between European and aboriginal/First Nations peoples being locally or regionally defined).

===Near Eastern Archaeology===
Focuses on the Ancient Near East (the early civilizations that arose in the area known as the fertile crescent).

===Mesoamerican Archaeoloy===
Study of the pre-columbian societies inhabiting much of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, parts of El Salvador and Honduras. This area comprises shared cultural traits and were made up of many complex sites over thousands of years. Most famously, this area includes the ancient Maya, the Olmec, and the Aztecs. 

===New World Archaeology===
Focuses on the Americas. Very broadly defined, this includes the study of all cultures from North and South America, including the many culture areas such as Mesoamerica, Amazonia, the Andes, the American Northeast, Southeast, Northwest and Southwest. Inuit and Native Canadian Archaeology is also part of this very broad term.

===Prehistory===
Focuses on the period before written history

===Underwater and Maritime Archaeology===
The specialty field of conducting archaeological investigations in submerged and maritime environments. This can include prehistoric sites, shipwreck sites, and other nautical/ maritime related contexts.

===Zooarchaeology===
The study of animal bones recovered from archaeological sites. Zooarchaeological research involves the identification and interpretation of animal bones recovered from archaeological contexts in the effort to gain information on the diets and patterns of animal exploitation of the people whose activities resulted in the formation of the site(s) under study.

Zooarchaeology involves much more than just the creation of so-called 'laundry lists' of animal species represented among the food remains recovered from an archaeological site (usually listed by taxa in order of abundance), although that was typically the limit of the extent to which the zooarchaeological data was cited in many archaeological reports until relatively recently. While such lists can be extremely useful to both archaeologists and zoologists, in more recent times zooarchaeological data has been used in the reconstruction of diet, seasonal scheduling of hunting/fishing activities, hunting and fishing methods, methods of butchery and food preparation, the use of animal bones and related materials for the production of tools and other artefacts (see: [[w:osteodontokeratic industry]]), the process of animal domestication and use, and much more.

==Dating Techniques==
===Dendrochronology===
As trees grow they create annual growth rings, which can be counted to determine the age of the tree when it was cut. The thickness of these rings is determined by annual climactic factors, and certain distinctive ring patterns found in several pieces of timber can be used to verify their contemporaneity.

===Obsidian Hydration===
Obsidian is a volcanic glass used by many cultures in tools and weapons. When a fresh surface is exposed (during the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flintknapping flintknapping] process, for example), it attracts water from the surrounding atmosphere. This water diffuses into the obsidian and creates a hydration rind on the exposed surface. This rind can be viewed using a microscope, and its thickness can be used to determine how long ago the surface of the tool or weapon was produced by flintknapping.

#Sydney Carton
#:At the beginning of the novel, Sydney Carton was a drunkard who did not have any real goals in life.  While his physical resemblance to Charles Darnay is astounding, he is, at the beginning at least, his opposite.  However, Carton's genuine love for Lucie Manette cause him to selflessly give up his own life to help Lucie, thereby rising him to a moral status that is higher than his physical counterpart.
#Charles Darnay
#:Charles Darnay is a member of the Evremonde family.  He renounces his future title of the Marquis, and tries to convince his family to stop being so cruel to the people of the country.  We first see Darnay after he has moved to England and is being tried for treason.  He later becomes a Tutor and marries Lucie Mannette. He is often considered the main protagonist.
#Lucie Manette Darnay- daughter of Doctor Manette. 
#Madame Therese Defarge

      <text xml:space="preserve">Environment sensors are sensors that detect and interpret things in the outside world (such as obstacles, sounds, and signs) or about the outside world (such as temperature, pressure, and viscosity).

Some of the more common kinds of environment sensors are discussed here.

== Object Sensors ==
There are several sensors that are designed to determine the location and size of various objects in the world.
* [[../Sensors/Computer Vision|Digital cameras]] can, with enough processing power, locate specific objects in their field of view.
* [[../Sensors/Tactile Sensors|Tactile sensors]] can detect how much force is being applied to a specific point.
* [[../Sensors/Distance Sensors|Distance sensors]] use various methods to determine the distance to the nearest object in a given direction.

== Media Sensors ==
Some sensors detect properties of the immediate environment, such as:
* [[../Sensors/Thermal Sensors|Temperature]]
* [[../Sensors/Pressure Sensors|Pressure &amp; Sound]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">A [[../Digital_image_Acquisition|digitally acquired image]] comes in the form of a matrix of vectors.
Each of these vectors is called a '''pixel''' and represents a specific color.
If the matrix is displayed with each cell filled in with the corresponding color, it creates a picture of the scene from the point of view of the camera.

==Camera Calibration==
Cameras are devices which are used to convert 2-d or 3-d reality into 2-d representations. While post processing can re-create 3-d representations from the initial 2-d images, the camera output is a projection of reality on a 2-d plane. Because light is used as the projection mechanism, anything that alters the path or character of the light rays from the object to the sensor plane will affect the fidelity of that initial 2-d representation on the sensor plane.

Cameras are not perfect devices. Because they are built with real-world components having real-world characteristics, their ability to represent reality is limited by the physical properties of their constituent parts. Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of distortions that can occur:

* Geometric - Spatial shifting of object representations on the sensor plane due to the design and characteristics of the optical system
* Radiometric – Errors in the reported “brightness values” recorded on each pixel due to variations in pixel sensitivity, occurrence of “hot” or dead pixels, and varying pixel full well capacity.
* Spectral – Errors in the reported “brightness values” due to the varying response of the sensor to different wavelengths of light.

The focus of this chapter is on Geometric Distortion – its causes and remedies.

==Exterior Orientation==
Exterior Orientation is defined as the position (x,y,z) and angle (tip, tilt, yaw) of the camera relative to the object scene. Even with a perfect camera, distortions due to the exterior orientation will be introduced. These can easily be removed by knowing these six elements of exterior orientation and employing techniques of solid analytical geometry. Solving for unknown exterior orientation elements is covered under the topic of photogrammetry and is generally considered part of the calibration of the entire camera system (which includes its object scene environment). Camera calibration, per se, usually refers to correcting for a camera's interior orientation. 

==Interior Orientation==
Interior Orientation is defined as the relative orientation and characteristics of components within the camera proper. These include:

* Calibrated focal length – the distance between the rear nodal point of the lens and the image plane when an object at infinite distance is brought to precise focus on the image plane.
* Optical properties of the lens system – the ability of the lens to alter normal “pin hole” geometry by clever optical designs. For example, telecentric lenses behave like telephoto lenses in their ability to “compress depth” and eliminate scale errors due to perspective, yet are designed for near-range applications.
* Principle point – where the optical axis intersects the sensor plane (not always in the center).
* Angle of the optical axis to the sensor plane. Normally, the optical axis is perpendicular to the sensor plane. If it is not, the resulting image will have a characteristic distortion. There are times, however, when this angle is deliberately altered to achieve some other objective. For example, some cameras are capable of employing the “Scheimpflug condition” - whereby the image plane, object plane, and lens plane all intersect upon a common line. Assuming the lens law is observed, this configuration ensures that all points on the object plane will be in focus, even though it is not perpendicular to the optical axis. Although this configuration preserves focus, it introduces additional geometric distortions.
* Flatness of the sensor plane – more of an issue with analog film than modern digital sensors.
* Lens Distortion – properties of a lens that alter the ideal “pin hole” model. Lens distortion and lens / sensor plane orientation are typically the largest contributors to geometric distortion within interior orientation.

==Lens Distortion==
Lens distortion causes image points to be displaced from their ideal “pin hole model” locations on the sensor plane. These displacements can be further described as:

* Radial – displacements either towards or away from the center of the image. Technically, displacements are radial to the principle point location. Radial displacements can be modeled with a polynomial, where the first few terms describe most of the effect. 
* Tangential – displacements occur at right angles to the radial direction. Typically, tangential displacements are much smaller than radial displacements.
* Asymmetric Radial or Tangential – the error functions vary (different radial functions for different radials, different tangential functions for different locations on the image plane)
* Random – displacements that cannot be modeled by any mathematical process.

===Ideal Pin-hole Model===
The pin hole model is used to represent the ideal lens. It simply enforces the idea that rays of light travel in straight lines from the object, though the pin hole, to the image (sensor) plane.

Expensive lenses approximate this pin-hole model behavior. 

[[Image:Pinhole_geometry_1.gif]]

==Goals of Camera Calibration==
The goal of camera calibration is to correct the image displacements which occur due to elements of the camera's interior orientation. There are two general approaches used for camera calibration:

* Model-based approaches – specific elements of the error are modeled and corrected for.
* Mapping-based approaches – the focus is on generating a comprehensive reality-to-image (or image-to-reality) mapping function, without regard to understanding the underlying contributing causes.

===Model-based Approaches===
With a Model-based approach, one attempts to identify a few predominant factors contributing to error, model them, measure them, and correct for them. For each contributing factor, a mathematical equation is proposed to model the error. For example, radial lens distortion can be modeled with a four-term polynomial of the form: 

delta r = (k1 * r) + (k2*r^3) + (k3*r^5)+ (k4*r^7)+ (k5*r^9) + .............

Usually, the first two or three terms are sufficient to completely describe the radial error. Note that this is a model of the error, not the actual error. Models can approximate the error, but never fully correct for error effects.

After determining the appropriate model (assume we pick the first three terms above to model radial lens distortion), the next step is to determine the values of the coefficients which best model the observed error. This can be accomplished in one of two ways:

* Explicit Approach – Use of targets with known (x,y), (x,y,z), or angular positions. Precision calibration frames, field approaches, stellar observations, or collimator banks can be used to generate targets of known position. 
** Pros: Precise
** Cons: Expensive and time consuming
* Implicit Approach – Use of objects with known geometric properties, but no known positional or angular orientation. Examples include the checkerboard approach, where the property that all the control points lie in a plane is exploited. Similarly, the Plumb-line approach exploits the fact that a series of physical plumb lines hung from a straight bar not only define a plane, but also produce a series of straight parallel lines which could be imaged. If the lines in the resulting image are not straight, the error can be attributed to lens distortion.
** Pros:
*** Relatively simple, fast, cheap
*** Simple models can usually account for most of the error
** Cons:
*** Not as precise as explicit approach, but usually good enough

====Summary of Model-based Approaches====
;Pros
* Relatively simple, fast, cheap
* Only a few factors influence geometry – mostly optical configuration and lens distortion
* Simple models account for most of the error
;Cons
* Can only remove errors represented by terms in the model
* Unknown causes of error are ignored, or simply result in higher residuals

===Mapping-based Approaches===
With a mapping-based approach, no attempt is made to understand the individual contributing causes of error. The entire focus is on generating a comprehensive reality-to-image (or image-to-reality) mapping function. Simple rubber-sheeting would be an example of such a transformation.

For example, imagine setting up a high precision x-y plotter in front of a camera, oriented so it is perpendicular to the camera's optical axis. Next, a pin-hole light source is mounted on the plotter pen holder in such a way as it can be moved to any location in its plotter-based x-y plane. Further, imagine that for every possible position of the light source, we can capture the row and column of the single pixel illuminated.

For a VGA format image (640 columns by 480 rows), there are 307,200 pixels. If we were to drive the plotter to each of 307,200 positions, and record what real world (x,y) coordinate mapped to each and every pixel, we would have achieved the building of an explicit mapping function. 

With this approach, all potential causes of errors come out in the wash – whether they're known or not. All that matters is having the explicit image to reality mapping preserved.

In reality, nobody bothers to separately illuminate 307,200 pixels. However, the process can be approximated by collecting similar measurements on several hundred patches (16 * 16 pixels in size, for example) and employing a piece-wise transformation for each patch. This process could be further automated by driving the plotter to the hundreds of control point locations.

====Summary of Mapping-based Approaches====
;Pros
* Can handle any and all distortions – even those unanticipated. 
* Very precise – sub-pixel accuracy
* Only needs to be done once - if nothing moves in the mean time
* Lends itself to automated approaches
;Cons
* Lots of explicit control required. Control point generator must be a “trusted source” - plotter errors would be passed on.
* Expensive and time consuming

==Summary of Camera Calibration==
By employing either a model-based or mapping-based approach to camera calibration, most of the image displacement errors caused by elements of interior camera orientation can be removed prior to further processing.

==Image Segmentation==
The purpose of image segmentation is to split a source image into multiple destination images or Regions of Interest based on certain criteria. For example, it may be beneficial to find a single part out of a bin. For navigation systems, it may prove useful to extract only floor lines from an image.

===Algorithm: Region Growing===
Start by finding a single set pixel. Search all the pixels around it. For every set pixel around one that is set, search all the pixels around it, and so on. This algorithm is not very efficient in terms of computational power, but it does extract regions with no post-processing required.

===Algorithm: Edge Detection===
Begin by searching for disparities in the image. Once a disparity surpasses a certain minimum size and threshold in luminosity or other characteristic, it is an edge. After all the edges have been found, look for regions bounded by edges. The example image has very well-defined edges, making it simple to process. However, many real world images have smoother gradients, making their edges harder to detect. Edge detection is also vulnerable to many types of noise, which will disrupt the edge detection.

===Algorithm: MultiScaling===
MultiScaling is a useful technique whenever multiple scales of an image can be obtained. Many camera image processors can emit a thumbnail along with the main image. This low-resolution thumbnail can be used as a plan for searching the main image. Specifically, any areas in the low-resolution image lacking in pixels likely represent empty or very sparse areas in the full image. If we are willing to sacrifice detection of small blobs for speed, MultiScaling is an efficient approach.

===Algorithm: Sequential Searches===
The goal of a sequential search is to examine each and every pixel once and only once. When new pixels are found, they are compared against previously found groups of pixels, and inserted into that group. If a pixel is found to be in two groups, the groups must be combined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The way in which actuators perform is determined by the combination of several factors.
The robot's control system sends the actuator some sort of control signal, and various factors of the environment affect what happens for any given control signal.
Feedback sensors are used to detect the actuator's output so that the control system can correct for external factors.

For example, many robots are propelled forward by wheels connected to DC motors.
The control system specifies the amount of power that should be applied to the motors to make them turn, but their speed is also affected by the amount of load on the motor.
In order for the robot to travel at a constant speed, it is necessary to have a sensor that determines how fast the robot is moving, and adjusts the power level to the motors as needed.

There are several standard kinds of feedback sensor that are used:
* [[/Encoders/]]
* [[/Tachometers/]]
* [[/Accelerometers/]]
* [[/Rate Gyroscopes/]]

== Apple icon ==

I've seen that icon before. I know it's from iMovie or FCP or one of those. It looks awfully familiar; it's from an Apple product. It's altered, but I don't think that makes it legal. [[User:65.35.3.81|65.35.3.81]] 23:13, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: Hi 65.35.3.81 (!), thanks loads for your comments. This issue was discussed briefly in the Google Groups list a while back... please do get involved in the discussion at the link above. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 10:15 21 Feb 2005 (GMT)

== PC vs. Windows ==

The &quot;Movie Making Manual-PC in film production&quot; section should really read &quot;Movie Making Manual-Windows in film production&quot;. A PC is a ''Personal Computer''. Windows is just one OS that can run on the x86 arch.

: Yeah, good idea. I'll move it... [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 11:18 16 April 2005 (GMT)

== WTF ==

I don't mean to be so negative, but I just read through the whole screenwriting section and it made me sick. It's ''HORRIBLE''. The entire section focuses on futile tips and pointers to get a script accepted by a Hollywood studio and the screenwriter as merely one small cog in the machinery of one of them. The &quot;writing for low budget&quot; part made me laugh. It mentions writing extra scenes to have a &quot;clean&quot; version for when it goes to TV, and how to keep the rating down in order to sell more. In my opinion, this section should focus on ways to make a '''script''' believeable, with more focus on writing for low-budget, DIY projects. Ninety percent of the info here is completely worthless to anyone who isn't practically established in Hollywood.

: Thanks for your comments. I would make two suggestions. Firstly, come and discuss your opinions in the [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/moviemakingmanual MMM Google Group] - we could do with a bit of controversy to spice things up! Secondly, if you don't like the content then edit it! [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 8:55 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

:: As the person who wrote that section (for the most part) I'll say that it comes from my experience in the industry, dealing with a particular genre and distribution of film, namely action-adventure for the international market. Many other types of scripts exist for many other different demographic groups. I have written and read scripts from these other genres, however I do not feel qualified to run on about it as I have not yet produced these films. I think the section on screenwriting can benefit from your input as to how to makie a film believable, the two subjects do not have to remain mutually exclusive. The section needs more information... please write it. [[User:cauri|cauri]] 10:53 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

== module naming ==

Hi, I believe you should consider refactoring the MMM to use either:
* A false namespace, like the cookbook. E.g. &quot;Movie making manual:Screenplay format&quot;
* Subpages. E.g. &quot;Movie making manual/Screenplay format&quot;
See [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] for more information about this. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:08, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

: Hi Kellen. Many thanks for your comments. To be honest, we gave quite a lot of thought to the module names (you can read our discussion on the topic [http://groups.google.com/group/moviemakingmanual/browse_thread/thread/0baa2e0067b0c9bd/c68765557a29a31c#c68765557a29a31c here]). Kellen, do you feel our existing naming convention is so bad that it MUST be changed? To be honest, it'll be a fair amount of work to change every module and I'm not eager to go through that hassle unless it's absolutely necessary. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 8:58 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

:: No, I don't think it ''must'' be changed, but it does look a bit odd in relation to the other books on here; I found myself having to look twice to find what the actual section name was in the title. The NP hasn't been accepted (yet) by WB as a whole, so there's no mandate in any case, but it might be easier now rather than later. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:28, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

::: OK, thanks for letting us know. I've alerted the [http://groups.google.com/group/moviemakingmanual/browse_thread/thread/662f6267f555ca09/4d3a10aa3bf3909f#4d3a10aa3bf3909f MMM Google Group to this issue]. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 10:27 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

:::: On the topic of naming conventions, are there any naming conventions for categories? We're using quite a few categories for the movie making manual. See [[:category:Movie Making Manual|this root MMM category]] to see our category naming in action. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 11:15 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

::::: I don't think there are any conventions for categories. There's not really a lot of categorization going on here right now, so I don't think it's been seen as a real issue. The Cookbook has a lot of categories, but we have somewhat inconsistent names for them (fixing that is on my list of TODO's). I am sort of inclined to have a prefix on all the categories related to a particular book, e.g. &quot;Category:Cookbook:Vegan recipes&quot; or &quot;Category:Movie making:Cinematography&quot; because at some point I can see there being difficult overlaps when we have enough books. Who gets to own Category:Tools? or does that category just get polluted with modules from different books? Seems like the &quot;top level&quot; categories (ones w/o a prefix) should be for categorizing books as a whole, then scoped categories (w/ prefix) should be used w/in books.... but that's just me musing about it. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:25, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

:::::: Humf... OK, maybe I should think about prefixing all our categories. I've asked about categories in the [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Naming_convention_for_categories.3F|staff lounge]]. Kellen, you might like to cut-and-paste your response to the staff lounge. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 18:37 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Where should we host our Movie Making Manual?

=Reasons for keeping it on WikiBooks=
* It's free
* It's neutral teritory
* It helps keep knowledge in one place
* We're likely to get more hits
* It'll be a real pain to move the book elsewhere
* People are already starting to learn about the book and might be put off if we move it now

=Reasons for taking it elsewhere=
* WikiBooks is SLOW (although they have ordered 5 new servers which may speed things up)
* We can't get access to the MySQL database (not a major problem)
* There's no easy way to backup all our work (although I imagine that wikibooks do run regular backups)

'''Melanzane Parmigiana''' was originally a Sicilian dish called ''Parmiciana di melenzane'', ''parmiciana'' being the slats of a wooden shutter which resemble the layering of the slices of eggplant in the dish. In the form in which it is now known worldwide, it is generally an oven baked dish consisting of aubergine, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella and tomato sauce.

==Ingredients==

* 3 or 4 big [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplants]] (aubergines)
* [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]
* about 200 or 300 [[Cookbook:gram|grams]] of [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]], sliced
* grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] or breadcrumbs
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

;Optional:
* fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs| eggs]]

==Procedure==

#Wash eggplants and cut them in slices about 1-1.5 [[Cookbook:Centimetre (cm)|cm]] thick.  
#Salt each slice on both sides and put them on a big plate.
#Cover them with another plate, pressing a bit.
#Let them rest for 60/ 90 minutes or more, time permitting (up to 2 hours).
#Then wash the slices under running water and let them dry a while.
#Alternatively, place salted eggplant slices in a large strainer and place a weight (e.g., a smaller pot of water) on top to help squeeze out the water.
#Dust the slices with flour (and/or bread crumbs) after in the eggs and fry them. (Or, bake them in an oven at 180°C/350°F for ten minutes with a very  small amount of olive oil on each slice to make them somewhat lighter than if fried.) Do not overcook, as they will spend some time in the oven later.
#Take a pan for the oven and make a layer with eggplants slices, then one with the tomato sauce, then one with some slices of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Some cooks add fresh basil leaves.
#Make as many layers as you wish, but 3 or 4 should be enough. Be sure the last one to be completely full of Parmesan cheese, that will make a nice crust when cooked.
#Now everything is finished, put the pan in the oven at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|180°C (350°F)]] for about 20-30 minutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Variables allow you to store and change information.  Below is an example how to use variables.

== Example Code for Variables ==
'''Example 1 (qBasic)'''
&lt;SOURCE lang=&quot;qbasic&quot;&gt;CLS
ASTRING$ = &quot;Hello World&quot;
ANUMBER% = 10
PRINT ASTRING$
PRINT ANUMBER%&lt;/SOURCE&gt;

'''Example 2 (freeBasic)'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;freeBasic&quot;&gt;
Cls
Dim aString As String
Dim anInteger As Integer
aString = &quot;John Doe&quot;
anInteger = 42
Print aString
Print anInteger
Sleep
End
&lt;/source&gt;

==Output==
'''Example 1'''
 Hello World
 10

In Basic, a string variable ends in a $, and whole number variables, known as integers, end with a %.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example 2'''
 John Doe
 42

If you use ''Dim varName As DataType'' to declare variables, you do not need to use a suffix.&lt;br /&gt;

== Arrays ==
An array is a collection of values.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;freeBasic&quot;&gt;
Cls
Dim aNames(3) as String
aNames(1)=&quot;John Doe&quot;
aNames(2)=&quot;Jane Doe&quot;
PRINT aNames(1)
PRINT aNames(2)&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Repairing Permissions===

The file system in Mac OS X is based on a derivative of UNIX called Darwin.  All UNIX based systems use what is known as &quot;permissions&quot; to manage all the files stored on your drive, from files vital to the operation of the system itself to the photo of your pet rock.

Occasionally, the permissions of some files may become incorrect, and if this happens to system files, you can get problems including a slow down of the system to unexpected crashes or freezing.

Many times, you can &quot;repair permissions&quot; and the problems will stop occurring.

Open Disk Utility (found in /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility) and select your hard drive from the list.  The very first screen you see should have a button marked &quot;Repair Permissions&quot;.  Clicking this will start an automated process that will check the existing permissions on each file, and compare it to what it should be, then try to change the permissions on that file if it is incorrect.  As the application does this, you may notice a lot of text scrolling in the window.  This is the application doing its work.  Once the process has finished, you should get a message stating if the repair was successful or not.  If successful, quit the application and see if the problems you have been experiencing still exist.

===Throwing the .plist===
Applications in OS X use something called plist to save the preferences. For example, when you start an application for the first time, it might ask you if it should look for updates when started and where you want your files to be saved. When you start the application next time, it will remember what you decided the first time. That information is saved in a plist file. Sometimes these files become corrupted, and that can lead to very odd problems like applications not starting and files not being saved correctly. Throwing the applications plist might fix this problem. (Throwing a plist file will not damage the application, but it will delete all your preferences and the application will act as if it's your first time using it the next time you start the application.)

The easiest way to throw a plist file is to search for the application in spotlight using the applications name and put .plist afterwards. For example, the plist for Mail is com.apple.mail.plist and the plist for iPhoto is com.apple.iPhoto.plist. From the spotlight menu, click &quot;Show All&quot; and right-click the plist file. Pick &quot;Reveal in Finder&quot; and a finder window should come up with the plist selected. Drag to the Desktop (and make sure that the plist is no longer in the folder you took it from). Start the application and see if it works better. If it doesn't, you can put the plist you put on the desktop back, that way you didn't lose your preferences for nothing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you use Font Book:

* First close all applications.
* Search for installed copies of the font with the Finder's Search and remove them from all system font files.
* Open the font with FontLab 4.5 or higher (or your own favorite font manipulation application). BTW: This doesn't work with all kinds of file formats.
* Choose from the File menu; Generate Font.
* From the popupwindow Font Format button, change 'FontLab' to 'OpenType-CFF' and save the file.
* By The Way: Do yourself a favour and choose a descriptive name, like TemplateGothicBold instead of temgotbol or something like that and avoid spaces. OS X doesn't have a problem with spaces, but a lot of others systems, like on the internet do. 
* Double-click the new .otf file and install it by clicking the button in the popup window.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[Mac OS X]]

Problem: When I type a certain character, the lead of that line - and that line height only - increases.&lt;br&gt;
Solution: This is caused by a lack of the typed charater in the font you are using. &lt;br&gt;

In this example, as soon as we type a eurosign, the line height increases, only in that line. The cause of this is the lack of a eurosign in the font we are using, the Templete Gothic. Flash MX 2004 tries to help out by putting in a eurosign from another font and this causes the difference in line height. Avoid this character, use a different font or recompile your font with eurosign in it.

==Some Important Constructions== 

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===[[w:Closure_(topology)|Closure]]===
*  A point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''point of closure''' of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if for every neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U \cap A \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
* Define the '''closure''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be the intersection of all closed sets containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; (some authors use &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}&lt;/math&gt;). The closure has the nice property of being the smallest closed set containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Each neighborhood (nbd) of every point in the closure intersects &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

===[[w:Interior_(topology)|Interior]]===
* We say that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an '''internal point'''  of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; [[w:iff|iff]] There is an open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; U \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;
* Define the '''interior''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be the union of all open sets contained inside &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt; (some authors use &lt;math&gt;A^\circ&lt;/math&gt;). The interior has the nice property of being the largest open set contained inside &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Every point in the interior has a nbd contained inside &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

''Note that'' a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is Open [[w:iff|iff]] &lt;math&gt;A = Int(A)&lt;/math&gt;

===[[w:Exterior_(topology)|Exterior]]===

* Define the '''exterior''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be the union of all open sets contained inside the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int} (X \setminus A)&lt;/math&gt;. It is the largest open set inside &lt;math&gt;X \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;. Every point in the exterior has a nbd contained inside &lt;math&gt;X \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;.

===[[w:Boundary_(topology)|Boundary]]===

* Define the '''boundary''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)\setminus\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Bd}(A)&lt;/math&gt; (some authors prefer &lt;math&gt;\partial A&lt;/math&gt;). The boundary is also called the '''frontier'''. It is always closed since it is the intersection of the closed set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and the closed set &lt;math&gt;X\setminus\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. It can be proved that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed if it contains all its boundary, and is open if it contains none of its boundary. Every nbd of every point in the boundary intersects both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;. All boundary points of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are obviously points of contact of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

===[[w:Limit_point|Limit Points]]===

* A point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''limit point''' of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if for every neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(U\setminus\{x\}) \cap A \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. All limit points of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are obviously points of closure of the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

===Isolated Points===

* If a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math&gt;x\in S\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that &lt;math&gt;N\cap S = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, then x is called an '''isolated point.'''

===[[w:Density_(topology)|Density]]===
Definition: A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called dense if any point 
&lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, or if the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a limit point of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Definition: In a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is dense if &lt;math&gt;Cl(A)=X&lt;/math&gt;.
:Example: The set of rational numbers is dense in the set of real numbers.

Definition: In a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a set &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is nowhere dense if &lt;math&gt;Cl(A)&lt;/math&gt; has no nonempty open sets.
:Example: The set of natural numbers is nowhere dense in the set of real numbers.

Definition: Suppose ''X'' is a topological space. Then for &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, ''A'' is dense in ''X'' if &lt;math&gt;\bar{A} = X&lt;/math&gt;.

Definition: Suppose ''X'' is a topological space. Then for &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, ''A'' is nowhere dense in ''X'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;int (\bar{A}) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

Definition: A ''G&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;'' set is a subset of a topological space that is a countable intersection of open sets.

Definition: An ''F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;'' set is a countable union of closed sets.

&lt;b&gt;Theorem&lt;/b&gt;

(''Hausdorff Criterion'') Suppose ''X'' has 2 topologies, ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. For each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, let B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; be a neighbourhood base for ''x'' in topology ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; be a neighbourhood base for ''x'' in topology ''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then, &lt;math&gt;r_1\subseteq r_2&lt;/math&gt; if and only if at each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; (B^1 \in B^1_x)(\exists (B^2 \in B^2_x)( B^2 \subseteq B^1).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Theorem&lt;/b&gt;

In any topological space, the boundary of an open set is closed and nowhere dense.

''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; Let ''A'' be an open set in a topological space ''X''. Since ''A'' is open, int(''A'') = ''A''. Thus, σ''A'' ( or the boundary of ''A'') = &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}/   int (A) &lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt; \bar A/A =  \bar A \cap A^c &lt;/math&gt;. The complement of an open set is closed, and the closure of any set is closed. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\bar A \cap A^c &lt;/math&gt; is an intersection of closed sets and is itself closed. A subset of a topological space is nowhere dense if and only if the interior of its closure is empty. So, proceeding in consideration of the boundary of ''A''.

::::::::::The interior of the closure of the boundary of ''A'' is equal to the interior of the boundary of ''A''.
::::::::::Thus, it is equal to &lt;math&gt;int (\bar{A} \cap A^c)&lt;/math&gt;. 
::::::::::Which is also equal to &lt;math&gt;int (\bar{A}) \cap int (A^c)&lt;/math&gt;.
And, &lt;math&gt;int (A^c) = \bar{[(A^c)^c]}^c&lt;/math&gt;.
So, the interior of the closure of the boundary of ''A'' = &lt;math&gt;int (\bar{A}) \cap int \bar{(A^c)}&lt;/math&gt;., and as such, the boundary of ''A'' is nowhere dense.

==Types of Spaces==

We can also categorize spaces based on what kinds of points they have.

===[[w:Perfect space|Perfect Spaces]]===

*If a space contains no isolated points, then the space is a '''perfect space.'''

== Some Basic Results ==

*For every set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq \mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;. If a closed set &lt;math&gt;\alpha\supseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x\in\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)=\displaystyle\bigcap_{\alpha\subset X} \alpha&lt;/math&gt; for closed &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; we have &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt; being arbitrary, &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq \mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; be open. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x\in A\forall x\in U&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)=\displaystyle\bigcup_{U\subseteq A}U&lt;/math&gt; for open &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;; we have &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathrm{Int}(A)\forall x\in U&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; being arbitrary, we have &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{int}(A)\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;


*A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is open if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)=A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; ''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is open and &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. But we know that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)=A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\Longleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br /&gt; As &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a union of open sets, it is open (from definition of open set). Hence &lt;math&gt;A=\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is also open.


*A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)=A.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; Observe that the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;X\setminus \mathrm{Cl}(A)=\mathrm{Int}(X\setminus A)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the required result is equivalent to the statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;X\setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is open if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(X\setminus A)=X\setminus A&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed implies that &lt;math&gt;X\setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is open, and hence we can use the previous property.  


*The closure &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed&lt;br /&gt; ''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be a closed set such that &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Now, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)= \displaystyle\bigcap_{\alpha\subset X}\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for closed &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. We know that the intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed, and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is closed.

==Exercises==
#Prove the following identities for subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A\cup B)=\mathrm{Cl}(A)\cup\mathrm{Cl}(B)&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A\cap B)\subseteq\mathrm{Cl}(A)\cap\mathrm{Cl}(B)&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)\cup\mathrm{Int}(B)\subseteq\mathrm{Int}(A\cup B)&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A\cap B)=\mathrm{Int}(A)\cap\mathrm{Int}(B)&lt;/math&gt;
#Show that the following identities need not hold (i.e. give an exaple of a topological space and sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; for which they fail):
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A\cap B)=\mathrm{Cl}(A)\cap\mathrm{Cl}(B)&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)\cup\mathrm{Int}(B)=\mathrm{Int}(A\cup B)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Manpurse''' is known for confusing languages with soup ingredients, causing her to overseason conversation with far too many foreign loan words. Not only that, but, like the far better bird-in-the-bush, she totally abuses mixed metaphors and puns.

In all seriousness, she's working towards her English major and hopes to one day write and illustrate for a living.

She likes to cosplay and watch fan documentaries. Subcultural studies are her passion. She participated in NaNo 2004--and won!--and Geocaches on sunny days. She enjoys electronic music and video games--especially when the two are mixed. ''Gitaroo Man'' is teh GREATEST GAME EVAAR!!11 She also grooves to the smooth stylin's of ''Eccentric Opera''. 

(And she has a teeny, &lt;small&gt;itty-bitty&lt;/small&gt; anime and manga addiction, which she tries to confine to her room. The other day, the VHS fansubs escaped to the living room; now she's afraid her many tankouban are going to run amok in emulation.)

That's about it. For now.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to keep the juice and flavor ==

A food processor will beat too much heat into the meat (via friction), breaking down the fat which gives the juicy flavor. So, don't a food processor, use your hands.

In fact, your hands will add heat too, so to avoid destroying the flavor, use your hands as little as possible.

Mix all the other ingredients first, while you leave the ground beef in the fridge.

As the last step, bring out the meat. Mix it in. Pat out the burger shapes. Never, ever, squeeze.

While frying, refrain from touching, poking, lifting, and cutting the burger. The more you touch it, the more juice you will lose. Just turn it at half-time.

And, of course, season the meat before forming patties, not after. You don't want lumps of spices, and tasteless bits in between.

(I don't want to blatantly add to the recipe published, and I put this here in the discussion section, for peer review. When you guys have beaten my ideas into shape, move this section to the main page. / J Omark)

== My version of the recipe ==

I can't stress the importance of keeping the juice enough. I wrote the above section too.

That fat is essential for a juicy burger. You need ground beef with at least 20% fat. Look for the words &quot;ground chuck&quot;.

I try to touch my burgers as little as possible. I place chunks on a baking sheet with a wax paper, and pat them down a bit if they look like cubes, and add spices on the lumps, instead of in them.

Using my hands, I gently toss each lump from hand to hand to make them round. I then use a spatula, or something flat, to pat my burgers flat on the wax paper.

I put the stove on high, cook two minutes on one side, turn once, and cook two more minutes.

With the spatula, I move the burgers back on the baking plate, and roast them at 230°C/450°F on the roasting rack in the oven. The last two minuets, I lay a slice of cheddar scheese on top of each burger.

Medium-rare: 8-9 minutes. Medium: 10-11 minutes. Well-done: 12-13 minutes.

Some people would not call my 12-13 minute burgers well-done. Do 14-15 minutes for them, but tell them they are really missing out.

(Should this be considered a separate recipe? If people are interested, I could expand it with my ingredients and such. / J Omark)

== Add a section on pork ==

The article needs pork too. I can't stand beef burgers, and mix half pork and half beef.

== The concept of hamburgers is from Hamburg ==

Needs reason why Hamburgers are called such, considering they are not made from ham.

I think the etymology of the word belongs over at Wikipedia, which has an excellent section on hamburger history. As for where they came from, Wikipedia is my bet there too. / J Omark

== Grilled Meatloaf ==

This recipe is more a grilled meatloaf than a burger recipe. Only meatloafs and meatballs use eggs. Also remember, most professional chefs, including Bobby Flay, season the outside after the patties have been formed. This helps make a nice crust. [[User:Iwatchaltonbrown|''Iwatchaltonbrown'']]


== This recipe disappoints me ==

You know, when I found this recipe, I was disappointed. First of all, I never add eggs and/or breadcrumbs. When I want a burger, I don't want a meatloaf! My criteria for a burger that will amaze people is: 1. Turn often. I know everyone likes those grill marks, but if it's covered by a bun, you're not gonna see it. If you don't turn it often, unless you're doing it in a frying pan, oven, or a broiler, it could stick and burn.

2. Sprinkle the seasonings once the burgers are formed, and keep it simple. The burgers I don't like are the ones way overseasoned and don't let the beef flavor shine through. A lot of people think it's best to put the seasonings in the patties themselves, but it's really best to sprinkle the seasonings on the outside of the patties. This helps form that nice crust everyone knows and loves.

3. Mushy bread. Anyone who's ever put a hot juicy burger on a hot toasty bun knows that the meat juices turn the bread into mush before you eat it. I get around this by applying a layer of fat, such as butter, oil, mayonnaise, or cream cheese. Since they're mostly fat, they repel the water-based juices from turning bread into paste.

4. No salads. Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and bacon are all nice in a big salad bowl coated with vinegar and oil, but not on a burger. Like I said about seasoning, keep it simple. Let the beef shine through.

That's my criteria for great burgers. My burgers are always gone before I can eat one at the neighborhood barbecues. ''Alton Brown is awesome''</text>

* Expand the argument of &lt;math&gt;sin&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2\pi n!e=2\pi n!+\frac{2\pi n!}{2}+\frac{2\pi n!}{3!}+\frac{2\pi n!}{4!}+...&lt;/math&gt;

Since [[w:sine|sine]] is a [[w:periodic function|periodic function]], adding or subtracting multiples of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; can not change the result, thus the first few terms on the right hand side can be dropped (those first few where &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{z!}&lt;/math&gt; is a whole number thus n is greater or equal to z), and one is left with

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\sin(2\pi n!e)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\sin(\frac{2\pi}{n+1}+\frac{2\pi}{(n+1)(n+2)}+...).&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)\approx x+...&lt;/math&gt; for small &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Taylor expansion|Taylor expansion]] of [[w:sine|sine]]), the limit is 

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\sin(\frac{2\pi}{n+1})=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\frac{2\pi}{n+1}=2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

A train goes around a circle, the first time with an average velocity of 100 km/h.  How fast should the train be when going around the circle again a second time, so that the average velocity over the two loops is 200 km/h?

==Hint==
* The obvious answer 300 km/h is wrong.
* Assume that the circle is 100 km long. How long does the train need for the distance (at 100 km/h)? How long is twice the distance, and how much time is left for the second loop?

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Physics]] | [[Puzzles/Physics puzzles|Physics puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Physics puzzles/Train on Circle|Train on Circle]] | Solution

The train would need to be infinitely fast.

The train is required to double its average velocity, so it was travel twice as far in the same amount of time. The first loop has already been travelled in a set time, and makes up half the distance, so the other half of the distance must to be completed in no time (so the train has travelled double the distance in the same amount of time). The train must travel infinitly fast to achieve this.

[[Category:Puzzles]]


*&lt;b&gt;Comments&lt;/b&gt;
Since this is a &quot;physics&quot; puzzle....velocity is vector.  A train going in a circle at ANY speed would have an average velocity of zero.

*The solution seems wrong to me.

Let t1 be the time taken for the first round and t2 for the second round. Let s1, s2 be the average speed and r the radius. Then

100 = 2*Pi*r/t1 =&gt; t1 = 2*Pi*r/100

200 = 4*Pi**r/(t1 + t2)

t2 = 1/100

s2 = 2*Pi*r/t2 =&gt; s2 = 200*pi*r

*Two additional comments
Yes, the average velocity (a vector) would be zero. The average speed (a scalar) would have to be infinite tho.

The calculations made in the Comment section above are wrong. If 100 = 2*Pi*r/t1, then 200 = 4*Pi*r/(t1 + t2) only if t2 is zero. Hence, t2 = 1/100 is not true.</text>

      <comment>I replaced the section about acidic marinades tenderizing with a better one.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cooknav}} | [[Cookbook:Cooking techniques|Cooking techniques]]

'''Marinating''' involves letting a piece of food to stand, usually refrigerated, in a highly flavorful broth or sauce to add flavor. Many marinades have [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] or some other acid.

Contrary to popular belief, acids in marinades will not tenderize meat! Any liquid that has a pH of 1 or lower will, but the only examples are stomach acid and battery acid, which are not very good to cook with. Most vinegars have a pH of 3, and the lowest pH liquid that is used for culinary use is citrus juice, which has a pH of 2, still not enough to tenderize. So those people out there that still believe that acids tenderize, go get some battery or stomach acid for your &quot;tenderizing&quot;.

If you're wondering what the difference between marinades and brines is, here it is: Brines are basically salty water with other flavorings added. Marinades usually don't contain the levels of salt that a brine does, and most marinades don't have added water. They also contain acids.

''You may also be interested in [[Cookbook:Butter]].''

'''Margarine''' is a butter substitute&amp;#8212; by US FDA regulations it must consist of 80% fat. Normally in the US, this is various partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and emulsifiers accounting for the fat portion, while the remaining 20% consists of primarily water. To make it taste like butter, butter flavor (which is not generally vegan unless otherwise specified) is added to give it a more butter-like taste, and salt is also generally added, as butter flavor has very little taste without salt.

Margarine works quite well in baking, although the taste and texture can't quite match butter. It is sold in stick or tub form. Margarine in stick form is better for cooking, because it can be easily measured and has melting properties similar to butter. However, margarine in a tub (soft margarine) is easier to spread - but often functions slightly more like oil when you are baking, due to the softer texture. 

It is important to note that a wide variety of products are considered margarine, while they are technically actually vegetable oil spreads and similar products with lower levels of oil. Even some stick products widely used and considered margarine are not technically margarine. As you reduce the fat content, it alters the properties, so use caution when baking with products that appear to be margarine but do not actually say that anywhere on the package. Soft spreads are particularly problematic, as some may have so little fat they are considered fat free.

Typical margarine has less saturated fat than [[cookbook:butter|butter]] but it has instead large amounts of potentially more harmful [[cookbook:trans fat|trans fat]] created during the hydrogenation process. It is important to note that while most margarine products available in the US today are produced using partially hydrogenated oils which contain trans-fats, margarine can be made using other vegetable oils that are not partially hydrogenated, resulting in a trans-fat free product. All margarine produced in Australia has been trans-fat free since 1996. Fully hydrogenated oils may also be used - when an oil is fully hydrogenated, no trans-fats remain.

Some margarines purport to be &quot;trans-fat free&quot; but still contain partially hydrogenated oils - this is often puzzling to people who know that partially hydrogenated oils always means the product contains trans-fat. In most jurisdictions, a certain level of transfats is allowed while calling the product &quot;trans-fat free&quot; - in the U.S. anything under 0.5 g is allowable while being reported as 0 g. This is quite disturbing, because while the FDA and USDA do not specify a maximum intake, the suggest intake at the press conference unveiling the new food pyramid was no more than 2 g per day. That means four servings of &quot;trans-fat free&quot; food could put you at your maximum intake of trans-fat for the day. This is particularly problematic in margarine where the serving size can be easily manipulated to obtain a value of less than 0.5 grams per serving.

'''Lemons''' are [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] from the tree ''Citrus limon''. They are cultivated primarily for their [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice]], though the pulp and rind are also used, primarily in cooking or [[Bartending/Cocktails|mixology]]. Lemon juice is about 5% citric acid, which gives lemons a sour taste.

Lemons were not cultivated in the West until after the Arab conquests. They were cultivated in Genoa in the mid-fifteenth century, and appeared in the Azores in 1494. Lemons were once used by the British navy to combat scurvy, as they provided a large amount of vitamin C. The British navy originally thought lemons were overripe limes which they resemble and their sailors became known as limeys, not lemonys.

[[Image:Lemon.jpg|right|thumb|Lemons]]
Both lemons and [[Cookbook:Lime|limes]] are regularly served as [[Cookbook:Lemonade|lemonade]] (natural lemon with [[Cookbook:Water|water]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]) or limeade, its equivalent, or as a garnish for drinks such as cola with a slice either inside or on the rim of the glass. Lemon juice is typically dripped onto battered [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] dishes in restaurants in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and other countries—the acidic juice neutralizes the taste of amines in fish. Some like to eat lemons as fruit.

Lemon juice contains approximately 500 milligrams of [[Metabolomics/Nutrition/Vitamin C|vitamin C]] and 50 grams of [[Nutrition:Citric acid|citric acid]] per liter.

== Zest ==

'''Lemon zest''', when used as an ingredient, refers to shavings of the thin yellow outer skin of the lemon. The zest contains strong smelling oils which are used to flavor many baked goods. One can remove the zest from a lemon by using a small-holed [[Cookbook:Grater|grater]], a microplane, or by carefully cutting the zest with a knife then [[Cookbook:Mincing|mincing]] the results. Ideally, none of the white pith should be included with the zest. Be sure to scrub and wash the outer skin first to remove any remaining pesticide.

== Recipes ==
Lemon recipes can be found in [[:Category:Lemon recipes]].

Give Wikibooks back to the reader, not empty category titles.

==Too many categories, too few books==
Wikibooks has a big goal, but is evolving slowly (see the [[Wikibooks talk:Why move books?|Talk]] page). Many empty categories and open books are added, without any content. This is frustrating for a user clicking through the [[all bookshelves|bookshelves]].

* '''Bookshelves''' should contain '''books''', not categories.
* Categories can be '''added when necessary''', not before.
* Let us concentrate on '''finishing''' existing books, rather than creating books that nobody writes.

==Active and suggested books==
* Let us focus our work on maintaining good '''active books'''.
* Books that look like stubs and haven't been worked on for the last three months (check its history!) should be moved to '''suggested books'''.

==Let us clean up==
Help cleaning up Wikibooks:
* Move books to the [[all bookshelves|new bookshelves]] that should contain '''books''', not empty categories.
* Move active books to sections labelled '''Active Wikibooks'''.
* Move inactive books (books with modest content, no major change for three months) to '''Suggested Wikibooks''' (We don't delete anything, somebody might take up the book idea and fill it marvellously - then it can be moved back to &quot;active books&quot;).
* Update [[Help:Development stages|development stages]]:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (Left, Right : T) {{Ada/kw|return}} T;

===== Usage =====

 A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float   := 5.0 * 2.0;  {{Ada/--|A is now 10.0}}
 B : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := 5 * 2;      {{Ada/--|B is also 10}}

===== Working Example =====

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|operator_multiply.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator_Multiply {{Ada/kw|is}}
    A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float   := 5.0 * 2.0;  {{Ada/--|A is now 10.0}}
    B : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := 5 * 2;      {{Ada/--|B is also 10}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
    {{Ada/kw|package}} F_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO (Float);
    {{Ada/kw|package}} I_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO (Integer);
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put (&quot;A = &quot;);
    F_IO.Put (
       Item =&gt; A,
       Fore =&gt; 3,
       Aft  =&gt; 1,
       Exp  =&gt; 0);
    T_IO.New_Line;
    T_IO.Put (&quot;B = &quot;);
    I_IO.Put (
       Item  =&gt; B,
       Width =&gt; 3,
       Base  =&gt; 10);
    T_IO.New_Line;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Operator_Multiply;

=== Common Non-Standard Operations ===

==== Character replication ====

A String is created where a single character is replicated n-times.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (Left : Natural; Right : Character) {{Ada/kw|return}} String;

In addition to standard Strings this [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] is also defined for Bounded_String and Unbounded_String.

===== Usage =====

 A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := 10 * 'X';  {{Ada/--|A is filled with 10 X}}

===== Working Example =====

The character replication [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] is part of the ''Ada.Strings.Fixed'' [[Ada Programming/Packages|package]]. You need to {{Ada/kw|with}} and {{Ada/kw|use}} the package to make the [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] visible.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|operator_multiply_2.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Fixed}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator_Multiply_2 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Strings.Fixed;
 
    A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := 10 * 'X';  {{Ada/--|A is filled with 10 X}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put_Line (&quot;A = &quot; &amp; A);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Operator_Multiply_2;

==== String replication ====

A String is created where a source string is replicated n-times.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (Left : Natural; Right : String) {{Ada/kw|return}} String;

In addition to standard fixed strings this [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] is also defined for Bounded_String and Unbounded_String.

===== Usage =====

 A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := 3 * &quot;Hello &quot;;  {{Ada/--|A is filled with 3 Hello}}

===== Working Example =====

The string replication [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] is part of the {{Ada/package|Ada.Strings.Fixed}} [[Ada Programming/Packages|package]]. You need to {{Ada/kw|with}} and {{Ada/kw|use}} the package to make the operator visible.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|operator_multiply_3.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Fixed}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator_Multiply_3 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Strings.Fixed; 
 
    A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := 3 * &quot;Hello &quot;;  {{Ada/--|A is filled with 3 Hello.}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put_Line (&quot;A = &quot; &amp; A);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Operator_Multiply_3;

A colon (&lt;tt&gt;':'&lt;/tt&gt;) is placed after an identifier, or list of identifiers,
for associating names with some entities, as follows. It occurs in declarations of objects,
or components of objects such as records and protected objects.
Similarly, a colon is to be found after the names of subprogram parameters and
after the names of generic formal objects.

A colon is also used after an identifier when declaring/renaming an
exception, or when declaring an exception choice parameter.
Also, it can be used when specifying a loop or block name.

'''Samphire''', or '''Rock Samphire''', is an edible wild plant found in coastal regions of mainland Britain.

Its fleshy, divided, aromatic leaves have long been regarded as a delicacy in Norfolk. It is now appearing as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]] in London restaurants or can be used a starter. The flavour is highly reminiscent of [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] hence samphire is sometimes referred to as &quot;Poor Man's Asparagus.&quot; It is often sold by fishmongers when in season (from late spring).  Well worth trying, if you can find it.

Early crops can be eaten raw, but in a later harvest, the leaves will be tougher and slightly bitter. To prepare them for the table, trim away the hard root, wash the leaves and plunge them into boiling water for a few minutes. Serve with a mixture of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] and [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], or with butter alone. Diners pull the green flesh from a hard central stalk by dragging it through their teeth like an over-sized thread of floss.

The tender young shoots of the '''hop''', in season for a very short period in spring, can be lightly boiled and used as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]], starter, or accompanying vegetable. They have a flavour similar to [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Measurement''' is one of the fundamental concepts in experimental sciences, including physics. What is exactly meant by &quot;measurement&quot; is not precisely defined, and in fact it is one of the frontiers of research in quantum physics, where the act of measurement plays an important role in the commonly accepted interpretations of quantum mechanics. For our purposes, we can say measurement is the act of writing down a physical quantity, such as time or length, in objective terms.

Measurement is how one tests theories in experimental sciences as physics. In order to test a theory, one uses the theory to make predictions in a specific physical situation, and then perform an experiment, that is, a series of measurements, to see if the prediction is true. For example, as a consequence of Earth's gravity near its surface (Newtonian theory of gravity), we predict that, in a free fall, an object travels a distance ''D'' in time ''T'', so that D is proportional to &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt;. Then we devise an arrangement of equipment and a plan to test this prediction: we can drop a steel marble from height of 25 cm, 50 cm, 75 cm, 1.0 m, 1.25 m and 1.5 m, and measure how long it takes to fall that distance using a stopwatch. If our measurements roughly follows the &lt;math&gt;D \propto T^2&lt;/math&gt; relationship, then this is a confirmation of the theory, in this particular situation.

== Physical Quantities ==
A '''physical quantity''' is anything that we use to describe a physical phenomenon quantitatively. We used a few examples of physical quantities earlier without discussing them further: distance, time, area, and mass. And we will make what we know of those quantities from intuition more precise here.

Some physical quantities can be defined from other quantities. Area and volume are good examples: when we have a square and a cube we can define their respective area and volume in terms of the length of the sides. Such quantitative definition also tells us how to calculate that particular physical quantity, given some other physical quantities.

Intuition tells us that we can't define ''all'' physical quantities in such manner, not without making a circular definition that will not be very useful to us. Physical quantities that cannot be defined in terms of other physical quantities are considered to be fundamental and we can define them only by stating how we measure them. Such definition is called ''operational definition''.

Distance, time, and mass are such fundamental physical quantities. These cannot be defined in terms of other measurable quantities (note that there is some arbitrariness in this choice: it is possible, although not practical, to choose area to be a fundamental physical quantity and define distance as length of the side of a square having certain area). In fact, how we choose to define them determines our unit system, which is a topic of next chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">how about adding (I can't do formulae :) ) 

*acceleration toward centre of rotation (centripetal force?) = (scalar velocity)^2/radius = omega^2 x radius
*Force toward centre of rotation = m x r x omega^2 or (mv^2)/r

== Torque ==

I also can't do formulas.  There isn't really anything about torque in the torque section!  The definition of 
torque = radius x force
should be included at least, right?
[[User:Dyknowsore|Dyknowsore]]


== Centripetal Acceleration ==

In regards to your discussion,

''&quot;acceleration toward centre of rotation (centripetal force?) = (scalar velocity)^2/radius = omega^2 x radius&quot;''

Keep in mind the formula you listed above states the ''magnitude'' of circular acceleration for uniform circular motion.  Given that we are dealing with uniform circular motion, we also know that acceleration will always be perpendicular to velocity; thus, we can assume its direction is always towards the center of the circle.  If acceleration wasn't perpendicular to the direction of velocity, then the acceleration would be contributing to the velocity in some sort of way.  Thus, the magnitude of velocity would not remain constant, thus no longer making it uniform circular motion.

Let:
A = Angle&lt;br&gt;
R = displacement vector&lt;br&gt;
V = velocity vector&lt;br&gt;
f = frequency &lt;br&gt;
w(omega) = 2piF = velocity/radius (v/r)&lt;br&gt;
t = time&lt;br&gt;
A = wt&lt;br&gt;
i = x-axis unit vector notation&lt;br&gt;
j = y-axis unit vector notation&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''1. Displacement vector R is equal to displacement in its x- and y-components.  Such that,'''R = R(CosA)i + R(SinA)j
&lt;br&gt;
-or-
&lt;br&gt;
'''2. Since A=wt,'''
R = R(Cos(wt))i + R(Sin(wt))j&lt;br&gt;
[substituting the angle for wt]&lt;br&gt;
Note: If you notice, the resultant vector R is equal to the radius at all points.  It is basically the radius sweeping out a portion of the circle.  In other words, it's only the angle (direction) that changes in uniform circular motion and the magnitude is always equal the radius.  For futher proof, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to show that the magnitude of R equals radius r.
&lt;br&gt;
'''3. Now deriving R, we produce velocity vector V.'''
&lt;br&gt;
V=R'=(Rw(-Cos(wt)))i + (Rw(Sin(wt)))j
&lt;br&gt;
'''4. Then we take the second derivative to get acceleration.'''
&lt;br&gt;
a(circular)=V'=-(Rw^2(Cos(wt)))i-(Rw^2(Sin(wt))j
&lt;br&gt;
'''Then factor the omegas...'''
&lt;br&gt;
a(circular)=-w^2(R(Cos(wt)))i+(R(Sin(wt))j
&lt;br&gt;
'''5. Now taking a look at the line above,'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a(circular)=-w^2'''(R(Cos(wt)))i+(R(Sin(wt))j'''
&lt;br&gt;
'''the bolded region is equal to vector R, so'''
&lt;br&gt;a(circular)=-w^2(R)
&lt;br&gt;
'''6. And since w=v/r'''
&lt;br&gt;a(circular)=-(v/r)^2(r)= -(v^2/r^2)(R)
&lt;br&gt;
But we cannot cancel out r, a scalar value, with a vector R.  We know that the magnitude of R is always going to equal r.  So we can take all of the components, square them individually, add them together, and square root them (according to the Pythagorean Theorem).  The value we produce is now in a format we are all used to:
&lt;br&gt;
|a(circular)|=(v^2/r^2)|R| = (v^2/r^2)r = v^2/r
&lt;br&gt;
'''Note:''' The negative sign in front of (v/r)^2 is removed during the squaring process.
&lt;br&gt;
'''And thus, we have proved:'''
&lt;br&gt;
|a(circular)| = v^2/r
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Centrifugal force==
The following statement from the article on 2/5/07 is incorrect:

::We know that an opposite force should exist for this centripetal force(by Newton's 3rd Law of Motion). This is the centrifugal force, which exists only if we study the body from a non-inertial frame of reference(an accelerating frame of reference,such as in circular motion).

The &quot;equal and opposite force&quot; is usually of the same nature as the centripetal force. For instance, for a uniform planetary orbit, the gravitational force of the planet on the sun is equal and opposite to the force of the sun on the planet. Because of such confusion, I don't think centrifugal force should be discussed in this module -- just mention (correctly) that it is an illusion in the non-inertial frame of reference, and maybe link to a more detailed discussion of the pseudo-force.[[User:Zolot|Zolot]] 20:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

This recipe for the deep fried Mars bar illustrates a typical procedure. The ingredients in the dish's variations may vary indefinitely, but the procedure will remain more or less the same. For authentic flavor, fry the treat in  [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] drippings rather than vegetable oil (it is worth noting the high saturated fat content this method of cooking involves).

==Ingredients==
*1 UK or Canadian [[w:Mars_Bar|Mars Bar]] or 1 US [[w:Milky_Way%20(confectionery)|Milky Way Bar]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] 
* Enough oil to fill the pot or fryer you are using ([[Cookbook:Oil|oil or fat]] can be used as well as [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] for authenticity)

==Procedure==
* [[Cookbook:Chill|Chill]], but do not [[Cookbook:Freeze|freeze]], the Mars bar by leaving it in a fridge, or freezer, for a short while. 
* Mix the milk, flour and egg in a bowl. 
* [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] together to create a creamy [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]]. 
* Heat the oil. 
* Coat the Mars bar completely in batter.
* Lower into hot oil (around 350-375 degrees Fahrenheit, 175-190 Celsius) and fry until batter is golden brown. (Note: be careful to lower it gently; otherwise the batter may come off)
* Serve.
{{NOTE|Deep fried foods, if at all, should be consumed with moderation. Extreme deep fat and caloric food, like this recipe describes, require extreme moderation.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Organizing bookshelves==
* Please [[why move books?|move books]] to existing bookshelves.
* Please add a new bookshelf only if necessary, and if it contains enough existing active books (e.g. splitting of a large bookshelf)
* Take out books of the list of active Wikibooks, if they look like stubs and nobody added anything in the last 3 months (check history). These can be moved to the corresponding &quot;Suggested Wikibooks&quot; section of the bookshelf.
* Somebody could move &quot;How-tos&quot; to &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; (creating a section &quot;How-tos&quot; there), since it only contains 4 active books so far.

It's a shame the shelf label says &quot;computer science&quot; and not &quot;computing science&quot;.

== Health Science ==

Medicine has its limits as a bookshelf when I noticed there were a few other books that were related to medical subjects but did not fall withing the purview of Medicine. Hence I went ahead and created a Health Science bookshelf. But after having done that I saw that many named books were yet to start. I thought I would let it stay for two reasons:
*not many medical people have been active though it happens to be the collaboration of the month
*by expanding the boundaries and including more disciplines I hope to encourage the participation of more people.
Your thoughts on this are welcome. I will try and keep only active books in the shelves. At the same time I feel that people feel more encouraged to contribute when they see a book already on the shelf. And by keeping only active books we eliminate the participation of these potential contributors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Too Slow Compared to What? ==
This sounds good, though the tone is a little bit pessimistic: I don't think that wikibooks is &quot;evolving too slowly&quot;. Hop on over to sourceforge to see a &quot;wasteland&quot; of open source projects that have been started, but never went anywhere. Or look at how long it took before Mozilla was worth using. That's part of the nature of an open source project: you need a dedicated team, or one truly dedicated individual, to do a bulk amount of work before &quot;the community&quot; can really make any thoughtful contributions to that.

Exceptions appear to be the cookbook, in which wikibookians are eager to add on an additional recipe. There is little connection from one recipe to the next. This is the wikipedia model: starting with little stubs, more can be added on communally, resulting in something great.

Textbooks, just like computer programs, however, require more coordination. It is not helpful to expect wikibooks to perform like the wikipedia; the required development models are different. As I've learned from the Algorithms and Data Structures books: (1) writing a quality textbook, even a slim one, is very time consuming (you need to verify that what you are saying is true, and even formatting what to say, after you know what you want to say, can take a long time); (2) the model seems to be more about 2-4 people working on a book, and then everyone else primarily contributing not as authors, but as readers and field testers who find errors and ask for clarification.

However, I approve of the idea of moving content to &quot;suggested&quot; books, so as not to be a repository for table-of-contents-without-books. Just as in the open-source world, there are plenty of people eager to offer ideas, but reluctant to dedicate even five hours a week for a period of six months. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:33, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:I didn't want to sound too pessimistic, but I think a healthy cleaning-up system might help to better focus work on good books. Keeping the bookshelves &quot;tidy&quot; (I'm not saying to throw away anything, just to put better or active work to more prominent position) is also not an easy work. The small images picturing the stages of a book are a very good beginning, but the problem is, they are not updated regularily.
:I will suggest a template, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{checked|25%|Jan 10 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (that doesn't exist yet), which will picture one of the 4 development stage squares, plus a tiny date next to it when the book was last checked. Anyone can then update this information, and one can easily see which books have not been checked for a long time, check those books, and move them accordingly. 
:Also, there should be simple and easy standardized guidelines for setting &quot;development stages&quot;. The 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% is a good start - one could e.g. count how many sections in the book are really filled (not only with stubs).
:I will work this out later, but anybody is invited here to discuss this procedure. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 11:53, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::To follow the OSS metaphor, I guess I could see the cleaning-up as a way to set the scope of the project: Initially dozens of requests for features (i.e., books) might come in, and many of them should instead be saved &quot;for version 2.0&quot;. We should be mindful that some books would move in periodic stages. For example, my school is on a quarter system, and the breaks between each quarter is when I have the most time to write new sections: I could still be actively thinking and planning a book I might not have edited for over two months. I'm sure other people's schedules would also be periodic.

::Perhaps we can start with a template that says &quot;this book has been flagged as a suggested book&quot; and state that if the notice is up for more than a month then the book would get moved. (Q1: Is it just the book gets moved off of the bookshelf, and the module itself stays put?) (Q2: When the wikibooks site says &quot;there are X many books being worked on&quot; is that the number of books listed on the shelves, or is that counting all modules, in which case a 10 module book would be counted as 10 books?)

::One other side note: since my books are still in the early stages it's actually somewhat nice there isn't high traffic and too many edits yet-- the result would be cluttered and incoherent. (At least with programs they cannot run when too many things are slapped on, but the only way to &quot;run&quot; a book is to read it cover to cover.) To address this problem in the future I actually created a third &quot;advanced&quot; book as a place to hold random content for the people who contributed something worth reading, but were mistaken in thinking that adding an article to a book is just like adding an article to the wikipedia. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:09, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:::I implemented new stage markers now. Please look at [[Help:Development stages|Development stages]] for details!
:::To answer your questions: I think the flag is a very good idea. I might implement it later. Also, the &quot;three months&quot; period can be discussed or extended. No hurry at all.
:::your Q1: Only the links (books) within [[All bookshelves]] move around. No book gets deleted or renamed or anything.
:::your Q2: Unfortunately, it lists all the modules, stub or not, so you never know how many quality books there are... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 16:16, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I moved this into the Wikibooks name space because this isn't content designed for users, but for editors and writers.  I'll go through and fix any double redirects I just made. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 19:31, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Thank you very much. I probably should also move the [[Book of the month]] + links to this namespace. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 21:32, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''kill''' is a unix command used to send unix signals to running processus. By default it will try to send the TERM signal which will ask the process to stop it works hence the name ''kill''.

Available signals are available from the kill command:

 $ kill -l
  1) SIGHUP       2) SIGINT       3) SIGQUIT      4) SIGILL
  5) SIGTRAP      6) SIGABRT      7) SIGBUS       8) SIGFPE
  9) SIGKILL     10) SIGUSR1     11) SIGSEGV     12) SIGUSR2
 13) SIGPIPE     14) SIGALRM     15) SIGTERM     17) SIGCHLD
 18) SIGCONT     19) SIGSTOP     20) SIGTSTP     21) SIGTTIN
 22) SIGTTOU     23) SIGURG      24) SIGXCPU     25) SIGXFSZ
 26) SIGVTALRM   27) SIGPROF     28) SIGWINCH    29) SIGIO
 30) SIGPWR      31) SIGSYS      33) SIGRTMIN    34) SIGRTMIN+1
 35) SIGRTMIN+2  36) SIGRTMIN+3  37) SIGRTMIN+4  38) SIGRTMIN+5
 39) SIGRTMIN+6  40) SIGRTMIN+7  41) SIGRTMIN+8  42) SIGRTMIN+9
 43) SIGRTMIN+10 44) SIGRTMIN+11 45) SIGRTMIN+12 46) SIGRTMIN+13
 47) SIGRTMIN+14 48) SIGRTMIN+15 49) SIGRTMAX-15 50) SIGRTMAX-14
 51) SIGRTMAX-13 52) SIGRTMAX-12 53) SIGRTMAX-11 54) SIGRTMAX-10
 55) SIGRTMAX-9  56) SIGRTMAX-8  57) SIGRTMAX-7  58) SIGRTMAX-6
 59) SIGRTMAX-5  60) SIGRTMAX-4  61) SIGRTMAX-3  62) SIGRTMAX-2
 63) SIGRTMAX-1  64) SIGRTMAX

You can send a given signal to all process having a given name or only to one process giving its PID. For example if you want to send signal SIGHUP to process 23154 :
 kill -s SIGHUP 23154
If you want to send the same signal to all process named Apache :
 kill -s SIGHUP Apache

You can also groups pid, the two commands above can be merged in:
 kill -s SIGHUP 23154 Apache


Issuing signals, you can control your system a bit more. Say you have an ongoing script, running under PID 12345, which use a lot of your cpu and you would like to &quot;pause&quot; it while doing something else. You can issue your process the STOP signal:

 kill -s STOP 12345

To later resume it, you will ask the process to CONTinue its work:

 kill -s CONT 12345

Example:

We will start a simple process (sleep) in the background (&amp;). The sleep process does nothing but waiting for the given number of seconds (in our case 360 seconds or 6 minutes):
 $ sleep 360 &amp;
 [1] 7551
 $
The shell give us back the PID of the process (7551). Let it run a bit then check its status with the [[ps]] command:

 $ ps -o fname,pid,stat,etime
 COMMAND    PID STAT     ELAPSED
 bash      7425 Ss         04:47
 sleep     7551 S          00:58
 ps        7600 R+   49710-06:27:47
 $

Now we ask our process to pause its work:
 $  kill -s STOP 7551

Press enter to update your output buffer and the shell give you the confirmation:
 $
 [1]+  Stopped                 sleep 360
 $

Sometime later, our process is still stopped:
 $ ps -o fname,pid,stat,etime
 COMMAND    PID STAT     ELAPSED
 bash      7425 Ss         10:37
 sleep     7551 T          06:05
 ps        7719 R+   49710-06:27:47
 $
You can notice that 6 minutes elapsed since the start although the process should have ended after 5 minutes (remember we used &quot;sleep 360&quot;).

Now we want to tell the process to continue its operation:
 $ kill -s CONT 7551

Update your buffer by pressing enter:
 $
 [1]+  Done                    sleep 360
 $

Blam the process is finished. When you issued the CONT signal the process resumed and checked the current time, as more than 360 seconds have been elapsed it ended itself.

Call sheets give the broad and essential details of a day's shooting.  Typically, you would send a call sheet out to every member of the cast and crew as early as possible.  During production, this usually means the night before!

==What a Call Sheet contains==

* Project title
* Date
* Day out of days (e.g. &quot;day 3 of a 5 day shoot&quot;)
* Location(s) for the day
* Parking details
* Contact details for (at least) the principal members of the crew (e.g. Producer, Production Manager, 1st AD, Location Manager)
* Recommended clothing (e.g. &quot;wear black&quot; or &quot;wear full waterproofing&quot;)
* Scenes to be shot for the day
* Broad schedule (the call sheet doesn't usually include the shot-by-shot schedule)
** Call times
** Makeup and wardrobe times
** Scenes
** Travel
** Breaks
** Estimated wrap time
* Weather forecast
* Details of the local hospital
* Details of the local police
* Equipment details
* Hire company details

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cryptography has a long and colorful history from Caesar's encryption in first century BC to the 20th century. 

== Caesar Cipher ==
One of the most basic methods of encryption is the use of Caesar Ciphers. It simply consist in shifting the alphabet over a few characters and matching up the letters.

== Classical cryptography ==
This makes transposition and substituting the two major principles in classical cryptography.

== Transposition ciphers ==
Lets look first at transposition, which is the changing in the position of the letters in the message such as a simple writing backwards
     Plaintext: THE PANEL IN THE WALL MOVES
     Encrypted: EHT LENAP NI EHT LLAW SEVOM

or as in a more complex transposition such as:
   
     THEPAN    
     ELINTH     
     EWALLM
     OVESAA        

then take the columns:

     TEEO HLWV EIAE PNLS ATLA NHMA

''(the extra letters are called space fillers)''
The idea in transposition is NOT to randomize it but to transform it to something that is not recognizable with a reversible algorithm (an algorithm is just a procedure, reversible so your correspondent can read the message).

We discuss transposition ciphers in much more detail in a later chapter, [[Cryptography/Transposition ciphers|Cryptography/Transposition ciphers]].

== Substitution ciphers ==

The second principle is substitution. That is, substituting a Symbol for a letter of your plaintext (or word or even sentence). Slang even can sometimes be a form of cipher (the symbols replacing your plaintext), ever wonder why your parents never understood you?
Slang, though, is not something you would want to store a secret in for a long time. In WWII, there were Navajo CodeTalkers who passed along info from unit to unit. From what I hear (someone verify this) the Navajo language was a very exclusive almost unknown and unwritten language. So the Japanese were not able to decipher it. 

Even though this is a very loose example of substitution, whatever works works.
The classical example of a substitution cipher is a shifted alphabet cipher

    Alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
      Cipher: BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZA
     Cipher2: CDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZAB
         etc...

Example:(using cipher 2)
           Plaintext: THE PANEL IN THE WALL MOVES
           Encrypted: VJG RCPGN KP VJG YCNN OQXGU

If this is the first time you've seen this it may seem like a rather secure cipher, but it's not. In fact this by itself is very insecure. For a time in the 1500-1600's this was the most secure (mainly because there were many people who were illiterate) but a man (old what's his name) in the 18th century discovered a way to crack (find the hidden message) of every cipher of this type he discovered frequency analysis. 

We discuss substitution ciphers in much more detail in a later chapter, [[Cryptography/Substitution cipher|Cryptography/Substitution cipher]]s.

== Frequency Analysis ==

In the shifted alphabet cipher or any simple randomized cipher, the same letter in the cipher replaces each of the same ones in your message (e.g. 'A' replaces all 'D's in the plaintext, etc.). The weakness is that English uses certain letters more than any other letter in the alphabet. 'E' is the most common, etc. Here's an exercise count all of each letter in this article. You'll find that in the previous sentence there are 2 'H's,7 'E's, 3 'R's, 3 'S's, etc. By far 'E' is the most common letter; here are the other frequencies [Frequency tables|http://rinkworks.com/words/letterfreq.shtml]. Basically you experiment with replacing different symbols with letters (the most common with 'E', etc.).

       Encrypted: VJG TCKP KP URCKP

First look for short words with limited choices of words, such as 'KP' this may be at, in, to, or, by, etc. Let us select in. Replace 'K' with 'I' and 'P' with 'N'.

       Encrypted: VJG TC&lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt; URC&lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt;

Next select VJG this is most likely the (since the huge frequency of 'the' in a normal sentence, check a couple of the preceding sentences).

       Encrypted: &lt;u&gt;THE&lt;/u&gt; TC&lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt; URC&lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt;

generally this in much easier in long messages
the plaintext is 'THE RAIN IN SPAIN'

We discuss many different ways to &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;break&quot;, and &quot;solve&quot; encrypted messages in a later section of this book,
&quot;Part III: Cryptanalysis&quot;,
which includes a much more detailed section on [[Cryptography/Frequency analysis|Cryptography/Frequency analysis]].


== Combining transposition and substitution ==

A more secure encryption is a transposed substitution cipher.

Take the above message in encrypted form
      
       Encrypted:VJG RCPGN KP VJG YCNN OQXGU

now spiral transpose it

           VJGRC
           NNOQP
           CAAXG
           YUNGN
           GJVPK

The message starts in the upper right corner and spirals to the center (again the AA is a filler)
Now take the columns:

        VNCYG JNAUJ GOANV RQXGP CPGNK

Now this is more resistant to Frequency analysis, see what we did before that started recognizable patterns results in:

        TNCYE HNAUH EOANT RQXEN CNENK

A problem for people who crack codes.

      <comment>/* Virtual images */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two types of images that can be formed: Real and virtual.

==Real images==
Real images are images that are formed at the same side as the either the reflected or transmitted rays. Rays actually passed through the points in the image and are being picked up by your eyes.  As a result they can be focused on to a projection screen. By convention, the position of a real image is greater than zero.

==Virtual images==
Virtual images are those that appear at the same side as the incident rays. Rays did not actually pass through the image but you can virtually trace the rays back to the location of the image as if the rays originated from there. Any mirror or lens can produce a virtual image. Virtual images are described by a negative image location.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Users should have control over the background sound or music; therefore, media player controls should always be visible. Don't try to script your own controls since they might not work in all environments. 

One valid way to do an autostarting (background) music player is to use Windows Media Player ActiveX for IE. Other browsers like Firefox, Opera and Safari can use a generic solution which doesn't dictate what plugin should be used. Plugin can be, for example, QuickTime (Windows, Mac) or MPlayer (GNU/Linux). If a suitable player doesn't exist, then fall back to a plain link. 

-Copy the following code to your site&lt;br&gt;
-Replace all four occurrences of &quot;clip.mp3&quot; with correct filename&lt;br&gt;
Other widely supported file formats are midi and wav, if you use those remember to change the type attribute accordingly:&lt;br&gt;
audio/midi for midi files&lt;br&gt;
audio/x-wav for wav files&lt;br&gt;

In the USA, the term '''pickles''' refers specifically to [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumbers]]. These are known as gherkins (or, less formally, &quot;wallies&quot;) in the United Kingdom. (In the US, gherkins are small pickles.) They may be produced by fermentation or by simply treating cucumbers with [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]. Pickles are often flavored with [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] and [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]]. They are generally used to add piquancy to a main meal, and on or with [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburgers]] and other types of sandwiches.

One popular type of pickle that comes from Jewish cuisine is the ''kosher pickle.'' The issue with kosher dietary rules comes from the usage of polysorbates that come from animals. (See [[Judaism/Jewish Cooking|Jewish Cooking]] for details.) Additionally, a kosher pickle has a zesty, [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] brine, made with kosher salt.
Outside of the USA, the term &quot;pickle&quot; sometimes refers to any sort of pickled food. These can range from pickled [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] to complex pickles produced for the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] market.  Even meats and fish can be pickled.

If a recipe calls for &quot;pickles&quot;, it's the US usage; if it is any other kind of pickle, it should be more specific (i.e., pickled [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]], pickled [[Cookbook:Chili pepper|pepper]], etc.)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Greeting someone ==

There is a simple standard formula to greet someone:
:''Xin chào!''

However, it is much more elegant to address the person you are talking to in some way. Hence, a formula like '''Chào ông!''' is much better. In this phrase, ''ông'' is used to address respectable men, usually older than oneself. Instead of ''ông'', the following words can be used to address persons with different status and age in relation to the speaker:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse&quot;
| cụ (俱) || people who are much older than oneself, or generally very old
|-
| bà (婆) || elderly ladies, or ladies who are older than oneself
|-
| ông (翁) || elderly men, or men who are older than oneself
|-
| chú (注) || uncle, or if they are older than you and younger than your parents
|-
| cô (姑) || aunt, or if they are older than you and younger than your parents
|-
| chị (姊) || young ladies, or ladies who are in the same age as oneself
|-
| anh (英) || young men, or men who are in the same age as oneself
|-
| em (㛪) || younger persons, children
|-
| thầy (偨 ) || the teacher (if he is a man)
|-
| cô (姑) || the teacher (if she is a woman)
|-
|}

When addressing more than one person, add '''các''' before the noun, e.g. '''Chào các anh!'''

The Vietnamese counterpart for ''How are you?'' is '''Ông có khỏe không?''' Again, here the ''ông'' has to be replaced by the necessary noun from the table, depending on the person addressed. Possible answers are:

;Cám ơn, tôi khỏe.
:Thanks, I am fine.
;Cám ơn, tôi bình thường.
:Thanks, I am normal.
;Tôi vẫn khỏe.
:I am still fine.
;Tôi cũng khỏe.
:I am also fine.

The Vietnamese equivalent to ''Good bye!'' is either '''Tạm biệt!''' or simply '''Chào ông!'''

[[Image:WasabiOnOroshigane.jpg|thumb|right|wasabi]]
Also known as '''[[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] [[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]]''' (''Wasabia japonica''), this green root is prepared by being ground, dried, and made into a paste. It is used in Japanese cooking and is often served with [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]].

Since the plant is difficult to grow, most wasabi sold outside of Japan is just European horseradish with green coloring added.

Wasabi (Japanese: 山葵 or 和佐比; scientific name Wasabia japonica (syn. Cochlearia wasabi, Eutrema japonica)) is a member of the cabbage family. Commonly known as Japanese horseradish, it grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan. It is green and has an extremely strong flavor. Its hotness is different from [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]], which burns the tongue; wasabi's strong sensations shoot up one's sinus cavity instead.

The historical purpose for wasabi is supposedly to kill the bacteria in the raw fish often used in sushi.

==BOMBING==
In the sentence concerning Vietnam: &quot;Bombing began 1967&quot;  and  By 1968 more bombs were dropped than in WWII.  I recall these phrases from that era, and consider them propaganda. 

I don't know whether you, the editor, should elaborate or not; considering the brevity of the article.  There is a vast difference between dive bombing and carpet bombing.  Most &quot;official&quot; data was secret or government propaganda. The Media was flagrantly abusive.   The fact is that limited precision dive bombing began over N. Vietnam in 1965.  Carpet bombing by B-52s (the monkey killers) was limited to bombing Jungle-Mountain infiltration trails in N. Vietnam and Laos.  It was primarily an image/morale exercise using up ship-loads (many ships) of bombs that did not fall on villages, towns or cities.  They made match-sticks out of jungle. Really impressive when photographed from the air for TV. In this regard the reference to WWII is egregiously deceptive.

(Another matter, entirely, were Nixon's Christmas 1972 B-52 raids on downtown Hanoi.  I recall 600 sorties, eleven days, that ended the war))

And perhaps you can advise me of the intended difference wetween Wikipedia and Wikibooks?  Truely, I don't know.---plumalley</text>

'''Turmeric''', or yellow ginger, is a spice similar to ginger in appearance, but it has a totally different taste, and it gives its characteristic yellow color to the food.

Turmeric is often used as a low-cost substitute for [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]]. The color is similar, but the taste is very different.

Turmeric, along with [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]], gives [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]] their characteristic taste.

Be careful using Turmeric, as it can overpower a dish easily.

= Ein Treffen in Hannover (WIP)=
(Don't be afraid. There is a lot of text, but not much grammar.)

Katja hat sich mit einem Freund, Markus, verabredet, den sie im Chat kennengelernt hat. Sie hat ein Foto von ihm gesehen, und vielleicht gefällt er ihr ja. Am &quot;Kröpcke&quot;, der größten U-Bahnstation in Hannover, steigt sie aus der U-Bahn. Täglich betreten Hunderte von Menschen diese Station, Schüler, Studenten, Angestellte und Rentner. Sie ist 22, studiert seit 2 Jahren Tiermedizin in Hannover, und ist im Moment ledig.
Sie geht auf die Rolltreppe, betritt die Stufen, und fährt zwei Stockwerke nach oben. Währenddessen schaut sie nach unten. Ihre U-Bahn hat die Station verlassen. Eine andere U-Bahn hat bereits gehalten, und die Fahrgäste sind aufgestanden und ausgestiegen. Sie kommt auf der zweiten Ebene an und geht weiter, Richtung Sonnenlicht, in die Pasarelle. Die Pasarelle führt Richtung Hauptbahnhof, und links und rechts locken die Schaufenster der Geschäfte.
Nach einer Weile hat sie die Rolltreppe erreicht, die zum Hauptbahnhof führt. Nun sieht sie in voller Breite den Hauptbahnhof von Hannover, und davor einen Sockel mit einer Statue von einem Pferd mit Reiter. Dort hat Markus schon fünf Minuten gewartet und begrüßt sie, bevor sie sich ins Eiscafe nebenan setzen.

Inverted word order occurs under several circumstances, among which are:

*Interrogatives
*Time Expressions
*Subordinating Conjunctions

For interrogatives, a simple statement, &quot;Du hast das Buch.&quot; becomes &quot;Hast du das Buch?&quot; when converting it to a question.  The method is simply switching the verb and subject of the sentence.  

Time expressions, such as &quot;Nach der Schule&quot; prefacing a sentence cause inverted word order.  The formula is &quot;Time Expression&quot;, &quot;Verb&quot;, &quot;Subject&quot; and &quot;Rest of sentence.&quot;  Practically applied, &quot;Every day, I go to school&quot; becomes &quot;Jeden Tag gehe ich zur Schule.&quot;

Subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an independent clause.  Some subordinating conjunctions are: ''dass'' (that), ''obwohl'' (although), ''seit'' (since), ''weil'' (because), and ''wenn'' (if, when).  The formula for a dependent clause is &quot;subordinating conjunction&quot; &quot;subject&quot; &quot;rest of clause&quot; &quot;verb&quot; and is offset from the independent clause by a comma.  Here are some examples (the dependent clause is underlined):
  ''Ich kann das Buch nicht kaufen&lt;u&gt;, weil ich kein Geld habe&lt;/u&gt;.''       ''I can't buy the book &lt;u&gt;because I have no money&lt;/u&gt;.''
  ''Ich kaufe das Buch für dich&lt;u&gt;, da du kein Geld hast&lt;/u&gt;.''           ''I am buying the book for you, &lt;u&gt;as you have no money&lt;/u&gt;.''
  ''&lt;u&gt;Wenn unsere Eltern uns besuchen&lt;/u&gt;, schenken sie uns Geschenke.''   ''&lt;u&gt;When our parents visit us&lt;/u&gt;, they give us presents.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

This is Jeffrey A. Meunier's WikiBooks user page.  My full home page can be gviewed here: http://jeffmeunier.wikispaces.com/

== Experience ==

I have a B.S. in CSE (computer science and engineering) and M.S. in CS (computer science).  I'm working on my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Connecticut.

I have taught a wide variety of courses, and have recently become interested in teaching programming languages.

== Interests ==

Computer-related:

* languages and language implementation
* virtual machines and other computational models
* architecture and assembly language
* networked and distributed computing
* autonomous mobile agents
* constraint programming

== Travel ==

===Germany===
I spent time in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and in Regensburg. I lived in the Ludwig-Thomas Studentwohnneim at the FH Regensburg and worked at Siemens.

===Thailand===
My wife and I lived in Mahasarakham and taught at the university there. She taught English in the department of Western Languages, and I taught computer science in the department of Informatics.

== To do ==
; [[Creating a Virtual Machine]]

; [[Programming Vintage Notebook Computers]]
: Notebooks are more practical than general microcomputers because they are self-contained, easily programmable, and have a long battery life.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==IR==
IR distance sensors are one of the most used distance sensors. They fall in 3 categories:

===Reflection===
(Short range. Not more than 2 - 3cm)
[[Image:IR_reflection_sensor.png|thumb|IR reflection sensor]]
This type uses an IR-LED and IR-diode (or phototransistor). When an object is close to the sensor it reflects the light emitted by the LED to the IR-diode. Using modulated IR-light (A) and filtering (B) the input signal of the IR-diode leads to better results as this blocks (much of) other IR-light.
There are ICs that contain both a modulator, IR-diode and filter-circuit.

===Triangulation===
(Larger range. Around 10 - 30cm)
e.g. Sharp has a family of sensors that use this principle for measuring distance. They consist of an IR-LED and an IR-sensitive LDR strip. Combined with built-in optical lenses, the reflected beam's position on the LDR depends on how far the object is.


===line detecting sensor===

Similar setup as the reflection IR-sensor, but aimed downwards to detect lines on the ground. This sensor makes use of the difference in reflection between a white background and a black line.

More advanced robots use multiple line detection sensors to follow a line more cleanly.

==Ultrasonic==
Ultrasonic distance sensors use sound to measure distance. These sensors emit an ultrasonic pulse train and then measure the time until the pulse is reflected. Since the speed of sound is (more or less; excluding temperature and wind) constant in air (approx. 344m/s) it is easy to calculate the distance to the reflecting object.
These are used for distance ranging from several centimeters up to a few meters.

==Laser==
Laser based distance sensors use the same principle as ultrasonic distance sensors, but use light instead of sound. These sensors are only useful for longer distances. (At least several meters.)

From [[Talk:How To Assemble A Desktop PC]], it sounds like you are interested in building a computer &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;.

What do you think about starting a wikibook to talk about that?
Or [http://tripu.triphoenix.de/ does one already exist]?

Have you seen
[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/ Harry Porter's Relay Computer]
?
It runs at 5 Hz.
(Not 5 GHz or 5 MHz or 5 KHz).
Five cycles per second.

Apparently I'm not the only one crazy enough to think it would be cool to
[http://www.holmea.demon.co.uk/Mk1/Architecture.htm build a CPU out of TTL chips].

I also plan to build something much smaller -- something similar to
[http://img.cmpnet.com/edtn/ccellar/e023pdf1.pdf &quot;Picaro: A Stamp-like Interpreted Controller&quot;]
by Tom Napier.
I hope to end up with something that:
* can run a standard instruction set (perhaps MMIX or 6502 or 8086 or F21)
* the entire CPU + external memory + sensors fits in a small model rocket
** too narrow for a standard 40-pin DIP IC that the original versions of those chips came in
** too narrow for the &quot;standard&quot; memory chips the original versions of those ICs require (but not too narrow for the serial memory chips I plan to use).
* also fits a medical diagnosis tool I'm working on.

''Development stages'' are little indicators placed next to a link to a book or a page to indicate its progress, as reviewed at a certain date. They also are used on a book's main page to indicate the book's progress as a whole.  They help readers identify comprehensive content, while drawing editors' attention to pages needing work.
{{stages}}


{| cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
| style=&quot;width:50%; padding-right:10px;&quot;|
== Quart stages ==
There are two templates that create the quart stages indicators: {{tlx|stage}} and {{tlx|stage short}}. They take the development stage as their first argument and a date as an optional second:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
!  Markup || Displays as
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;[[Main Page]] {{stage|100%|Jan 11, 2005}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|[[Main Page]] {{stage|100%|Jan 11, 2005}}
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;[[Main Page]] {{stage short|100%|Jan 11, 2005}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|[[Main Page]] {{stage short|100%|Jan 11, 2005}}
|}
If the second parameter is not included in the {{tlx|stage}} template the date will not be displayed.
== Deci-stages ==
The {{tlx|decistage}} template creates an indicator with ten stages:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
! Markup || Displays as
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;[[Main Page]] {{decistage|10|Jan 11, 2005}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|[[Main Page]] {{decistage|10|Jan 11, 2005}}
|}
|}

==Book completion status==
Readers browsing through a certain subject area or classification often want to view books that are complete or closer to completion.  In order to indicate the level of completion for a book, add {{tlx|status|&lt;PROGRESS&gt;}} to a book's main page, where &lt;code&gt;&lt;PROGRESS&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is one of the following: &lt;code&gt;0%&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;25%&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;50%&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;75%&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;100%&lt;/code&gt;.  Don't abuse this to try to make your book more popular; misleading readers will cause them to leave in frustration.
{{completion status}}

==TODO list==
Sometimes it's very hard to figure out what should be added in one page rather than in another.  If you evaluate a page to an incomplete stage, you know what is missing.  So don't forget to fill a TODO list.  Add {{tlx|Todo|&lt;MISSING&gt;}} to the page, where &lt;code&gt;&lt;MISSING&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a text describing what should be added to make the page complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To deal with American business persons it is a good idea to understand something about American sports. Many businessmen were athletes in high school and college and have had their way of thinking formed by team sports.  It is important to know a little about the most popular sports: football (not soccer), basketball, baseball, golf, and even hockey in some areas.

Sports metaphors and jargon permeate even polite speech.  Below are some common expressions:a

* &quot;Run with it&quot; or &quot;Take the ball and run with it&quot;
* &quot;Homerun&quot;, &quot;That's a homerun&quot;, or &quot;Hit a homerun&quot;
* &quot;Punt&quot;, &quot;It's time to punt&quot;, &quot;I think we'll have to punt&quot;, or &quot;We punted&quot;
* &quot;Hole in one&quot; or &quot;You hit a hole in one&quot;
* &quot;Hail Mary&quot; or &quot;Throw a Hail Mary&quot;
* &quot;Slam dunk&quot; or &quot;It was a slam dunk&quot;

It is expected that conversational partners will understand these.  Only those speakers who reflect on the cultural derivation of these expressions will modify their speech for those who do not share similar cultural backgrounds.  However, the savvy listener can usually comprehend the meaning of these expressions when heard in context of a discussion.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: arabic → Arabic using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a virtual talk between two people. Imagine that there is a visitor called Mark coming from a forign country to visit his friend Ahmed. They are at the airport, and meeting for the first time. Mark has learnt Arabic (but not very well) and wants to talk to Ahmed in Arabic. This is what they say:
&lt;!-- His ''friend'' AND metting for the first time?? You can explain better ;-)
Could you also add a phonetic transcription of the conversation to plain english? It would also be convenient if it was right below each line of the conversation, ''Italicised'', for example  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Changed the 2nd sentence so that &quot; a country called&quot; is not there --&gt;
&lt;!-- Added transliteration, transliteration notes when a letter is capital it is usually written as a lower case with a dot under it when it is transliterated in Hans Wehr dictionary--&gt;

== Conversation with vowels indicated ==
'''Mark:''' &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مارْك: أَهْلاً'''&lt;/font&gt;

      <comment>[[Talk:Game Design and Programming]] moved to [[Talk:Video Game Design/Programming]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I would recommend that the title be changed to &quot;Game Engine Design and Programming&quot; since &quot;Game Design&quot; is a completely different topic more akin to level design, etc. [[User:Random|Random]]

Game Design AND Programming is entirely too much material to bite off in one 'book' unless it is going to be a broad survey.  There doesn't seem to be much activity going on here so if nobody objects I'll likely re-structure this considerably. [[User:Geared|Geared]] 23:44, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

Game Design AND Programming is indeed quite a task...perhaps this article should be either merged with &quot;Video Game Design&quot;, and then split into more sections, or there should be some discussion as to which level of abstraction each article should approach the subject matter on...Both articles contain sections on &quot;Input&quot;, which is quite specific, but (until a moment ago) neither contained a section on &quot;Level Design&quot;. Perhaps one article should cover the creative process, marketing, etc., while the other contain more technical specifics, such as program structure, hardware considerations, or commonly used algorithms. Either way, some level of collaboration seems necessary between these two articles. [[User:DarkPhoenix32|DarkPhoenix32]] 05:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

I believe as there is another book on Design, we should remove the &quot;design&quot; topic from this book entirely. This book should focus on the programming side, and implementing levels of ANY kind. Design is enough of a task for that separate book. If there are no objections, does anyone want to do the honors of renaming the book, or should I? (I'll do it if there aren't any objections in a week) Thanks, [[User:NinjaSkitch|NinjaSkitch]] ([[User talk:NinjaSkitch|talk]]) 06:17, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

Also, just a proposal to see who is for or against this idea, how many of you would want to turn this book into cross-platform game development? For two reasons: the first being that it's already been started (with C++ and OpenAL) and it would address programmers of every OS, and the second is, if this is going to be a reference for future programmers, wouldn't we as a community want to support openness and compatibility (OpenGL, OpenAL, SDL rather than *gasp* Windows-only C# and DirectX)? Let's get a little vote going, please add your sig. to the For or Against list to see how popular or unpopular this idea is:

Yes! (Cross-platform game programming)
# [[User:NinjaSkitch|NinjaSkitch]] ([[User talk:NinjaSkitch|talk]]) 06:35, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

No!



== Development stage review ==

Hi. I just reviewed your book about Game Design and Programming, see [[Help:Development stages]]. It is a promising start. I would suggest to convert the table of contents from a list of headings &lt;nowiki&gt;== title... ==&lt;/nowiki&gt; to a plain list, if you use those titles as links to other pages anyway. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 00:08, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Request for contributions ==

Hi, i'm busy trying to add some substance to this wikibook because I think it was off to a good start. If anyone has anything to contribute, be it tutorials, code snips, pictures, even laymans explanations of the various concepts, please do. I think this wikibook could be awesome!

--[[User:AfroToad|afroToad]] 14:13, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

: I'm definitely interested, and am going to contribute as much as I can. I think this is a great idea--there aren't many good places for potential game programmers to start, because most game source is kept secret. Also, I don't think there's any reason we can't give examples in multiple languages, maybe even UML. Since there is no one way to make a game though, this does pose another question: should this book focus on the design and structure of an ideal game engine? One that's abstracted to make any type of game? In my opinion, we have to go from a broad spectrum down to narrow modules: The main book could contain detailed descriptions of how a game engine works. Then for each module, Networking, Input, Cameras, etc, we could focus on different options, (Winsock and SDL_net, DirectX and OpenGL) along with examples in a couple different languages. [[User:NinjaSkitch|NinjaSkitch]] ([[User talk:NinjaSkitch|talk]]) 04:24, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

== Cleanup ==

Loads of cleanup needs to be done, and a lot more needs to be added. I'll try and contribute whenever I feel like.

--[[User:GatesPlusPlus|GatesPlusPlus]] 09:41, 1 January 2006 (UTC)
:Don't know know why I'm on this talk page (or every other talk page lol), but this is something I am very interested in. As a side note, has anyone here seen the article on [[Blender 3D]]? It is quite brilliant, in particular have a look at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Game Engine Basics]]

--Andy 12:25, 12 September 2007

I suggest just deleting this wikibook as there's basically nothing useful and there's lots of misinformation.

: I suggest giving it some time, because it has the potential to be a very good resource for beginner game developers. There aren't many free resources out there. I just happened to find it recently, and I'm presently adding content. If this one is deleted, one will simply start up again anyway, so there's [[meta:Deletionism|no point in getting rid of it just yet]]. Bear with us.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stores are places that sell things. People go to stores to buy things. There are many different types of stores. Each store sells different things. Some stores sell clothes, others sell electronic equipment, and still others sell food, or toys.

== Ways to pay ==
People use money to pay for things at stores. Cash is a type of money that is very easy to use. Cash includes paper bills and metal coins. In the United States, cash is also called legal tender and is issued by the US Treasury. Another common way to pay for things is with checks. Customers go to banks to open checking accounts, or bank accounts that have checks. Checks are pieces of paper that people give to stores instead of cash. Stores then take the checks to the banks. Then, the banks give the stores money from the bank accounts of their customers. The other main way that people pay for things is with credit cards. A credit card is a piece of plastic that some banks issue to their customers. Customers can use credit cards to buy things more quickly than with checks. 

== Kinds of stores ==
Most stores sell new things but some stores sell old or used items. The advantage of buying used things is that they are cheaper (that is, less expensive). In America, stores sell used books, used clothes, used cars and very old used furniture and other things. Very old used things are called antiques. 

Stores are usually physical places but are sometimes virtual places. Virtual stores are Internet sites where people can buy things. One of the most famous virtual stores is Amazon.com, a web site that sells books and many other things. 

When people go to a store to buy things they say that they are going shopping. When people look for things at a store it is called browsing or window shopping. Sometimes Americans do this as a pleasure activity or to relax. Because of this, people sometimes criticize Americans as being materialistic. 

The part of a store where customers pay is called the check-out counter or check-out aisle. There, a clerk helps ring up the products to register their prices. To do this, the clerk uses a cash register. If the cash register is computerized, the clerk uses a scanner to ring up the prices. Paying at the register is also called checking out. Sometimes lines of people at the register are long. When this happens, it takes a lot of time to pay and customers have to wait for several minutes. This can be stressful. 

People go to expensive stores to buy luxury items. This makes them feel good. Nice stores like this are often at malls or shopping centers. Rich Americans buy many luxury items, and so do many lower-income Americans, too. The United States is a consumer society, where people use the money that they make to buy more and more consumer products.

== &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; - Flexible Archiving Tool ==

In general, &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt; is the preferred method for creating archives,
but in some cases a particular archive format may be desired and
&lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; provides a greater degree of control over how the archive is
generated at the cost of greater complexity.

==== Creating a &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; archive ====

To create a &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; archive, the &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; option is provided (think 'o' for &quot;The archive is being written &lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;ut&quot;).  &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; expects a list of files to be provided to its standard input.  The list of files is usually provided by piping results from the find command.  The &lt;code&gt;-H&lt;/code&gt; option can be used to specify the archive format, see the [http://www.sunsite.ualberta.ca/Documentation/Gnu/cpio-2.4.2/man/cpio.1.html man page] for more information.

==== Listing contents of an archive with &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; ====

To view the contents of an archive the &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option is provided
to tell &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; to expect the archive data on its standard input.
The &lt;code&gt;-t&lt;/code&gt; option is also used then to tell cpio to not extract, but
rather simply list the contents of the archive.

==== Extracting an archive with &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; ====

The &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option is used with a combination of options to tell
it how to extract.  Common choices include &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; to tell cpio to
create directories as needed.  &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; to reset file modification
times.  &lt;code&gt;-R&lt;/code&gt; to change file ownership.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Finding files with dangerous permissions ==

==== Files that are writable by &quot;other&quot; ====

If we search just based on permission, we'll get false hits from things like symbolic
links.

 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;find . -perm +002 -ls&lt;/strong&gt;
   4095    0 lrwxrwxrwx   1 user     user           22 Jan  4 08:30 ./rh033 -&amp;gt; rh033-RHEL3-1-20031103
  10209    0 lrwxrwxrwx   1 user     user           18 Jan  4 09:28 ./.mozilla/default/bgdnw5up.slt/lock -&amp;gt; 192.168.0.254:3311
  63259    1 -rw-rw-rw-   1 user     user            6 Jan  5 11:58 ./playground/real-problem

Instead look for files with other write enabled that are regular files.&lt;/p&gt;

 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;find . -perm +002 -type f -ls&lt;/strong&gt;
  63259    1 -rw-rw-rw-   1 user     user            6 Jan  5 11:58 ./playground/real-problem

==== Directories that are writable by &quot;other&quot; ====

When searching for directories that are writeable by other, one should also consider whether the &quot;sticky bit&quot; is set for the directory.  In octal, the sticky bit is represented as a 1 in the first position in four digit octal representation (ex: 1777).  This is a common setting for temporary directories and is not normally considered a security risk.

World writable temporary directories:

 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;find / -perm -1002 -type d -ls 2&amp;gt;/dev/null&lt;/strong&gt;
    493    0 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root           40 Jan  4 09:25 /dev/shm
      2    4 drwxrwxrwt  11 root     root         4096 Jan  5 11:42 /tmp
  58497    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 xfs      xfs          4096 Jan  4 09:26 /tmp/.font-unix
  29250    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     user         4096 Jan  4 09:27 /tmp/.X11-unix
  14625    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 user     user         4096 Jan  4 09:27 /tmp/.ICE-unix
  29252    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 user     user         4096 Jan  4 09:28 /tmp/.esd
 665189    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         4096 Jan  3 07:51 /var/lib/texmf
  97345    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         4096 Jan  4 14:00 /var/tmp
 178466    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         4096 Aug 11  2003 /var/spool/vbox
 762533    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         4096 Sep 25  2003 /var/spool/samba

Finding the real problem directories:

[user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;find / -perm -002 -not -perm -1000 -type d -ls 2&amp;gt;/dev/null&lt;/strong&gt;
  46931    1 drwxrwxrwx   2 user     user         1024 Jan  5 12:06 /home/kupferer/bad-permissions

==== SUID and SGID executables ====

SUID and SGID executables can present serious security concerns since they allow users to execute programs with permissions of another user.  For this reason they should be closely monitored.  SUID is represented as 4 in the first position and SGID, by a 2.

== &lt;code&gt;md5sum&lt;/code&gt; ==

The &lt;code&gt;md5sum&lt;/code&gt; command produces a checksum for a file that can be used later to check whether the file's contents have changed.

 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;echo &quot;some content&quot; &amp;gt;a_file&lt;/strong&gt;
 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;md5sum a_file&lt;/strong&gt;
 eb9c2bf0eb63f3a7bc0ea37ef18aeba5  a_file
 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;echo &quot;Some content&quot; &amp;gt;a_file&lt;/strong&gt;
 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;md5sum a_file&lt;/strong&gt;
 581ab2d89f05c294d4fe69c623bdef83  a_file

This is often used when downloading files from possibly untrustworthy mirrors.  So long as a trusted checksum can be obtained, it can be used to verify that the data wasn't corrupted whether accidentally or maliciously.  Often checksum files are distributed with downloads or kept on secure media to check systems for possible data corruption or intrusion.  To create an MD5 checksum file, simply redirect the &lt;code&gt;md5sum&lt;/code&gt; output to a file.  &lt;code&gt;md5sum -c&lt;/code&gt; can then be used to run the check later.

 [user@station playground]$ &lt;strong&gt;for I in $(seq 1 6)&lt;/strong&gt;
 &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;do echo &quot;Content for file-$I&quot; &amp;gt;file-$I&lt;/strong&gt;
 &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;done&lt;/strong&gt;
 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;ls&lt;/strong&gt;
 file-1  file-2  file-3  file-4  file-5  file-6
 [user@station playground]$ &lt;strong&gt;md5sum * &amp;gt;files.md5&lt;/strong&gt;
 [user@station playground]$ &lt;strong&gt;cat files.md5&lt;/strong&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the Mechanics 3 module of the [[A-level Mathematics]] book. This module assumes that you are familiar with the [[../C1/]], [[../C2/]], [[../C3/]], [[../C4/]], [[../M1/]] and [[../M2/]] modules. Please post all questions to [[A-level Mathematics/Discussion]].

== Contents ==
# [[/Elastic Strings and Springs/]]{{stage short|75%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Impulse and Momentum/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Circular Motion/]]{{stage short|75%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Kinematics/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/SHM|Simple Harmonic Motion]]{{stage short|100%|Dec 14, 2005}}

==Formulae==
By the end of this module you will be expected to have learnt the following formulae:

===Kinematics===
* &lt;math&gt; a = v\frac{dv}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

===Simple Harmonic Motion===
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x} = -\omega ^2x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;v^2 = \omega ^2(a^2-x^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x = a \sin (\omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x = a \cos (\omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt; or, generally, &lt;math&gt;x = a \cos (\omega t + \epsilon)\,&lt;/math&gt;
===Elastic Springs and Strings===
* Hooke's Law: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac{\lambda x}{l} &lt;/math&gt;
* Elastic potential energy: &lt;math&gt; E_p = \frac{\lambda x^2}{2l} &lt;/math&gt;
===Small-angle Approximations===
* &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta \approx \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2}\theta ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \tan \theta \approx \theta &lt;/math&gt;
only applies when &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is in radians

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your book is nicely evolving. I just reviewed your book to give it a new [[Help:Development stages|development stage]], and I suggest the following improvement: Your Reference/Definitions could be converted into a table. Wiki supports [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:How_to_use_tables#Yet_another_example_.28MediaWiki_table_code.29 tables] like this following example:
{|
! Acronym
! Definition
|-
| AAX
| Advanced Assembly Extension
|-
|APX
|Assembly Performance Extension
|-
|ARX
|Advanced Rendering Extension
|-
|ASX
|Advanced Surfacing Extension
|}
This might improve the visual appearance of your nice book. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:41, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I can do this quite easily in [http://www.vim.org Vim] but I'm concerned about the source of the material.  It appears to be copied directly out of some formatted document, which could possibly have been copyrighted.  There's no indication from the person who added this (Iturner2) whether this material is free to be used.  It will be difficult to write our own version of the definitions reference but legally we may have no choice.  [[User:Praetis|Praetis]] 14:00, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

== Version stuff? ==

Pro/Engineer changed drastically between 2001 and Wildfire, and less so between Wildfire and Wildfire 2.0.  I propose that this WikiBook be written, if possible, to keep pace mainly with the latest version.  If someone has the time or inclination later to add &quot;menu mapper&quot; information or other details of earlier versions, such as might be useful to those upgrading from earlier versions or working on legacy systems, that can have its own section. 

It looks as though this book has been inactive for awhile now.  If anyone is interested in helping me pursue it, please drop me a note on my talk page.  I'm a Wiktionarian first, so I don't know yet how much time I'll devote to this project.--[[User:Dvortygirl|Dvortygirl]] 07:08, 23 October 2005 (UTC)


Um... this is pretty much the dumbest, most useless endeavor I've ever seen anyone attempt. The software changes too quickly and no normal human (or TEAM of them) could keep pace without massive support. Even WITH massive support, Pro/E &quot;experts&quot; abound but few of them *really* know what the heck they're doing. PTC's textbooks are nothing to write home about- but this massive piece of software just does not lend itself to an E-book written by the web community. While I probably owe the guy a kick in the family jewels, Steve Smith's textbooks are probably the best resource for Pro/E knowledge. Spend your money there and save your time for something more worthwhile. And if you happen to SEE ol' Steve, do me a favor and try to get in one good kick for me. Trust me, he deserves it.</text>

      <comment>Consider changing the title</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I just reviewed your book for [[Help:Development stages|development stages]]. I think, your tips are well written, but the book`s title (&quot;WordPerfect&quot;) is too general. Please consider renaming the book or moving your content to a new book called e.g. &quot;Tips for WordPerfect&quot; or &quot;Tips to tweak the Classic Mode to resemble more to WordPerfect 5.1 DOS&quot;. You might then get a higher development stage. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:58, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Frames allow a section of the webpage to be constantly visible in a column or section, by having multiple pages shown in separate subwindows.  Usage of frames has been deprecated in HTML 4.0, and may only be used in Transitional or Frameset mode.  Frames have been replaced by a combination of Cascading Style Sheets and AJAX scripting, as they keep a more suitable method of keeping or updating content on the screen.  

== Framing ==

Frames must begin with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;frameset&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, and end with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/frameset&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.  The frameset has optional parameters to determine the number of rows and columns along with their sizes (e.g. &lt;code&gt;rows=&quot;2&lt;/code&gt;). A frameset tag may be nested within another tag, to allow complex frame layouts.

Within a frameset element, you can either specify a new frameset, or add the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;frame&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; element.  The frame element as the attributes &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; to specify the location of the document, and the name used for interconnection with other links. 

Since some web browsers cannot display frames you must specify alternate content for these browsers in a &lt;code&gt;noframes&lt;/code&gt; element within the &lt;code&gt;frameset&lt;/code&gt;.

== Inline frames ==

An inline frame begin with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, and end with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.  As with the frame element, you can apply the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attributes

      <text xml:space="preserve">When studying Japanese, it can help greatly to know the terminology or jargon used. These may include different parts of speech, grammar structures, names of particles, etc. This is not an explanation of those forms, but a simple list of what they are called. Beginning students may not want to bother with these until they have completed the first lesson, although there may be some useful terms here.

== Sindhi cuisine ==

There were some recipes on the Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhi_food Sindhi food]. The article's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Sindhi_food AfD] determined that the recipes should be transwikied here. I've put them on a subpage [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fang_Aili/sindi_food_temp here], and anyone interested can copy them from there and place them appropriately at Wikibooks Cookbook. I'd appreciate help from someone who knows what they're doing here. Thanks! --[[User:Fang Aili|Fang Aili]] 23:28, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

== Brief tutorial on spice preparation needed ==

Cooks from other cultures often fall down on spice preparation: roasting, frying, grinding, etc.  A tutorial on this subject would be extremely helpful!
:I could take a stab at some of this, but am not sure where to link it into the main page.  Any suggestions? [[User:AndyCunningham|AndyCunningham]] 10:42, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

== Cusines from East India ==

The section talks about cuisines from most parts of India. However the cusines from east part of the country have not been discussed. Hope someone does some contributions to this.

== Biryani - Sub topic- Non veg section need to be sub divided ==

Hi everyone,&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to have a discussion on subdividing the Non veg section. There is a biryani link which is given an additional title &quot;Rice based dish also&quot; this does not seem to be legible. Either we can have a separate section for biryani by re arranging the entire page or we can sub divide the Non veg dish section to subsections like e.g. Biryani, Curry e.t.c. Please share your views &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most robots have an electronic &quot;brain&quot; (part that uses sensor input to determine actuator output). This can be either a simple electronic circuit, a µcontroller or a PC. This is not the only way to build a robot &quot;brain&quot;.

== Mechanical Robot Brains ==
One of the first robots was designed by Da Vinci, this was a small vehicle powered by wind-up springs and it was &quot;programed&quot; by changing gears.
Although possible this kind of robot brains are very hard to design and build.

== Pneumatic Robot Brains ==
If you need to automate some part of a plant where explosive gases are used it might be too dangerous to use electronic circuits. Instead pneumatic circuits are used. It's possible to construct logical circuits, timers, sequences,... using pneumatic valves and cylinders. 
You can find a lot of pneumatic valves for automation here: www.ngtvalves.com

 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;as suas&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Gender==
The gender in these words is of the object possessed, not the possesor (as in English). 
For example
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''Ele vai para a sua casa''' - He goes to his house.

''Even though 'ele' is masculine, we use the feminine 'a sua' because 'casa' is feminine.''
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Confusion==
Unfortunately, confusion can arise with the forms '''seu''', '''sua''', '''seus''' and '''suas'''. This is because they can mean ''his'', ''her'', ''your'' and ''their''. We therefore use the following forms frequently.

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 228px;&quot;
 border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
 width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c8d7f0&quot;
 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;a casa '''dele'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e6e9f0&quot;
 width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;his house&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c8d7f0&quot;
 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;a casa '''dela'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e6e9f0&quot;
 width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;her house&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c8d7f0&quot;
 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;a casa '''deles'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e6e9f0&quot;
 width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;their (m) house&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c8d7f0&quot;
 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;a casa '''delas''' &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e6e9f0&quot;
 width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;their (f) house&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

'''Note: The gender of these words refers, unlike the words above, to the possesor, not the object(s) possessed'''.

*ASCO and NCCN recommend maintaining Hb near 12 g/dL.  Should initiate therapy when Hb drops to 11 or lower. 
*However, randomized data from H&amp;N, breast, and NSCLC show adverse outcomes in patients undergoing therapy with Epo support
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/General#Hypoxia|H&amp;N Epo data]]
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Advanced_breast|Breast Epo data]]
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Lung/NSCLC/Palliation#Anemia|NSCLC Epo data]]
*A general randomized trial enrolling patients with Hb &lt;11 showed no improved in transfusion requirements, and significantly worse survival with darbepoetin alfa


==Darbepoetin Alfa ([http://www.aranesp.com/ Aranesp])==
*FDA recommended doses
*:Starting dose: 2.25 mcg/kg SC injection qweek
*:May increase to 4.5 mcg/kg if less than 1g/dL increase in Hb over 2 weeks
*Other doses
*:3 mcg/kg q2week
*:200 mcg q2week
*:300 mcg q3week


*'''Multi-National''' (Europe, North America, Australia)(2004-2006)
**Randomized. 989 patients. Non-myeloid malignancies (NSCL 18%, breast 13%), anemia Hgb &lt;11 (mean 9.5), not receiving chemo or RT. Arm 1) placebo vs. Arm 2) darbepoetin alfa 6.75 ug/kg q4w x 16 weeks
**'''2008''' PMID 18227526 -- &quot;Darbepoetin Alfa for the Treatment of Anemia in Patients With Active Cancer Not Receiving Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy: Results of a Phase III, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.&quot; (Smith RE Jr, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 28 [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: Transfusions week 5-17 similar. Median OS DA 8.5 months vs. placebo 10.8 months (SS)
***Toxicity: more cardiovascular, thromboembolic events, more deaths
***Conclusion: Darbepoetin no impact on transfusions, worse survival


==IV Iron==
*'''Italy''' (2004-2006) -- darbepoetin +/- IV iron
**'''2008''' PMID 18375891 -- &quot;Randomized trial of intravenous iron supplementation in patients with chemotherapy-related anemia without iron deficiency treated with darbepoetin alpha.&quot; (Pedrazzoli P, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Apr 1;26(10):1619-25.)
**Randomized. 149 patients with lung, GYN, BCA, and CRC; Hb &lt;=11 g/L and no iron deficiency. Treated with darbepoetin and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) IV iron (sodium ferric gluconate) 125mg IV Q1W x6 weeks
***Outcome: Hb response EPO 62% vs. EPO + Iron 77% (SS)
***Toxicity: Comparable
***Conclusion: IV supplementation reduces treatment failures to darbepoetin

*'''European Multi-Institutional''' -- darbepoetin +/- IV iron
**Randomized. 396 patients with non-myeloid malignancies, Hb &lt;11 g/dL. Treated with darboepoetin and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) IV iron Q3W x 4 months
**'''2008''' PMID 18375890 -- &quot;Randomized, multicenter, controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alpha administered every 3 weeks with or without intravenous iron in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia.&quot; (Bastit L, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Apr 1;26(10):1611-8.)
***Outcome: % achieving Hb &gt;=12 EPO 73% vs. EPO + Iron 86% (SS); also fewer transfusions  20% vs. 9% (SS)
***Toxicity: No difference in adverse events; iron-related were GI
***Conclusion: Addition of IV iron to darbepoetin improved Hb control and decreased number of transfusions

*'''Sundsvall''' (2003-2005) -- EPO +/- IV iron
**Randomized. 67 patients, lymphoproliferative malignancy, Hb 9-11 g/dL. Treated with epoetin 30,000 IU Q1W and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) IV iron 100 mg QW
**'''2007''' PMID 17252006 -- &quot;Addition of intravenous iron to epoetin beta increases hemoglobin response and decreases epoetin dose requirement in anemic patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies: a randomized multicenter study.&quot; (Hedenus M, Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):627-32. Epub 2007 Jan 25.)
***Outcome: Hb response EPO 53% vs. EPO + IV iron 93%; mean weekly EPO dose lower &gt;25% in IV iron group by week 15 (p=0.05)
***Conclusion: Hb reponse significantly improved with IV iron

*'''Karnell Cancer Center''' -- epoetin +/- oral iron or IV iron
**'''2007''' PMID 17296819 -- &quot;Intravenous ferric gluconate significantly improves response to epoetin alfa versus oral iron or no iron in anemic patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy.&quot; (Henry DH, Oncologist. 2007 Feb;12(2):231-42.)
**Randomized. 129 patients, Hb &lt;11 g/d, ferritin &gt;= 100 ng/ml, transferring &gt;=15%. Treated with epoetin 40,000 U and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2)oral ferrous sulfacte 325 mg TID vs. Arm 3) IV ferric gluconate 125 mg IV Q1W  
***Outcome: Hb response EPO 41% vs. EPO + oral iron 46% vs. EPO + IV iron 73% (SS)
***Toxicity: Well tolerated
***Conclusion: IV iron in addition to epoetin produces significantly greater Hb response

*'''Averbach Hematology-Oncology''' -- rHuEPO +/- oral iron or IV iron
**Randomized. 157 patients, Hb &lt;=10.5 g/dL or ferritin &lt;=450 pmol/L or transferring &lt;=19%. Treated with rHuEPO 40,000 U QW and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) oral iron 325 mg BID vs. Arm 3) IV iron (iron dextran) 100 mg bolus vs. Arm 4) IV iron (iron dextran) 100 mg infusion
**'''2004''' PMID 15051778 -- &quot;Intravenous iron optimizes the response to recombinant human erythropoietin in cancer patients with chemotherapy-related anemia: a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial.&quot; (Auerbach M, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Apr 1;22(7):1301-7.)
***Outcome: Hematopoietic response EPO 25% vs. EPO + oral iron 36% vs. EPO + IV iron 68% (both groups). IV iron groups had improved energy, activity and QoL, oral iron group no difference, and no iron worsening
***Conclusion: IV iron improves effect of EPO</text>

An '''oven''' is a closed compartment for [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] and [[Cookbook:Broiling|broiling]]. Usually a [[Cookbook:Cooktop|cooktop]] is attached to the top.

==Gas==
Some ovens are heated by burning gas. Water is a byproduct of the burning of gas, and this creates a humid environment inside the oven. While this reduces the need to cover foods to prevent drying, it also prevents drying when drying is desired. Gas ovens generally provide poor support for broiling. Gas fuel is cheaper than electricity in some areas, and gas ovens often come with the generally desirable gas cooktops.

[[Image:Parsley Flat.jpg|right|thumb|Flat leaf parsley]]
[[Image:Parsley Curled.jpg|right|thumb|Curly leaf parsley]]

'''Parsley''' is a bright green, biennial herb that is very common in Middle Eastern, European, and American cooking. Its value as a breath-freshener, and much of its taste, come from its high concentration of chlorophyll. It is also high in [[Cookbook:Vitamins|vitamin]] C.

Two forms of parsley are used as herbs: curly leaf and Italian or flat leaf. Curly leaf parsley is often used as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]]. Many people think flat leaf parsley has a stronger flavor, and it is sometimes used as a substitute for [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]]. Its flat leaves are less springy than those of curly leaf parsley, and hence it is easier to chop. Another type of parsley, Hamburg parsley, is grown for its edible root, similar in appearance to a [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnip]].

== Basics ==

==== Handling Arguments ====

This program will display all arguments:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 for ARG; do
     echo &quot;had arg: $ARG&quot;
 done
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example Functions ==

==== Launch Apps and Set Niceness ====
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 showdates () {
      cal
      date
      ddate
 }
 
 donice () {
     COMMAND=$1
     NICEVAL=$(grep &quot;^$COMMAND&quot; ~/.nice-settings | cut -d: -f2)
     if test -n &quot;$NICEVAL&quot;
     then
         nice -n &quot;$NICEVAL&quot; $*
     else
         nice $*
     fi
 }
 
 grpshare () {
     if [ $1 = '-g' ]; then
         SET_GROUP=$2
         shift; shift
     else
         SET_GROUP=users
     fi
 
     for FILE; do
         chgrp $SET_GROUP -R $FILE
         chmod g+rw -R $FILE
     done
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example Scripts ==

==== Setting Environment Variable ====
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 
 for PROFILE in $(find /home/ -name .bash_profile)
 do
     if egrep -q '^(export[[:space:]]+)?EDITOR' $PROFILE
     then
        # User already set an editor, override that
        sed -i.orig -r 's/^(export[[:space:]]+)?EDITOR=.*/export EDITOR=nano/' $PROFILE
     else
         # No previous editor was set
         echo &quot;export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano&quot; &gt;&gt;$PROFILE
     fi
 done
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Setting Aliases ====

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 
 for BASHRC in $(find /home/ -name .bashrc)
 do
     for ALIAS in &quot;alias rm='rm -i'&quot; &quot;alias cp='cp -i'&quot; &quot;alias mv='mv -i'&quot;
     do
         ALIAS_CMD=$(echo $ALIAS | cut -d= -f1)
         if ! egrep -q &quot;^$ALIAS_CMD&quot; $BASHRC
         then
             echo $ALIAS &gt;&gt;$BASHRC
         fi
     done
 done
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Checking MD5s for SUID and SGID Executables ====

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 # /root/bin or /usr/local/bin would be a good place for this script
 # Probably need to run this as root, otherwise many errors will show up about
 # permission problems with reading these files.
 NOTIFY_EMAIL=user@station.example.com
 
 # Assume (for now) that we already have a /etc/suid.md5 to compare new file to
 find / -type f -perm +6000 -exec md5sum {} \; &gt;/etc/suid.md5.new
 
 if diff /etc/suid.md5 /etc/suid.md5.new &amp;&gt;/tmp/suid-check-diff.out
 then
     echo &quot;No SUIDs have changed&quot;
 else
     if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;interactive&quot; ]
     then
         cat /tmp/suid-check-diff.out
         echo &quot;Check FAILED!  SUID executable(s) have changed!&quot;
         read -p &quot;Is this okay? (yes/no) &quot; RESPONSE
         if [ &quot;$RESPONSE&quot; = &quot;yes&quot; ]
         then
             mv /etc/suid.md5.new /etc/suid.md5
         fi
     else
         echo &quot;Check FAILED!  SUID executable(s) have changed!&quot; | mail -s &quot;SUID Change&quot; $NOTIFY_EMAIL
     fi
 fi
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Checking URLs for New Content ====

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 
 URL_FILE=$HOME/.content-check-urls
 URL_DIR=$HOME/.content-check
 
 if ! [ -d $URL_DIR ]; then
     mkdir $URL_DIR
 fi
 
 if ! [ -f $URL_FILE ]; then
     echo &quot;new-content-check: $URL_FILE not found&quot;
     exit 1
 fi
 
 for URL in $(cat $URL_FILE); do
     MD5_FILE=$URL_DIR/$(echo $URL | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
 
     if [ -f $MD5_FILE ]; then
         # Looks like we´ve got an old version of this data, gotta check it
         links -dump &quot;$URL&quot; | md5sum &gt; $MD5_FILE.new
         if ! diff $MD5_FILE $MD5_FILE.new &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then
             echo &quot;New content at $URL&quot;
             mv -f $MD5_FILE.new $MD5_FILE
         else
             rm $MD5_FILE.new
         fi
     else
         # No old version, just store the new sum
         links -dump &quot;$URL&quot; | md5sum &gt; $MD5_FILE
     fi
 done
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Connecting via ssh using keys ====

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 SUCCESS=0
 WRONG_ARGS=65

A partition is a place on disk which contains 


at the fdisk prompt:
n - create a new partition
e - create an extended partition 
p - will print the table

==== Block Devices ====


==== Overview of Partitions ====
Using Radified's [[http://partition.radified.com]] analogy, a partition is
like

==== Creating a partition ====

===== Using the fdisk utility =====
&quot;fdisk -l&quot; ---&gt; listed
fdisk -l

===== the Mkfs Command =====
mkfs, then hit the tab key twice gives you a list
mkfs -t * which equals mkfs.*

so mkfs.reiserfs equals mkfs -t reiserfs

VFAT filesystem - tends to be used for usb
mkfs -b ----&gt; 
mkfs -t
every partition has 

4k is what you want -&gt; optimized for speed rat
mkfs -f [fragment size]
fdisk -&gt; enters the interactive prompt
w - write
n - new
m - manual
+100m - creates a partition
q - quit
the command &quot;q&quot; will quit fdisk.
if you exit with &quot;q&quot; rather than &quot;w&quot;

1000 bytes is kb
1024 bytes is a kib &quot;kibibytes&quot;

running the command &quot;cat /proc/partitions&quot;
looking at the file /proc/partitions will tell you what block devices the kernel knows about
partprobe - speaks to a higher level of the kernel

it is a good idea to check with &quot;partprobe&quot; if the kernel agrees with our partitions

==== Sysfs filesystem vs. Proc filesystem ====


==== Inodes ====
Metadata is stored in the inode

we have goto our filesystem formatted 

ctime - when was the inode created
mtime - when was the inode last modified

ext2 had to make sure it assigns them to the correct filesystem -
tune2fs -l /dev/xvda1

dumpe2fs /dev/xvda1
holding

====== Mounting the file system =====

if something is to show up on the desktop, then it will show up as mnt

if we &quot;touch /home/share/unmounted&quot;

the command to mount the 

every directory has an inode for the current directory ( in the . entry)

dump e2fs will tell us if

==== ext2 and ext3 ====
ext3 is the ext2 filesystem with journaling added.  Journaling keeps track of what will be written to the disk prior to the write operation beginning.  When the write is done, it is noted in the journal.  If the system crashes during a write, it can recover the operation when it comes back up.  This prevents incomplete writes from occurring on the disk and eliminates the need to do a filesystem check after a system crash.

==== jfs ====
JFS is a high a performance filesystem made by IBM and ported to Linux in 2001. It uses B+ trees,extents, and a journal to guarantee the consistency of the file system in the event of a crash.

==== /etc/fstab ====

== AutoFS - Automounting ==

AutoFS allows the system to automatically mount devices and network shares as they are requested and even unmount them again when no longer in use.  The main configuration for the automounter is &lt;code&gt;/etc/auto.master&lt;/code&gt;.  Initially, this file will only contain comments, including examples for a &lt;code&gt;/etc/auto.misc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/auto.net&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Mint''' refers to the leaves of a perennial herb, typically [[Cookbook:Peppermint|peppermint]] (''Mentha piperita'') or [[Cookbook:Spearmint|spearmint]] (''Mentha spicata''), used for flavoring in [[Cookbook:Candy|candy]], [[Cookbook:Tea|teas]], and some dishes. An extract is produced for uses where the leaves would be inconvenient.

Mint is also regarded as a good accompaniment to roast [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], especially in the form of [[Cookbook:Mint sauce|mint sauce]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Portuguese|Number and Gender|Practise Definite and Indefinite Articles}}

In English, we use definite and indefinite articles all the time. They are the words 'the', 'a' and 'an'.
In Portuguese there are articles as well, but the actual system is quite more complicated.

As you can learn from the [[Portuguese/Contents/Number and Gender|Number and Gender section]], Portuguese makes use of two features known as Number and Gender. What this means is that a noun is either ''singular'' or ''plural'' and at the same time it is either ''masculine'' or ''feminine''. In Portugese, articles and nouns must agree; that is to say that the article and the noun must have both the same number and the same gender. So when there is a feminine noun, you use a feminine article; when the noun is plural, you have to use a plural article as well. Let's have a look at these articles.

==Definite Articles==
The '''definite articles''' are used when one is referring exactly to one particular object or collection of objects. The following table resumes the four Portuguese definite articles. In English, the definite article is ''the''.

{| width=240 border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background:#A5ADFA; border:#5061F5; border-collapse: collapse&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''Table I''' - Definite articles
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! width=&quot;80&quot; | Singular
! width=&quot;80&quot; | Plural
|-
! Masculine
| align=&quot;center&quot; | o
| align=&quot;center&quot; | os
|-
! Feminine
| align=&quot;center&quot; | a
| align=&quot;center&quot; | as
|}

So, to say ''the house'', we first need to look at the word &quot;casa&quot;, ''house''. It is feminine (see [[Portuguese:Number and Gender#Tips for Identifying Word Gender|Tips for Identifying Word Gender]] for tips on how to recognize word gender). Since there is only one house, we look for the feminine singular. It is ''a'', so we say &quot;a casa&quot;, ''the house''.

==Indefinite Articles==
We now need to look at the indefinite articles. They are used when the noun refers to something of one kind, but the particular instance isn't important. In English, the indefinite article is ''a'' or ''an''.

{| width=240 border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background:#A5ADFA; border:#5061F5; border-collapse: collapse&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''Table I''' - Indefinite articles
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! width=&quot;80&quot; | Singular
! width=&quot;80&quot; | Plural
|-
! Masculine
| align=&quot;center&quot; | um
| align=&quot;center&quot; | uns
|-
! Feminine
| align=&quot;center&quot; | uma
| align=&quot;center&quot; | umas
|}

Again, if we want to say ''a house'', we are looking for the feminine singular indefinite article, which is ''uma''. Therefore, we say &quot;uma casa&quot;, ''a house''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Common Prepositions and Contractions==

Prepositions are words that describe location, for instance, 'at', 'of' etc.

However, unlike in English, some of these &quot;contract&quot;. That means they join other words to form new words, not always in a facilitative way.
Here are the prepositions, with the contractions with definite and indefinite articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Future Tense ==
In portuguese you can use the future tense by saying 'I am going to' or 'I will,' by adding an ending. Ir + infinitive is the first way, and see below for the other way with all the verb endings required.

==Using ''ir''==
In Portuguese, we often use the construction &quot;going to&quot;.

&lt;big&gt;'''ir''' + '''infinitive'''&lt;/big&gt;

You conjugate &quot;ir&quot; as normal, and then add the verb in the infinitive form.

For example, the verb &quot;andar&quot; (to walk):

Eu '''vou''' andar

Você/Ele/Ela '''vai''' andar

Nós '''vamos''' andar

Eles/Elas/Vocês '''vão''' andar

==Simple Future==
It is still possible, but slightly formal, to say &quot;I will eat&quot; or &quot;I will swim&quot;. This is the simple future tense.
This tense is one of the easiest to form in Portuguese. Just conjugate as below.

'''FALAR - To Speak'''

&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ão&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

''EXCEPTIONS'' - '''Trazer''', '''dizer''', '''fazer'''. [[Portuguese/Future tense irregular verbs|See how to conjugate these in the future tense]]

Note that this contruction works even if the verb is usually irregular. Ser, ter and ir, for example, can all be made into the future this way.

==Splitting of Stem and Ending==
When using indirect and direct object pronouns, the future stem and ending must be split. The stem is (except for the irregular verbs mentioned above) simply the infinitive. The indirect or direct object pronoun goes between the stem and the ending, as in these examples:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''Eu falar-lhe-ei''' - I will speak to him/her/you

'''Você beijar-me-á''' - You will kiss me.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

However, this construction is rare in spoken Portuguese. When an object pronoun is used, we usually use ''ir'' and the infinitive (see above).

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''Eu vou falar-lhe''' - I am going to speak to him/her/you.

'''Você vai beijar-me''' - You are going to kiss me.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi! I just reviewed your book, updating your [[Wikibooks:Development stages|development stages]] {{stage short|50%|Jan 12, 2005}}. Wow! This took some time, cause it is really a BIG book with many many sub-chapters! I was impressed by the quality and clear style of writing. Keep up the work, and concentrate on the 75% chapters: I think many of them can be 100% by just finishing up the pages or including those examples that have been announced, but obviously forgotten... (See [[Help:Development stages]] for how to use this template, and if you read this, help by reviewing another book and spreading the word! Thanks!) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:30, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)


I'll work on this again in the fall when I'm in the mood for organic again --[[User:Ghostal|Ghostal]] 23:00 EST, Apr 11, 2005

== In module Ketones and aldehydes ==
I suggest that the topic &quot;Preparing Aldehydes and Ketones&quot; should have subtopics of &quot;Preparing Aldehydes&quot; and &quot;Preparing Ketones&quot;. Not all of the preparation methods can be used in both instances. It would help with clarity. [[User:Glich|Glich]] ([[User talk:Glich|talk]])

==New icons==
I have uploaded to the Commons two pictographs that I made:
[[Image:OrgChem_Nomen_pictograph.png]], [[Image:3 flasks pictograph.png]]. They are both public domain. [[User:Ramir|Ramir]] 13:19, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

== Official Headers / Footers ==

Hello all!  This is an amazing book so far, and I look forward to editing it.  I'm curious which pages include the 'official' Header and Footer (including the little ethane icon).  I'd be happy to standardize as many as I can, but I need to know which you prefer for the standard.

Cheers! [[User:Buxtor|Buxtor]] 22:44, 2 June 2005 (UTC)

== Standard Structure Format? ==

Hey All! There's really quite an impressive array of work here. I'm concerned, though, that there's no nice standard way to display chemical structures. While we don't have the same engine as the math guys do for displaying sturucture like they do equations, we can still try and settle on one program and settings for making structures, no? I'd recommend Chemdraw, ACS template with the bold width 2.5 and line width 1.5. --[[User:Lineweaver|Lineweaver]] 08:46, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

Great work you are doing here. However I must suggest you have a look at the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].

:Indeed, I shall berenaming all pages in this book so that they start with &quot;Organic Chemistry/&quot;. This will make this book consistent with most other wikibooks, plus allow for easier navigation. I trust this change will be non-controversial (especially as it is being done in a way that preserves all links), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:41, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Print Version of this Wikibook ==

If you look at [[Organic Chemistry/Print Version]], I've put together a compilation of most of the pages for this Wikibook.  I have excluded pages that have not been created yet (so if you add new pages, it might be good to put them here), and I'm still working on the appendix sections.

Feel free to edit and work on this print version, but it is looking pretty nice at the moment.  Don't worry about keeping the content up to date, as if you work on adding just content to the existing parts of this Wikibook it will also be updated in the print version automatically.  This is done through the transclusion process.  Some minor reorganization may have to be done with the various sections, and there is some duplication of a few items that still needs to be dealt with.

Anyway, have fun with this content.  BTW, I'm preparing to make a PDF version of the print version, but it would also be nice to clean up the content before we make this &quot;official&quot;.  There are far too many red linked images, and I'm not sure exactly what happened here to make them red links.  I can't find any history of those images from the deletion log.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:49, 13 March 2006 (UTC)


==A page move==
I've started doing work on the [[Organic_Chemistry/Introduction_to_reactions/Substitution_reactions|Substitution Reactions]] page, but I'd like to rename the page, '''Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions''' because it's a little more accurate as well as being more descriptive. I assume this is done simply by &quot;moving&quot; the page. Being new at this, however, I'm reluctant to make such a change without someone saying &quot;go ahead and do it.&quot; I read the noob stuff and it said, &quot;be bold&quot;, but I'm drawing the line at moving a page, for the moment.
--[[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 15:25, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

==Duplication==
The [[Organic Chemistry/Haloalkanes|Haloalkanes]] page has a short section on reaction mechanisms that duplicates a lot of what is discussed (and in some cases, contradicts) in [[Organic_Chemistry/Introduction_to_reactions/Substitution_reactions|Substitution Reactions]]. I haven't yet gotten to the Elimination reactions page, so I don't know if there are contradictions there, but there is surely some duplication.

It's probably best to link to the Substitution Reactions and Elimination pages from Haloalkanes and move whatever is needed from the Haloalkanes page.

As for contradictions, the first thing that caught my eye (since I was updating this in the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction mechanism, is that in the Haloalkanes page, it says non-polar solvents are preferred. This is, as far as I know, incorrect. Aprotic polar solvents are preferred in S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions based on nearly every book and online source I have checked. [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 19:56, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

== Some reorganizations ==

Okay, I've moved some stuff around a bit. I've tried to be really careful to fix all links so that they're not going to redirects or blank pages, but I have no doubt I missed something somewhere. This turned out to be a MUCH bigger project than I expected it to be.

Basically, I renamed (via a move) Alkanes and Cycloalkanes to simply Alkanes. It still has a short section on Cycloalkanes and some of this will be left there and maybe some minor changes made because it's a very short introduction to cycloalkanes.

I will add in a new section entirely on cycloalkanes, after the stereochemistry stuff which will go into much greater depth about cycloalkanes.

And the small move was Substitution Reactions was moved to Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions since that is what it was and shouldn't be confused with other types of substitution reactions.

== Standard chapter structure? ==

Should we have a standard format for each chapter? I usually go for:

1: Methods of making this class of compound (often referring to section (3) of other chapters)

2: Properties of this class of compound (including nomenclature, uses, etc)

3: Reactions of this class of compound (often leading to section (1) of other chapters)

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 10:48, 20 November 2006 (UTC)


:Ewen, yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. I assume you mean the chapters for each functional group.

::Yup! [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 14:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:I haven't decided how I want to do it, but I want to bring the Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination reactions stuff into an earlier place in the book, possibly in their own section. I'm also not happy with all those reactions being in the back of the book. Reactions should generally be with the class of compound they're with. If a reaction has been covered previously for another functional group, you just don't need to go into any depth about mechanism, as that will be covered the first time it comes up. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 14:20, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

::I agree. I'd prefer that when a reaction type first occurs that it has its own section, so that it can be found more easily later. I'd prefer that to the reaction type being a sub-heading of some or other functional group chapter. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 14:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Precisely and I think this is how most books handle it. I mean, you go read a chapter on carboxylic acids, and in every books I think I've seen, there's a section (or actually, usually multiple sections) dealing with all the reactions related to creating carboxylic acids and reactions that carboxylic acids can take part in. Frequently, the first time that particular type of reaction is shown and it's important, the mechanism is usually laid out with electron pushing, transition states and/or intermediates... I think we need to do all that stuff. I'm all for trying new stuff, but I think the reason it's laid out in most books this way is because it makes sense to lay it out this way. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:::As an additional note, I think we ought to move Alkenes and Alkynes an place them between Haloalkanes and alcohols. I think they should be discussed before alcoholis and I think Alkenes is probably the place to begin discussing reactions and reaction mechanisms, not haloalkanes. My reasoning on this is that haloalkanes are often used for creating different functional groups. For example, dehydrohalogenation to create an alkene. I mean, we might want to discuss halogenation of alkanes in the haloalkanes section, but I think that's probably the only thing. It's not a particularly useful reaction since it produces so many products, but that's really the only one I think would be useful there since most of the other reactions involving haloalkanes result in the creation of different functional groups that are discussed later. Anyway, just a thought. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Ewen, on a related note, in regards to structure, if you look at, for example, the Alkene chapter, notice how you go to the alkene page and it simply has links to other pages. I think this is a bad way to do it. Then if you go to Haloalkanes, it's all one one page. I think having it all on one page is the better way to do it. I think for Alkenes and Alkynes and other chapters that might be laid out that way, we ought to take the information from the sub-pages and merge it into the main page.

:::There are alsos some things there that need reorganization. Alkenes, for example, has a section on pi bonds. Pi bonds ought to be covered in the Foundations section along with other bonding stuff. I mean, Pi bonds are certainly worth mentioning elsewhere since they play a huge role, but I think they should be introduced before Alkenes. What are your thoughts? -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 20:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

::::Yup! Haloalkanes seems the way to go for structure. What sort of page length are we looking at before splitting them? Pi (and other) bonding is surely fundamental rather than a passing topic of relevance mainly to alkenes. I'll have a bash at some of these issues. I work in a different time zone to you don't I? We'll not have edit conflicts unless I stay up late or you get up very early 8-) [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 20:52, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

Wow, you've been busy today Ewen. I love what you've done with the Alkanes section... We might step on each other from time to time. I work from home and I sometimes get a little work in on the book during my lunch hour or something. I don't think there's too much danger, though. I'll be doing most of my work in the evenings and weekends, so the 6 hour (maybe 7) time difference should keep us from stepping on each other too often.

I've deicded I'm going to keep away from doing any big moves for a short while. I did that pretty big move of the Alkanes section over the weekend and it turned into a much bigger job than I expected (because of all the links that needed updating) and I just kinda bit off more than I think I was ready for, so I'm going to slow down a bit. I've also almost made some structural changes that I would have regretted because I didn't see some other stuff that was going on.

So, with that in mind, for a week or two, I'm just going to do additions here and there around the book, maybe a little cleanup, and just make sure I have a better feel for where everything is and how it's laid out, what's missing, what's duplicated, etc, and adding it to my [[Organic_Chemistry/To-Do_List|To-Do List]]. I'm also going to try to wrap up some of the stuff I've started, like the Cycloalkanes stuff and I need to do some more work on Elimination and Nucleophilic Substitution, and then bring them together in Haloalkanes, I think. It definitely makes sense to discuss Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination together, if for no other reason, than because they have a tendency to compete with each other and it's easier to address that with them together than it is to address it in each one separately. Anyway, just trying to give you a heads up on where I'm going, but I don't see us bumping heads too much in the near future... -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 22:46, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== Chapter structure ==

Ewen, you originally proposed chapter layout made sense at the time, but in working on the Alkene section, I ran into problems with it. I think what we ought to do is put together a layout model somewhere off of the [[Organic_Chemistry/Book_outline|Outline]] page and then we'll use that as a basic layout model for all the chapters that are based on functional groups.
Here's the problem I ran into. I was writing about the synthesis of alkenes and for dehydrohalogenation, it goes by the E2 mechanism and thus is regioselective and, depending on the alkane, can produce reliably consistent products or possibly a mix of E and Z product. The problem is, the E and Z naming isn't discussed until later in the section, which made me stop in my tracks and come here.
I think we ought to consider an order like this:
# Naming
# Properties
# Reactions
Properties is sort of a catch-all for everything not falling into the other two categories. Under reactions, we'd begin with synthesis reactions, followed by the rest of the reactions. But at least, at the point that you're discussing synthesis, you can name the products without there being confusion as to what the names mean. I'm also trying to cover reaction mechanisms with the reactions, as much as possible.
But like I said, I think we ought to come up with a model chapter. Look around at other chapters and see if maybe there are specific things that we're not considering for these 3 categories. Maybe there should be other categories that aren't coming to mind right now. But we can then use that model as the basis for all the functional group chapters. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 03:43, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, I was thinking that too. The structure doesn't fit well with some chapters. I should have been more flexible and not imposed a structure that didn't really fit. Live and learn! Perhaps the default structure should look like this anyhow:

::Introductory paragraph (no heading - puts it above the contents)
::Naming
:::Possible structures
::Properties
:::Physical properties (e.g. boiling point)
:::Chemical properties (e.g. acidity, toxicity)
::Reactions
:::Synthesis
:::(other reactions)

:I'm keen to list the details of synthesis reactions under their respective reactants. Haloalkanes, for example, might have a short reference to substitution of alcohols, but the main discussion is under reactions of alcohols and the haloalkanes chapter might merely reference the alcohol reaction section.

:One advantage of this moving stuff around: It helps to tidy things up! There are so many sections where work is duplicated and written to very different standards. Finding one home for each section has brought them together and made the best of them all, or highlighted the need for someone to fill a gap. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 06:40, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

::Ewen, I think this new order makes more sense. As for reactions, I think it's okay to mention them more than once. For example, the Wittig synthesis of Alkenes, I'm going to show the reaction and write a short paragraph about it in Alkenes, but it's a reaction between an aldehyde or ketone and a triphenylphosphonium ylide. So I'm thinking, the earliest it should be discussed in detail (i.e. mechanism details) is maybe aldehydes and ketones. So, to that degree, I don't mind duplication, as long as say, the Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination reaction mechanisms aren't covered completely in both Alkenes and Alcohols, for example. Some reactions apply to multiple functional groups and deserve at least some mention with each of those functional groups, but the degree of duplication that's been in some places is way too much.
::Today is the Thanksgiving holiday here in the States, so I won't be doing much here. I'm heading off to visit my family for the traditional turkey feast and offer thanks to the native Americans for letting us steal their land and virtually wipe them out. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 13:47, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Ewen, another thing we've forgotten is problems. Currently, there are very few problem exercises for the reader to work on. For me, this is really a low priority, but we ought to consider how they should be placed in the book. I was thinking the best way would probably be to have them as links at the end of each chapter. There would be two links: A link to the problems and a link to the answers, hopefully with explanations where appropriate. My thinking is there ought to be about 50 problems per chapter. That's a lot of work in itself, but like I said, it's low on my priorities. There are so many other things that still need work. But I didn't want it to slip through the cracks. I've added it to the to-do list. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 03:26, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== Ethers ==
I noticed that ethers are discussed in the module about alcohols.  Might it be better to move them into a module of their own? That way, readers might be able to find them more easily. I personally would not think to look for ethers under the topic of alcohols. -- [[User:WilliamJenkins09|WilliamJenkins09]] 04:25, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

:Good idea! Alternatively, we could rename 'Alcohols' as 'Alcohols and ethers'. Certainly ethers deserve a mention in the contents. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 08:40, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

==Index==

Anybody know how we could add an index to the book? [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 08:40, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

== An outdated and copycat organisation ==

Why on Earth has this book been organised by functional groups? It should be organised by reaction types and mechanisms, the true basis of organisation in organic chemistry. A functional group organisation belongs to the barbaric ages when terms such as electron density and carbocation stability were unknown. Such an organisation is a very poor effort in the twenty-first century.

Also, the book is seriously lacking in comprehensiveness. Only classically important topics are included, at the expense of overwhelmingly important modern topics such as orbital symmetry rules (pericyclic reactions), borderline mechanism in solvolysis, retrosynthetic analysis, chiral synthesis, basic organometallic chemistry etc. Physical chemistry is oversimplified. For example, entropy-controlled catalysts so important in biological systems are never discussed. In fact the whole process of kinetics is misrepresented, as is the difference and relation between rate and equilibrium (that is, equilibrium thermodynamics and kinetics).

Many experimental observations are left unexplained, such as why certain reactions proceed only at certain temperatures at the presence of a certain concentration of a certain catalyst. Catalytic mechanisms are rarely given. Overall, the book in its current form continues the long-observed tradition in chemistry textbooks of emphasising rote memorisation over logical analysis and understanding. The book is in need of  major overhaul and a complete change in the organisation and outlook to make it into a truly modern organic chemistry text that actually enriches wikibooks instead of simply rehashing material from commonly available high-school texts. [[User:59.93.198.128|59.93.198.128]] 08:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:To take your last point first: 'High-school texts' are not 'commonly available' if you can't afford them, and the scope of this book is beyond high school anyway.

:We've discussed the organisation and the consensus seems to be that organising according to functional groups (the 'nouns' of organic chemistry, as it were) is preferable to organisation by reaction types (the 'verbs'). Why? It's the status quo.

:Perhaps the reaction types and mechanisms organisation can be included by cross-referencing the relevant sections in the various chapters. Please go ahead and add such cross-referencing.

:Your second paragraph asks about the comprehensiveness of the content: Feel free to add what you think is missing!

:[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 10:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Regular access to an internet connection and a computer is not more affordable than a low price edition or second hand version of a standard text. Also, in its current form the book is written exactly at the level of Indian high-school OChem curricula (though US curricula is probably more elementary).

:: Cross-referencing can not be a substitute for organisation. Where did this discussion about organisation take place? It should be reopened. It does not make sense to use functional groups rather than mechanisms, as it is mechanisms that unite OChem into a cohesive whole. Use of functional groups creates the impression that OChem is simply about memorising seemingly unconnected mechanisms of reactions of many different functional groups. I quote a professor below:

:::&quot;...overall the books are criminally incoherent, much due to that substance classes rather than reaction classes form the &quot;basis&quot; of the chapter division [note: NOT &quot;...the basis of the 'organization'...&quot;, since organization can only exist when the reaction classes are the basis for the discussions, the one thing that brings order to organic chemistry!]; never does anyone take a more &quot;holistic&quot; or just &quot;passioned&quot; view, to actually demonstrate the monumental versatility of the concepts discussed - and exactly the same highly vital information is left out, about how to interpret or control all the hundreds of written consecutive equillibria, or what difference it makes to use the methoxide rather than the ethoxide, or why 70% phosphoric acid is used (or, indeed, what is meant by 70%), or why precisely 780K and not 775Kis needed, or how you actually carry out a single reaction and what apparatus should be used, or how you handle and isolate the substances; or how you name those compounds that show up later than the first few chapters (when all the authors suddenly forget the previous efforts of showing completeness in presentation).&quot; 
::[[User:59.93.201.127|59.93.201.127]] 18:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I do appreciate your criticisms are well-intentioned and constructive.

:::If you have a problem with the content - why not write some? No amount of requests will give me, or anyone else, more time to write material. Why not use your time to add to this book instead of criticising it? You obviously have spent some time reading the book and considering its failings.

:::If you missed the [[Organic_Chemistry/Foreword|foreword]] then you may have missed some of the rationale - the intention is to supersede expensive college-level texts. You're right about the cost of computing or internet access, but this book also has a printable version - it would cost no more than the printing costs to make a copy.

:::Your suggestion for organisation is novel and interesting (thanks for proposing and explaining it), but I'm not persuaded that it's substantially better than the system we use now. I didn't use the analogy of verbs and nouns lightly: You need both to learn a language, but vocabulary is more important than grammar (to change the analogy slightly). How can we discuss the chemical reactions before we can name the chemicals and know their physical properties? 

:::You're right, though - I can't find any formal discussion of the organisation. [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] and I discussed whether the structure should be flatter or deeper but nobody, to my knowledge, has suggested reorganising along the lines you suggest. 

:::Would you like to register and choose a username? I find it a bit odd writing to an IP address! You'd also be able to add pages like this to your 'watch' list which helps discussions.

:::Regards, [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 19:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: It takes significantly more money to print all these pages instead of buying the book. But irrespective of whether this book replaces or supplements standard texts,I think nobody will like it to become a copy of content that is already available.

:::: As for the organisation, if the goal was to discuss nomenclature and physical properties then the best organisation would undoubtably have been functional groups. But I think you will agree that the principal objective of a general introductory OChem text is to discuss reactions, and it is here that the advantage of a mechanistic discussion arises.

:::: Arranged by functional groups, the conversion of a halide and an alcohol into nitriles become different things, when in reality they are the same reaction, nucleophilic substitution. This separation gives a student the idea that the only way to get through OChem is to memorise the countless reaction mechanisms separately for each different class of compounds, when he would have a far easier time if only he understood that there are only a handful of basic reactions in introductory OChem and that which one occurs can be predicted (not memorised) from a knowledge of general principles and reaction conditions. Elimination of water and elimination of hydrohalide is the same reaction, but since one involves alcohol and the other halogen a student is forced to learn them separately, adding to his burden.

:::: As for functional groups being status quo, fashion can not be the foundation of science. Writing a textbook is not less important an exercise than writing a paper, and the same principles apply. Also, this status quo is increasingly being broken and most important second level OChem texts like March, Carey and Sykes have for a very long time used reaction types as their basis of organisation. It seems meaningless to deprive beginning students from what is already considered best for their seniors. Writing a good and original textbook that not simply a conventionally-organised collage from existing textbooks with sudden and inexplicable emphasis on the author's personal interests is a difficult and time-consuming task for which I don't have the time. However this labour can be significantly lessened by the collaboration offered by a wiki system, but that first requires consensus. [[User:59.93.162.4|59.93.162.4]] 07:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

==Organisation==

Re: [[User:59.93.162.4|59.93.162.4]]'s comments on organisation:

Bluntly; I don't think this book will be reorganised along reaction lines unless somebody has a huge amount of time to do it. I'm not sure that the majority of readers and writers would want this to happen anyway. It's my impression, but the 'consensus' seems to be to organise the book on functional group lines. Of course you're right; progress can be stymied by consensus and the status quo, but some projects develop by evolution, not revolution. Help in evolving the project is appreciated.

I think you exaggerate the problem. We have a section on reaction types - I gues sit needs expanding and re-emphasising. We also organise reactions from the viewpoint of the products, not the reactants. You say that &quot;Elimination of water and elimination of hydrohalide is the same reaction, but since one involves alcohol and the other halogen a student is forced to learn them separately, adding to his burden.&quot; but in fact both reactions form alkenes, and so the reactions are also dealt with in the alkene chapter.  Similary, it is not exaclty the  case that &quot;the conversion of a halide and an alcohol into nitriles become different things&quot; because both reactions come under nitriles too.

Thankyou for highlighting the problem: By organising along the lines of functional groups we have fragmented discussion of reaction types. I think all editors of this book should be conscious of this issue and ensure that common reaction types are cross-referenced as much as possible; and that the appendix on reaction types should be used to draw these common threads together as much as possible.

&quot;Writing a good and original textbook that not simply a conventionally-organised collage from existing textbooks with sudden and inexplicable emphasis on the author's personal interests is a difficult and time-consuming task&quot;

Agreed, and the wiki system ''is'' a way to share this task. However, this is an ambitious project and it is a work-in-progress. If some sections are currently further developed than others, and these sections are the result of one or other author's personal enthusiasms and interests, then is that so surprising? Eventually, the gaps will be filled (we hope).

You have identified many areas you consider under-developed. Do please dive in and develop them!

==Cost==

Re: [[User:59.93.162.4|59.93.162.4]]'s comments on cost:

The aim of the book is to make it as comprehensive and up-to-date as can be, with constant revisions. The competition would be the books listed on the Main Page, which are more expensive than the wikibook. Of course, you could buy an inferior book or on old copy of a good one; but the quality of this wikibook should justify its limited cost. We're not there yet; but already for the many students who have free internet access through their colleges the cost of this book cannot be beaten.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi! I just reviewed your book for [[Wikibooks:Development stages]]. I suggest that you have a look how to set mathematical formulae. It would make the excercises easier to read. Have a look at [[meta:Help:Displaying a formula]] or check out this example:
&lt;math&gt;\sin^2(\theta)+\cos^2(\theta)=1&lt;/math&gt;
--[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:57, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I was looking for a project like this to contribute. I like to make a database of excercises of physics. I think that a book of Physics exercises would be better if it contains both solved and unsolved problems. What do you think?

--gabrielvc, wikibooks user--

: I think it is better to have the solutions around somewhere for reference. They don't have to be on the same page though as it is now. Also, the solutions don't have to be written by you, but you might encourage others to provide them. Also, there might be a &quot;Teacher's wikibook&quot; that contains solutions to exercises without solutions in this book? So there is no point in omitting solutions in a wiki... Also, this is the only way to look for errors, should the exercises by accident be wrong or unsolvable... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 11:37, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Merge into Physics Study Guide? ==
I think this book would be better served as part of the [[Physics Study Guide]] book since the goal is to have worked examples to study from --[[User:msmithma|Mart&amp;iacute;n S-M]]
: At the moment, Physics Study Guide links to this book (as an appendix), and IMHO, that seems like the best thing to do. The Study Guide, as a whole, does not focus on problems (more of a quick-review guide, it seemed like), and having problems interpersed throughout the guide will rather be distracting, not to mention it does not serve those students/instructors who are simply looking for problems to work out. I am removing the merge tag, as it appears to have been done already. [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] ([[User talk:Novakyu|talk]]) 07:01, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

== Automatically numbered equations ==

How do you do that? Also, is it possible to just upload postscript or PDF files instead of typing text here? [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 01:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
: Automatically numbered questions are done through HTML lists, or in Wiki markup, by lists starting with &quot;#&quot;, like
# First question
# Second question
: I should note that this notation is rather fragile (if you break the list, it'll restart numbering), so there are a lot of stuffs in between, you should use ordered HTML list like (see code)
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; First question&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Second question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
: And, no, I don't think there's a way to just upload PS or PDF files. There are tools that will turn PS or PDF to HTML code, and you can *probably* more or less paste that in here, but short of making a link to a PS or PDF file (which I don't think is recommended), you can't do that. [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] ([[User talk:Novakyu|talk]]) 06:52, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

== Refraction exercises ==

I think [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)/Refraction/Worked Solutions]] should be included here, either as a copy or as a redirect. [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 20:43, 18 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

You should have already had a look at the page [[Portuguese/Contents/Definite and Indefinite Articles|Definite and Indefinite Articles]]. If you haven't, have a look over it. Now it's time to have a little practice, as well as learn some vocabulary. It might be best to print this page out or copy it to fill out in a word processing application.

Note that when a word ends in an '''-s''' it is plural: to determine whether it is masculine or feminine, take off the '''-s''' (or sometimes '''-es''' if the word ends in '''-res''', '''-ses''' or '''zes''') to determine gender. Pay attention to the real meaning of the word because the way to determine gender needs it.

In this lesson you will learn how to ask and identify objects.
== Lesson ==
=== What is that? ===
When you want to ask someone what something is, you might ask
* Kanji and hiragana: それは何ですか
* Hiragana: それ　は　なん　です　か 
* Romaji: ''sore wa nan desu ka?''
* English: What's that?

==== Words ====
* '''[[wiktionary:それ|それ]]''' means &quot;that&quot; (''sore'')
* '''[[wiktionary:何|何]]''' ([[wiktionary:なん|なん]], ''nan'') means &quot;what&quot; (from [[wiktionary:なに|なに]], ''nani'')
* Recall that AはBです (''A wa B desu'') means &quot;A is B.&quot; 
* '''[[wiktionary:か|か]]''' (''ka'') is the question particle. Questions are formed by adding か to the end of a sentence. Unlike English, the word order doesn't change. Question words, such as 何 (&quot;what&quot;), simply replace the words you are asking about.

As in English, you would ask about an object depending on its distance from yourself (speaker) and the person you are talking to (listener). In Japanese, there are three words denoting an object's distance from the speaker and listener.
* [[wiktionary:これ|これ]] (''kore'') &quot;this&quot; - refers to an object '''near the speaker''' (e.g., you are holding the object)
* [[wiktionary:それ|それ]] (''sore'') &quot;that&quot; - refers to an object '''near the listener''' (e.g., the person you are talking to is holding the object)
* [[wiktionary:あれ|あれ]] (''are'') &quot;that over there&quot; - refers to an object that is '''far away from both speaker and listener'''.

To summarize, これ (''kore'', this), それ (''sore'', that), あれ (''are'', that - far).

=== That is a... ===
To reply to the question それは何ですか you would say これは___です. &quot;This is a ___.&quot; You should use the name of the object in place of the blank.

In the above question, person A used それ to indicate the object is near person B. In response, person B uses これ to indicate the object is near person B.

'''Note:''' The distance of an object from the speaker and listener is taken into consideration when asking or responding to a question. You must familiarize yourself with これ・それ・あれ

Try to remember how to reply to a question with these tips.
* When someone asks you これ, you reply それ.
* When someone asks you それ, you reply これ.
* When someone asks you あれ, you also reply あれ.

=== も - Also ===
When you want to ask or say that something is also a type of object, you use the particle も.
* Question: これ / それ / あれ'''も'''___ですか &quot;Is this/that/that (far) '''also''' a ___?&quot;

There are two possible responses to this question...

If the answer is affirmative, you say 「はい、これ/それ/あれも___です。」.

If the answer is negative, you say 「いいえ、これ/それ/あれは___では　ありません」. (では is pronounced /dewa/, or /ja/ in less formal conversation.) 

* はい means &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;correct&quot; 
* いいえ means &quot;no&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; 
* ___では　ありません means &quot;is not ___&quot;. When you want to say something is not a type of object you use this phrase.

=== の - Possessive particle ===
The possessive particle, の, is added after a noun or pronoun to indicate that an object belongs to them.

==== Example ====
* それは私の___です。 &quot;That is my ___.&quot;
* あれは___さんの___ですか。 &quot;Is that (far) ___-san's ___?&quot;
* これは私の___ではありません。 &quot;This is not my ___.&quot;
'''''Note:''''' You can omit the name of the object.
* 私のです。 &quot;It's mine.&quot;
* ___さんのです。 &quot;It's ___-san's.&quot;
* 私のではありません。 &quot;It's not mine.&quot;

=== Whose is this? ===
A useful phrase to use is 「これは誰の___ですか。」 (これは　だれの ___　ですか) &quot;Whose ___ is this?&quot; or 「これは誰のですか」 &quot;Whose is this?&quot;

=== More specific ===
これ・それ・あれ, which was used to indicate an object's location can be used in their more specific form of この・その・あの to refer to a specific object.
* この車 (この　くるま) &quot;This (particular) car.&quot;
* そのペン　&quot;That (particular) pen.&quot;
'''''Note:''''' これ車, これペン is not possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Imperfect Tense ==
The imperfect Tense is used in Portuguese to express something that was happening at a particular moment in time. For instance, we would NOT use the imperfect for the sentence &quot;I ate an apple&quot; because the action has finished. However, the sentence &quot;I was eating an apple&quot; describes something that was happening at a moment in time.

Let's see how to form the imperfect tense. First, take the &quot;ar&quot;, &quot;er&quot; or &quot;ir&quot; off the infinitive (so '''falar''' becomes '''fal''', '''comer''' becomes '''com''' and '''partir''' becomes '''part'''

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Regular -er and -ir verbs==
You only need to learn one conjugation for the 'ir' and 'er' verbs. That means that the verb '''partir''' is conjugated exactly like '''comer''' in the imperfect tense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you want to say that something exists, there two verbs you have to choose from depending on whether the subject is an ''animate-'' or ''inanimate object''. The difference is not quite living/non-living, as plants would be considered inanimate (as they don't move ... well, most only really slowly). A fish swimming in its fish-bowl would be an animate object, but a dead fish (whether at the fish-mongers or — let's hope not — in its bowl) would be in-animate.

* For '''animate''' objects (humans and animals), use &quot;いる&quot; (polite present positive: &quot;います&quot;).
* For '''inanimate''' objects, use &quot;ある&quot; (polite present positive: &quot;あります&quot;).

Note that these can denote both presence or possession.

In the dialogues below, you may replace &quot;います&quot; with &quot;あります&quot;.

== Dialogue ==
=== The presence of no particular object ===
{{Japanese conversation|begin}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= 何かいますか。
| english = Is something (animate) there?
}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= &lt;animate object&gt; がいます。
| english = There's a &lt;animate object&gt;.
}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= 何もいません。 (なにも　いません)
| english = There's nothing.
}}
{{Japanese conversation|end}}

=== To ask about the presence of a particular animate object ===
{{Japanese conversation|begin}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= &lt;object&gt; がいますか。
| english = Is there a &lt;animate object&gt;?
}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= はい、います。
| english = Yes, it's there.
}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= いいえ、いません。
| english = No, it's not there.
}}
{{Japanese conversation|end}}

If the animate object in question is not present but something else is, you can suggest this by saying:
{{Japanese conversation|begin}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese=いいえ、&lt;animate object&gt; はいません。
| english = No, &lt;animate object&gt; is not there.
}}
{{Japanese conversation|end}}

Notice that this reply uses &quot;は&quot; instead of &quot;が&quot;. The &quot;は&quot; particle can be translated as &quot;as for such and such&quot;, while &quot;が&quot; directly marks the subject.{{citation needed}}

== Vocabulary ==
{{furi|何|なに}}か: &quot;anything/something&quot;.
{{furi|何|なに}}も: &quot;everything/nothing&quot; (positive/negative depends on the verb)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A matroid is an algebraic construct that is related to the notion of independence.

Matroids are an abstraction of several combinatorial objects, among them graphs and matrices. The word matroid was coined by Whitney in 1935 in his landmark paper &quot;On the abstract properties of linear dependence&quot;. In defining a matroid Whitney tried to capture the fundamental properties of dependence that are common to graphs and matrices. Almost simultaneously, Birkhoff showed that a matroid can be interpreted as a geometric lattice. Maclane showed that matroids have a geometric representation in terms of points, lines, planes, dimension 3 spaces etc. Often the term combinatorial geometry is used instead of simple matroids. However, combinatorial geometry has another meaning in mathematical literature. Rank 3 combinatorial geometries are frequently called linear spaces. Matroids are a unifying concept in which some problems in graph theory, design theory, coding theory, and combinatorial optimization become simpler to understand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How do you think about languages as you study them? Typically, you will consider every punctuation mark and letter, all the verbs and nouns, adverbs and adjectives, and study them in order to make connections. Ideally, you will have a teacher to point you in the right direction, and help you make those connections. But when you have no teacher, these connections are left for you to discover. They may be clear or hidden, but either way you will have to make them yourself. As you explore this Wikibook, it will require the skill of critical thinking.

You can never go wrong studying a language if you remember that exposing yourself to a language, even if you stumble in practice, is itself learning it. Looking things up too much can sometimes impede progress. Stretch your memory, read slowly, and re-read. As you will soon discover, you are about to study a language that is rich and full of meaning, an ancestor of many modern languages spoken around the world, including romance languages, like Spanish, French, Italian, Romanian, and even English.

== So do not assume that... ==
...Latin is like any other language. Do not assume ancient Roman culture is entirely unlike other cultures, however. The Romans grappled with issues that are universally dealt with.

We, the authors, endorse memorization, and after that, immersion. You must develop Latin muscles, and a willingness to write or type things out, or drill using software, or with a friend. Note the patterns after you have memorized the forms, not before. Allow yourself to be mesmerized by them. Similarly, seek out explanation only after you have memorized forms. Memorize forms, then make sentences, then use your knowledge to speak the language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Commands==
====ABS()====
 N = ABS(expression returning a numerical value)

Returns the 'absolute' value of the expression, turning a negative to a positive (e.g. -4 to 4)

&lt;pre&gt;PRINT ABS(54.345) 'This will print the value ABS now as it is (54.345)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;PRINT ABS(-43)    'This will print the value as (43)&lt;/pre&gt;

====ACCESS====

&lt;pre&gt;OPEN &quot;file.txt&quot; FOR APPEND ACCESS WRITE&lt;/pre&gt;

This sets the access of a file that has been declared into the program. There are three settings that the programmer can set. These are:
 READ - Sets up the file to be read only, no writing.
 WRITE - Writes only to the file. Cannot be read.
 READ WRITE - Sets the file to both of the settings above.

APPEND means 'add' to the 'end of' the existing &quot;file.txt&quot;. If omitted, any existing &quot;file.txt&quot; is over-written without warning

====ASC()====

&lt;pre&gt;PRINT ASC(&quot;t&quot;)  'Will print 116&lt;/pre&gt;

Prints the ASCII code number of the character found within the brackets. If the programmer put in a string into brackets, only the first character of the string will be shown.

====ATN()====

 ATN(expression)

Part of the inbuilt trigonometry functions. An expression that evaluates to a numeric vale is converted to it's Arc-Tangent.
 angle = ATN( B ) 
 angle2 = ATN( 23 / 34 )

====BEEP====
 BEEP
The BIOS on the motherboard is instructed to emit a &quot;Beep&quot; sound from the PC 'speaker'. See also SOUND and PLAY.

====CASE====
 SELECT CASE [variable]
 CASE [value]: [command]
 CASE ELSE: [command]
 END SELECT
Use this when using multiple values in your program and assigning them separate paths. This is an example of a program with no CASE commands that assigns different paths to values:
 10 PRINT &quot;1. Print 'path'&quot;
 PRINT &quot;2. Print 'hello&quot;
 PRINT &quot;3. Quit&quot;
 INPUT &quot;Enter a choice: &quot;; a$
 IF a$ = &quot;1&quot; THEN
 PRINT &quot;path&quot;
 GOTO 10
 IF a$ = &quot;2&quot; THEN
 PRINT &quot;hello&quot;
 GOTO 10
 IF a$ = &quot;3&quot; THEN END
 PRINT &quot;That is not a valid choice&quot;
 GOTO 10
This is what a program looks like with the CASE command:
 PRINT &quot;1. Print 'path'&quot;
 PRINT &quot;2. Print 'Hello'&quot;
 PRINT &quot;3. Quit&quot;
 INPUT &quot;Enter a choice: &quot;; a$
 SELECT CASE a$
 CASE &quot;1&quot;:
 PRINT &quot;path&quot;
 CASE &quot;2&quot;:
 PRINT &quot;Hello&quot;
 CASE &quot;3&quot;:
 END
 CASE ELSE:
 PRINT &quot;That is not a valid choice&quot;
 END SELECT

====CHAIN====
 CHAIN {filename.format (parameters list)}

This 'calls' (transfers execution) to another program (typically another .bas file, a command (.bat or .cmd) script or an executable (.com, .exe) ).

Values may be passed directly in the invoking command (to files accepting command line parameters). Values may be passed to another basic script by using the 'COMMON' statement before the CHAIN command.

Control returns to the basic interpreter when the 'chained' program terminates.

====CHDIR====
 CHDIR [directory name]
This is used for changing a directory. Used in conjunction with MKDIR and RMDIR. The directory name is declared exactly like in DOS PROMPT. For example:
 CHDIR &quot;c:/Program Files/QBasic_FIles/Testing_Files&quot;
To use this command, the programmer will have to know how MS DOS and COMMAND PROMPT work.

====CHR$()====
This returns the string character symbol of an ASCII code value.
 name$ = CHR$([acsii character code])
Often used to 'load' characters into string variables when that character cannot be typed (e.g. the Esc key or the F{n} (Function Keys) or characters that would be 'recognised' and acted upon by QBASIC interpreter (eg &quot;, the double quote). Here is a list of some character codes :-
 07 Beep (same as BEEP)
 08 Backspace
 09 Tab
 27 Esc
 34 Double quote
 72 Up Arrow
 75 Left Arrow
 77 Right Arrow
 80 Down Arrow

====CINT()====
This rounds the contents of the brackets to the nearest integer.
 PRINT CINT(4573.73994596)
4574

====CIRCLE====
 CIRCLE ([X Coordinate], [Y Coordinate]), [Radius], [Colour]
Lets the programmer display a circle. Like all graphics commands, it must be used with the SCREEN command.
====CLEAR====
 CLEAR
Resets all variables, strings, arrays and closes all files. The reset command on QBasic.
====CLOSE====
 CLOSE
Closes all open files
 CLOSE #2
Closes only the file opened as data stream 2. Other files remain open

====CLS====
 CLS
Clears the active screen. Erases all text, graphics, resets the cursor to the upper left (1,1), and also applies the current background color (this has to be set using the COLOR command) to the whole screen.

====COLOR====
 COLOR [Text Colour], [Background Colour]
This lets you change the colour of the text and background used when next 'printing' to the current output window. It can be done like this:
 COLOR 14, 01
 PRINT &quot;Yellow on Blue&quot;

You have a choice of sixteen colours:
 00: Black            08: Dark Grey
 01: Dark Blue        09: Light Blue
 02: Dark Green       10: Light Green
 03: Dark Cyan        11: Light Cyan
 04: Dark Red         12: Light Red
 05: Dark Purple      13: Magenta
 06: Orange Brown     14: Yellow
 07: Grey             15: White
These values are the numbers that you put in the COLOR command.

Note Only screen modes 0, 7, 8, 9, 10 support a background color. To 're-paint' the whole screen in a background colour, use the CLS command.

====COMMON====
Declares a variable as 'global' which allows it's value to be accessed across multiple QBasic programs / scripts (see also the CHAIN command) 
 COMMON SHARED [variablename]

Each program that declares 'variablename' as COMMON will share the same value.

NOTE. All COMMON statements must appear at the start of the program (i.e. before any executable statements).

====CONST====
Fixes a variable so it can not be changed within the program.
 CONST (name) {AS (type = INTEGER / STRING)} = (expression or value)
For example :-
 CONST PI = 3.14159265
Assigns the value 3.14159265 to PI.
 CONST PI2 = 2 * PI
PI must be assigned a value before it is used to calculate PI2. Typically all CONST are declared at the beginning of a program.

====DATA====
 DATA [constant]
Use in conjunction with the READ and RESTORE command. Mostly used in programs dealing with graphics, this command lets QBasic read a large number of constants. The READ command accesses the data while the RESTORE command &quot;refreshes&quot; the data, allowing it to be used again.

====DATE$====
A system variable that always contains the current date as a string in mm-dd-yyyy format. Use it like this:
 a$ = DATE$

====DIM====
This this is used to declare an array (early versions of Basic required all variables to be defined, not just arrays greater than 10)

 DIM [Array Name] ([count],[count], ..)

The Array name can be of any type (Integer, Double, String etc). If not declared, single precision floating point is assumed. Strings can be 'declared' using $ sign (Integers with the '%' sign). The QBASIC interpreter tolerates numeric arrays of up to 10 count without these needing to be declared.

NOTE Early versions of QBasic did not explicitly set the contents of an array to zero (see CLEAR command)

 DIM table%(100,2)
Create an integer array called table% containing 100x2 = 200 entries

 DIM form$(5)
Create a string array called form$ containing 5 strings

 DIM quotient(20) AS DOUBLE
Create an array called quotient that contains 20 double precision numbers

====DO .. LOOP====
 DO
 [program]
 LOOP UNTIL [test condition becomes TRUE]
Used to create a loop in the program. The [condition] is tested only after the [program] code is executed for the first time (see also WHILE). For example:
 num$ = 1
 sum$ = 0
 DO
 sum$ = 2 * num$
 PRINT sum$
 num$ = num$ + 1
 LOOP UNTIL num$ = 13
This program outputs the Two Times Tables up to 12. The Reason why we put 13 is that the program stops at that point and does not continue the loop. If we put LOOP UNTIL num$ = 12 the last output on the screen would be &quot;22&quot;.

See also EXIT DO

====DRAW====
 DRAW &quot;[string expression]&quot;
Used to draw a straight line from the current 'cursor' position in the current colour. DRAW defines the direction (up, down etc.) and the length of the line (in pixels). For example:-
 SCREEN 7
 PSET (50, 50), 4
 DRAW &quot;u50 r50 d50 l50&quot;
 
The letter in front of each number is the direction:
 U = Up    E = Upper-right
 D = Down  F = Lower-right
 L = Left  G = Lower-left
 R = Right H = Upper-left

The drawing 'cursor' is left at the position where the line ends.
u50 draws from 50,50 upwards ending at 50,0
r50 draws from 50,0 to the right, ending at 100,0
d50 draws from 100,0 downwards, ending at 100,50
l50 draws from 100,50 to the left, ending at 50,50

The example shown will thus draw a red 'wire frame' square.

See also LINE and CIRCLE commands.

Note: Pixels are square. The diagonal from 0,0 to 100,100 will be 100 * root(2) pixels long (i.e. 141)

====END====
 END
Signifies the end of the program. When QBasic sees this command it usually comes up with a statement saying: &quot;Press Any Key to Continue&quot;.
====END IF====
 END IF
Ends the program if a condition is reached.
====ENVIRON====
 ENVIRON [string expression]
NOTE: If you are running QBasic on a Windows system, you wont be able to use this command.

This command lets you set an environment variable for the duration of the session. On exit from the QBasic.exe interpreter, the variables revert to their original values.

====EOF()====
This checks if there are still more data values to be read from the file specified in (). EOF() returns a boolean / binary value, a one or zero. 0 if the end of file has not been reached, 1 if the last value in the file has been read (see also LINE INPUT)

 OPEN File.txt FOR INPUT AS #1
 DO
 INPUT #1, text$
 PRINT text$
 LOOP UNTIL EOF(1)
 END

Note that, since the INPUT is executed before UNITIL is reached, File.txt must contain at least one line of text - if the file is empty, you will receive an 'ERROR (62) Input past end of file'.

====ERASE====
 ERASE [arrayname] [,]
Used to erase all dimensioned arrays.
====ERROR====
System variable holding a numeric value relating to the processing of the previous line of code. If the line completed without error, ERROR is set to 0. If the line failed, ERROR is set to one of the values shown below. Most commonly used to redirect program flow to error handling code as in :-
 ON ERROR GOTO [line number / label]
If ERROR is non=zero, program flow jumps to the line number or label specified. If ERROR is zero, program flow continues with the next line below.

To manually test your program and check to see if the error handling routine runs OK, ERROR can be set manually :- 
 ERROR [number]
Set ERROR = number

The error numbers are as follows:
 1 NEXT without FOR                 39 CASE ELSE expected 
 2 Syntax Error                     40 Variable required 
 3 RETURN without GOSUB             50 FIELD overflow 
 4 Out of DATA                      51 Internal error 
 5 Illegal function call            52 Bad file name or number 
 6 Overflow                         53 File not found 
 7 Out of memory                    54 Bad file mode 
 8 Label not defined                55 File already open 
 9 Subscript out of range           56 FIELD statement active 
 10 Duplicate definition            57 Device I/O error 
 11 Division by zero                58 File already exists 
 12 Illegal in direct mode          59 Bad record length 
 13 Type mismatch                   61 Disk full 
 14 Out of string space             62 Input past end of file 
 16 String formula too complex      63 Bad record number 
 17 Cannot continue                 64 Bad file name 
 18 Function not defined            67 Too many files 
 19 No RESUME                       68 Device unavailable 
 20 RESUME without error            69 Communication-buffer overflow 
 24 Device timeout                  70 Permission denied 
 25 Device Fault                    71 Disk not ready 
 26 FOR without NEXT                72 Disk-media error 
 27 Out of paper                    73 Advanced feature unavailable 
 29 WHILE without WEND              74 Rename across disks 
 30 WEND without WHILE              75 Path/File access error 
 33 Duplicate label                 76 Path not found 
 35 Subprogram not defined 
 37 Argument-count mismatch 
 38 Array not defined

Note that ERROR is set when execution fails, not when the code is 'read' - so, for example, a 'divide by 0' will be found before the result is assigned to a non-existent array variable or written to a non-existent file.
====EXIT====
Allows the immediate exit from a subroutine or a loop, without processing the rest of that subroutine or loop code  

 EXIT DEF
Exits from a DEF FN function.
 EXIT DO
Exits from a DO loop, execution continues with the command directly after the LOOP command
 EXIT FOR
Exits from a FOR loop, execution continues with the command directly after the NEXT command
 EXIT FUNCTION
Exits a FUNCTION procedure, execution continues with the command directly after the function call
 EXIT SUB
Exits a SUB procedure.

====FOR .. NEXT====
 FOR [variable name] = [start value] TO [end value] {STEP n}
 [program  code]
 NEXT [variable name]

The variable is set to the [start value], then program code is executed and at the Next statement the variable is incremented by 1 (or by the STEP value, if any is specified). The resulting value is compared to the [end value] and &lt;b&gt;if not equal&lt;/b&gt; program flow returns to the line following the FOR statement.

For example:
 FOR a = 200 TO 197 STEP-1
 PRINT a
 NEXT a

200
199
198

Care must be taken when using STEP, since it is quite possible to step past the (end value) with the result that the FOR loop will run 'for ever' (i.e. until the user aborts the interpreter or an error occurs), for example :-

 FOR a = 200 TO 197 STEP-2
 PRINT a
 NEXT a

200
198
196
194
192
...
0
-2
-4
...
-32768
ERROR overflow

====GOSUB====
 GOSUB [subroutine line number / label]
Command processing jumps to the subroutine specified. When the RETURN command is encountered, processing returns to this point and  continues with the line below the GOSUB.

====IF====
 IF [variable or string] [operator] [variable or string] THEN [command] {ELSE [command]}
Compares variables or strings. For example, if you wanted to examine whether or not a user-entered password was the correct password, you might enter:&lt;br&gt;
IF a$ = &quot;password&quot; THEN PRINT &quot;Password Correct&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Where a$ is the user entered password. Some operators include:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;=&quot;- equal to&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;&quot;- less than (only used when variable or string is a number value)&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&gt;&quot;- greater than (only used when variable or string is a number value)&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;- does not equal&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;=&quot;- less than or equal to (only used when variable or string is a number value)&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&gt;=&quot;- greater than or equal to (only used when variable or string is a number value)&lt;br&gt;
One can also preform actions to number values then compare them to other strings or variables using the if command, such as in the below examples:&lt;br&gt;
IF a+5 = 15 THEN PRINT &quot;Correct&quot;&lt;br&gt;
IF a*6 = b*8 THEN PRINT &quot;Correct&quot; &lt;br&gt;

====INCLUDE====

[[QBasic]] supports the use of include files via the $INCLUDE directive:

 '$INCLUDE: 'foobar.bi'

Note that the include directive is prefixed with an apostrophe, dollar, and that the name of the file for inclusion is enclosed in single quotation mark symbols.

====INKEY$====
 [variable] = INKEY$
This is used when you want a program to function with key input from the keyboard. Look at this example on how this works:
 a$ = INKEY$
 PRINT &quot;Press Esc to Exit&quot;
 END IF a$ = CHR$(27)
You can use this in conjunction with the CHR$ command or type the letter (e.g. A).

====INPUT====
 INPUT [String Literal] [,or;] [Variable]
Displays the String Literal, if a semi colon follows the string literal, a question mark is displayed, and the users input until they hit return is entered into the variable. The variable can be a string or numeric. If a user attempts to enter a string for a numeric variable, the program will ask for the input again. The String Literal is option. If the string literal is used, a comma (,) or semicolon (;) is necessary.

====INPUT #====
 INPUT #n [String Literal] [,or;] [Variable]
Reads a string / value from the specified file stream (see also LINE INPUT #)
 INPUT #1, a$, b$, n, m
Reads 4 values from the file that is OPEN as #1. a$ is assigned all text until a ',' (comma) or end of line is reached, b$ the next segment of text, then two numeric values are interpreted and assigned to n and m.

Note that, within the file, numbers can be separated by 'anything' - so, if a number is not found (for 'n' or 'm') on the current 'line' of the file, the rest of the file will be searched until a number is found. Input is then left 'pointing' at the position in the file after the last number required to satisfy the input statement (see also 'seek #' command)

====INSTR====
 INSTR (start%, Search$, Find$)
Returns the character position of the start of the first occurrance of Find$ within Search$, starting at character position 'start%' in Search$. If Find$ is not found, 0 is returned. start% is optional (defaul = 1, the first character of Seach$)
 Pos = INSTR (&quot;abcdefghi&quot;, &quot;de&quot;)
returns 4

====LEFT$()====

 A$ = LEFT$(B$,N)

A$ is set to the left most characters of B$ ending at the Nth character.

 A$ =  LEFT$(&quot;Get the start only&quot;,4)

returns &quot;Get &quot;

See also RIGHT$(), MID$().

====LET====
 LET [variable] = [value]
Early versions of the QBasic.exe command interpreter required use of the 'LET' command to assign values to variables. Later versions did not.

 LET N = 227 / 99
 LET A$=&quot;a line of simple text&quot;

is equliavent to :-

 N = 227 / 99
 A$=&quot;a line of simple text&quot;

====LINE====
 LINE ([X], [Y]) - ([X], [Y]), [Colour Number]
Used for drawing lines in QBasic. The first X and Y are used as coordinates for the beginning of the line and the second set are used for coordinating were the end of the line is. You must put a SCREEN command at the beginning of the program to make it work.

Note. When in SCREEN 13, the Colour Number == the Palette number

====LINE INPUT #====
 LINE INPUT #1, a$
Reads a complete line as text characters from the file OPEN as stream #1 and places it in a$.

To find the 'end of line', the QBasic interpreter seaches for the 'Carriage Return' + 'Line Feed' (0x0D, 0x0A) characters. When reading text files created on UNIX/LINUX systems (where the 'Line feed' 0x0A is used on it's own to signify 'end of line'), LINE INPUT will not recognise the 'end of line' and will continue to input until the end of file is reached. For files exceeding 2k characters, the result is an &quot;Out of String Space&quot; Error as a$ 'overflows'. One solution is to use a text editor able to handle UNIX files to open and 'save as' before atempting to process the file using QBasic.

====LOOP====
 DO
 [Program]
 LOOP UNTIL [condition]
Used to create a loop in the program. This command checks the condition after the loop has started. This is used in conjunction with the DO command.

====LPRINT====
 LPRINT [statement or variable]
Prints out text to a printer.
The LPRINT command expects a printer to be connected to the LPT1(PRN) port. If a printer is not connected to LPT1, QBasic displays a &quot;Device fault&quot; error message.

If your printer is connected to a COM port instead, use the MS-DOS MODE command to redirect printing from LPT1 to COMx (for example, to redirect to COM1, use the following command:
    MODE LPT1=COM1

If you need to cancel the redirection when finished, use the following command:
    MODE LPT1

====MID$====
  a$=MID$(string$,start%[,length%])
  MID$(string$,start%[,length%])=b$

In the first use, a$ is set to the substring taken from string$ strating with character start% taking Length% characters. If length% is omitted, the rest of the line (i.e. start% and all the characters to the right) are taken.

In the second use, length% characters of string$ are replaced by b$ starting at start%. If length% is omitted, the rest of the line is replaced (i.e. start% and all the chracters to the right)

See also LEFT$ RIGHT$ LEN

====OPEN====
 OPEN &quot;[(path)\8.3 file name.ext]&quot; (FOR {INPUT/OUTPUT} AS #{n})
This opens a file. You have to give the DOS file name, for example:
 OPEN &quot;data.txt&quot; FOR INPUT AS #1
Opens the existing file data.txt for reading as data stream #1. Since no path is specified, the file must be in the same folder as the QBasic.exe - if not, processing halts with a 'file not found' error
 OPEN &quot;C:\TEMP\RUN.LOG&quot; FOR OUTPUT AS #2
Opens an empty file named RUN.LOG in the C:\TEMP folder for writing data stream #2. Any existing file of the same name is replaced.

====PALETTE====
 PALETTE[palette number, required colour]
For VGA (SCREEN mode 13) only, sets the Palette entry to a new RGB color. The palette number must be in the range 1-256. The required colour is a LONG integer created from the sum of (required Blue * 65536) + (required Green * 256) + required Red.

====READ====
 READ [Variable]
Used in conjunction with the DATA command, this command lets QBasic read data. This is mostly used when dealing with large quantities of data like bitmaps.
====REM or '====
 REM {comments}
 ' {comments}
When the interpreter encounters REM or &quot; ' &quot; (a single quote) at the start of a line, the rest of the line is ignored

====RETURN====
 RETURN
Signifies that it is the end of a subroutines
====PLAY====
 PLAY &quot;[string expression]&quot;
Used to play notes and a score in QBasic on a computer equipped with a MIDI sound-card (all modern computer motherboards with built-in sound support MIDI). The tones are indicated by letters A through G. Accidentals are indicated with a &quot;+&quot; or &quot;#&quot; (for sharp) or &quot;-&quot; (for flat) immediately after the note letter. See this example:
 PLAY &quot;C C# C C#&quot;
Whitespaces are ignored inside the string expression. There are also codes that set the duration, octave and tempo. They are all case-insensitive. PLAY executes the commands or notes the order in which they appear in the string. Any indicators that change the properties are effective for the notes following that indicator.
 Ln     Sets the duration (length) of the notes. The variable n does not indicate an actual duration
        amount but rather a note type; L1 - whole note, L2 - half note, L4 - quarter note, etc.
        (L8, L16, L32, L64, ...). By default, n = 4.
        For triplets and quintets, use L3, L6, L12, ... and L5, L10, L20, ... series respectively.
        The shorthand notation of length is also provided for a note. For example, &quot;L4 CDE L8 FG L4 AB&quot;
        can be shortened to &quot;L4 CDE F8G8 AB&quot;. F and G play as eighth notes while others play as quarter notes.
 On     Sets the current octave. Valid values for n are 0 through 6. An octave begins with C and ends with B.
        Remember that C- is equivalent to B. 
 &lt; &gt;    Changes the current octave respectively down or up one level.
 Nn     Plays a specified note in the seven-octave range. Valid values are from 0 to 84. (0 is a pause.)
        Cannot use with sharp and flat. Cannot use with the shorthand notation neither.
 MN     Stand for Music Normal. Note duration is 7/8ths of the length indicated by Ln. It is the default mode.
 ML     Stand for Music Legato. Note duration is full length of that indicated by Ln.
 MS     Stand for Music Staccato. Note duration is 3/4ths of the length indicated by Ln.
 Pn     Causes a silence (pause) for the length of note indicated (same as Ln). 
 Tn     Sets the number of &quot;L4&quot;s per minute (tempo). Valid values are from 32 to 255. The default value is T120. 
 .      When placed after a note, it causes the duration of the note to be 3/2 of the set duration.
        This is how to get &quot;dotted&quot; notes. &quot;L4 C#.&quot; would play C sharp as a dotted quarter note.
        It can be used for a pause as well.
 MB MF  Stand for Music Background and Music Foreground. MB places a maximum of 32 notes in the music buffer
        and plays them while executing other statements. Works very well for games.
        MF switches the PLAY mode back to normal. Default is MF.

====PRINT====
 PRINT [Argument] [,or;] [Argument]...
Displays text to the screen. The Argument can be a string literal, a string variable, a numeric literal or a numeric variable. All arguments are optional.
 PRINT #[n] [,or;] [Argument]...
Saves data to the file that is 'OPEN FOR OUTPUT AS #[n]'

====PSET====
 PSET ([X coordinate],[Y coordinate]), [Pixel Colour]
This command displays pixels, either one at a time or a group of them at once. For the command to work, the program must have a SCREEN command in it.

====SCREEN====
 SCREEN [Screen Mode Number]
This command is used for displaying graphics on the screen. There are ten main types of screen modes that can be used in QBasic depending on the resolution that you want. Here is a list of what screen modes you can choose from:

SCREEN 0: Textmode, cannot be used for graphics. This the screen mode that text based programs run on.

SCREEN 1: 320 x 200 Resolution. Four Colours

SCREEN 2: 640 x 200 Resolution. Two Colours (Black and White)

SCREEN 7: 320 x 200 Resolution. Sixteen Colours

SCREEN 8: 640 x 200 Resolution. Sixteen Colours

SCREEN 9: 640 x 350 Resolution. Sixteen Colours

SCREEN 10: 640 x 350 Resolution. Two Colours (Black and White)

SCREEN 11: 640 x 480 Resolution. Two Colours

SCREEN 12: 640 x 480 Resolution. Sixteen Colours

SCREEN 13: 320 x 200 Resolution. 256 Colours. (Recommended)

Note. In SCREEN 13 you have a colour Palette of 256 colours. The PALETTE is pre-set by Windows however you can change the RGB values using the PALETTE command.

====SEEK====
 SEEK #[file number], 1
Repositions the 'input #' pointer to the beginning of the file.

====SGN====
 SGN(expression yielding a numeric value)

Yields the 'sign' of a value, -1 if &lt; 0, 0 if 0, 1 if &gt; 0


====SLEEP====
 SLEEP [n]
Execution is suspended for n seconds

====SOUND====
 SOUND [frequency], [duration]
Unlike the BEEP command, this produces a sound from the PC speakers that is of a variable frequency and duration. The frequency is measured in Hertz and has a range from 37 to 32767. Put in one of these numbers in the frequency section. The duration is clock ticks that is defaulted at 18.2 ticks per second.

====STR$====
Converts a numeric value into a text (string) character

 A$ = STR$(expression yielding a numeric value)

The numeric value is converted into text characters and placed into A$. Used to convert numbers into a text string.

WARNING. If the result is positive, a leading 'space' is added (STR$(123) = &quot; 123&quot; and not &quot;123&quot; as might be expected). If the result is negative, instead of a space you get a '-' (minus sign), i.e. STR$(-123) = &quot;-123&quot; and not &quot; -123&quot; as might be expected from the positive behaviour.

See also CHR$ for converting an ascii value into a string character.

See also LEFT$, MID$, RIGHT$ for extracting sub-strings from a line of text.

====SYSTEM====
 SYSTEM
The .bas exits, the QBasic.exe interpreter is closed and 'control' passes to the Command Window c:\ prompt (or next line of a calling .cmd script etc.).

====THEN====
 [Command] [variable] = [value] THEN GOTO [line command value]
Used in conjunction with the GOTO or IF condition commands. It tells the computer what to do if a certain condition has been met.

====TO====
 [Command] [Variable] = [Value] TO [Value]
Usually used to input a number of variables.
 FOR a = 400 TO 500
 PRINT a
 NEXT a
This example will print all numbers from 400 to 500. Instead of declaring all values separately, we can get them all declared in one go.

====USING====
 USING &quot;format&quot;;
Used to format the output of data from PRINT commands. Normally, the QBasic interpreter will print a number as 8 characters with as many leading spaces as necessary. To change this behavour, the USING command can be used to format the output. For example ..

 IF n &gt; 99 THEN PRINT #1, USING &quot;###&quot;; n; ELSE IF n &gt; 9 THEN PRINT #1, USING &quot;0##&quot;; n; ELSE PRINT #1, USING &quot;00#&quot;; n;

.. will output n from 0 to 999 with leading zeros. Note the ';' after the n. This means 'don't start a new line' and results in the next PRINT #1 adding data directly after the comma (',') Qbasic automatically inserts instead of a line line.

====VAL()====
 name=VAL([variable$])
Converts the [variable string] contents into a numeric value so it can be used in calculations. If (name) is an INTEGER type, the VAL is rounded down. See also STR$.
 A$ = &quot;2 + 3&quot;
 B = VAL(A$)
 PRINT A$ is B
2 + 3 is 5

====WHILE ... WEND====
 WHILE {NOT} [test condition is true]
 [program code to execute]
 WEND
The condition is tested and if true (or NOT true) the [program] code is executed until WEND is reached, at which point control passes back to the WHILE line.
 WHILE NOT (EOF(1))
 LINE INPUT #1, A$
 PRINT #2, A$
 WEND
While the end of file #1 has not been reached, read each complete line and write it to file #2.

Unlike FOR and DO, it is not possible to EXIT from a WHILE loop

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Group 2 Spanish== 
Spanish B Higher Level (HL) suits someone who has studied the language for 4-5 years. Spanish Standard Level (SL) is suited to someone who has 2-5 years experience. Beginners should opt for Spanish ''ab initio''. Native or bilingual speakers, if already doing English or French in Group 1, should take Spanish A2 in Group 2. This wikibook focuses on Spanish B HL and SL.

==Differences between HL and SL==
The structure of the course should be similar whether studying HL or SL. However, HL students should have more allocated teaching time and more homework. In addition, HL students should be exposed to more complex language, be introduced to a variety of literary styles and explore more culture. While a SL student would be expected to communicate orally and in writing in a variety of common situations and with a certain degree of fluency, a HL student would be expected to communicate orally and in writing in a wide variety of situations with clarity and fluency.
SL and HL are differentiated by the recommended number of teaching hours, the depth of syllabus coverage, the study of literature at HL, and the level of difficulty and demands of assessment and assessment criteria.
The core—with topics common to both levels—is divided into three areas and is a required area of study.
• Communication and media
• Global issues
• Social relationships
In addition, at both SL and HL, teachers select two from the following five options.
• Cultural diversity
• Customs and traditions
• Health
• Leisure
• Science and technology

Also, at HL, students read two works of literature.

==Syllabus==
There is one Language B Guide that covers all (30+) languages taught in Group 2. This means that it is the responsibility of the teacher to design a course suitable for the needs of the students. Despite this freedom, there are two main strands around which a teacher can base his own course: Text Type (or Communicative Purpose) and Topics. In addition, the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing should be interlinked throughout the course.

==Types of Text==
The IB Spanish course is intended to prepare students to be able to understand and write a variety of types of texts, including: brochures, diary entries, police statements, anecdotes or short stories,   informal letters and emails, formal letters and emails, letters to a newspaper, news articles, opinion articles (editorials/columns), essays, reports, book reviews and film reviews. Students should also learn to write “spoken” texts such as interviews, speeches and conference presentations. The more complex texts should be reserved for HL students, for example: interviews, conference presentations, essays and creative writing. 

==Topics==
Anything related to Hispanic culture, society and history can be studied, as well as issues relating to young people and the international community, for example:  

''El deporte, la salud, el ocio, la moda, el botellón, el papel de la mujer, el machismo, las relaciones personales, el amor, el turismo, el medio ambiente, la solidaridad, la globalización, la educación, la lectura, la tecnología, el internet, el espanglish, las comunidades indígenas, las fiestas, las tradiciones, la tauromáquia, el flamenco, los gauchos, el tango argentino, la gastronomía, el arte, el cine, el narcotráfico, la política, los conflictos internacionales, la inmigración.'' 

==Authentic Resources==
It is very easy to find authentic resources in Spanish on the internet. For the news and current affairs use high quality websites such as http://www.rtve.es (Radio y televisión española), http://www.elpais.es, http://www.elmundo.es. Don’t limit yourself to articles; search in the archives for videos and podcasts too. http://www.youtube.com is fantastic for music videos (with lyrics), interviews with famous people, publicity, and is a lively source of background information on almost any topic. Films are a must for any student wanting to explore issues of culture and society. Films made in Spain and Latin America are becoming increasingly mainstream in the UK and are equally accessible to SL and HL students, for example: ''Volver, María llena eres de gracia, Amores Perros, Y tu mamá también, El orfanato, El laberinto del fauno, La lengua de las mariposas''.

==Literature==
HL Students are required to read two &quot;works&quot; authentic literature, such as whole books or plays or collections of poems or short stories. Accessible authors to start with include Federico García Lorca (''La casa de Bernarda Alba, Bodas de Sangre''), Laura Esquivel (''Como agua para chocolate''), Carlos Fuentes (''Aura''). Extracts of lengthier works can be studied in order to gain an appreciation for different styles including Gabriel García Márquez (''Cien años de soledad'', ''Crónica de una muerte anunciada''), Miguel Delibes (''Cinco Horas con Mario''), Fernando Fernán Gómez (''Las bicicletas son para el verano''), Jorge Luis Borges (''Ficciones''), Miguel de Cervantes (''Novelas ejemplares''), Juan Rulfo (''Pedro Párramo''), Pablo Neruda (''Confieso que he vivido''), Mario Vargas Llosa (''La fiesta del chivo'') Roberto Bolaño (''Los detectives salvajes''), Mario Benedetti (''Aquí se respira bien''), Luisa Castro (''La segunda mujer'').        

==Assessment and grading== 
Students sit two written exams: Paper 1 and Paper 2, each lasting 1hr30. In addition, a written assignment is produced under teacher supervision during the school year. Internal Assessment comprises Interactive Orals and an Individual Oral. Students are assessed throughout on their Language, Interaction and Message. 

The grade boundaries shift slightly in every exam sessions, and remain to be established in the new program for initial testing in 2013.

Externally assessed written assignment: This paper, new to the curriculum for 2013, is written by students under teacher supervision, but submitted for external evaluation. For HL, the paper is based on the literature topics studied. For SL, it is based on a selection of three related non-literary readings which the student uses as a basis for the paper. 

==Paper 1 (Text Handling)   1hr30    40%==
'''Section A) Reading Comprehension''': 30-40 questions based on 4 texts (Texts A, B and C). Question types include true or false with a justification, looking for synonyms, inserting conjunctions, identifying which noun a pronoun refers to, matching titles with paragraphs, multiple choice, identifying the main purpose of the text. All answers should be exact words lifted from the text; do not try to explain or paraphrase. 1 mark is allocated to each question.

==Paper 2 (Writing in Registers)   1hr30    30%==
Students have a choice of 5 topics covering different areas of study and types of text. 
In addition, HL students have a second written item reacting to a short reading.

==Internal Assessment    30%''' == 
'''Interactive Oral''': At least 3 group orals should be assessed in the final year of the course and the best mark is put forward. Interactive Orals can take many forms, for example: a prepared presentation followed by questions, a formal debate, an informal discussion, a role-play, or a spontaneous response to a film-clip. Interactive orals are marked by the teacher. The more orals done in class, the less nerve-wrecking they become.     

'''Individual Oral''': The Individual Oral takes place in the final year and lasts 8-10 minutes. It is conducted and marked by the teacher and recorded for external moderation. The mark is added to the best Interactive Oral mark. Part 1 is a 3-4 minute presentation on a picture related to a curriculum theme. Part 2 involves 5-6 minutes of unprepared discussion with the teacher based on the picture's topic.      

==Extended Essay in Spanish== 
Students can choose to write their Extended Essay (''la monografía'') in Spanish as part of Group 2. The EE can be written either on aspects of Language, Culture &amp; Society, or Literature. Students should read carefully the Extended Essay Guide (2009) and the Group 2 Subject Specific criteria. Writing the EE in Spanish is excellent preparation for university study of the language.

      <comment>/* Equation of Motion, in terms of displacement, amplitude and time */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== SHM Equations of Motion == 

=== Defining Equation of Motion (in terms of acceleration and displacement) ===

By definition, a particle performs '''simple harmonic motion (SHM)''' when
* the magnitude of its acceleration &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is ''proportional'' to the magnitude of its displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from some fixed point, '''and'''
* its acceleration and displacement are in ''opposite'' directions.

More formally, SHM occurs whenever the equation of motion &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=-kx&lt;/math&gt; holds, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant. By convention, we write &lt;math&gt;k=\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; (we will explain the significance of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; later) so the equation becomes &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=-\omega^2 x&lt;/math&gt;.

Simple harmonic oscillators are easy to find in the real world. The undamped oscillation of a mass attached to an elastic string or spring is just one example in the realm of mechanics. Before studying such examples, let us first examine the characteristics of SHM using the abstract model described below.

Consider the following oscillator with an ''oscillation amplitude'' of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denote its '''displacement''' from the origin, and &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt; its '''acceleration'''.

[[Image:shm1.png|400px]]

Let us restate the defining equation for SHM:

{| style=&quot;border:2px solid red&quot;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=-\omega^2 x \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Recall that the algebraic variables representing displacement and its derivatives wrt time represent ''one-dimensional vector quantities'' (i.e. they all lie on a line). If the value of the variable is positive, then its vector points in the positive direction; if it is negative, its vector points in the other direction.

Observe that when the &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=0&lt;/math&gt;. By '''Newton's Second Law''', the ''resultant force'' &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; acting on the oscillator is zero at this instance.

When &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. to the right of the origin), the resultant force points to the left, towards the origin. When &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the resultant force points to the right, towards the origin. Because the resultant force always points towards the origin whenever the oscillator is not at the origin, the resultant force can be termed a '''restoring force'''. The behaviour of the restoring force suggests that the speed of the oscillator is maximum at the origin and is zero at the two ends where it changes direction (i.e. &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x=\pm a&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Equation of Motion, in terms of velocity, amplitude and displacement===

Now, let us rewrite the defining SHM equation in terms of the '''velocity''' &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and '''displacement''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We make the following substitution: &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=v\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;v\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\int v \,dv&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 \int x \,dx&lt;/math&gt; (separating variables)
|-
|}

Using &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=\pm a&lt;/math&gt; as one pair of limits for the integral, we get

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\int_0^v v \,dv&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 \int_{\pm a}^x x \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left[ \frac{1}{2} v^2 \right]_0^v&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 \left[ \frac{1}{2} x^2 \right]_{\pm a}^x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;border:2px solid red&quot;|&lt;math&gt;v^2=\omega^2 (a^2 - x^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}


Now, it is clear that the speed is maximum when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; (in which case &lt;math&gt;v=\pm\omega a&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x=\pm a&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Equation of Motion, in terms of displacement, amplitude and time ===

The significance of the constant &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; will become clear once we express the defining SHM equation in terms of the '''displacement''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and '''time''' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-|
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\omega^2 x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

This is just a ''second-order ordinary differential equation with constant
coefficients''. The ''characteristic equation'' (as a function of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;) is given by:

&lt;math&gt; m^2 + \omega^2 =0 \Rightarrow m = \pm \sqrt{-\omega^2} \Rightarrow m = \pm \mathrm{i}\omega &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the general solution to the differential equation may be
written as:

&lt;math&gt;x=A_1\cos (\omega t) + A_2\sin (\omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;x=A_3\cos (\omega t + \varepsilon)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

To solve for the pairs of constants &lt;math&gt;\{A_1,A_2\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{A_3,\varepsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;, we need a pair of ''initial conditions'' describing the SHM.

If the particle starts ''from rest'' at the maximum displacement &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt;, then we substitute &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;A_1=a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_2=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_3=a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=0&lt;/math&gt;. The solution becomes &lt;math&gt;x=a \cos (\omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, if the oscillation begins at minimium displacement, then we obtain &lt;math&gt;x=a \sin (\omega t)=a\cos\left(\omega t - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, we have

{| style=&quot;border:2px solid red&quot;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x=a \cos(\omega t + \varepsilon) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

where the constant &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; depends on the starting position of the oscillator. 

These equations show that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is just the '''constant angular velocity''' (or angular frequency) associated with the SHM. The following figure illustrates this relationship between ''SHM'' and ''uniform circular motion'' (with an angular velocity of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;). The displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the simple harmonic oscillator is really just the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate of the particle performing uniform circular motion. We can therefore think of SHM as a projection of uniform circular motion onto the diameter of the circle.

The simple harmonic oscillator completes ''one oscillation'' whenever it traverses twice the end-to-end distance (i.e. a distance of &lt;math&gt;4a&lt;/math&gt;). This corresponds to ''one revolution'' around the circle in the case of uniform circular motion. Thus, the '''period of oscillation''' in SHM is given by

{| style=&quot;border:2px solid red&quot;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

== Example: Mass on an Elastic String ==

We wish to determine if a mass suspended on a light (i.e. massless) elastic string will demonstrate SHM.

Consider a light elastic string with ''natural length'' &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and ''modulus of elasticity'' &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; suspended vertically from a fixed point O. The other end of the string is attached to a particle of ''mass'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[Image:shm2.png|150px|left]]

Let the point E denote the '''equilibrium position''' of the particle. At E, the particle is at rest (i.e. the resultant force acting on it is zero). Let &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; denote the extension of the string when the particle is at E. Considering the vertical forces on the particle gives:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda}{l}e = mg \Rightarrow e= \frac{mgl}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;.

The displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the mass is always measured from the equilibrium position E, since this is the point where &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=0&lt;/math&gt; and hence, the resultant force &lt;math&gt;F=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose the mass experiences a small displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Applying '''Newton's Second Law''' produces

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;mg-T&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;mg-\frac{\lambda}{l}(e+x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;mg-\frac{\lambda}{l}e - \frac{\lambda}{l}x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;- \frac{\lambda}{l}x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;mg=\frac{\lambda}{l}e&lt;/math&gt;) 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\frac{\lambda}{ml}x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

which is the defining equation of motion for SHM, with &lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = \frac{\lambda}{ml}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the particle performs SHM only when the string remains taut, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

      <comment>/* 12IF.BAS */ Added RANDOMIZE TIMER line.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conditional execution==
To choose between two or more sections of the program to execute, the IF statement can be used. It is also possible to use the WHILE, DO UNTIL and CASE statements. All of these control conditional execution by using a Boolean logic 'test', the result of which is either TRUE or FALSE. To repeat a section of code for a set number of times, the FOR statement is used.

The IF test can be executed in a single line, however it can also be used like the others to control a block of code.  

==True or False==
Boolean logic is a test that yields one of only two possible results, true or false. The tests are always mathematical in nature .. when two characters (or strings) are 'compared' it is their ASCII codes that are used (thus a &lt; b and b &lt; A).

The comparison operators used in qbasic are:
= true if two variables are equal
&lt; true if the first is less than the second
=&lt; true if the first is less than or equal to the second
&gt; true if the first is greater than the second
&gt;= true if the first is greater than or equal to the second
&lt;&gt; true if the two are unequal

Multiple tests can be linked together in the comparison, using the 'AND', 'OR' and 'NOT' operators. We will cover exactly what these mean later on, but you probably understand the first two already.

==IF==
One of the most useful statements in QBasic is the IF statement. It allows you to choose what your program will do depending on the conditions you give it. The next few programs will be taking a look at ways to use the IF statement.

 IF [conditional] THEN [do this]

The single line IF is the simplest example. To execute a block of code, the END IF is used

  IF [conditional] THEN
    [do this]
    [and do this]
     ...
    [and also do this]
  END IF

==IF...THEN...ELSE==

 IF [conditional] THEN [do this] ELSE [do that]

To choose between two different code blocks, the ELSE statement is used.

 IF [conditional] THEN
   [do this]
   ..
   [and do this]
 ELSE
   [do that]
   ..
   [and also that]
 END IF

==13IFELSE.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 RANDOMIZE TIMER

 num = INT(RND * 20) + 1
 INPUT &quot;Pick a number between 1 and 20: &quot;, answer

 IF answer = num THEN PRINT &quot;You Win&quot; ELSE PRINT &quot;You Lose&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==FOR...NEXT==

 FOR &lt;variable name&gt; = &lt;start value&gt; TO &lt;end value&gt; [STEP &lt;increment&gt;]
  [do this]
  ...
  [and do this]
 NEXT

&lt;increment&gt; may be + or - and is optional. If omitted the default is +1. The code contained within the FOR loop will always be executed at least once because it is only at the 'NEXT' statement that the value of the variable is checked against the end value.

When the NEXT statement executes, the variable is modified by STEP value and compared against the end value. If the variable has not yet exceeded the end value, control is returned to the line following the FOR.

You can exit a FOR loop early with the '''EXIT FOR''' command.  

==14FOR.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 RANDOMIZE TIMER

 num = INT(RND * 20) + 1

 FOR count = 1 TO 5
  INPUT &quot;Pick a number between 1 and 20: &quot;, answer
  IF answer = num THEN PRINT &quot;You win after&quot;;count;&quot;guesses!&quot;: END
 NEXT
 PRINT &quot;You lose&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== WHILE...WEND ==

  WHILE &lt;condition is true&gt;
    [do this]
    ..
    [and this]
  WEND

If the condition is true, the code following the WHILE is executed. When the WEND command is executed, it returns control to the WHILE statement (where the condition is tested again). When the condition evaluates to FALSE, control is passed to the statement following the WEND.

== 15WHILE.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
PRINT &quot;Press any key to continue&quot;
WHILE INKEY$=&quot;&quot;
WEND
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above, you see a press any key prompt that waits until the user presses a key.  (The INKEY$ feature will be described under [[QBasic/Advanced Input|Advanced Input]].)


== DO...LOOP ==

  DO
    [this]
    ..
    [and this]
  LOOP WHILE &lt;condition is true&gt; / LOOP UNTIL &lt;condition is true&gt;

The '''DO...LOOP''' construct is a more advanced of the WHILE loop - as with other flow control blocks, it is marked by '''DO''' and '''LOOP''' to denote the boundaries.

It relies on a conditional statement placed after either DO or LOOP:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
DO
  a$ = inkey$
LOOP WHILE a$=&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

As an alternative, you can instead replace '''WHILE''' with '''UNTIL''' have the loop continue until a specific condition is met:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
DO
  x=x+1
LOOP UNTIL x &gt;= 10
&lt;/source&gt;


==12IF.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 RANDOMIZE TIMER

 num = INT(RND * 100) + 1
 DO 
      INPUT &quot;Pick a number between 1 and 100: &quot;, answer

      IF num = answer THEN PRINT &quot;You Got It!&quot;
      IF num &gt; answer THEN PRINT &quot;Too Small&quot;
      IF num &lt; answer THEN PRINT &quot;Too big&quot;
LOOP UNTIL num = answer
PRINT &quot;Game Over.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== SELECT CASE ==

  SELECT CASE &lt;variable expression&gt;
    CASE &lt;value&gt;
      [do this]
    CASE &lt;value 2&gt;
      [do instead]
    ...
    CASE ELSE
    ...
  END SELECT

The select statement is a substitute for repeated use of IF statements.  The &lt;variable expression&gt; is evaluated and compared against each CASE &lt;value&gt; in turn. When a CASE &lt;value&gt; is found to match, the [do this] code following is executed. If an EXIT CASE is executed, control passes to the line following the END SELECT, otherwise the next CASE &lt;value&gt; is checked. If no matches are found, the CASE ELSE is executed. Note that &lt;value&gt; may be a number, character or string or logical expression (eg '&gt;0', '&lt;&gt;1'). Note also that multiple CASE matches may be found and executed (so, for example, if two CASE &lt;values&gt; are 'CASE &gt;1' and 'CASE &gt;10', a &lt;variable expression&gt; that evaluates to 11 (or more) will result in both CASE &gt;1 and CASE &gt;10 being executed)

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
CLS
PRINT &quot;WELCOME&quot;
PRINT &quot;I HAVE ANSWER FOR ANY OF YOUR QUESTION&quot;
input &quot;WRITE YOUR QUESTION AND I'L GIVE YOU ANSWER &quot;, question$
10 RANDOMIZE TIMER
PRINT
answer=INT(RND*10+1)
SELECT CASE answer
  
 PRINT &quot;pls rephrase your question .&quot;
  CASE 2
    PRINT &quot;Your question is meaningless .&quot;
  CASE 3
    PRINT &quot;do you think i cant answer this.&quot;
  CASE 4 
    PRINT &quot;the question looks funny.&quot;
END SELECT
PRINT &quot;ENTER ANOTHER QUESTION&quot;, K$
GOTO 10
&lt;/source&gt;

If a parameter would be covered by more than one case statement, the first option will take priority.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauce|Sauce]]

'''Barbecue Sauce''' is a [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] or [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] based [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] used on [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]]. Kansas City-style barbecue sauce is the most common version used in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]]. It is tomato or ketchup based with sweet, sour and smoky elements. Barbecue sauce can be added to the meat before, during or after cooking. This version contains quite a bit of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], so it should be added near the end or after cooking the meat to avoid burning the sauce.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (235 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (90 mL) [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
*4 tablespoons (60 mL) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*3 tablespoons (45 mL) white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1 tablespoon (15 mL) plain prepared [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*3 tablespoons (45 mL) finely minced yellow [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] (20 mL) bottled [[Cookbook:Liquid Smoke|liquid smoke]] flavor (hickory)
*1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) Louisiana-style [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]] [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]
*1/2 cup (120 mL) [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*1 tablespoon (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]]
*1 teaspoon (5 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

Makes 2 cups (470 mL) of sauce.

==Procedure==
#Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan.
#Mix well.
#[[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] over low heat for 20-minutes, stirring occasionally.

==Notes, tips and variations==

#This sauce tastes very close to commercial barbecue sauces such as Masterpiece and Bullseye.

==Warnings==
* Keep refrigerated
* Add to meat near end or after cooking to avoid burning sauce because of sugar content.

'''Yogurt''' is a pudding-like food made from milk fermented in a culture of (typically) ''Lactobacillus delbrueckii  bulgaricus'' and ''Streptococcus salivarius thermophilus''. At the end of the process, the yogurt is usually heated to kill the bacteria. &quot;Live active culture&quot; is a type of yogurt that has the live bacteria still in it. Some people believe that this &quot;live&quot; yogurt has special health benefits.

Lactic and other acids produced during fermentation give it a slightly sour taste. It is usually eaten with [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] or [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]].

Yogurt can also be used as a garnish for savoury food, particularly in the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]] and [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asia]]. It is the basis for [[Cookbook:Raita|raita]]. 

Yogurt can also be substituted for [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] when baking, as in the recipe for [[Cookbook:Corn Muffins|Corn Muffins]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Eldatencelion}}
Fantasy author [[w:Tolkien|J. R. R. Tolkien]] invented many writing systems to be used by his [[w:Elves(Middle-earth)|Elves]] and other races in his fictional world of [[w:Middle-earth|Middle-earth]].

This is a detailed account of the writing systems used by the Elves. The essay is concentrated on the process of time in the fictional history and the Ages of Middle-earth, and its purpose is to show how writing could have evolved by various races of the legendarium, as well as the interrelation between modes. The logical process behind evolution of each system from the other is speculated.

==Disclaimer==
The document doesn't include many explicit quotes from Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s writings for reference, but it is clear that many statements set forth are conclusions out of the authors' judgement from the sources and evidence. Words like &amp;ldquo;assume&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;speculate&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;reconstruct&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;must&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;perhaps&amp;rdquo; are used, and the reader must have in mind that these theories have not been ensured by examples or explicitly stated by Tolkien.

The same applies to the examples of some writing systems, like early Certhas, specimina of which Tolkien haven&amp;rsquo;t left to us at present. On the contrary, this essay provides all of known (elvish) Tengwar samples that have been written by Tolkien, leaving the final judgment to the reader.
===What this document is not===
*The document is by no means a tutorial for starters, or a guide of how to write Tengwar. Although it can be used as such, there are better and more practical tutorials and guides available. What can it be used for is a reference guide for all known systems (some of them hypothetical or reconstructed) and is recommended as a supplement for such a study by a starter. 
*The document does not try to describe every single system that came into Tolkien’s mind, but takes account only his &amp;ldquo;latest&amp;rdquo; elaborations that he must have considered &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; while writing '''Lord of the Rings''' and the later '''Silmarillion'''. So no description of the early Sarati, the &amp;ldquo;Valmaric script&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Runes of Pengolodh&amp;rdquo; will be found there.
*English and Old English modes for Tengwar devised by Tolkien won't be described either.

===Legal remarks===
The essay tries not to show anything that goes beyond Fair Use and doesn&amp;rsquo;t quote so extensively from Tolkien's work as to run afoul of it. All quotation is used for the purpose of supporting the analysis that forms the vast majority of the work.

== History ==
''Eldatencelion'' started as a timeline of all the changes that took place forming the Elvish writing systems according to the information given in '''Appendix E''' to '''The Lord of the Rings'''. An early form was hosted kindly in [http://elvish.org/gwaith Gwaith-i-Phethdain] in a portable document format, and was soon translated into Italian by [http://www.eldalie.it Eldalie.it]. It was ported to wiki format on January 2005 and has been improved and changed ever since.

== On reading this document ==
The reader must have the following way of formatting in mind:
* Names of published corpus are in bold: '''LotR, King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''', '''Moria Gate Inscription'''
* Words or sounds used as samples (usually elvish) are in italic: ''thúle, parma''
* Tengwar names are not in italic, but their first letter is capital: Thúle, Parma
* Minus &lt; and major &gt; are used to show etymological process or change in pronounciation: ''*áse &gt; áze &gt; áre''
* Non-attested hypothetical forms (usually archaic) are asterisked: ''alda &lt; *galadâ ''
* Wrong forms are asterisked twice: ''alda &lt; *galadâ'', not ''**aladâ''
* Primitive stems and etymological roots are always in capital: ''alda'' &lt; GALAD

FA, SA and TA mean First, Second and Third Age respectively.

'''Note:''' The document makes heavy use of certain fonts of Tengwar, Runes and, in a case, Sarati. The fonts that need to be installed in order to view this document properly are:
* [http://at.mansbjorkman.net/saratieldamar.htm Sarati Eldamar] and
* [http://at.mansbjorkman.net/parmaite.htm Tengwar Parmaite], both by Måns Björkman
* [http://www.acondia.com/fonts/cirth/ Cirth Erebor] by Dan Smith
* [http://www.tolkiendil.com/telechargements/polices/angerthas_et_runes#gondolin Gondolindic Runes] by Ronald Kyrmse

Some other compatible fonts will also work since most of the best-known tengwar fonts follow the layout proposed by Dan Smith. In some cases, Tengwar doesn&amp;rsquo;t render correctly in ''Internet Explorer'', so other browsers are recommended (the display is fine in ''Mozilla Firefox''). The problem can alternatively be overpassed by copying and pasting the text into a word processor such as ''MS Word''.

{{Template:Eldatencelion}}

= Sarati =
Rúmil of Tirion was a Noldorin scholar and the composer of Ainulindale. Before that he was the inventor of the first elvish writing system in the Valian Year 1179. It has been suggested that his system was based on an even more ancient, unrecorded writing system of the Noldor, but this is hardly probable. The Sarati (&amp;ldquo;significant marks&amp;rdquo;), as he called his letters, were ideal for writing both on stone and on paper, but we have only seen what seems to be their &amp;ldquo;calligraphic&amp;rdquo; versions.

Several different writing-directions were used with the script. Rúmilian texts were written in rows or in columns like Japanese, LTR like the western scripts, RTL like eastern scripts or boustrophedon (RTL&amp;ndash;LTR&amp;ndash;RTL etc.) like some ancient Greek inscriptions.

Rúmil decided that the vowels should be written with diacritics and not with independent letters, since, according to the linguistic perceptions of the Valinorean loremasters, vowels were considered as &amp;ldquo;colours&amp;rdquo; of the consonants.

Todate various interinconsistent modes of Sarati have been published, from various stages of Tolkien's youth and development. They are mostly used for English or early Qenya words and phrases. Unfortunately there is no definite, compatible to Lord of the Rings-Quenya mode of Sarati known.

= Early Tengwar =
Fëanáro Curufinwë (better known as Fëanor) invented the tengwar (&amp;ldquo;signs representing audible phonemes&amp;rdquo;), strongly influenced by the Sarati, in the Valian Year 1250. From that time on, the term Sarati, from the general notions of &amp;ldquo;letter&amp;rdquo;, only refers to the Rúmilian writing system.
==Rumilian Influence==
With the first sight one might observe the stylistic influence of the Sarati. Especially two of the sarati (namely ''P'' &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tirion Sarati'; font-size: 3em;&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and ''B'' &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tirion Sarati'; font-size: 3em;&quot;&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) are visually similar to the shape of a tengwa, since their morphology is consisted of a &amp;ldquo;line&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;curves&amp;rdquo;. The organization of the tengwar follows the aforementioned concept, where the form of the letter reflexes its sound. Fëanor decided that the doubling of a &amp;ldquo;curve&amp;rdquo; should add voice to the &amp;ldquo;basic&amp;rdquo; sound, and generally the way the &amp;ldquo;curves&amp;rdquo; are doubled is similar to the &amp;ldquo;p&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;b&amp;rdquo; sarati, so these two sarati must be his main inspiration.

Fëanor therefore, by reducing the number of variable elements, produced a simpler and more consistent set of characters. The two basic elements of the tengwar were a &amp;ldquo;stem&amp;rdquo; (telco) and a &amp;ldquo;bow&amp;rdquo; (lúva), which could be combined and modified in a number of different ways. Fëanor decided that the tengwar whose telcor and lúvar were organized in a particular way, represented a certain group of related sounds: The telcor determined how the sound was articulated, and the lúvar where in the mouth it was made.

The greatest difference between the systems was that the tengwar were written from left to right. 
=== Table  ===
It is more probable that the Tengwar system was not especially based on the needs of Quenya, Feanor's mother tongue; this is obvious when we compare the [[../Age of Starlight#Original Quenya mode|Quenya mode table]] with other, [[../Third_Age#&quot;General Use&quot;|later modes]], where the phonemes fit to the Tengwar table more consistently. It is therefore possible that the Tengwar started initially more like a generic phonological 'template', on which all later derived modes and spellings could be based. The dialects of Aman as well as ancient reconstructed words could then be written with an adaptation of that generic system.

The following table is based on a theory by Jim Allan, published in '''An Introduction to Elvish'''. It shows a reconstruction of the original theoretical 'template' of the Tengwar, perhaps never used in any language. 

The only mode known closest to the theoretical values would be the [[../Second Age#General_Use_mode|General Use mode]], of which we first hear millennia later.

Note that the second-to-last series represents voiceless consonants.

=Quanta Sarme=
Unlike Rúmil, Fëanor considered vowels as indepedent sounds and not just &amp;ldquo;colours&amp;rdquo; of the consonants, so he devised the &amp;ldquo;full writing&amp;rdquo; (Quanta Sarmë).

Quanta Sarme had distinct letters for vowels (ómëar or óma-tengwi), and was used by the Loremasters for special purposes only&lt;ref&gt;Appendix D to '''Quendi and Eldar'''&lt;/ref&gt;. No texts of this system are known to us, and its usage and characters are unknown, but Tolkien says that it was used in Middle-earth for other languages, like Sindarin, where the tehta-mode was inconvenient. 

This system is not heard much thereafter and it seems that its usage hasn't endured into the following Ages. However by the above information, we can easily assume that it was the predecessor of the [[../First_Age#Mode_of_Beleriand|Mode of Beleriand]], and the letter Osse &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;]&lt;/em&gt; is maybe the only remnant of that (otherwise extinct) system.

=Original Quenya mode=
Despite Fëanor is said to prefer the Quanta Sarme, he also used a more 'conservative' system which (judging by the majority of the subsequent samples) seem to have been proved far more popular. Fëanor held the idea of syllabic analysis of the words by the Sarati, and made also use of signs (tehtar) for vowels (instead of the full letters), placed over the preceding tengwar/consonants, indicating their &amp;ldquo;colour&amp;rdquo;. A consonant followed by a vowel was concidered as a &amp;ldquo;full letter&amp;rdquo; (ñávëa or ñáva-tengwë). The sarat &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tirion Sarati'; font-size: 2em;&quot;&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;/em&gt; was imported from the previous system, and when a vowel had no preceding consonant, it was used as a carrier for convenience in writing. This system however was used by Fëanor mainly for tradition and brevity, favouring the Quanta Sarme instead.

Apart of the standard consistent characters, there were also additional tengwar which don't fit in the structure. These are usually modifications of the standard tengwar. Hyarmen is a modification of Charma, Úre is of Wilya, and Anna derived from an earlier sarat.

=== Table ===
According to '''Appendix E''' (mixed with other recently published sources) and our knowledge on Quenya phonology evolution&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/qevolution.pdf The Evolution of Primitive Elvish to Quenya]: Valinorean&lt;/ref&gt;, we can reconstruct a Tengwar table, hopefully as close to the original Feanor's concept as possible:

=== Notes ===
'''Tengwar names''': The names given in '''Appendix E''' were based on the 3rd Age table composed in Gondor. It is not known if this arrangement was given then or existed since Fëanor&amp;rsquo;s days. It is possible, however, that some of the known names may have replaced earlier, unrecorded forms. The best that can be done here is to give the oldest known names (e.g. Charma instead of Aha). This is our evidence:

'''Anna''' originally represented ''3'', a sound from primitive ''g'' (cf. ''*galadâ &gt; *galda &gt; *3alda &gt; alda''). The ''3'' sound was early lost, and Anna was used as an initial vowel carrier to indicate an assuming &amp;ldquo;vanished&amp;rdquo; initial consonant wherever words begun with a vowel (note that its &quot;ancestor&quot;, the sarat &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tirion Sarati'&quot;&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, was also used for ''3'' before being used as a carrier. It was inherited as a carrier by Fëanor, and later it replaced initial Anna). This usage tried to explain the relation of words between Noldorin words starting with a vowel where Telerin had ''g-'' (cf. Quenya ''alda'' vs. Telerin ''galla''), but did not explain all the cases of words without an initial consonant (''alca'', according to this, should be spelled *&lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica',; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;hDjaE&lt;/em&gt; that time, although it had never been ''**galka'' before). The problem with the name is that Anna is given as derived from the root AN, and not *GAN (although there is some evidence that the latter root is the correct, and therefore its archaic form was ''*3anna'').

'''Halla''' represented an archaic breath ''h'', that survived from primitive H only in Amanye languages, while Charma represented ''ch'', that derived from Primitive KH. The problem is that the ''h'' of the word ''halla'' evolved from the latter sound: KHAL &gt; ''*khallâ &gt; halla'', therefore pronounced ''*challa'' in Fëanor&amp;rsquo;s time. We are lead to the conclusion that there must be another ancient unrecorded name for this letter that had the breath sound ''h''!

'''Óre''': Óre is given by Tolkien as /&amp;#633;/: &amp;ldquo;weak (untrilled) ''r'', originally occurring in Quenya&amp;rdquo; (Appendix E). This quote suggests that Quenya originally contrasted /&amp;#633;/ and /r/, since there would be no need for independent letters if the two sounds were merely [[:wikipedia:allophone|allophones]] of each other. In this case, however, the original distribution of the letters Óre and Rómen must have been different from the one we observe at the end of the Third Age, where both letters are in perfectly complementary distribution, no contrast being possible. If Óre is the original name of this letter, this could mean that it is one of the words with original /&amp;#633;/.

The problem about the sound of /&amp;#633;/ is that there is no other evidence apart from the mentioned quote.

'''Extended stems''': As we are told in '''Appendix E''', the original Fëanorean alphabet contained a Grade of &amp;ldquo;extended&amp;rdquo; stems, both raised and lowered. The usage of those tengwar (whose names, if they had, are of course unknown) was to represent spirant sounds. As we know, no Amanya language possessed spirant sounds, since the Primitive spirants ''th, ph'', and ''kh'' had already became ''th, f'' and ''ch'' in Quenya. It is possible that they were used for recording Valarin or maybe archaic forms.

'''Tyelpetéma''': '''Appendix E''' informs us that Quenya also made use of a palatal series, the Tyelpetéma. Christopher Tolkien, who made the names known, notes that the names are given in a number of different formulations, and he cannot determine which were the standard ones. The only difference from the Tincotéma was the underposed (for tengwar with raised stems) and overposed (for tengwar with lowered stems) dots. Those tengwar, not included in the table of the '''Appendix E''', must have been ommited from the standard letters.

'''Áze''': The /z/ sound later changed to /r/ only in the Noldorin dialect, and this letter took the name Áre.

'''Azya''': This tengwa is given as Arya, and is attested either as a Rómen or as an Óre with the overdots. Since the sound ''ry'' derives from original ''sy &gt; zy'' (still present in Vanyarin), the form of the letter should be Áze with the dots, changed after ''z'' merged with ''r''. But then this tengwa should be placed among the Additional Tengwar, for it is not consisted of a telco and a lúva.

'''Yanta''': Yanta's shape reminds of the Rúmilian letter for ''y''. It might have represented this sound too (Yanta probably written *&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lD4#&lt;/em&gt;, while this word should read **''ainta'' in 3rd Age spelling). In our attested examples of 3rd Age texts, it occurs only as the -''i'' of dipthongs (in &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lH&lt;/em&gt; ''ai'', ''oi'' etc.). Maybe e.g. ''tuilë'' was originally spelled *&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1UlUj$&lt;/em&gt; (''tuyulë'') like in Rúmilian orthography, before simplified to &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1lUj$&lt;/em&gt;. Cf. Úre.

'''Úrë''': Besides that in the attested examples of 3rd Age, Úre appeas as the -''u'' of the dipthongs (&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.D&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.F&lt;/em&gt; ''au'', ''eu'' etc.), its original use and etymological relation to the word ''úrë'' itself are unknown. Since it&amp;rsquo;s attested in diphthongs in our samples like Yanta is, we can suppose it was used for intervocalic ''w'', which later became ''v''. Maybe ''taurë'' was originally spelled *&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1D.D7R&lt;/em&gt; (''tawarë'') before simplified to &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1.D7R&lt;/em&gt;, while for initial ''w'', only Wilya was used. Jim Allan suggested that ''úre'' should be written as &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.J7R&lt;/em&gt;, a function that reminds of the Rúmilian spelling of long ''u''… &amp;ndash; or maybe it was used as ''u'' in Quanta Sarme, like in the Mode of Beleriand? Cf. Yanta.

'''Thúlë''': In Noldorin Quenya the sound ''th'' had merged with ''s'' since very early. The word thúlë thus became ''súlë''.

'''Ñoldo/Ñwalmë''': Those sounds were found only initially. Sometimes written ''ng-'' and ''ngw-'', but not to be confused with Anga/Ungwe, which are used only medially.

'''Nuquernë Tengwar''': The table of '''Appendix E''' gives us the inverted forms of Silmë and Ázë, which were used when followed by a vowel (since they were too tall to receive a tehta). It is not known if these forms were invented by Fëanor or by later users, but Silmë Nuquerna was used in the Mode of Beleriand (as a vocalic ''y''), which makes us think it was already present in Valinor. If we are to suppose that the original form of Arya was an Ázë with dots, there must also have been an inverted form of it (Arya Nuquerna).

=== Examples ===
Like the Sarati, the Amanya system of the tengwar is also unknown at this point. According to the theories mentioned above, they will be tentatively reconstructed, showing some tengwar transcriptions of various Quenya words as pronounced in Fëanor&amp;rsquo;s time. For better understanding the words and the connection between spelling and etymology, alongside are given the etymological roots or the better attested later Quenya forms:
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;dE6U&lt;/em&gt;, ''*cheru'' &lt; KHER
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1E.6R&lt;/em&gt;, ''taurë''
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1`C.D6R&lt;/em&gt;, ''*tawarë &gt; tavar''
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;`C.D,Fj&lt;/em&gt;, ''*awazel &gt; aurel''
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;hEm#&lt;/em&gt;, ''*3alda &gt; alda
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1Ulj$&lt;/em&gt;, ''tuilë'' &lt; TUY

====Possible examples of Quanta Sarme==== 
We know absolutely nothing about the Quanta Sarme orthography and the following are '''purely conjectural''', based solely on what we know about 'classical' tengwar.
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;],Ö]&lt;/em&gt;, ''azya'' 
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;l]y]55]&lt;/em&gt;, ''Yavanna'' 
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;½]5.&lt;/em&gt;, ''hanu'' &lt; HAN

= An alternative mode =
For variant spellings, the general hypothetical 'template' above could have been implemented. For example, we have no clue on how the Vanyar and Teleri used the known Tengwar, since their dialect possessed sounds not found in Noldorin, like indepedent ''d'' and ''b''. The Vanyarin poem&amp;rsquo;s name, ''Aldudénie'', is known from the '''Silmarillion''', and the word ''ulban'', &amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo;, is also adapted from Valarin by the Vanyar. They could probably write these words by modifying this flexible system according to their language (like the Noldor and the alien speakers did later in Middle-earth), but some sources state that the Vanyar kept the Sarati{{fact}}. Tolkien notes that the system of Fëanor provided the means of expressions for more sounds than those occuring in Quenya and Telerin, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention them or the reasons.

In '''Addenda et corrigenda to the Etymologies''', an old version of the tengwar by Tolkien appears. Some tengwar have different names and values. It is not known if this mode coexisted with the one presented above, or if one evolved after the other.

= Certhas =
During that time, the Sindar of Beleriand began developing an alphabet for their language. Its letters were entirely made for carving on wood, stone or metal, hence their angular forms and straight lines. These letters were named ''cirth'' (sing. ''certh'').

The assignment of values was unsystematic. The form of a certh was consisted of a stem and a branch. The branch was found usually on the right side of the stem, and sometimes on the left, but with no phonetic significance. Therefore &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;3&lt;/em&gt; would just be an alternative form of &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;.

The following cirth were given by Tolkien as the most ancient of the later [[../Second_Age#Angerthas_Daeron|Angerthas]]. They had possibly different values at that time than the ones given below. Since we lack any other evidence though, we will use the known standard values of the letters to have a framework of discussion and make our comparisons; this is not so far-fetched as it seems: it's possible that at some later stage, some sound values were 'stuck' to some of the cirth, setting some stable basis for Daeron to make his final [[../Age of Starlight#Certhas Daeron|standardization]].

If we are to accept the known values to these old Cirth, we will observe that they don&amp;rsquo;t cover all the sounds of Sindarin, since we are missing ''rh'', ''lh'', ''mh'', ''v'', ''y'', ''œ''. The most possible explanation is that those early Cirth were used for the &amp;ldquo;Old Sindarin&amp;rdquo; tongue, and many of the above mentioned sounds indeed didn&amp;rsquo;t exist in that language. However this doesn't explain the absence of sounds ''w'' and ''a''. This indicates that some ancient, unknown cirth could have existed, but didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the later systems and therefore aren't given by Tolkien; a fuller table therefore can't be reconstructed.

As for the vowel usage, perhaps the certh for ''u'' possibly was used for ''w'' (like in early latin orthography). The certh for ''a'' can&amp;rsquo;t be guessed, so maybe this sound was &amp;ldquo;meant&amp;rdquo; (like in some Quenya Tengwar Modes). More possibly it was one of the two cirth whose value can&amp;rsquo;t be determined, or it was one of some other cirth that did not survive till the later Angerthas.

Long vowels were evidently indicated by doubling (cf. the known certh for long ''o'', &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, is a simplified form of &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;bb&lt;/em&gt;).

: '''''Note:''' The term &amp;ldquo;Old Sindarin&amp;rdquo; is used hypothetically to facilitate understanding of Sindarin etymology, although we don&amp;rsquo;t know if it actually existed, and when. The term &amp;ldquo;Old Sindarin&amp;rdquo; is not a term used by Tolkien, but the term, as well as the language, are based on &amp;ldquo;Old Noldorin&amp;rdquo; as known by him.''

=== Notes ===
&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/em&gt;: The original value of this certh wasn&amp;rsquo;t given by Tolkien, but he mentions that in later Angerthas, it took the value ''hw'' after &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; became ''m'' (for reasons explained below) while he doesn't give us the early certh for M. We can infer that this was the certh for M judging by both its 'labial' shape, and the symmetrical shape used for nasals, like &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;@&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;u&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/em&gt;: As mentioned, this certh will have the value ''m'' in later Angerthas, for reasons explained below. Its original value can&amp;rsquo;t be guessed (maybe the certh for ''a''?), but judging from the  &amp;ldquo;labial&amp;rdquo; shape, it could be ''w''.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;%&lt;/em&gt;: As Tolkien mentioned, the reversal of the stem didn&amp;rsquo;t had any phonologic significance. These Cirth were interchangeable and used for ''h'' or ''s'' depending on when &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; was ''s'' or ''h''. This would perhaps apply to these early Cirth as well

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;: Similarly, this Certh was ''h'' when &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;%&lt;/em&gt; were ''s'' and vice versa.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;: This Certh will have the value ''ss'' in later Angerthas. It must had another unknown value before (maybe the certh for ''a''?).

=== Examples ===
As mentioned, it is probable that this primitive Certhas were used &amp;ldquo;Old Sindarin&amp;rdquo;, and we can try to see how some words could be written. The spelling exemplified here assumes that like in Latin, a single certh was used for ''w'' and ''u'', and similarly for ''k'', ''t'' and ''p'' for ''kh'', ''th'' and ''ph''. Since we can&amp;rsquo;t guess the form of ''a'', we will consider that it was actually ommited.

* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;ua52z&lt;/em&gt;, ÑLMBE (''*ñalambe''), &amp;ldquo;barbarous speech&amp;rdquo;
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;lSRl@z&lt;/em&gt;, IURINE (''*yurine''), &amp;ldquo;I run&amp;rdquo;

== Certhas Daeron ==
In the Valian Year 1350&lt;ref&gt;The Grey Annals&lt;/ref&gt;, Dairon (better known as Daeron), the Minstrel and Loremaster of Doriath, reorganised the cirth and added new ones, making the extension of the cirth known as Angerthas Daeron (&amp;ldquo;Long Runerow of Daeron&amp;rdquo;), used for inscribing names in Menegroth. The Dwarves working for Thingol liked them and adopted them, making them known also in the East, beyond the Mountains.

The nature and the timeframe of the standardization however are obscure; some point the similarities between &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; et &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/em&gt; as signs that Daeron was influenced by the Tengwar, therefore this mustn't had occurred before the return of the Noldor, which means during the [[History of Elven writing systems/First Age|First Age]]. Unlike the previous system, the reversal of the certh had a phonemic significance: reversed cirth were softer versions of their originals. This also gives us another information: perhaps lenited consonants must have started to occur in Sindarin around that time.

Tolkien mentions that at that time (or maybe later) a sound of ''mh'' was needed. The most appropriate solution was to revert the certh for ''m'' to indicate its softening, but &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; (we assume it was this certh) couldn&amp;rsquo;t be reverted, so ''m'' was given to &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; (which until then had a value unknown to us), and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; got the value of ''hw''. The same process took place with ''r'', ''l'' etc., and maybe at that time the distinct cirth for semivowels and umlauts, like ''w'', ''y'' and ''œ'', were employed.

=== Examples ===
There are no Angerthas Daeron texts by Tolkien either, so we cannot know how the text forms can look like. By some English specimina we see at least that words are separated by dots, phrases by colons and longer periods by 3 or 4 dots. We don&amp;rsquo;t know if Angerthas Daeron, like Tengwar, used other diacritics for modificators or combinations like ''nd'', ''mb'', ''dw'', ''gw'' or diphthongs. It seems, however, quite straightforward, and for now we use them in close correspodence to the latin letters. The following examples attempt to show words as would be in the Age of the Starlight (Daeron&amp;rsquo;s time), so the first and last examples should be ''Gelydh'' and ''Elvellon'' in the 3rd Age.
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;c@@b@IluIumaG!&lt;/em&gt;, ''Annon-iñ-ñGœlydh'', &amp;ldquo;Gate of the Noldor&amp;rdquo;

= Mode of Beleriand =
When the Noldor came to Middle-earth, they were forbidden by King Elu Thingol to use Quenya&lt;ref&gt;'''The Silmarillion''' Ch 15 &quot;the Exiles took the Sindarin tongue in all their daily uses&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;and were forced to adopt Sindarin. They adapted Tengwar to their new language, taking advantage of their inherent flexibility to other sounds, imitating maybe the way the Teleri of Aman represented the Telerin sounds that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist in Quenya. For some obscure reasons we do not know, they found the most usual tehta-mode inappropriate for Sindarin, and they took therefore also example of the original Fëanorian Quanta-Sarme, using distinct tengwar for vowels. 

The Mode of Beleriand seems to have been held &amp;ldquo;traditionally&amp;rdquo; by the Noldor who were established in Eregion during the 2nd Age, as seen on the Moria Gate Inscription written by Celebrimbor&lt;ref&gt;'''''The Fellowship of the Ring''''', Journey in the Dark&lt;/ref&gt;. After Eregion was destroyed in SA 1697, the Noldor migrated to Imladris&lt;ref&gt;The Tale of Years&lt;/ref&gt;, where the Mode of Beleriand was perhaps used even till the 3rd Age&lt;ref&gt;The Road goes ever on&lt;/ref&gt;. The only Beleriandic texts attested are the '''Moria Gate Inscription''' and '''A Elbereth Gilthoniel''', the hymn of Imladris. Many of the tengwar haven&amp;rsquo;t been attested in those texts, and it&amp;rsquo;s uncertain if they were used at all.

It seems that Sindarin speakers found use only for 3 of the 5 témar. Of the Quessetéma, only Wilya is attested, as a final -''u'' (spelled -''w'' by Tolkien, in ''tîw''). There is also an ''a''-tengwa, not corresponding with any of the older ones known from Quenya. We don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was a new invention or imported from a Quenya semivowel unknown to us, but more probably it is the ''a''-letter from Fëanor&amp;rsquo;s [[../Age of Starlight#Quanta Sarme|Quanta-Sarme]].

Since the vowels were separate letters, the carriers took vowel values too. The short carrier was for ''i'', while in the '''King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''', written in the later '[[../Third_Age#Sindarin &quot;Full Writing&quot; with &quot;General Use&quot; Consonants|General Use with full writing]]', used in Arnor, we see the long carrier for the semiconsonantal initial sound ''y-'' (spelled ''i-'' by Tolkien, as in ''Ioreth''). We don&amp;rsquo;t know if the latter was an Arnorian employment or was used even back in the original Beleriand Mode.

In the same text, we also find the ''w''-tehta used over consonants as well for labialisation (''edwen'', which would be written here as &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;l2èl6&lt;/em&gt;), since the Quessetéma was discarded. A tilde is used before stops for nasalisation, since Anto, Ampa etc. took different values.

Diphthongs were expressed by tehtar. Two overdots, maybe a remnant of the Tyelpetéma, used for -''i'' in the diphthongs ''ai'', ''ei'' and ''ui''. Similarly for ''au'' (spelled -''aw'' finally by Tolkien), we assume the ''w''-tehta was used (''caun'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;a]é6&lt;/em&gt;). ''ae'' is attested written with the separate letters for ''a'' and ''e'', and maybe the same applies to the diphthong ''oe'' too. Another tehta was used to indicate long vowels, an acute accent called Andaith (''á'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;]R&lt;/em&gt;)

A well-known tehta that indicates long consonants, the under-tilde, wasn&amp;rsquo;t used. Long ''m'' and ''n'' were written with Malta and Númen (i.e., doubling of the lúva), while in the '''Moria Gate Inscription''', other long consonants were written with two letters, so maybe this under-tilde wasn&amp;rsquo;t used earlier in Aman either, but is a later device.

In the '''King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''', the letter of lenited ''m (mh)'' appears, which is a &amp;ldquo;nasal variant of ''v''&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;spirant ''m''&amp;rdquo;, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know its form in this mode.

=== Notes ===
'''Tengwar Names''': Even if we assume the names we know from '''Appendix E''' were the original ones used back in Aman, it is sure that the Sindarin users of the Sindarin modes changed their names, like any other race did according to their system. However, since those names are unknown, their known Quenya names will be used for these annotations.

'''Malta/Númen''': Because of their doubled lúvar, those tengwar were considered as lenghtened forms of Vala and Órë, which had the values of ''m'' and ''n'', respectively.

'''Unque''': This letter is not attested in any Sindarin text, neither is the sound it theoretically represented, but we can theorize that this sound existed in very early Sindarin (''g'' dissappeared in the middle of words via this sound. Cf. early Quenya ''3''). If the Noldor came to Middle-earth when this sound still existed, it is likely that they represented it by this tengwa, before finally disappearing. See also Gasdil.

'''Gasdil''': The lenited ''g'' sound was indicated by a sign called Gasdil, which is an elaboration of the letter Halla. It is used like Tolkien uses the apostrophe, to indicate a missing ''g'': ''galadh'', &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo;, but ''i ‘aladh'', &amp;ldquo;the tree&amp;rdquo;.

'''Noldo''': This letter is neither attested, but it is easy to assume that it represented the sound ''ñ'', which Tolkien transcribed as ''ng''. This sound (that existed initially in Quenya) in Sindarin occurs only in nasal mutations and finally (like in ''ang''), and was different from medial ''ng'' (like in ''ungol''). So, if both weren&amp;rsquo;t written with a tilde over an Anga, Noldo was most likely used for the former, like it was in Quenya.

'''Wilya''': Maybe for prevocalic and final ''w'' (e.g., ''tawarwaith'', ''tiw''). Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used for the diphthong ''au'' (finally spelled -''aw'').

'''Arda/Alda''': Tolkien states that these letters were used for the initial soft sounds ''rh'' and ''lh'' (spelled ''hr'' and ''hl'' in Quenya).

'''Silmë Nuquerna''': It is not known if this tengwa existed in Aman or if it is a Beleriandic invention. In tehtar-modes, however, it was used when a tehta should be placed over Silme. In this mode, the sound it represents is the vowel ''y'' (not to be confused with the consonantal Quenya ''y'' in ''yulma'').

'''Essë''': This letter (previously Ázë) is found in the '''King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''' (and in 3rd Age Quenya texts) to have the value of ''ss''. But it is not known which took it from which. There are two probabilities:
* Sindarin didn&amp;rsquo;t possess the ''z'' sound, so the Noldor gave it the value of ''ss''. Quenya imitated this Sindarin mode and gave the value of ''ss'' to that letter, which had till that time the value of ''r''.
* The '''King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''' is a 4th Age Sindarin text. Maybe the value ''ss'' of this tengwa was an attribute borrowed from the Quenya mode of that time.

'''Essë Nuquerna''': We lack a letter for the umlaut sound ''œ'' found in early Sindarin (later becoming ''e''), but a wild guess is that perhaps Essë nuquerna was used, similarly like Silmë nuquerna was used for ''y''.

'''Hyarmen''': Sindarin didn&amp;rsquo;t possess palatalised sounds. ''hy'' had became ''h''. Hyarmen was employed for this soft sound, not to be confused with ''ch''.

'''Hwesta Sindarinwa''': This mysterious letter, said to have the value ''hw'', had never appeared in any of the Sindarin texts. It is unknown why was it employed instead of Hwesta and when. It was probably used much later by the mannish modes, where Hwesta was used for the sound ''ch'' or ''chw''.

=== Examples ===
The best known sample of the Mode of Beleriand is of course the '''Moria Gate Inscription''', written by Celebrimbor of Eregion, a Noldorin place where this Mode was preserved.

Tolkien has written the hymn of Imladris, '''A Elbereth Gilthoniel''', in this mode. Imladris, inhabited by the refugees of Eregion, is one of the places that might have kept the Mode of Beleriand, even in the 3rd Age.

= Runes of Gondolin =
This system was perhaps an invention of Pengolodh or other loremasters, and was employed obviously in Gondolin (or in Nevrast, at earliest).

Like the Tengwar and the Cirth, the forms of these runes show a relation between sound and shape. It is not known if the few similarities to the cirth are coincidental or not. Pengolodh, however, was not aware of the Cirth before he, with the survivors of destroyed Gondolin, migrated to the Mouths of Sirion.

It is not known if the values given by Tolkien (and presented here) are the original, or his own adaptation for writing English, Modern or Old. One reason against the former is that the sounds given are not found in the known elven languages of the First Age, but it may be that it was designed for notating a variety of languages. Glamdring and Orcrist, the famous swords, had probably inscriptions in that system, because Elrond (who it is stated to know of all types of runes) could read their inscriptions since he was born in Arvernien, while Gandalf was unable to.

The system of Gondolin was perhaps dropped out of use after its fall, but used for a while in Arvernien. It is mentioned that there Pengolodh was fascinated by the Certhas Daeron brought by the survivors of Doriath (perhaps it seemed to him a more perfected system), and adopted it for his works. They seem to have been obsoleted and forgotten by the Third Age, and this is supported by the abovementioned fact that only Elrond could read the swords&amp;rsquo; inscriptions.

This system has appeared only in an article of '''Mythlore''' issue 69, by Paul Nolan Hyde, publishing an early concept of Tolkien. Its existence is not explicitly stated in the known later texts, but the above story about Glamdring is evidence that indeed a different kind of runes was used in Gondolin.

=== Notes ===
&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;ñ&lt;/em&gt;: This rune seems to be used both for ''n'' and -''ng'' (''ñ'').

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Ö&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;UU&lt;/em&gt;: These runes were used for long ''œ'' and ''y'' respectively, but there are no such accented characters in typesetting, so they are displayed here as double. The sounds they represents are of those that appear in the alphabet, but not attested in any elvish tongue.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;: This rune is described as ''x'', however, this is an alternate spelling for the Sindarin sound ''ch'', not the English ''x'' (Quenya ''ks''). For ''x'', the letter &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;K&lt;/em&gt; was used.

=== Examples ===
If we accept the values of the runes above, maybe these were the inscriptions of the famous swords of '''The Hobbit''':
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;glamdriñ&lt;/em&gt;, ''Glamdring'' (Foe-hammer)
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;orkrist&lt;/em&gt;, ''Orcrist'' (Orc-cleaver)

      <text xml:space="preserve">why did you edit beating season's author section?

I have no idea who the author is. However, if the guy whose name was put at the bottom is a real person and he had nothing to do with the article, then it's pretty unfair that his name was put there. If he isn't a real person, well, then it doesn't matter if I removed it. And if he really was the author, then he can go ahead and put his name back on it if he really wants to be associated with such rubbish. And if you're the author, well, go and put you're name back there - I won't remove it again.</text>

'''Allspice''', also ''Jamaica pepper'', sometimes ''pimento'', is the unripe berry of the ''Pimienta dioica'' tree; which is dried, ground, and used as a seasoning. Its name comes from its flavor, which is reminiscent of many spices, including [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]], and [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]], with a [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppery]] flavor. 

It is the primary spice in the [[Cookbook:Jamaican Jerk Spice|Jamaican Jerk Spice]] blend.

In this cookbook, '''half and half''' refers to a mixture of 50% [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] and 50% [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]. This is available as a pre-mixed product in the USA, so many American recipes specify it as an ingredient.

Elsewhere, half and half is a name often given to a mix of a light-coloured beer with a dark-coloured beer, or some other mix of alcoholic beverages.

[[Image:ARS_Durian.jpg|frame|right|Durian]]
'''Durian''' (''Durio'') is a green, spiny fruit from Southeast Asia. This &quot;King of Fruits&quot; has a complex, rich flavor and an intense odor which many find offensive. The fruit's stench has caused it to be banned from public places in some countries and has [http://www.durianpalace.com/newsmedia/DTA/durian_terror_alarm.htm caused evacuations]. Durians can sometimes be found in normal supermarkets in Western countries, frozen and thickly wrapped in plastic.

A durian is opened by splitting it along natural sections. You might be able to see them on the outside as places where the spines run parallel. A durian can be forced open with the hands. Though not needed, a sturdy knife can be helpful to get things started. A durian will start to open itself when it is really ripe. Once opened, a durian should be eaten quickly.

Durian fruit is used to flavour a wide variety of sweet edibles such as traditional Malay candy, ice kachang, rose biscuits, cakes, and, with a touch of modern innovation, ice cream, milkshakes, mooncakes and even cappuccino. Pulut Durian is glutinous rice steamed with coconut milk and served with ripened durian. In Sabah, red durian (''D. dulcis'') is fried with onions and chilli and served as a side dish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sabahtravelguide.com/culture/default.ASP?page=trad_cuisine (URL accessed 3 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Cookbook:Tempoyak|Tempoyak]]''' refers to fermented durian, usually made from lower quality durian that is unsuitable for direct consumption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~durian/rec/recipe.htm (URL accessed 3 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Tempoyak can be eaten either cooked or uncooked, is normally eaten with rice, and can also be used for making curry. Sambal Tempoyak is a Sumatran dish made from the fermented durian fruit, coconut milk, and a collection of spicy ingredients known as sambal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Central Sierra Miwok is a nearly extinct Native American language of central California, closely related to the other Miwok languages (spoken from Marin to Yosemite) and ultimately a member of the widespread Penutian family of the west coast of North America.

==Lesson 1==

Traditionally, Central Sierra Miwok was not a written language; however, it has been written by linguists using phonological notation and a few special symbols.

It has 6 vowels: 
* a, e, i, o, u are all pronounced as in Spanish - that is, ah, eh, ee, oh, oo
* ï (usually written y by linguists) is a sound not found in English, halfway between the vowels in the English words &quot;book&quot; and &quot;mitt&quot;. It sounds like Turkish ı or Russian ы.

Most of its consonants occur in English:
* ch (written č by linguists), h, k, l, m, n, ng (written ŋ by linguists), p, s, sh (written š by linguists), w, y (written j by linguists)

but a couple don't:
* In English there is only one t sound.  In Miwok there are two: an &quot;alveolar&quot; t, like English t (written ṭ by linguists) and a &quot;dental&quot; t, like Spanish or Italian t (written t by linguists).  Since the &quot;dental&quot; t sounds closer to English th, and there is no th sound in Miwok, it will be written &quot;th&quot; here.
* ^ (written ˀ by linguists) is called a glottal stop - it effectively means you don't combine the vowel before it together with the vowel after it, but stop between them instead.

If a t plus an h or an s plus an h is intended, instead of a th or sh sound, we will write s'h, t'h to remove ambiguity.

Both vowels and consonants can be doubled, like in Finnish; you pronounce aa longer than a, and tt longer than t.

==Lesson 2==

Let's start with a few simple nouns:

* person: miwwï
* acorn-bread: ïlee
* acorn soup: nïppa

and verbs:

* say: kachchï
* eat: ïwwï

English makes a difference between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;, or &quot;he&quot; and &quot;him&quot;: you say &quot;he&quot; if he is the one doing something (subject case), and &quot;him&quot; if something is being done to him (object case).  In Miwok, you have to make this distinction for all nouns: you add -^ at the end of the subject, and -y at the end of the object.  If you did this in English, you might say: &quot;I eat nïppay&quot;, but &quot;The nïppa^ spilled&quot;, for instance.

The order of words is different from English: instead of saying &quot;man bites dog&quot;, you would normally say &quot;man dog bites&quot;.

* The person eats acorn-bread: ''miwwï^ ïleey ïwwï''

This is a brief listing of chemotherapy drugs that may be useful for the radiation oncologist to know.  It is not to be an in depth discussion of how these drugs work, but it may touch on their basic type of action (i.e. nucleoside analogues).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well, this is a new one on me.  I had never heard of Wiki Books or the Wikiversity, and here's an entry for LIS.  What ideas do you have for this page?  Do you intend to offer a lot of info?  Where is all of this going?  I'm a young librarian with a passing interest in the wiki and just happened by here.

I'll check back and see who's around later.  Good luck!

== LIS program ==

I started the LIS program because I realized that much of what I learned in my MLIS program could be done at my own pace at home.  I'm hoping to pass on much of what I payed my hard-earned tuition for, so that others can perhaps learn some of this on their own.  The program is loosely structured on the LIS program I attended.  As time goes on, I hope to slowly develop each of the &quot;classes.&quot;

I of course welcome any additions that anyone can offer.[[User:Clifflandis|Clifflandis]] 23:48, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Wiki Research Skills?? ==

I'm teaching electronic media and research skills to high school freshman, and this seems like a really good place to develop a basic primer for such a course. My course covers internet beginnings and history, seach tools, surface web and deep web as resources, information evaluation, and basic library research skills. I'm interested in adding sections on blogging and the wiki-world of information, too. 

But here's the thing: These are amazing new ways of constructinig information - but I wonder about how they will develop. It seems it will be increasingly important and necessary to find ways to contextualize these forms of information, and that that needs to be taught to people, too. The wiki-world and the blogosphere need to be understood to be in relation to other more traditional forms of information. In fact, a great part of their value lies in just that fact that they are so free. But, that does not make them necessarily better, more correct, more reliable, less biased, less corrupted than other forms  of information. The freedom has value - and that requires a certain acceptance of responsibility on our parts. For young people, most people, really, all &quot;information&quot; is equal. THey jump into a see of words and accept it all. !here is no concern, much less understanding that there IS a context in which we are living, giving, receiving this information, and that that context has meaning, too. 

At any rate, getting back to the course, it seems that media skills modules that address some of these aspects of information organization, evaluation, retrieval, and meaning making, could be a great wiki-library tool, useful for all kinds of learners. 

What do you all think?

== Is this school still active? ==

Hi there,

I'm new to the WikiWorld and only came across WikiVersity on Friday (25/11). I got all excited and thought I'd build myself a LIS School only to find that this one was already here. 

Only thing is that there isn't a lot of content here and there hasn't been much activity recently either. This has got me wondering if the school is still active.

I'd really like to be involved in moving the school forward - It's just I dont want to offend anyone by doing too much and being accused of taking over or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_vandalism  worse things]

Is the school still being worked on?

Thanks

== Move from Wikiversity to Wikibooks ==

This page seems to be a Wikibook, not a school of Wikiversity. I suggest moving the six blue links here to a [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves|bookshelf]], or merging them into one book. That would fix the present naming-convention problem. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:23, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

== Introduction to Sashimi ==
'''Sashimi''' is raw meat, sliced very thin. It is typically served with [[Cookbook:Onigiri|onigiri]] or [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]]. Although the meat used is usually a kind of [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] can also be used.

== Making Sashimi ==
=== Ingredients ===
* Almost any type of fish
** Salmon
** Tuna
*

=== Procedure ===
Since the meat is raw, it is important that it be as fresh as possible. Slice as thinly as possible across the grain to keep it tender, like you would a steak.


=== Tips, Notes, and Variations ===
* Some people avoid freshwater fish (i.e., freshwater [[Cookbook:Eel|eel]] (''unagi''), [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]]) entirely, because they may contain parasites that do not live in saltwater. (These parasites are killed during cooking.)

OsiriX is developed in collaboration by a core group of developers headed by Antoine Rosset.  To allow collaborative development the current source code is stored on a remote server at the sourceforge site.  Getting the code and merging changes is handled by the SVN version management system.

In order to build your own copy of OsiriX you must have Apple's developer tools (Xcode) v 3.1. For best results use the latest version of Xcode.  Currently (July 2008) Xcode v 3.1 is only available as part of the iPhone SDK. It can be downloaded from http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/. It is available for free though you will have to set up an account.

The next two sections describe how to get the source code and compile it once you have it.

In order to check out (fetch an initial copy) of the OsiriX source code, you need to have [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] installed.

== Anonymous Access ==
Anonymous access is simple if you don't plan to submit any changes to the project.  Open up Terminal.  '''cd''' to a root directory to check out your code.  Mine is /Users/spalte.  Then type: 
&lt;nowiki&gt;
svn co https://osirix.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/osirix osirix
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This will then chunder for a while and you will end up with a directory called osirix containing the source ie for my setup /Users/spalte/osirix. Now you are ready to build the project.

When the download is complete open the project in x-code, then select the unzip binaries target and build this and then build the deveolpment target.

Now that you have the source code you are ready to build.

1) Open osiriX.xcodeproj

2) Choose '&quot;Unzip Binaries&quot; as the active target and then click Build.

3) Choose &quot;Development&quot; as the active target and then click Build.

You should now have an application that runs.  Before you run though if you already have a version of OsiriX installed on your system, BACKUP your OsiriX user data folder since this app will use the same version and there could be conflicts.

I have written (or more accurately pinched from the bibdesk website) a perl script to get the osirix source code called '''getosirixCVS.pl'''.  Download this onto your machine.  it is probably easiest to save it in your development directory.  Mine is /Users/jefferis/dev.  Go to the Terminal and run as follows:

gjg5:~/dev jefferis$ '''perl getosirixCVS.pl'''

Answer the questions and you will get a response that looks like this if you are using anonymous cvs

 After that open osirix/OsiriX.pbproj/ and commence the build.
 1) compile DCM.framework target FIRST. This will create the OsiriX.framework for OsiriXBurner application
 2) compile 'OsirixBurner.xcode' file
 3) compile all the PreferencePanes projects located in the 'Preference Panes' folder
 4) compile 'Osirix.pbproj' file with OsiriX target

Huh?  Isn't the comma derivative the tensor quantity that is the normal partial derivative adjusted by a sum over the Christoffel symbols?  If the Christoffel symbols are zero, as they are in a flat space, the covariant derivative is the same as the normal derivative, but in general this is not the case.  Or am I missing something?


The tensor quantity that you're talking about is the covariant derivative and it's written as X&lt;sub&gt;;c&lt;/sub&gt; - Itzamna 2 Feb 2009</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can associate formatting instructions with a web page by defining CSS rules in either an [[../Applying CSS to HTML and XHTML#Embedding|embedded]], [[../Applying CSS to HTML and XHTML#Linking|linked]], or [[../Applying CSS to HTML and XHTML#Inlining|inline]] stylesheet. Although there are many ways of defining styles, the main difference between them is where they are located. Linked stylesheets are preferred for live websites. Embedded and inline stylesheets are useful for prototyping but do not have the maintenance savings associated with linked stylesheets.

==Syntax==
A stylesheet consists of one or more rules.

Each rule has two parts: a selector and a group of one or more declarations surrounded by braces (curly brackets): 

::selector { declaration; declaration2; ...}

Each declaration is formed like this:

::property: value 

Remember that there can be several declarations in one rule. A common mistake is to mix up colons, which separate the property and value of a declaration, and semicolons, which separate declarations.
A selector chooses the elements for which the rule applies and
the declaration sets the value for the different properties of the elements that are chosen.

The property is one of many properties. [http://www.w3.org/ w3.org] has a list of all of the [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/propidx.html CSS Properties].

==Basic Uses==
Here is an example of how you would make all &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; elements appear bold:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
span {
	font-weight: bold;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;font-weight: bold;&lt;/code&gt; declaration has the property &lt;code&gt;font-weight&lt;/code&gt; and the value &lt;code&gt;bold&lt;/code&gt; which makes the font bold.

That would appear like this:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Bold Text&lt;/span&gt;}}

A slightly more complex example is

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
span {
	font-weight: bold;
	color: yellow;
	background-color: black;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

That would appear like this:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold; color: yellow; background-color: black;&quot;&gt;Yellow Bold Text&lt;/span&gt;
}}

You can use many other properties, and values, but this is just a beginning as to how to use CSS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bambara''', or '''Bamanakan''' in the language itself, is a language in West Africa, mostly in Mali, where it is mother tongue of the ''Bambara'' people (30% of the population), and where 80% of the population can communicate in the language. Bambara will also be useful in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, and Gambia. Together with Dioulé and Malinké it belongs to the Mandekan family of more or less mutually comprehensible languages, which itself part of the Mande group, which is a Niger-Congo language subgroup.the bambaran tribe were mostly Muslim.they took some of the luageguage

It is a Subject Object Verb language and it is a tonal language with two tones.
It uses seven vowels a, e, é, i, o, ó and u (a like in car, e like in echo, é similar
to the second e in echelon but more open, i like in India, o like in for, ó like the
final sound in gnaw, and u like in the name Honolulu).

==History, influences==
In the past and present Bambara has strongly been influenced by French. Any knowledge of French is of great use when learning Bambara. And during your first attempts of actually speaking the language you can try to use French words if you don't yet know the Bambara word for something. &lt;!-- haven't tried this yet, but sounds obvious :) If _you_ know better: please write about your experience --&gt;

==Sound==
It is a tonal language, with two different tones, high and low. Within a word the tone can only be rising. 

==Grammar==
Like Turkish and Japanese, it is an agglutinative language, meaning that morphemes are glued together to form a word.

The basic sentence structure is Subject Object Verb.  Take the phrase, &quot;n t'a don&quot; (I don't know [it]). &quot;n&quot; is the subject (me), &quot;a&quot; is the object (it), and &quot;[ka] don&quot; is the verb ([to] know). The &quot;t'&quot; is from the present tense marker &quot;té.&quot; &quot;té&quot; is the negative present tense marker and &quot;bé&quot; is the affirmative present tense marker. Therefore, &quot;n b'a don&quot; would mean &quot;I know it&quot;.  

==Contents==
* [[/Verbs|Verbs]]
* [[/Vocabulary|Vocabulary]]

===Particles===
There are no definite particle in Bambara.

===Gender===
Gender can explicitly be expressed by using the suffixes '''-muso''' for feminine and '''-kè''' for masculine. For instance

;jakuma
:cat

;den
:child

===Questions===
In Bambara there are three different ways for turning a sentence into a question. The first is simply using a question mark, or a change of expression, of tone, which is common in French, and the other two are like Japanese and Chinese where an interrogative particle is used to indicate that the sentence is a question:

# .. '''wa'''?  - at the end of a sentence
#¿'''yali''' ..  - at the beginning of a sentence

====Interrogatives====
;min? (at the end of the sentence)
:where?

;mun .. ?
:what?

;munna .. ?
:why

;jón .. ?
:who?


===Plural===
The plural is indicated with a '''w''' at the end of a word, and '''uu''' for words ending in '''u'''.

;musow
:women

===Pronouns===
;né : me, I, my, mine
;i : you, your, yours
;a : he, she, him, her, his, hers, it
;aw : you, your, yours (plural)
;an : us, our, ours
;u, alou : they, their, theirs

Note that Bambara doesn't have a special possessive pronoun. Possession is formed using the ''ka'' particle, e.g. ''ne ka mobili'' - my car.

= Quenya Mode =
Some changes occurred in Noldorin phonology, already in Valinor, that differentiated it from the dialect of the Vanyar: ''th'' merged with ''s'', initial ''ch'' with ''h'' and maybe later, but still before the Exile, ''z'' with ''r''. Those changes were inherited to Exilic Quenya which slowly evolved further.

There is not much known about the slow elvish evolution in 2nd Age, but certainly the sages of Númenor, as well as Elven sages of middle-Earth, were using the Quenya Tengwar and applied some changes and simplifications to them. It is not known when exactly those changes that brought us to the final form of the table in '''Appendix E''' took place, but if we consider some changes as “early” or “late”, we could attribute some intermediate stages to the 2nd Age. It still must be noted that some changes described here could not had happened then, but later.

Aldwin Lowdham wrote some Numenorian names with tengwar and Lisa Star believes this writing represents a Numenorean mode. This mode reminds of Sanskrit: since a was very frequent, its sign was sometimes left out, and the sound was just meant, giving the script therefore an [[Wikipedia:abugida|abugida]] flavour. An unutixë (underdot), which in this case was called Putta, was used to indicate that a consonant is not followed by any vowel (''Minyatur'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;t%5Ô1Y6Ê&lt;/em&gt;).

=== Notes ===
*'''Extended stems''': The Grade of extended stems was hardly usable by that time. Elvish had certainly lost aspirated sounds and Númenorians didn’t had much need to record Valarin. They should however have found a place in Adûnaic orthography, or in archaic elvish studies.
*'''Árë''': This letter was used for ''r'' (which previously had been a ''z'') for orthographic reasons. Since there was already Rómen for intervocalic ''r'', (''auzel'' and the later ''aurel'' should both be written &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;.D,Rj&lt;/em&gt;, but ''aurel'' could be written &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;.D7Rj&lt;/em&gt; as well) Árë was renamed Essë and took the value of long ''s''. Maybe the application of value ''ss'' was an influence from the earlier Mode of Beleriand.
*'''Tyelpetéma''': Some changes took place in Tyelpetéma: the archaic (and Vanyarin) word Quendya and Noldorin Quenya demonstrate a simplification ''ndy &gt; ny''. So Indyo must became *Inyo, making the letter useless and replaced by Nyellë. Similarly Istyar became Istar and shows a process ''sty &gt; st''. Maybe these reasons, and the change ''zy'' &gt; ''ry'', consisted Tyelpetéma obsoleted as a separate series. The palatalised sounds will be now shown with its remnant, the “following ''y''” underdots.
*'''Harma/Aha''': In the days of Aman, initial ''ch'' was softened and merged with ''h'', and Charma became Harma. Harma might still be used initially, but it seems (later?) it was replaced by Hyarmen. Harma was renamed Acha and was used now only medially where the sound ch remained unchanged.
*'''Súlë''': The sound ''th'' merged with ''s'' since very early in Noldorin. It is known that for orthographic reasons, Súlë was used for ''s'' in words that once were ''th'' (eg. ''thanga'' and later ''sanga'' would be written &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;3Ds#&lt;/em&gt;, not **&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;iEs#&lt;/em&gt;). One can wonder why it didn’t get another useful value, like Árë did, since Súlë was confused with Silmë.
*'''Anna''': The ''3'' sound had been dissappeared and the carrier was now solely used to carry the tehtar. But Anna was still used with the “following ''y''” dots to represend the ''y'' consonant since it seems Yanta was now used only to represent ''–i'' in diphtongs.
*'''Arya''': Noldorin z merged with ''r'', and ''zy'' became ''ry''. It seems that when Árë became Essë, the ''ry'' sound began to be indicated by Rómen/Órë and the “following ''y''” nuntixi (maybe after Tyelpetéma was disemployed).
*'''Rómen/Órë''': Maybe by that time, those two ''r''’s began to have the known from the later Tengwar texts functions: Rómen before vowels and Órë anywhere else (before consonants and finally).
*'''Hyarmen''': This letter was simplified to ''h'', maybe because of Sindarin influence, and by the 3rd Age displaced Halla completely (and maybe Harma). Its old ''hy'' value was restored when borrowing the “following ''y''” nuntixi.
*'''Halla''': This letter was replaced by Hyarmen, but it was still used before initial l and ''r'' to show that those consonants are to be pronounced softer (''hrívë'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;&amp;#189;7~ByR&lt;/em&gt;)

=General Use mode=
The Noldor founded Eregion in the year 750 of the Second Age. When this civilization reached its peak, it was already a cultural and financial crossroad of races: Noldor, Sindar, Dwarves and Men, Dúnedain or other. 

In [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS58 '''The Howlett Rivendell Inscriptions'''], Tolkien affirms that there was a &quot;general use (applicable to both S[indarin] and Q[uenya])&quot; around the end of the Third Age but there is some evidence that the same or similar concept must have been employed back to the Eregion times: The Third Age &quot;general use&quot; shown by Tolkien is consistent to the Second Age [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS7 the '''Ring-inscription'''], which, Isildur says, is &quot;fashioned in an elven-script of Eregion&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''''Isildur's Scroll''''', read at the '''''Council of Elrond'''''&lt;/ref&gt;; this mode bore many similarities to the actual theoretical and unused [[History of Elven writing systems/Age of Starlight#Rumilian_Influence|values]] of the Tengwar.

A similar system is also used for the few late Second Age Adûnaic words in [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS50 '''Edwin Lowdham's Manuscript''', Text I], we may tentatively assume that the &quot;general use&quot; is of Númenorian influences. 

The origins of the General Use Mode are unclear; we can assume that it originated in Eregion that could satisfy the needs of non-Elvish languages and facilitate writing and communication in those multicultural circumstances; out of this contact Sauron could have inscribed the Ring. But it is also possible that this Mode originated in Númenor and spread with the use of Westron.

Since the '''Ring Inscription''' is the only Second Age source for this, and because the &quot;General Use&quot; is mentioned mostly in context to the Third Age, please see [[../Third Age#&quot;General Use&quot;|the relevant section]]

= Angerthas Daeron =
Similar to the &quot;General Use&quot; modes, the Cirth also saw universal usage. The Gelydh (Noldor) made use of the cirth and made a name for them in Quenya, ''Certar''. They even extended the Certhas and added several cirth. The adding of 2 whole new rows was attributed to the Ghelydh (CH-row and QU-row). It was considered an extention of Certhas Daeron, so it was named Angerthas Daeron (''and+certhas=long runerow).

Tolkien is not clear about when the name 'Angerthas Daeron' was used. '''An Introduction to Elvish''' interprets Tolkien as if the Angerthas was an earlier invention, while the authors use the custom name 'Angerthas Eregion' to refer to the system of the Second Age explained below.

Whatever this system was called, we see the innovations concerning the employment of the two new CH and QU-series, a new certh for ''h'' to replace the previous certh &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt; which became ''ch''. This certh was preferred for ''ch'' because its shape seemed to be between the shapes of the T and K cirth (&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/em&gt; T + &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; K &gt; &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt; CH), to represent how the ''ch'' sound also (phonologically) exist between ''t'' and ''c''. There was also a new certh for ''nd'', which as Tolkien notes, its form wasn’t much related to the dental cirth.

Some of the new letters were used for sounds of Quenya (and other tongues) not found in Sindarin. In that stage, the Angerthas reached its fullest extent, but for most forms of writing other than carving, the Tengwar were used.

=== Notes ===
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt;: This certh was used for ''h'', but was chosen for ''ch'', as it occurred phonologically between sounds ''t'' and ''c'', and its shape looked intermediate between the Cirth &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;. Not to be confused with Sindarin ''ch''!
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;: Since it represents the labialised sound ''kw'' (also spelled ''qu''), its shape was maybe a mixture of the Cirth &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;.
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;: Tolkien shows two distinct signs for ''s'' as indifferent. Their exact use can’t be guessed and isn’t obvious like the relation of the tengwar Silmë and Silmë Nuquerna.
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;: Tolkien gives the value ''z'' to that letter (in alien systems?), but notes it was ''ss'' when used in Quenya and Sindarin.
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;: Maybe near that time, this new certh was made for the value of ''h'', similar in shape to the former &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt; (and to the tengwa Hyarmen &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;9&lt;/em&gt;).

=== Examples ===
The Angerthas was convenient for Quenya and alien languages, probably Mannish, and maybe the ancestor of the Common Speech. We can see how some archaic Mannish words that maybe were current, can be written.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;9Dec@&lt;/em&gt;	''Dûkan'' (Roh. dweller)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;ecf8S&lt;/em&gt;	''Kastu'' (treasure)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Rnrl@&lt;/em&gt;	''Rógin'' (Woses)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8Rc.ca9&lt;/em&gt;	''Trahald'' (Nor. Mannish: burrowing)

= Angerthas Moria =
During the 2nd Age, or maybe its beginning, the Dwarves got accustomed with Angerthas of the Noldor and they modified it to suit Khuzdul, their language. This alphabet was spread further wherever the Dwarves went, hence the name Angerthas Moria, which is exemplified on the '''Balin's Tomb Inscription'''.

The Dwarves introduced various new cirth and some unsystematic minor changes to the values. The greatest of those changes, which resulted in major reorder, was the switch of the cirth for ''s'' and ''h'' (&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;), and for unknown reasons, the abandonment of the cirth &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;$&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; for which they substituted &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;. Subsequently they used &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;@&lt;/em&gt; for ''r'' and subsequently &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;u&lt;/em&gt; for ''n''! 

They used also &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;, which was a simplified form of &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;u&lt;/em&gt;. Following the relation of those two letters, they gave to &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; the value ''z'' to relate better with &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;, which as mentioned had now the value ''s''.

Tolkien doesn’t mention any other cirth abandoned by the Dwarves but much must have been, as there are many that represent sounds not occurring in (at least our published words of) Khuzdul, like ''th, dh, hw'' etc. It is strange also to observe that some of the cirth they introduced represent sounds not occurring in their language, like ''nj, hy, ñ, y-, hy''! Of course, our corpus of Khuzdul is very limited to judge the necessity or not, of these sounds.

=== Notes ===
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;: This certh is said to represent the clear or glottal beginning of a word with an initial vowel. It seems that it is used in words derived from a consonantal base whose first consonant is a glottal stop.

*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;: These cirth where a halved form of &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;, used for vowels like those in English ''butter''. When weak they were reduced to a stroke without a stem (&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/em&gt; represented a schwa sound, an unstressed vowel, while &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt; a sound similar to the schwa, only in stressed syllables.

*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;: This sign is to denote aspirate ''kh, th'' etc which were frequent in Khuzdul.

=== Examples ===
The only Angerthas Moria inscription by Tolkien is '''Balin’s Tomb'''.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;2calu&lt;br&gt;
3SdluSa&lt;br&gt;

''Baruk Khazâd. Khazâd ai-mênu!''

and some other words:

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;uSaSeeVlw9lu&lt;/em&gt;	''Nulukkhizdin'' (caves of Nargothrond)

Hi Jamesday, I just noticed your comment on the revision history of [[IT bookshelf]] (Jan 16, 2005) (&quot;despam. THE TWO VERSIONS OF THIS ARTICLE BEFORE THIS SPAM ARE MISSING DUE TO HUMAN ERROR BY ME. Sorry for the inconvenience.&quot;). How could this happen? I mean.. technically. I thought no page history can be deleted by a common user - or did you touch the database directly? Just curious... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 07:37, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:As James isn't here very often, I thought I'd let you know that he's a [[m:developer|developer]], which lets him do strange things. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:08, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::Oh, then he might help me with a problem I just posted on [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Who is responsible for the print CSS%3F]]:
::&quot;I'd like to add a box to my project, that does not show up on print, just on screen. I looked at the [http://en.wikibooks.org/skins/common/commonPrint.css Wikibooks commonPrint.css] but didn't find any generic class &quot;.noPrint&quot; or something like this. I could just use a class &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;DIV class=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to mimic this behavior, but it is not a clean solution, as top might in the future also have other stylistic properties that I don't want to inherit. Any idea, who could change the CSS file mentioned above? It would be a simple one line addition to the CSS file. (adding it to my private CSS file would not be of much help, since I want to use this property in a book for everybody).&quot; --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 09:47, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[Alchemy]]==
*This book passes off medieval pseudo-science as fact, offers baseless, ambiguous and contradictory claims (e.g. &quot;''This is an exercise in operative alchemy. That is the practical means of refinement. Speculative alchemy is what you are reading. Alchemy is the integration of knowledge into the practice or art of living. In this sense science is speculative. Technology is operative. Alchemy is the craft that combines the truth of science with the technology to enable that truth.''&quot;). Ridiculous assertions and bald-faced lies are tossed off nonchalantly (e.g. &quot;''The agenda of alchemy has always been the furtherance of human knowledge and the integration and improvement of society. Alchemy has also been a technological system, interested in working operations and the preparation of material wealth, longevity and a big theory of everything now being attempted by modern physics.''&quot;).

*The book offers no prospect of being changed or improved to something of value (or even something not completely false).

*The book is not a science textbook (it's listed in the science section), nor even a textbook of any kind. I see no compelling argument for its existence on Wikipedia.--[[User:24.103.207.38|24.103.207.38]] 22:16, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)
**Extraordinary as it may seem you do not have the ability to predict the potential of something to evolve. There are few things that are more able to generate correction than that which is completely false. According to your interpretation the book merely needs to be factual. Operative alchemy is partly based on paradox and multi leveled symbols - what you refer to as ambiguety and contradiction. It also uses ridiculous assertions to test the 'metal' and response of those who are easily swayed by such techniques. The alchemical term for such people is 'puffers'. If you know what is required to refine this book then please do so. However it may be that you belong to those who have always had a tendency to burn and flame what is beyond their certainties. I gather this is not your intention? [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 21:10, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)
***Please speak in plain English - I can't follow what you are saying. Are you saying that it's perfectly ok to right something that is not factual into an article? because if you I'm afraid that you are going against the whole ethos of wikibooks ans the wikimedia foundation. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:59, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Well maybe it should be moved to media studies? Are you seriously suggesting there are no textbooks on operative alchemy of this kind. Clearly one is required. [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 21:10, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I agree it's not a science textbook, but that can be delt with by removing it from the science section. I'm not at all convinced that it needs to be delted outright though. The book needs serious amounts of work, but we since alchemy did lead to the science of chemistry we should have abook on this subject. '''Weak keep''' [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:59, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' As long as the textbook does not pass itself off as fact (so it should have a clear warning at the top), it seems like something that somebody may want to find out about.  Definitely needs quite a bit of work though.

*'''Keep''' Just because the topic of the book is not part of mainstream science doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to exist. I would be very interested in reading about the history of alchemy, myself. However, I would suggest that the language, which seems particularly obfuscatory and murky (as may be the nature of such a topic), be clarified. --[[User:Chuckhoffmann|Chuck Hoffmann]] 13:32, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''- I think there could be a category for funny useless books, like Vandwelling, Time Travel Genius, and this.  But if those others go, this should too. -- [[User:Tormod|Tormod]] 04:56, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)


*'''Keep''' Alchemy is philosophy, and an ancient perspective on percieved manifested reality, identity and evolution WITHIN that context, using terms suited to the perspectives, and style of percieving, which have collectively formulated it.  Arguments about the usefulness of an alchemy treatise are moot.  Consider that calling water an amino acid comprised of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen is an conventional oversimplification for one who has learned to relate and identify with the subtle interactions of manifested reality, and an outright mistruth, a stunted truth, for one who percieves reality through the eyes of a physicist.  All these 'factual' entries are descriptions, not facts, behooving one to be true to topic.  Alchemy is philosophy, part of the rudiments of thought, of self-awareness.  It is only of use to one who would increase intimacy of self-awareness (including what one percieves and indentifies with as &quot;thing&quot;, a necessary component of &quot;self&quot;, being &quot;not identified as self&quot;).  It is of practical significance (as a text); the applications of an understanding of alchemy ARE what's happening all around us and in us, and it is useless other than as a pathway to wisdom, which I will personally define as understanding in operation.  This is a call for clarity (and editing out the spurious content,) not censorship.  

* '''Keep'''  Many things one person considers useless another finds of great value.  Let a thousand flowers bloom!! [[User:Simontzu|simontzu]]                 


BTW The sacred texts archive has excellent references in the public domain on alchemy.

      <comment>/* Dynamic multidimensional arrays */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Networking in UNIX|Language extensions}}

With its extensive use, a number of common practices and conventions have evolved to help avoid errors in C programs. These are simultaneously a demonstration of the application of good software engineering principles to a language and an indication of the limitations of C. Although few are used universally, and some are controversial, each of these enjoys wide use.

== Dynamic multidimensional arrays ==

Although one-dimensional arrays are easy to create dynamically using malloc, and fixed-size multidimensional arrays are easy to create using the built-in language feature, dynamic multidimensional arrays are trickier. There are a number of different ways to create them, each with different tradeoffs. The two most popular ways to create them are:
* They can be allocated as a single block of memory, just like static multidimensional arrays. This requires that the array be ''rectangular'' (i.e. subarrays of lower dimensions are static and have the same size).  The disadvantage is that the syntax of declaration the pointer is a little tricky for programmers at first.  For example, if one wanted to create an array of ints of 3 columns and &lt;tt&gt;rows&lt;/tt&gt; rows, one would do
 int (*multi_array)[3] = malloc(rows * sizeof(int[3]));
:(Note that here &lt;tt&gt;multi_array&lt;/tt&gt; is a pointer to an array of 3 ints.)

:Because of array-pointer interchangeability, you can index this just like static multidimensional arrays, i.e. &lt;tt&gt;multi_array[5][2]&lt;/tt&gt; is the element at the 6th row and 3rd column.

* They can be allocated by first allocating an array of pointers, and then allocating subarrays and storing their addresses in the array of pointers (this approach is also known as an [[w:Iliffe vector|Iliffe vector]]). The syntax for accessing elements is the same as for multidimensional arrays described above (even though they are stored very differently).  This approach has the advantage of the ability to make ragged arrays (i.e. with subarrays of different sizes). However, it also uses more space and requires more levels of indirection to index into, and can have worse cache performance. It also requires many dynamic allocations, each of which can be expensive.


For more information, see the [http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/q6.16.html comp.lang.c FAQ, question 6.16].

In some cases, the use of multi-dimensional arrays can best be addressed as an array of structures.  Before user-defined data structures were available, a common technique was to define a multi-dimensional array, where each column contained different information about the row.  This approach is also frequently used by beginner programmers.  For example, columns of a two-dimensional character array might contain last name, first name, address, etc.

In cases like this, it is better to define a structure that contains the information that was stored in the columns, and then create an array of pointers to that structure.  This is especially true when the number of data points for a given record might vary, such as the tracks on an album.  In these cases, it is better to create a structure for the album that contains information about the album, along with a dynamic array for the list of songs on the album.  Then an array of pointers to the album structure can be used to store the collection.

* Another useful way to create a dynamic multi-dimensional array is to flatten the array and index manually. For example, a 2-dimensional array with sizes x and y has x*y elements, therefore can be created by
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int dynamic_multi_array[x*y];
&lt;/source&gt;
The index is slightly trickier than before, but can still be obtained by y*i+j. You then access the array with
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
static_multi_array[i][j];
dynamic_multi_array[y*i+j];
&lt;/source&gt;
Some more examples with higher dimensions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int dim1[w];
int dim2[w*x];
int dim3[w*x*y];
int dim4[w*x*y*z];

dim1[i]
dim2[w*j+i];
dim3[w*(x*i+j)+k] // index is k + w*j + w*x*i
dim4[w*(x*(y*i+j)+k)+l] // index is w*x*y*i + w*x*j + w*k + l
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that w*(x*(y*i+j)+k)+l is equal to w*x*y*i + w*x*j + w*k + l, but uses fewer operations (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method Horner's Method]). It uses the same number of operations as accessing a static array by dim4[i][j][k][l], so should not be any slower to use.

The advantage to using this method is that the array can be passed freely between functions without knowing the size of the array at compile time (since C sees it as a 1-dimensional array, although some way of passing the dimensions is still necessary), and the entire array is contiguous in memory, so accessing consecutive elements should be fast. The disadvantage is that it can be difficult at first to get used to how to index the elements.

== Constructors and destructors ==

In most object-oriented languages, objects cannot be created directly by a client that wishes to use them. Instead, the client must ask the class to build an instance of the object using a special routine called a constructor. Constructors are important because they allow an object to enforce invariants about its internal state throughout its lifetime. Destructors, called at the end of an object's lifetime, are important in systems where an object holds exclusive access to some resource, and it is desirable to ensure that it releases these resources for use by other objects.

Since C is not an object-oriented language, it has no built-in support for constructors or destructors. It is not uncommon for clients to explicitly allocate and initialize records and other objects. However, this leads to a potential for errors, since operations on the object may fail or behave unpredictably if the object is not properly initialized. A better approach is to have a function that creates an instance of the object, possibly taking initialization parameters, as in this example:

  struct string {
      size_t size;
      char *data;
  };

  struct string *create_string(const char *initial) {
      assert (initial != NULL);
      struct string *new_string = malloc(sizeof(*new_string));
      if (new_string != NULL) {
          new_string-&gt;size = strlen(initial);
          new_string-&gt;data = strdup(initial);
      }
      return new_string;
  }

Similarly, if it is left to the client to destroy objects correctly, they may fail to do so, causing resource leaks. It is better to have an explicit destructor which is always used, such as this one:

  void free_string(struct string *s) {
      assert (s != NULL);
      free(s-&gt;data);  ''/* free memory held by the structure */''
      free(s);        ''/* free the structure itself */''
  }

It is often useful to combine destructors with ''[[#Nulling freed pointers]]''.

Sometimes it is useful to hide the definition of the object to ensure that the client does not allocate it manually. To do this, the structure is defined in the source file (or a private header file not available to users) instead of the header file, and a forward declaration is put in the header file:

  struct string;
  struct string *create_string(const char *initial);
  void free_string(struct string *s);

== Nulling freed pointers ==

As discussed earlier, after &lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt; has been called on a pointer, it becomes a dangling pointer. Worse still, most modern platforms cannot detect when such a pointer is used before being reassigned.

One simple solution to this is to ensure that any pointer is set to a null pointer immediately after being freed:
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://c-faq.com/malloc/ptrafterfree.html comp.lang.c FAQ list: &quot;Why isn't a pointer null after calling free?&quot;] mentions that &quot;it is often useful to set [pointer variables] to NULL immediately after freeing them&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
  free(p);
  p = NULL;
Unlike dangling pointers, a hardware exception will arise on many modern architectures when a null pointer is dereferenced. Also, programs can include error checks for the null value, but not for a dangling pointer value. To ensure it is done at all locations, a macro can be used:
  #define FREE(p)   do { free(p); (p) = NULL; } while(0)
(To see why the macro is written this way, see ''[[#Macro conventions]]''.) Also, when this technique is used, destructors should zero out the pointer that they are passed, and their argument must be passed by reference to allow this. For example, here's the destructor from ''[[#Constructors and destructors]]'' updated:
  void free_string(struct string **s) {
      assert(s != NULL  &amp;&amp;  *s != NULL);
      FREE((*s)-&gt;data);  ''/* free memory held by the structure */''
      FREE(*s);          ''/* free the structure itself */''
      *s=NULL;           ''/* zero the argument */''
  }

Unfortunately, this idiom will not do anything to any other pointers that may be pointing to the freed memory.  For this reason, some C experts regard this idiom as dangerous due to creating a false sense of security.

== Macro conventions ==

Because preprocessor macros in C work using simple token replacement, they are prone to a number of confusing errors, some of which can be avoided by following a simple set of conventions:
# Placing parentheses around macro arguments wherever possible. This ensures that, if they are expressions, the order of operations does not affect the behavior of the expression. For example:
#*Wrong: &lt;code&gt;#define square(x)   x*x&lt;/code&gt;
#*Better: &lt;code&gt;#define square(x)   (x)*(x)&lt;/code&gt;
# Placing parentheses around the entire expression if it is a single expression. Again, this avoids changes in meaning due to the order of operations.
#*Wrong: &lt;code&gt;#define square(x)   (x)*(x)&lt;/code&gt;
#*Better: &lt;code&gt;#define square(x)   ((x)*(x))&lt;/code&gt;
#*Dangerous, remember it replaces the text in verbatim. Suppose your code is &lt;code&gt;square (x++)&lt;/code&gt;, after the macro invocation will x be incremented by 2
# If a macro produces multiple statements, or declares variables, it can be wrapped in a '''do''' { ... } '''while'''(0) loop, with no terminating semicolon. This allows the macro to be used like a single statement in any location, such as the body of  an if statement, while still allowing a semicolon to be placed after the macro invocation without creating a null statement. Care must be taken that any new variables do not potentially mask portions of the macro's arguments.
#*Wrong: &lt;code&gt;#define FREE(p)   free(p); p = NULL;&lt;/code&gt;
#*Better: &lt;code&gt;#define FREE(p)   do { free(p); p = NULL; } while(0)&lt;/code&gt;
# Avoiding using a macro argument twice or more inside a macro, if possible; this causes problems with macro arguments that contain side effects, such as assignments.
# If a macro may be replaced by a function in the future, considering naming it like a function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Private Types Can be Completed in the Unit's Body'' This is actually not true. Maybe the author was speaking about private types that are defined as access to a type declared in the private part and defined in the body. That is:

 package Private_And_Body is
   type Private_Type is private;
 
 private
   type Body_Type is private;
   type Private_Type is access Body_Type;

This is equivalent to C ''opaque pointers''. I believed that it is used when in future versions the size of a data structure can grow, but I've only used it because is the sole rational approach to have real private types in C. Has someone used it? Is it interesting to add this info to the wikibook? - [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 12:12, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

The following paragraph has been moved from the book to the discussion page since this feature alledged to Tucker Taft has been present in Ada since Ada 83.

&lt;quote&gt;These types are sometimes called &quot;Taft types&quot; &amp;mdash;named after Tucker Taft, the main designer of Ada 95&amp;mdash; because were introduced in the so-called Taft Amendment to Ada 83. In other programming languages, this technique is called &quot;[[w:opaque pointer|opaque pointer]]s&quot;.&lt;/quote&gt;

== Quirks ==

I assume the described problem is caused by a bug of a particular GNAT version and maybe on a particular Windows version. Doesn't make sense to clarify this and add a link to the corresponding bug report? --[[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 18:48, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

: It seems like &quot;delay 0.0&quot; has been in wide spread use for tasking related issues (to do with synchronization points); comp.lang.ada usenet has reports on &quot;delay 0.0&quot; from as early as 1992. However, there is a hint in these messages that the expression was/is used to trigger a task switch, at least with a number of compilers. So maybe declaring this particular quirk a bug is less than could be done to improve the subsection. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] ([[User talk:GeorgBauhaus|talk]]) 11:18, 11 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">War Driving (wôr dri'vin) v.
Driving around looking for wireless networks.
-term coined by Pete Shipley

The term wardriving generally covers the practice of discovering and mapping (with the help of GPS) the wireless networks available in a particular area. Useful statistics are gathered from this activity, including statistics on the encryption used in discovered networks. Wardriving does not include the unethical activity of unauthorised connection to wifi networks (encrypted or unencrypted).

'''WARNING: THE TECHNIQUES DESCRIBED ON THIS PAGE MAY BE ILLEGAL IN YOUR JURISDICTION.  THIS PAGE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR LAWYER FOR MORE INFORMATION'''

== Equipment ==
To 'wardrive', you need the following equipment:
*A computer (preferably a laptop or PocketPC, as they are far more portable)
*A wifi card.
*Transportation.
*Software (Such as [http://www.netstumbler.com/ Netstumbler] for Windows, [http://kismetwireless.net Kismet] for Linux, and [http://kismac.binaervarianz.de/ KisMAC] for Mac OS X)
*A [[w:GPS|GPS]] receiver (optional but necessary to create a map)
*External omnidirectional antenna, such as a [[../Cantenna/]] (optional) 
*External unidirectional antenna (optional)

== How to Wardrive ==
After you have installed and started your sniffing software and have activated your wireless card, you should configure your GPS adapter. After that, drive to the area that you wish to investigate and pick up signals of the active wifi networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Nomination'''
* Every user can nominate books of interest for voting and add them at the end of the voting page.
* A featured wikibook cannot be nominated again for one year.
* To nominate a book just add that book to the voting section of the [[Wikibooks:Book_of_the_month/{{nextmonth|{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}_voting|voting page]] using this Wiki code: &lt;nowiki&gt;===&amp;nbsp;[[Book&amp;nbsp;Name]]&amp;nbsp;===&lt;/nowiki&gt; where &quot;Book Name&quot; is the name of the book.  When you have done this add {{tl|Botm}} to the top of the front page of the Wikibook.
'''Voting'''
* Every registered Wikibooks user can vote for as many of the nominated candidates as they like.
* '''Only registered Wikibooks users should vote''' while they are logged in (check by history of page). This is because it is impossible to detect multiple votes by a user using different anon IPs.
* Due to previous voting irregularities, we now require a user to show they are intending to participate with Wikibooks by showing a minimum of 20 edits in your edit history.  This number may increase in the future if continued problems persist.
* The use of [[w:Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sock puppets]] as a way to pad votes is strongly discouraged.  While you are not restricted to only one user account on Wikibooks, please use just one account for any voting activities on Wikibooks including the Book of the Month voting.  Suspicious cases of duplicate voting may be reviewed using the [[m:CheckUser|CheckUser]] services of MediaWiki software.
* To enter your votes, simply edit the appropriate sections by just inserting a new line with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# ~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to add your username and a time stamp in a new numbered list item.
* Please add only support votes. Opposing votes will not affect the result, as the winner is simply the one with the most support votes (see [[w:Approval voting]]).
* You may add short supporting or opposing comments to each candidate, signed with your name. These comments do not count in the voting process.
* Votes can be retracted by the voter until the voting closes.
'''Evaluation'''
* Voting ends 00:00UTC on the day specified.
* The winner is the candidate book with the most support votes.
* In case of a tie, the older book will be selected (by book history).
* Books with 3 or more votes will be automatically nominated for the following month.

* I am withdrawing my vote from this book 

: - firstly because I am not logged in and secondly because I helped to write it. Interestingly it was (when combined with the open source book - now a seperate book) voted for deletion, and is now up for an award - well no votes - but the thought is there. So let that be an inspiration to all wikibookians. :-) &lt;br&gt;
I would like to offer a sincere thanks to the community members who worked hard on putting everything into tables. It means the information can be added to, improved and updated. I would like to thank my agent and . . . (sorry got a little carried away there - Nurse - my injection if you please!)

: - the second reason for withdrawing my vote is a little Zen - I am withdrawing it because I never made it.

Good luck to Lucid Dreaming - which gets my vote even though I am not allowed to vote without logging in (which I have forgot my password for)

sparse on explanations (not definitions) and could quickly be polished a lot with some publicity  - [[User:Marknewlyn|Mark]]
*Excellent book - [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]]
* this guide is good for students preparing for exams. for full impact it really needs a complimentary textbook... perhaps [[http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst/]] could provide that! (i hope i voted correctly... i just edited the page by hand)

&lt;small&gt;''Previous Page: [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Render Settings|Render Settings]]'' -- ''Back to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro|Index]]''&lt;/small&gt;

When you render a scene in Blender, by default there will open a small window showing your image. If you want to publish your picture, you may want to render it a bit bigger. To do this, you have to open the Scene context (F10) and locate the Format sub-context (usually on the right).

You will see some settings there. Let's go through their meanings:
* SizeX: This parameter sets the width of the image in pixels.
* SizeY: This parameter sets the height of the image in pixels.
* AspX, AspY: These parameters specify the aspect ratio of the pixels. By default, this is 100:100, because a pixel on a computer screen has equal width and height. These settings can be used for screens whose pixels don't have equal width and height. For example, on a PAL system one pixel's width/height ratio is 54:51, which you can select there easily. Notice that these parameters don't change the size of the image.

There is one more thing changing the render size: In the Render sub-context (usually in the middle) there are 4 buttons: 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%. If you have chosen SizeX = 640, SizeY = 480 and you clicked 50%, your image will be 320 pixels wide and 240 pixels high.

'''WARNING''': I have encountered some crashes when I changed those parameters. If you have problems too, locate the Output sub-context (usually on the left) and select the option DispView instead of DispWin. This renders the image &quot;into&quot; Blender instead of making a new window.

== [[:Category:Recipe]] ==

Ah, that makes sense.  When I first found [[:Category:Recipe]], I just thought it was redundant with [[:Category:Recipes]] (much like [[:Category:Bread]] and [[:Category:Bread recipes]], but it is nicer to have a full list elsewhere from the tree listing.

This project definitely has a lot of different design considerations than wikipedia.  For instance, an index would be useless there, but necessary here (Say I want [[Cookbook:Jambalaya|Jambalaya]], which can be made with many meats. Do I look in [[:Category:Chicken recipes]], [[:Category:Seafood recipes]], or [[:Category:Southern recipes]] first?) 

You can tell I'm such a wikiholic.  Wikipedia is down to edits for a day and I go categorizing recipes like mad in wikibooks. --[[User:Laurascudder|Laurascudder]] 22:14, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Pasta e Fagioli ==

OK, I figured out your name..  Thanks again [[User:Too Old|Too Old]] 17:37, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

BTW:  To eliminate the problem with forgetting to log in;  If you always use the same IP, you can change your preferences to &quot;Remember accross sessions&quot;.

== Re: category hierarchies ==

''Hi, I perused your critique of wikibooks and since you're one of the more active people on here, I wonder what your opinion is on hierarchical category schemes.&lt;br&gt;[snip]&lt;br&gt;[[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 21:35, 12 July 2005 (UTC)''

== Problem:  Jewish Cooking ==

I want to add a category or categories for Jewish cooking.  My problem is that there are several different regional variations.  Northern and Eastern European Jews (Ashkenazim) have one way of cooking, Southern European Jews another.  Jews that trace their ancestry from the Mediaeval Jews of Iberia (Sfardim) have a third way. Then there are the Jews of Israel, and the Jews of North Africa.  Let alone the Jews of India, China, etc.

I could provide several Ashkenazik recipes, but where should I put them?  European Cuisine?  Northern or Eastern?  Where then would Sfardik or Israeli dishes go?  

Should Jewish cooking be split among Regional Cuisines, or should the regional varieties of Jewish cooking be subsumed under an over-all category of Jewish Cooking?  

Do you have any suggestions?  Can you help? [[User:Too Old|Too Old]] 02:27, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

==Thanks==
Now, if I got back to cooking, I could use my new camera to take pics of some of our recipes :) [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

==Suggestion==

Would it be possible to have some sort of link between some links so that adding one automatically inludes related links?  eg recently I added a Peruvian recipe. I inserted the appropriate 'Peruvian Recipes' category at page end. Then found that also there is a South American cat, A Peruvion Cuisine link on some Peruvian recipes, and a link to the Wikipedia Peruvian Food  section on another. It seems somewhat tedious if each has to be added individually when adding just the Peruvian foods could just trigger an alert for the other 
three or be programmed to do so.[[User:Conce|Conce]] 04:31, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:: You could create a template (to go at the bottom of the page), named perhaps ''Italic text''&quot;Template:Peruvian&quot;, which you would include by doing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{peruvian}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and which would have the contents: 
&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikipedia|Peruvian Food}}
[[Category:Peruvian recipes]]
[[Category:South American recipes]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
::That said, you should probably not include Peruvian recipes in ''both'' Cat:Peruvian and Cat:SouthAmerican since Cat:SouthAmerican is a supercategory of Cat:Peruvian. In the future, there will probably be a way to see all the pages in descending categories, which means that anything in peruvian food would show up nicely in south american food without a tagging it with both categories. Also be warned that including a category through a template requires extra work when the template changes -- you'll have to do edits on all the pages that include the template in order for their category listings to refresh. Gah. hope this is all clear. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:14, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I dearly hope that the template problem is a soon-to-be-fixed bug and not something considered unfixable. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:37, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

yes.thank you. usefull info. which I need to consider. [[User:Conce|Conce]] 05:32, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

==rhubarb pie picture==
I agree that a solution needs to be found.  But I do think that my own arrangement is more satisfactory than your latest one.  I won't revert yours, but I think some work should be done on this.  I suppose that either the box or the picture needs to be drastically moved.... [[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 15:33, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
:Well, I'll try playing around with the Image and things, although I'm certainly not a guru at this.  And yes, I did indeed take the picture -- if you click on it, it gives you all sorts of info about it.... [[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 18:08, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== Category unions ==

If you recall, we were previously discussing the possibility of creating a union of two existing categories. It seems there is a MediaWiki extension for this already, although it is presently only enabled on Wikinews. See [[m:DynamicPageList]] for details. Drop a request into bugzilla if you want it enabled for Wikibooks. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:53, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Cool, thanks for the pointer, I'll probably request it tonight. This doesn't really solve the problem though as the lists must still be manipulated by hand and what I really want is automatic inclusion of pages further up the category tree (DAG) and ''dynamic user-controlled'' cross-category listings (instead of page-controlled). This is definitely a step in the right direction, though. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:12, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

== Poe tay toe ==
''I kinda think the potato varieties should just be merged with the main potoato page, no?''
:They originally were, but someone deleted them so I gave them a home of their own. The page could get very very big if more people add other varieties, as I would hope. (Although no-one did before &lt;wry face emoticon&gt;) [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 09:02, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

== Sweet Potatoes or Yams ==

Well, the two are different things, both starchies like the potato, but they're not the same.  So they really shouldn't be under yam. http://www.seedsofknowledge.com/yams.html [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 02:59, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== cookwork ==

I agree with [[User:Duk]], [[Cookbook:Tahini Goddess Dressing]] should not be marked with the cookwork template. You've marked many, many pages this way. The pages that really do need work are now buried in a category full of fairly-decent pages. Probably all the Cookbook pages could use some work!

I have been thinking of going down that list and just removing the template from 90% of the pages it is on. The template is way overused. It's like the &quot;under construction&quot; signs that most web pages had around 1995.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:54, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

: I did not actually add most of the recipes in that category, but had [[User:Uncle G]] mark them when he transwikied recipes since their links would probably be broken and not have proper formatting. I use the template to denote pages that don't conform to the standard cookbook formatting or need categorization, but don't have time to fix up when I mark them. Perhaps a less invasive template would be more appropriate for those types of pages, but they do need some sort of attention.

Thanks for your suggestion on [[User_talk:Fasten#vegan_cheese_ideas|vegan cheese]]. Feel free to add your input to the vegan cheese recipe.

Thanks for the attention you've given to [[Cookbook:Chocolate Cheesecake]].  I've done a little cleanup, but is there anything more you can think of that needs doing?  This is really one of my favorite recipes, so I'd like to put its best foot forward.--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 02:22, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

:Okay, I see that the attention tag is gone.  I made a few more changes, and I think that will be that until another editor has something to add.  Thanks again!--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 06:01, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

== could use some help ==

We've been getting subtle and subversive vandalism by {{user|198.236.13.33}} recently. I'm sick and very tired this week. Please have a look. It's a mess. Some of the more-reasonable-looking edits have had non-revert edits afterward, making it difficult to undo things properly. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:49, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

== Title Case ==

I wouldn't object to moving the pages back, and I'll refrain from writing new titles in sentence case.  I'll continue my practice of creating redirects with all case conventions not covered (except CamelCase, which would just be silly) when I have the time; this should simplify any eventual change in convention that may take place.  Thank you for your courtesy, and for cleaning up after me on so many occasions.--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 05:37, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Chile recipes]] ==

The [[:Category:Chile recipes]] category is something that could cause trouble. Chile peppers are fruits of ''capsicum'' plants, and are commonly (not always) hot tasting. Chile is a dish normally containing beef, chili peppers, tomatoes, cumin, etc. (from [[User:AlbertCahalan]])

: We have:
:*[[:Category:Chile recipes]], which I was using for hot peppers.
:*[[:Category:Chili recipes]], which I was using for the dish.
:*[[:Category:Bell Pepper recipes]], which I was using for the larger, related, and non-spicy peppers.
: is there some better organization you can think of? This is pretty ad-hoc, so there's definitely room for improvement. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:39, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

::Well, Chile and Chili and Chilli are all valid ways to spell the various things. So you're using a very arbitrary distinction, no better than using uppercase or two spaces or a hyphen. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:34, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Agreed. =) I chose those semi-arbitrarily.
::: A google test: &quot;(chile|chili|chilli) (beans|pepper)&quot; (&quot;beans&quot; to filter out non-dish pages to some minor degree):
:::*chili beans: 3,230,000
:::*chile beans: 1,900,000
:::*chilli beans: 631,000
:::*chili pepper: 2,920,000
:::*chile pepper: 1,790,000
:::*chilli pepper: 1,770,000
:::So &quot;chili&quot; wins out for both kinds. I think so long as they're consistent and the descriptions are clear, it'll be ok (since the words themselves are ambiguous). Any suggestion for a better kind of distinction?  [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:45, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

I think the [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures]] page would be an appropriate home, especially if you can relate the values to regular measurements.

== Re: the other wiki cookbook ==
Hi Kellen. Including its creator, there are currently only three people on cookiwiki. The creator didn't know about this wikibook, and either did I when i joined the cookiwiki! Both he and I are just getting acquainted to the Cookbook and are [http://www.cookiwiki.net/cookiwiki/index.php/CookiWiki:Community_Portal considering] contributing here instead. I've added a few things to the Cookbook already, and I have to admit, its been challenging to figure out how things work. Wikibooks has such a huge amount of info, that its difficult to figure out whether to consult pages on the overarching Wikibook, or on Cookbook specific pages. Over the weekend, I'm going to add an introduction page here to better orient new users to the organization of the site. The one major thing that isn't found here is a page to track changes specific to the entire Cookbook. That was initally a turn-off to the Cookbook, but some contributors have given me some alternative routes, and I plan to put those in the Intro page.

== You may just be onto something... ==

Hiya Kellen.  Thanks for your response to my discussion with UncleG on the category naming thingybob.  I think you may just be onto something very useful with your idea to do the recipes with a dietary indication in their name, rather than tagging them using my letter suggestions.  I have vested interest, since I am on 2 diets, Gluten and Dairy Free.  I would like to see recipes like that.  So your way would be like this: [[Cookbook:Dutch Apple Cake (Diabetic)]]?  That would work for me, definitely!  Thanks for your comment.  [[User:Tmalmjursson|Tmalmjursson]] 03:04, 12 February 2006 (UTC)  [[User_talk:Tmalmjursson|Thor's pet yack]]

== &quot;Subst:&quot; ==

Hi. On Wikipedia I have been encouraged to substitute templates as per [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SUBST]. The primary reason for doing so is that it speeds up the site since every time someone views a page, the server must get text from a separate page for every template used. However I am aware that some templates are inappropriate for this - I am going to revert my subst' back. --[[User:BorgQueen|BorgQueen]] 17:40, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

== Marking content for speedy deletes ==

It would be appreciated if you didn't remove the text prior to marking up for a speedy delete.  By leaving the offending text (unless you really think it is obscene and don't want to bother admins with it) you make it very obvious to get a second opinion on the topic, and one that with all of the markups you've given I have agreed with you.  Just to verify, I have had to go in and check the history (to avoid removing content that was marked up as an act of vandalism).

Anyway, thanks for helping to clean up and maintain Wikibooks.  Efforts like yours, even though small, are very much appreciated and make a huge difference.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:05, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== Asking for items ==
=== 「___をください。」 ===
When you want to ask for an item, you say 「___をください。」

In some circumstances you may have to specify the amount of the item that you want. To do this, you would say the number of items and add the suffix counter for the type of item: 「___を___ください。」

*「タオルを三枚ください。」 &quot;Please give me three towels.&quot;

=== Please show me ___.「___を見せてください。」 ===
If you just want to see an item, you'd say 「___を見せてください。」 (___を　みせて　ください).
*見せて means &quot;show (it to me)&quot;

*You'll hear this at customs as you enter Japan, when the customs official requests to see your passport.

「パスポートを見せてください 」　(パスポート　を　みせて　ください).  Please, show me your passport.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Robotics#Design Basics|Robotics]]: Design Basics: '''Building Materials'''

There is plenty of choice when it comes to picking the building materials for your robot. However not every material is a good choice.

There are three groups of materials. Each of these three groups have their own characteristics, possibilities and difficulties.

'''Note:''' There is a fourth group of materials called ceramics. However this group is only marginally useful for robotics.

'''Note''' In this book robot sizes are mentioned as small, medium and large. With small I mean any robot that can maneuver on a table. Medium means any robot that's too large to move on a table but still is light enough to lift on your own. Large mean anything bigger and heavier than that. Also robots that'll have to operate in real life (rough) condition should be counted as either medium or large.

=Wood=
Wood is probably the best material to start with. It's light, pretty strong and easy to work on. Not to mention cheap and easily available.&lt;BR&gt;
Even if you intend to use metal or plastic, wood can be handy for various purposes like prototyping and building jigs and other aids in working on metal or plastic parts. &lt;BR&gt;
The main reason that you will not see many wooden robots is because wood doesn't seem to fit in the picture of high tech machines. Funny thing is that (synthetic) composite materials have a very high coolness-factor (e.g Kevlar&amp;reg; Yes, Kevlar is a brand name. It's made of Aramide), yet wood, a natural composite material, hasn't. 
*Useful for small or medium sized robots, prototyping and as construction aid.

=Metal=
There are 80 different pure metals each having different properties. However in the world of Robotics there are only a select few from the 80 that are useful. This list is increased by Alloying. Alloying is the process of combining either in solution or compound, two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal, and where the resulting material has metallic properties. The resulting metallic substance has different properties (sometimes significantly different) from those of its components.The properties of some metals and their alloys are below.

Some alloys are limited in supply in the market due to the limited demand for them. In order to obtain these materials it is often required to look further than the general consumer market.

==Aluminum==
Aluminium (or aluminum, both are correct) is commonly available in extruded forms in different shapes. It's pretty cheap, light, strong, resistant to corrosion and easy to work with. However welding aluminum isn't practical as it needs special welding equipment (MIG/MAG or TIG welding) and the bond isn't very strong. While soldering is possible, it doesn't make a strong bond. Rather use  nuts and bolts or rivets.
*Useful for small or medium sized robots.
*Useful for non-load bearing parts in large robots.
*Not very good for bearings.

There is an alloy of aluminium called ''Duraluminium'' it is almost as strong as soft steel but very light thus making it a natural choice for the construction of Aircraft. However as a trade off for the combination of being strong and light it is quite expensive (if you can find it at all). The best bet is to search aircraft wrecking yards.

==Steel==
Commonly available steel is an alloy of iron. It's stronger than aluminum, but it's also heavier and harder to work with - in particular, it blunts tools more easily and swarf is always razor sharp. Welding isn't much of a problem. However heating steel (at welding temperatures) changes its characteristics (strength, hardness, rust resistance).
Note that drilling steel requires cooling and a slow drill speed (both rotational and feeding). If you drill too fast, you'll see your drill heating up red hot. Drills that have been red hot lose their hardness and will be dull in no time. 
*Useful for large robots and robots intended to operate in rough conditions. Too heavy for small or medium sized robots.

==Bronze==
Heavy. Very good for bearings. Too expensive and heavy for most other purposes.

==Brass==
Heavier and more expensive than aluminum. Can be soldered.
*Useful for bearings.

==Copper==
Mostly available as wire or axles. Quite heavy, very good conductor.
*Useful for special parts and wires.

=Synthetic Materials=
Like steel, synthetic materials are a name for a very large group of materials. There are hundreds of different plastics each with different characteristics and uses. We'll be covering only a few of them, but many techniques work just as well with other synthetics.

Most synthetic materials can be bent into shape after they are heated. A hot air gun (used to remove paint) can be sufficient for this purpose. Drilling and sawing these materials requires low speeds or they have to be cooled with water so the material doesn't melt.
Soft plastics can be cut with an utility knife.

==PVC==
Polyvinyl chloride: Used for plastic tubes.

==Plexiglass==
Polymethyl methacrylate: Transparent material. Can be bent when heated to 200°C.

=Composite materials=

Polymer composite materials are materials consisting of a polymer matrix and a reinforcing material. (think of reinforced concrete: the polymer matrix is the steel grid and the reinforcing material is the concrete)&lt;BR&gt;
These materials are considerably stronger and stiffer than steel and aluminium alloys.&lt;BR&gt;

 Material           Specific strength        specific stiffness&lt;BR&gt;
 Steel              150*10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg            20*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg&lt;BR&gt;
 E-fiberglass/epoxy 300*10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg            10*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg&lt;BR&gt;
 Aramide/epoxy      500*10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg            25*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg

The reason why composite materials haven't replaced steel is because of cost. Composites are only used where weight is a more important factor than price, e.g., airplanes: less weight means less fuel consumption and/or more useful payload.

=Other Materials=

==Foamcore==
Foamcore is relatively weak, but it is very practical for making fast prototypes. (

==Cardboard==
Generally, it's weak and looks ugly{{fact}}, but it's very practical for making fast prototypes. Can be cut with a knife or scissors and put together with duct tape or glue gun. When dry, it's an insulator and can be used as a prototyping board for circuits.

With careful design, corrugated cardboard is strong enough to hold up full-sized humans ( [http://www.arcspace.com/gehry_new/cardb/cardb.html a] [http://www.erb.co.il/en/cooperations.asp b] [http://www.dezeen.com/2012/11/12/cardboard-bicycle-by-izhar-gafni/ c] ).

Often a cardboard mockup is built to make sure the parts of the robot all fit together properly.

Sometimes cardboard is more than strong enough for many parts of a working robot ([http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/392540503/cardboard-robot-robotic-arm-and-smart-phone-camera a] [http://thecardboardrobot.com/ b]).

Bienvenue mes amis dans le monde magnifique des francophones !

=French B SL=

As of 2012 the IB Language B exam has changed in format and contents. This article is outdated. 

Pour faciliter la communication entre les étudiants de ce niveau, et puisque ceci est la section Anglaise de « Wikibooks », la plupart de cette section est en Anglais.  

To begin, French B is the second lowest difficulty of Group 2 Subjects. It is intended for students who have some background in French already, and wish to improve upon their reading and writing. There is no IB syllabus for French, so it really depends on your teacher to prepare you for your exams.

==The Exams==

Your French IB mark is determined primarily by external markers. The Oral Exam is internally marked, and externally moderated, whereas the Paper 1 &amp; 2 are externally marked.

===The Oral Exam===

You are expected to speak for 3 to 5 minutes on a subject of your choice. Following this, there is a question period between you and your teacher for 2-3 minutes. During this question period, their job is to show your breadth and depth in the French language.

Note: You have to do your oral via cassette tape recording or digitally via CD recorder.

Tips for the Oral:
:*It would be most beneficial to your mark if you chose something relating in some way to French culture. Talking about Ford cars really has nothing to do with French culture, and would not impress markers. Some examples that are sure to &quot;wow&quot; the marker would be
:***French Regions (i.e. Provence, Champagne, Franche-Comté)
:***French-speaking Countries (i.e. Cameroon, Haiti, Tahiti, Belgium, etc...)
:***French Cuisine
:***French Art
:***Basically, anything distinctly French or Francophone will do
:*Pick something you're interested in and can talk easily about
:*Read newspapers and magazines about recent events in France or French-speaking countries, and express your opinions. 
:*Watch French television. It is very helpful in picking up enunciation and pronunciation, as well as French expressions, which the markers love to hear.
:* Practise your speech and record yourself. It is very helpful to hear yourself on tape, and to recognize what common errors you make.

===Paper 1===
The Paper 1 exam is 1h 30 minutes. This exam is designed to test your reading comprehension. You will be given two packages:
:*Your readings
:*The exam itself 

The exam is composed of approximately 50 questions. They range from True/False to Fill in the Blanks to Finding Synonyms to Matching.

A strong grasp of French vocabulary is a must, as well as grammar.

===Paper 2===

The Paper 2 exam is also 1h 30 minutes. It is designed to test your writing skills. A list of choices will be given to you, upon which you must select ''ONE'' and write a minimum of 250 words on.

Some teachers recommend that you write at least double the minimum, but to be honest, go with quality over quantity. Aim for 350 words, but make those 350 words rife with idiomatic expressions, various verb tenses, and a clear presentation of your knowledge of the language. It is all a matter of personal preference in the end.

===Tips for Paper 2===

Il faut que vous sachiez comment écrire dans les formes suivantes:

- Discours

- Lettre à un ami

- Lettre formelle

- Page de journal intime / Blog

- Essai

- Guide (humoristique ou non)

- Interview / Dialogue / Conversation

- Editorial

- Brochure

- Compte-rendu

- Page d'accueil d'un site Internet

- Article de journal

- Critique (de livre ou de film)

- Fin d'un récit

Know the specific formats of each form, as these are easy marks to get. If you fail to write in the specific format, your points can go down by a lot. Format includes register, vocabulary, phrases, and physical appearance (for example if it is a newspaper article include columns). 

Les questions d'écriture vont exiger une de ces formes. Si vous n'écrivez pas dans la forme précisé, vous serez pénalisé.

[[Image:SPMcentral.jpg|thumb|Statistical Parametric Mapping]]
SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) refers to the construction and assessment of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about functional imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in software that is called SPM.

The SPM software package has been designed for the analysis of brain imaging data sequences. The sequences can be a series of images from different cohorts, or time-series from the same subject. The current release is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG and MEG.

SPM is made freely available to the [neuro]imaging community, to promote collaboration and a common analysis scheme across laboratories. The software represents the implementation of the theoretical concepts of Statistical Parametric Mapping in a complete analysis package, as a suite of [[MATLAB|MATLAB]] ([http://www.mathworks.com/ The MathWorks, Inc]) functions and subroutines with some externally compiled [http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1605.html C] routines.

My real name is Em. I'm a computer systems engineering student from Australia. I like playing the saxophone, video games, and loud music (in no particular order...)

[mailto:emcarter@ozemail.com.au My email]

=My Contributions=
I've started contributing to [[Electrical Engineering, Basic signals]], and once the [[computer engineering]] text gets going, I intend to contribute to that too.

I reckon I might contribute to some of the cs texts too. I'll just have to see how I go.

I also notice that the [[saxophone]] text is really barren... but that's kind of a difficult text to work on. Once again, I'll see how I go.

=My Usage=

I'm currently teaching myself [[Japanese]] from wikibooks, much to the amusement of my younger sister, who is studing Japanese in her final year of high school. I have used some the programming texts as a reference, and the same with markup lingos like [[XHTML_(XML)|XHTML]] and [[CSS_(XML)|CSS]].

=Final Words=
Wiki is great. Long live Wiki in all it's wonderous forms.

I'm adding this section now, and I'll do basic fingering sections tomorrow. I restructured the whole thing a little bit.

Hi there. I'd like to contribute to this book as well. Have we considered adding a section on reading music?

-[[User:MasterSheep|MasterSheep]] 05:10, 25 October 2006 (UTC)


I've filled out the rest of the sharp and flat keys.  Might it not be worth removing the references to the key signatures as this is really a forward reference to a non-existent page as it currently stands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The saxophone is a family of woodwind musical instruments. Each type of saxophone has a different size, pitch and key. There are four types of saxophone commonly used, although more do exist, they are very rare and are not yet covered in this text.

==Soprano Saxophone==
One of the highest in pitch of the saxophones is the Bb Soprano Saxophone. A person who masters the soprano usually finds it easy to play the alto saxophone because of the mouthpiece size.  The soprano comes in three shapes.  The most common is the straight soprano, which looks like a brass clarinet, albeit with a conical shape, rather than a cylindrical one.  The next is the curved soprano which looks like a mini-alto sax.  The least common is the saxello, which looks like a straight soprano, but the bell faces front

There are two smaller varities of saxophone, the sopranino (in Eb, an octave above the alto, in both straight and curved versions), and newly developed, the soprillo saxophone in Bb, an octave above the soprano, straight version only.  The sopranino is sometimes used in saxophone chiors but the soprillo is almost never seen.  

==Alto Saxophone==
Lower in pitch than the soprano, and higher than the tenor, the alto sax is an E flat instrument.  The notes range from low Bb to a high F, not including altissimo.  It is the most popular member in the saxophone family simply because it is the easiest to play and master, especially among beginning students. 
 
There are straight versions of the alto as well. Both LA Sax and Keilwirth make straight varieties of this sax, but it is again, uncommon. One of the most influential alto sax players in the Bebop era of the jazz scene is Charlie Parker, who was known for introducing flurries of 8th and 16th notes into improvised solos.

==Tenor Saxophone==
This is probably the most famous and well known sounds in the music of today.  It ranges from low Bb on the treble cleff to high F, and even higher with altissimo notes.  Usually, the tenor is in the key of Bb, played by 80's musician, Eddie Money, and 1950's father of free jazz, John Coltrane. Sometimes they are placed in the key of C, which was most notably played by Lester Young.

The tenor sax is used in marching bands, concert bands, and jazz bands.  In marching bands, they play close to the same thing as trombones and baritones.  In concert bands, they act as a woodwind baritone if you will.  In jazz bands, they have the most significant role in a big band setting.  They are good instruments for improvisation and used in solo jazz settings.

==Baritone Saxophone==
One of the lowest saxophones, the baritone is an E flat instrument. It is the largest common saxophone, and it is characterised by its unusual curled neck. There is also a straight baritone saxophone, but it is extremely rare. 

There are lower pitched members of the saxophone family that do exist. The bass, contrabass, tubax, and subcontrabass tubax are members that plummet to the deepest pitches of the piano.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Counterpoint is a method of composing music. It is a set of &quot;rules&quot; that are traditionally followed in order to write music for two or more voices. It is organized into &quot;types&quot; of counterpoint known as ''species''. They go in order from most restrictive to the least. The more voices there are in a musical score, the more freedom the voices have (less rules to follow). It is important to know what [[Counterpoint/Consonant Intervals|Consonant Intervals]] and [[Counterpoint/Dissonant Intervals|Dissonant Intervals]] are.

==History==
Much of the credit for the formation and organization of the rules of counterpoint is given to a single man by the name of Joseph Fux. His classic and groundbreaking work on counterpoint, ''Gradus ad parnassum'', is regarded as the most important contribution to the advancement of the theories of counterpoint. It has been historically proven that great composers such as Haydn, Mozart, as well as Beethoven worked from the same book (giving much to say concerning the usefulness and importance of this method.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Second Species counterpoint, two tones are used against each note of the melody. It is important to note where one places the consonant and dissonant tones.

Accented beats on the counterpoint should create consonant intervals. The exceptions for this are that the perfect unison should only fall on unaccented beats until the last note of the song and the octave should be used sparingly on accented beats.

Dissonant tones can be used on the weak beats provided that it is used as a [[Counterpoint/Passing Tone|passing tone]].

A rest may be used in place of the first beat for the counterpoint. This is the only place a rest is allowed. In this case, the unaccented beat must have a perfect consonant interval. If the cantus firmus is above, this would refer only to the octave or the prime. If below, it refers to the octave, the prime, and the fifth.

It is often best to start by writing the cadence first.

== Cadences ==

When writing the cadence in second species counterpoint, you have to think about whether you are writing your counterpoint above or below the [[Counterpoint/Cantus Firmus|Cantus Firmus]].

=== Writing cadences above the Cantus Firmus ===

If your Cantus firmus ends in 2-1, then your counterpoint will end with (6-7)-8. Often the 5 will proceed the 6.

If your Cantus Firmus ends in 7-8, then your counterpoint will end with (2-5)-P

=== Writing cadences below the Cantus Firmus ===

If the cadence of the Cantus Firmus is 7-8 then the counterpoint will end with (5-2)-1.

If the cadence of the Cantus Firmus is 2-1 then the counterpoint will end with (

 NOTE: Numbers in () show that they are half the duration of the others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As well as being enjoyable in their own right, '''alcoholic drinks''' are frequently used as ingredients in recipes. This page lists the most common types of drink. See also [[Bartending/Cocktails|Cocktails]] for mixed drinks, and [[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]] in the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]] for drink recipes not normally considered part of mixology.

==Alcoholic Beverage Ingredients==

Alcoholic beverages can be served '''straight''' (also called '''neat'''), meaning there is only one ingredient (a particular type of alcohol), or '''mixed'''. Most mixed drinks include other ingredients, or '''mixers''', besides the alcohol or blend of alcohols. Common mixers include carbonated beverages, sweeteners, bitters, flavorings, colorings, sauces, and salt. Ice is an important ingredient in many mixed drinks, whether the drink is poured over the ice or the ice is blended as part of the beverage. Mixed drinks also include non-alcoholic, or &quot;virgin&quot;, cocktails, which are generally made in the same manner, but leaving out the alcohol.

===Buying Basics===
In nearly every bartender's stock, you will find these basic ingredients, which are key to making a wide variety of drinks.

* '''Bourbon''' - Kentucky whiskey
* '''Gin''' - distilled spirit flavored with juniper berries and other botanicals
* '''Rum, Dark''' - flavorful distilled spirit from sugar cane
* '''Rum, White''' - lightly flavored distilled spirit from sugar cane
* '''Scotch''' - Scottish whisky, more smoky than other whisky.
* '''Tequila''' - flavorful distilled Mexican spirit from the agave plant
* '''Triple Sec''' or '''Cointreau''' - orange flavored liqueurs
* '''Vermouth, Dry''' - a common aromatized mixer wine
* '''Vermouth, Sweet''' - a common aromatized mixer wine
* '''Vodka''' - clear, nearly flavorless distilled spirit
* '''Wine, White''' - more delicately flavored than red wine

===Beyond the Basics===
After stocking a bar with the basics, it is time to grow in new directions. These common ingredients help to expand the variety and diversity of the drinks you can provide to your patrons.

* '''Beer, Lager'''
* '''Flavored Spirits/Liquors''' - the more flavors, the wider range of cocktails you can serve
* '''High-Proof Spirits''' - any spirit or liquor with a high alcohol content (e.g., Bacardi 151 or Everclear)
* '''Kahlua''' - coffee flavored liqueurs
* '''Local Variants''' and '''Locally Distilled Alcohols''' - regional differences highlight different alcohols (e.g., sake, pisco, ouzo)
* '''Pre-mixed Mixers''' - the ingredients for several popular mixed drinks (martinis, margaritas, mudslides, etc.) are available pre-mixed; all you do is add the alcohol 
* '''Schnapps''' - peach and peppermint are common flavors
* '''Whiskey, Rye''' - Tennessee whiskey
* '''Wine, Red''' - more robustly flavored than white wine

==Distilled Alcohols==
Mixed drinks where the primary ingredients by volume are one or more distilled alcohols are referred to as '''cocktails'''.

===Spirits===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits}}
The term '''spirits''' includes brandy, rum, vodka and whiskey. These are made by distilling weaker drinks to concentrate the alcohol content to 35 per cent or more.
* Arak (Middle East)
*Arrack (South Asia and South-East Asia)
* Vodka (Northern Europe)
* Tequila - made from distillation of Mexican agave plant (not cactus)
* Calvados - French spirit made by distilling hard cider
* Shochu - Japanese spirit made from koji and starch / sugar based ingredients with ~30 to ~90 percent alcohol by volume.
*  Cachaça (pronounced [kuh.chah.'suh])  - Brazilian spirit made from sugar cane

===Liqueurs===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Liqueur}}

==Fermented Alcohols==
Fermented alcohols are most often served &quot;straight&quot;, without mixing. However, many enjoyable mixed drinks can be made by combining a fermented alcohol with other ingredients. Such drinks are usually referred to as '''mixes''' (''beer mix'', ''wine mix'', etc.) or '''punches''', rather than &quot;cocktails&quot;.

===Beer===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Beer}}
Beer is any variety of alcoholic drink produced by the brewing process: fermentation of starchy material derived from grains or other plant sources, such as malted barley or wheat. Beer typically has an alcoholic strength of from 3 to 8 per cent. The main categories of Beer are Ale and Lager.

===Cider and Perry===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Cider}}
Cider (known as 'hard cider' in the US) is made by fermenting apple juice; the less common perry is made by fermenting pear juice. Both can be made in a variety of styles, but the alcoholic strength is usually similar to that of beer.

===Mead===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Mead}}

===Wine===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Wine}}
Wine usually has an alcohol content of between 10 and 15 percent, and is made by fermentation of grape juice. Fortified wine, such as Port,  Sherry and Madeira, is made by adding brandy to wine before the completion of the wine's fermentation process, increasing the strength to around 20 percent.

##Set up the XML Document with a Division of either the American League or the National League. Enter a representative data into the document to justify your answer.
##Organize the XML stylesheet to nicely display the data.
#Move all Java parsing to a separate chapter
#Write BlueJ as per database access for XML parsing
#Move exercise 4 from chapter 3 (one-to-many relationship) and place it in chapter 5 (many-to-many relationship). My reason for this is as follows:
#This problem asks you to create a personal library. As we learned earlier a library can have many books and books have many copies. There can be many different people who check out books, however, what they actually check out are copies of books making this a many-to-many relationship since a borrower can check out many copies of a book. I feel like this exercise is a little misleading and would be better off in ch. 5. Most people who have had any experience in data modeling and are trying to learn XML from this book would be confused by this exercise (i.e. myself). It's hard to do something that you haven't learned how to do yet.
#Comments in the code and not elsewhere
#Instead of giving a complete explanation for an example of an xml/xls/xsd after the problem, explain each piece of the code as you go through it. Or after a given solution, repeat the entire line of code that you are trying to explain. I've found this layout in other technology related books, and it has been easier to follow along. Also, when referring to a table or different section of the book, create a bookmark or link to that section. Could this be in the instructions for authors and what else could we add.

      <comment>Simple 'restaurant style' miso soup</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Cuisine of Japan]]

In traditional Japanese cuisine, miso soup is served for breakfast every day, and often served with meals as well.
[[File:Bowl of miso soup.JPG|thumb|miso soup]]

=Variant One=
==Ingredients==
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] of [[Cookbook:Sesame_Oil|sesame oil]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of water 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbl.]] of [[Cookbook:Miso|miso]]
* 2 green [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], finely minced (optional)
* 1/2 cake [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], cut into 1/2 inch cubes (optional)
* 2-3 fresh [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], thinly sliced (optional)
* 5-6 shrimps, cubed or shredded (optional)
* Some pieces of seaweed (optional)

==Procedure==
# Heat oil in the bottom of a small pot
# Add green onion (if using)
# Cook for a few minutes while stirring frequently
# Add 2 1/2 cups of water
# Bring to a boil
# Dissolve miso in 1/2 cup of water and add to pot
# Lower heat and add mushrooms, seaweed &amp; tofu if desired
Enjoy!

=Variant Two=

==Ingredients==

* 90% to 94% [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]] (consider using instant dashi mix)
* 6% to 10% [[Cookbook:Miso|miso]]. It can be ''aka''(red) or ''shiro''(white), or a combination.
* odds and ends for garnish

The garnish would typically be two to three items that contrast in color, flavor, buoyancy, shape, texture, etc. [[Cookbook:Wakame|Wakame]] with [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] is a standard and popular combination, especially at restaurants. Some common items for garnish are:

* finely sliced and [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|deep-fat fried]] [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] (Agedashi tofu)
* finely cubed raw (silky) [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] ('''recommended''')
* [[Cookbook:Wakame|wakame]] [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]] ('''recommended''')
* [[Cookbook:Konbu|konbu]] (kelp) seaweed, perhaps left over from making dashi
* [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* chopped [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallion]] ('''recommended''')
* grated [[Cookbook:Daikon|daikon]] radish
* boiled and finely cubed [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]
* [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]] (asari or shijimi)
* grated [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]]
* [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]]
* [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]

==Procedure==
#Put dashi in a pot.
#Add any garnish that needs cooking.
#Heat the dashi, letting it simmer, cooking any garnish that needs cooking. Do not bring to a rolling boil, as this degrades the flavor.
#Add any garnish that does not need cooking, and remove from heat.
#Add the miso to the soup. Avoid boiling the miso; some nuances of the flavor will be lost.


=Modern Variant=

While certainly a traditional food, miso is also suited to modern interpretations. One non-traditional yet delicious way to make miso soup is as follows:

#Heat frying oil in a small pot
#Fry onions and cabbage in the oil over high heat until browned. A slight degree of burning is acceptable.
#Proceed with the traditional method listed above.

Using oil leftover from frying bacon and caramelizing the sugars in the onion and cabbage through high heat, this method produces a soup notably different from the traditional variety, and can add new interest to a classic dish. A small quantity of freshly ground black pepper added just before serving rounds out this method very well. 

=Simple Restaurant Miso=

This miso soup is a close approximation of what you get in most cheap western Japanese restaurants. All ingredients are to taste; the primary thing is the ratio of miso to dashi. 

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Dashi|Dashi]] (roughly 250ml or 1 cup per person for a typical restaurant portion)
*Wakame, 5 or so pieces per person (Wakame is a form of edible seaweed, sold in dry curls at most Asian markets)
*Traditional tofu (medium firmness), a few one centimeter cubes per person
*Miso paste, either white, red, or a mixture (many restaurants in western Canada use white miso, also called shiro miso) 

==Procedure==
#Heat the dashi to a light simmer
#While this is heating, lay out your bowls and place the wakame and tofu in the bottom
#When the dashi simmers, take a ladle or so of liquid aside and mix into it approximately 1 tablespoon (about 15ml) of miso paste per cup of dashi stock
#Remove the pot of dashi from the stove and stir the miso prepared above into it
#Ladle some of the prepared miso into the bowls and serve

==Notes== 
*Some prefer less miso, some prefer more. The quantity given results in the moderately-salty type popular in restaurants before meals.
*Do not permit the miso to boil; doing so alters the flavour

=Introduction=

The [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ SPM] software is a suite of [http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/ MATLAB] functions to organise and interpret functional neuroimaging data.

[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ SPM] is made freely available to the (neuro)imaging community, to promote collaboration and a common analysis scheme across laboratories. The software represents the implementation of the theoretical concepts of Statistical Parametric Mapping in a complete analysis package.

=Licence=

SPM (being the collection of files given in the manifest in the Contents.m file included with each distribution) is free but copyright software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence as published by the Free Software Foundation (either version 2, as given in file spm_LICENCE.man, or at your option, any later version). Further details on &quot;copyleft&quot; can be found at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. In particular, SPM is supplied as is. No formal support or maintenance is provided or implied.

=SPM Version=

==SPM8==
SPM8 was released in April 2009 and represents a major update to the SPM software, containing substantial theoretical, algorithmic, structural and interface enhancements over previous versions:
*http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/

==Previous versions==
Previous versions are still available for download, however you should prefer the most recent one:
*SPM5: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5/
*SPM2: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm2/
*SPM99: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm99/
*SPM96: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm96/

=Prerequisites=

You need the following to run [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/ SPM] on your computer:
* [[SPM/MATLAB|MATLAB]]: MATLAB is a high level numerical mathematics environment developed  by [http://www.mathworks.com/ MathWorks], Inc. Natick, MA, USA. SPM requires only core MATLAB to run ('''no special toolboxes are required'''). See [[SPM/MATLAB|this page]] for more details.
* SPM also uses external C programs, linked to MATLAB as C-mex files, to perform some of the more computationally intensive operations. Pre-compiled binaries are provided with the distribution for Linux (''*.mexglx'', ''*.mexa64''), Windows (''*.mexw32'', ''*.mexw64'') and Mac (''*.mexmac'', ''*.mexmaci'', ''*.mexmaci64''). Hence, most of the time, SPM will work immediately using these binaries; in some instances, you might have to recompile them for your own architecture, details are provided [[SPM#Installation|here]] for each platform.
* SPM8 uses the [http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/ NIFTI-1] file format for the image data. All images are written as [http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/ NIFTI-1], but it will also read the old Analyze format used by SPM2. Tools are provided to import data from [http://medical.nema.org/dicom/2004.html DICOM], [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/software/minc/minc.html MINC] and ECAT7. SPM8 also uses the [http://www.nitrc.org/projects/gifti/ GIfTI] file format for surface-based data.

=Download=
SPM is freely available, but you will be asked to complete a [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html registration form] prior to downloading. Having completed the form, you will be directed to the download location.

=Installation=
* On Unix/Linux, use ''unzip SPM.zip'' or ''tar xvfz SPM.tar.gz''
* On Windows, use [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip] (free and powerful file archiver) or any other archive software that you might already have installed.
* On Mac, double-click to unpack the archive

Then launch MATLAB and add SPM to MATLAB's path:
 &gt;&gt; addpath C:/software/matlab/spm
SPM is now ready to use:
 &gt;&gt; spm

==Managing your MATLAB path==

To ensure SPM is automatically on your MATLAB path in the future, you can either use the command
 &gt;&gt; pathtool
and save the path, or (better, if you have multiple MATLAB versions) you can edit your [http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/techdoc/ref/startup.html MATLAB startup file] to include the above ''addpath'' command. 

(Expert tip: since the startup file can be a general MATLAB script/function you could consider more elaborate things like bringing up a GUI window with a choice of SPM versions to add to the path.)

=Updates=
SPM updates are made from time to time and advertised on the SPM [[SPM/Learning SPM|mailing list]]. They can be downloaded from the following addresses:
* http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm8_updates/
* http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm5_updates/
* http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm2_updates/
On Unix systems (Linux, Mac), use this command line syntax to install the updates
 unzip -o spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm8
On other platforms, just unpack the update archive over your SPM installation so that newer files overwrite existing files.

=Toolboxes=
A list of SPM toolboxes and extensions is available on the SPM website: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ext/.

To install one of them, follow the instructions probably provided with the package.
It usually consists in simply copying the functions into a subdirectory of the ''toolbox'' directory of your SPM installation.

__NOTOC__

SPM requirements in terms or hardware are closely related to those of MATLAB, see:
* [http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/ MATLAB System Requirements]
* [http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/choosing_hardware.html Choosing Hardware for Use with MATLAB]
* [http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-18C2A/?solution=1-18C2A Computer hardware which best optimizes the performance of MATLAB]

= Processor =

No particular requirements, apart from those for MATLAB. The faster the better but little memory or a slow hard disk can become a bottleneck so make sure to have a coherent hardware installation.

== Mono-/multi-processors ==

Recent MATLABs support implicit multiprocessing allowing to run multiple threads on a single machine without any change to the MATLAB code itself: this requires a multiple CPU (multiprocessor or multicore) system. The gain in compute time with SPM is not dramatic though.

See:
* http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/brdo29n-1.html
* http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/maxnumcompthreads.html

If you run many MATLAB sessions in parallel to manually distribute your SPM processings, it is recommended to set the number of computational threads to one.

Some effort is currently done to provide a parallel version of SPM that could automatically distribute tasks on a multicore/multiprocessor machine or a cluster.

== 32/64 bit ==

Major Operating Systems, MATLAB and SPM support 64bit architectures and are nowadays recommended.

= Memory =

The more RAM you have the better but SPM should accommodate with any amount of memory you have (provided there is enough for MATLAB itself). Remember that a 32 bit Operating System might not be able to make use of the full amount of memory.

For more information, see:
* http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1100/1106.html
* http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1100/1107.html


= Hard Disk =

Neuroimaging datasets can be quite large so a slow [[w:Hard_disk_drive|hard disk]] can be a bottleneck for SPM processing (i.e. if you've got the choice, choose the hard disk with the highest RPM). Concerning the capacity, it's also obviously the more the better.

== Reviews of hard disks ==

http://www.storagereview.com

== Network File System ==

It is certainly possible to store your datasets on an NFS server. If the server is located in another building or section of your building, make sure the entire connection to your SPM processing workstation is at least 100MB/s.


= Graphic Card =

At current time little use is made of the GPU in SPM so the graphic card should not have any impact in SPM processing.

== SPM Optimisation ==

=== Adjusting SPM settings ===

A defaults variable called ''maxmem'' indicates how much memory can be used at the same time during GLM estimation. If your computer has a large amount of RAM, you can increase that memory setting in spm_defaults.m:

 defaults.stats.maxmem   = 2^30;

* 2^32 = 4GB
* 2^31 = 2GB
* 2^30 = 1GB
* 2^29 = 512MB

In SPM12, there is another defaults variable called ''resmem'' governing whether temporary files during GLM estimation are stored on disk (''false'') or kept in memory (''true''). If you have enough available RAM, not writing the files to disk with fasten the estimation. 

 defaults.stats.resmem   = true;

=== Compiling the MEX files ===

The compiled MEX files provided with SPM are built in such a way to be compatible with most platforms and MATLAB versions but you might benefit from compiling them for your exact platform/MATLAB version - some C compilers might also produce better optimised binaries (such as [http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers/ Intel Compilers]). See the installation pages for more details on how to recompile SPM MEX files.

== MATLAB Optimisation ==

=== General statements ===

[http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk_r13/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/ch7_perf.html Maximizing MATLAB Performance].

Note that it is not recommended to disable the JAVA Virtual Machine when launching MATLAB (matlab -nojvm). If you don't want to use the MATLAB desktop, you can preferably launch MATLAB with:
 matlab -nodesktop

=== Multithreading ===

Recent MATLABs support implicit multiprocessing allowing to run multiple threads on a single machine without any change to the MATLAB code itself: this requires a multiple CPU (multiprocessor or multicore) system. The gain in compute time with SPM is not dramatic though.

See:
* http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/brdo29n-1.html
* http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/maxnumcompthreads.html

If you run many MATLAB sessions in parallel to manually distribute your SPM processings, it is recommended to set the number of computational threads to one.

=== Updating BLAS/LAPACK ===

Install the latest Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS)/Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) for your system, as MATLAB doesn't ship the latest version in its releases. 
* [http://www.netlib.org/blas/ BLAS]
* [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/ LAPACK]
The main choices are between:
* [http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/ ATLAS] - Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software (open source)
* [http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/ MKL] - Intel Math Kernel Library
* [http://developer.amd.com/cpu/libraries/acml/Pages/default.aspx ACML] - AMD Core Math Library
* [http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/#blas GotoBLAS] - GotoBLAS (Texas Advanced Computing Center)
For more information on how to upgrade your MATLAB libraries with ATLAS/MKL, see:
* http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-mkl-with-matlab/
* http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-math-kernel-library-intel-mkl-for-windows-using-intel-mkl-in-matlab-executable-mex-files/
* http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/SpmWithPentium4

== Parallel Computing ==

=== SPM toolboxes ===

See [http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/parallelspm/ pSPM] for SPM2.

=== General tools ===

There is currently work in progress to provide an official parallel/distributed version of SPM.

== Using the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) ==

It is possible for MATLAB to take advantage of the GPU (the processor of the graphic card, by opposition to the CPU), to perform some operations, resulting in significant speed improvements. A number of toolboxes are available:

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've renamed this page Alcoholic drinks, just to make it a bit wider in scope. My, we need some content here! [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 21:37, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I think the &quot;Warnings&quot; section is mostly extraneous. A couple of short paragraphs should suffice. I wonder about the selection/veracity of a couple of those items also: particularly, the &quot;abnormally deep sleep, allowing an adult to roll onto a baby&quot; and the one about obese people combusting. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 17:33, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:Alcohol frequently kills and maims people. I'm sure that most bar patrons are oblivious to this fact; they wouldn't go to bars if they were fully aware now, would they? Most people will ignore the warnings here, as they do elsewhere, but perhaps a few lives might be saved. I kept things factual, avoiding words like &quot;idiot&quot; and &quot;moron&quot;. I have shown restraint, resisting the urge to make that warning into a template that goes on every page. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:03, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:As for the two specific items you mention: It is fact that it is safe for a baby to sleep next to an adult (not child; children have different sleep patterns), provided that the adult is not obese or under the influence of alcohol, sleeping pills, or other drugs. (the sleep surface must be appropriate, of course) Human combustion occurs via a candle-like wicking effect, nearly always to those that are obese and drunk. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:03, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:I don't see how you can argue with the point of view of dry facts. Were I to express an opinion on the wisdom of drinking alcohol, then you might have a legitimate argument over point of view. I can't help it that the harsh facts are unpleasant and may cause you to question your own point of view. The facts are what they are. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:03, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

::Regardless of the evils of alcohol, I don't think a cookbook is the proper place to discuss all these possible effects drinking can have on your life. As I said, a warnings section is a good idea, but it should be brief: anybody wanting elaboration can go to the Wikipedia entries on Alcoholism, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, etc. That's exactly why I dispute the NPOV...while the facts may be true (I'm still having trouble with the spontaneous combustion), it is obviously biased against alcohol.From [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]]: &quot;While all facts might be presented fairly, the very selection (and omission) of facts can make an module biased.&quot; [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 19:23, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:::Being neither Muslim not Protestant, I didn't remember to mention the ''evils'' of alcohol. :-) The section does indeed direct readers wanting elaboration to Wikipedia. I agree that omission of facts can be considered bias, and would not be opposed to mentioning that small amounts of alcohol can be useful for cardiovascular reasons. Harvard says &quot;For men, a good balance point is 1 to 2 drinks a day. For women, it's at most one drink a day.&quot; The USDA agrees, while also mentioning hypertension and cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and stating that women of childbearing age who could become pregnant should completely abstain. In fact, I'll add this now, hopefully addressing your objections. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:12, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

::::Thanks! I still think it's much too verbose, but that's more of a style issue. Do you have a source for the &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot;? I'm not sure how controversial that is, but it sounds really bizarre? [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 21:03, 6 May 2005 (UTC)

:::::Wikipedia [[w:Spontaneous_human_combustion|covers it pretty well]]. The BBC has a [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/158853.stm good article on it]. Somebody at the BBC burned a pig corpse in a model house to prove how &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot; happens. Victims tend to be female, obese, not young, smokers, drunk, and dehydrated. Alcohol obviously causes the drunkenness; it can also be a contributing factor to obesity and dehydration. To be clear, there is nothing spontaneous about &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot;. (the tabloids gave it that name, making for better headlines) It's very much like a candle burning, and is able to consume most of a human. The person smoulders for many hours, with barely any flame. Being drunk keeps the victim from reacting to the fire. Note that smokers are more at risk; presumably this is the typical ignition source. Strong alcoholic drinks can also burn; a spill would help to get things started. I certainly don't claim that &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot; is a common problem, but it is: real, interesting, and related to the use of alcohol. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:24, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

Sorry - but you really need to have watched the actual programme aired by the BBC back in 1998. Through the course of the programme spontaneous combustion as described in this article is rubbished, and explains how bodies 'appear' to have spontaneously combusted in very specific conditions. This kind of non-factual material does not belong in this article. I would also add that this is not a soapbox, and I'm afraid this is how the article reads.
--Robins, 23:25, 05 July 2005 (BST)

I agree that the warnings is a bit over the top, perhaps putting a link to a special site.I mean, I know that I keep wanting to add &quot;Yes, but are there any negative effects?&quot; --[[User:Frontier|Frontier]] 13:07, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

I definitely agree that spontaneoous combustion topic needs to be carefully researched before putting it out under a topic for Cookbook Talk - Alcohol Drink. Apart from the evils of drinking alcohol there is some good news for people suffering from Rhematic diseases are likely to protect themselves (by having alcohol) from the disease by reducing the inflammation within the body like the way red wine helps in protecting the heart. But of course the amount of alcohol consumed should be on moderate levels and not on a high level.

I don't agree with the warnings. If we keep them we also should start to add warnings everywhere. In the Wikipedia's articles about barbiturates, in recipes containing fat foods and advice on Ferrari's article ''not to drive at maximum speed''. -- '''[[w:User:Zimbricchio|Zimbricchio]]'''
:Okay, I toned down the warnings, and removed the NPOV tag. Hopefully, everybody will be happy with this. --- [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 04:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

[[Wikibooks:Legal disclaimer]], [[Wikibooks:Medical disclaimer]]. I think thats fairly explicit that any warnings given here should be discarded by the reader so why go into so much depth. At most there should be inter-wiki links to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_alcohol_on_the_body Effects of alcohol on the body] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage#Legal_considerations Legal considerations] and a brief sentence saying you may wish to consult your docter or lawyer [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 22:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

:I totally agree Discordance, most people are able to think and judge for themselves, on the same side of the coin, who has a doctor or lawyer sitting next to them, advising them as they surf the pages of Wikipedia?.[[User:TrumpyNZ|TrumpyNZ]] 07:40, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

==Spirits==
I reworded the section to say other drinks are not widely used in cooking but i cant think of many recipes that use whiskey or vodka. Anyway if anyone knows better please calrify the sentence, i was changing it in the first place because it seemed to suggest there were only 4 types of spirit which is far from true, and most glaringly it ommitted tequila and gin which are extremely important as cocktail bases i thought theyd probably been left out as this is a cookbook and not a cocktail recipe guide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tentative outline for '''Arithmetic, Physics, and Mathematics; or the Units of Measurement'''
==Units of Measurement as Mathematical Constants==
#Physics and Mathematics begin with counting
#*1 apple, 2 apples, etc.
#*Thus an &quot;apple&quot; in our records is a '''unit of measurement''', the quantity in question being &quot;number of apples&quot;
#This evolves into simple arithmetic
#*1 apple added to 1 apple is 2 apples
#*10 apples subtracted from 30 apples is 20 apples
#Introduction of shorthand notation
#*&lt;math&gt;1\; apple + 1\; apple = 2\; apples&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;30\; apples - 10\; apples = 20\; apples&lt;/math&gt;
#Mathematics can discard the physical objects in question and has the luxury of concerning itself with abstract concepts
#*&lt;math&gt;1 + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;(1 + 1) \times a = 2 \times a&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;1 \times a + 1 \times a = 2 \times a&lt;/math&gt;
#Whereas in mathematics the constant &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; represents a numerical constant, in physics this constant can represent a ''physical'' constant, thereby allowing physical objects to behave as mathematical entities in mathematical equations
#*&lt;math&gt;1 \times apple + 1 \times apple = 2 \times apple&lt;/math&gt;
#Units of measurements are '''important''' in mathematical equations since they represent critical information and errors in calculations will result if these physical constants are neglected
#*&lt;math&gt;1 + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;is wrong in the sense that&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;1 \times apple + 1 \times orange = 1 \times apple + 1 \times orange&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;is the only answer allowed under the rules of mathematics
#Also, care must be taken when we perform mathematical operations
#*&lt;math&gt;(3 \times apples) \times (3 \times apples) = 9 \times apples^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;represents 9 apples arranged in a square
#*&lt;math&gt;(3 \times apples) \times (3 \times oranges) = 9 \times apples \times oranges&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;creates a new physical quantity apple(orange) that is neither apples nor oranges!  This is how new physical quantities, i.e. energy are created from lengths, times, and masses.

==Basic Units of Measurement==
#Time
#*Usually measured in seconds
#**Shorthand is s
#***10 seconds
#***10 s
#*Only unit of measurement not to be decimalized (although such a system does exist)
#Distance
#*Usually measured in meters
#**Shorthand is m
#***10 meters
#***10 m
#Mass
#*Base unit is the kilogram
#**Shorthand is kg
#***10 kilograms
#***10 kg
#*Sometimes measured in grams
#**Shorthand is g
#***10 grams
#***10 g

==Derived Units of Measurement==
#Area
#*Usually measured in meters squared
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; meters\times meters&lt;/math&gt;
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; square \ meters&lt;/math&gt;
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;
#Volume
#*Usually measured in meters cubed
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; meters\times meters\times meters&lt;/math&gt;
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; cubic \ meters&lt;/math&gt;
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{m}^3&lt;/math&gt;
#Density
##Linear density
##*Usually measured in kilograms per meter
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; kilograms \ per \ meter&lt;/math&gt;
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{kg}/\mbox{m}&lt;/math&gt;
##Area density
##*Usually measured in kilograms per meter squared
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; kilograms \ per \ square \ meter&lt;/math&gt;
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{kg}/\mbox{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;
##Volumetric density
##*Usually measured in kilograms per meters cubed
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; kilograms \ per \ cubic \ meter&lt;/math&gt;
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{kg}/\mbox{m}^3&lt;/math&gt;

==Scientific Notation==
*Shorthand notation for large or tiny numbers based on powers of 10
#Large
#*&lt;math&gt;1,000,000 = 10^6 = 1 \times 10^6&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;2,500,000 = 2.5 \times 10^6&lt;/math&gt;
#Small
#*&lt;math&gt;0.001 = 10^{-3} = 1 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;0.000234 = 2.34 \times 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;
==Syst&amp;egrave;me International d'Unit&amp;eacute;s (International System of Units, aka SI)==
*Further simplification of written numbers
**&lt;math&gt;4,430 \mbox{ meters} = 4.43 \times 10^3 \mbox{ meters} = 4.43 \mbox{ kilometers}&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;4,430 \mbox{ m} = 4.43 \times 10^3 \mbox{ m} = 4.43 \mbox{ km}&lt;/math&gt;

==The Mathematics of Conversion Between Units==
#In mathematical equations, units of measurement behave as constants
#*&lt;math&gt;(1\mbox{ m} + 2\mbox{ m})\times 4\mbox{ m} = 12\mbox{ m}^2&lt;/math&gt;
#To convert from one unit of to another, we utilize an equation relating the two measurements
#*&lt;math&gt;1\mbox{ km} = 1000\mbox{ m} \,&lt;/math&gt;
#We can solve and substitute for the constant &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km} = \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\left[1\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right) + 2\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right)\right]\times 4\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right) = 12 \left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\left(1\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km} + 2\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km}\right)\times 4\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km} = 12\times 10^{-6}\mbox{ km}^2&lt;/math&gt;

The Mathematics of Conversion Between Units

   1. In mathematical equations, units of measurement behave as constants
          * (1\mbox{ m} + 2\mbox{ m})\times 4\mbox{ m} = 12\mbox{ m}^2
   2. To convert from one unit of to another, we utilize an equation relating the two measurements
          * 1\mbox{ km} = 1000\mbox{ m} \,
   3. We can solve and substitute for the constant m
          * \frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km} = \mbox{ m}
          * \left[1\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right) + 2\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right)\right]\times 4\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right) = 12 \left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right)^2
          * \left(1\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km} + 2\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km}\right)\times 4\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km} = 12\times 10^{-6}\mbox{ km}^2

==Quick searches and keywords==
[[Image:Adding_a_Keyword_Search_in_Firefox.png|right|thumb|300px|Select &quot;Add a Keyword for this Search&quot;.]]
[[Image:Defining_a_Quicksearch_Keyword_in_Firefox.png|right|thumb|300px|A Name and the Keyword ''w'' were just entered for this Quick Search.]]
Quick Searches allow you to define custom search keywords for entering in the Location Bar. After setup, just type your search keyword before your search terms. A wiki of popular quick searches is maintained [http://www.wormus.com/leakytap/Internet/CustomKeywords here]. The steps needed to make a new Quick Search are outlined below:

# Go to a web page that contains a search box.
# Right click in the search entry box.
# Select &quot;Add a Keyword for this Search&quot;.
# Give your quick search a keyword. For example, a Wikipedia search could be ''w''. Obviously, shorter keywords are more efficient than longer ones, such as ''wikipedia''.

An alternative method for older versions of Firefox or locations without search boxes is to:

# Go to a webpage that contains a search box.
# Search for something. In this case, ''oddball'' will be the search word.
# Note the term in the URL, and replace it with ''%s''. For example, searching on the Google search engine gives us the URL:
::&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q='''oddball'''&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&lt;/tt&gt;
:Using our example, the new address would be:
::&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q='''%s'''&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&lt;/tt&gt;
# Copy the modified URL from the location bar.
# Go to ''Bookmarks'' &amp;rarr; ''Manage Bookmarks'' &amp;rarr; ''New Bookmark''.
# Paste your modified URL in the ''Location'' box.
# Give your quick search a name, e.g. Google Quick Search.
# Give your quick search a keyword. '''Note:''' This can be one character or more. For example, a Google search could be ''g''.

To use your new quick search all you need to do is type &lt;tt&gt;''keyword'' ''your search term''&lt;/tt&gt; in the address bar; for example, to search for the information regarding the history of Wikipedia in Google, you would type, &lt;tt&gt;g history of wikipedia&lt;/tt&gt;. You can also bookmark advanced searches using the same technique. Just try a search and replace your search term with ''%s''. Simple!

This functionality doesn't have to be limited to web searches; it can be used to quickly go to pages that have a certain structure. For example, one way to get more out of [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]] would be to create a bookmark to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s&lt;/tt&gt; with keyword ''w''. Getting to Wikipedia articles now only requires typing in &lt;tt&gt;w ''article title''&lt;/tt&gt;.

Another example is currency conversions. To easily convert from US dollars to Euro, one could create a bookmark to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi?From=USD&amp;To=EUR&amp;Amount=%s&lt;/tt&gt; and give it the keyword ''$''. To convert a given amount (say $50), all one has to do now is enter &lt;tt&gt;$ 50&lt;/tt&gt; into the address bar (note the space, it's very important).

Once you start thinking about them, keywords can become quite useful.

You can also use the [http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=188 SmartSearch] extension to do all your quick searches from the context menu, by highlighting a word on a page, right-clicking it and search using any of your quick searches.

== Find Toolbar ==
[[Image:Firefox_FAYT.png|thumb|300px|right|Screenshot of performing &quot;Find as you type&quot;. &quot;ency&quot; was being typed and the first matched text was highlighted in green.]]
A new and innovative feature is the Find Toolbar. The Find Toolbar is used for searching for text within a page without being too obtrusive. When activated by pressing Ctrl+F, the Find Toolbar appears on the bottom of the Firefox browser ready to search the current web page. The Find Toolbar using incremental searching which means that it will look up your search term simultaneously as you type it. This is more robust than traditional find as finding is done immediately when typing starts. The Find Toolbar has the ability to find the next or previous result and select it, highlight all the matched results and match case. Firefox will search down until reaching the end of the document and &quot;wraparound&quot; to the beginning of the page. If there are no results matching your terms, Firefox will 'beep' to inform you of this. (If you want to disable this 'beep' go to &lt;tt&gt;about:config&lt;/tt&gt; and change the value &lt;tt&gt;accessibility.typeaheadfind.enablesound&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;.)
When you are done searching, simply press the Esc key and the Find Toolbar will hide.

=== Find As You Type ===
A very useful feature is Find As You Type, which lets you use the functionality of the Find Toolbar without having to open or close it with Ctrl+F or Cmd+F.

By default, Find As You Type will only begin after pressing the ''/'' key. Alternatively, to only search links, press the '' ' '' key (apostrophe). However, it is possible to have Find As You Type work without needing an additional key press. To do so, go to ''Tools'' &amp;rarr; ''Options'' &amp;rarr; ''Advanced'' &amp;rarr; ''General'' and check &quot;Begin finding when you begin typing&quot;.

From now on, when searching about some topic on a website, just start typing into the body of the page. You will instantly go to the first instance of the sequence of letters as you type. The Find Toolbar will temporarily appear at the bottom of the page, allowing you to highlight all the places the term occurs, or jump to the next one. More Find Toolbar shortcuts can be found in the [[../Keyboard shortcuts/]] section, and a complete description [http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/ here].

A useful tip to navigate around a web page is to use find as you type. You simply push the '' ' '' key (apostrophe) and begin typing the text of the link you wish to follow. Once Firefox highlights that link (whether you've only typed a few letters or the entire word), you hit the Enter key and Firefox will begin loading that page. For example, if on this same page, you quickly want to go to the Table of Contents. Notice that the link for the table of contents is ''&lt;&lt; To Contents''. Press the apostrophe key to activate the Find Toolbar for searching for links and then type &quot;to&quot;. Firefox will then highlight part of the link. Pressing enter will take you to the ''Using Firefox'' Table of Contents. One thing to note is that the apostrophe key does not necessarily have to be used for this tip to work; just using Find As You Type can accomplish the same thing, but since it searches all text, whether it's a link or not, it may not be as quick as beginning your search with the apostrophe key.

Extensions are small add-ons that add new functionality to Firefox. They can add anything from a toolbar button to a completely new feature. They allow the browser to be customized to fit the personal needs of each user if they need additional features, while keeping Firefox small to download.

There are over 1000 extensions available for Firefox. This may make it difficult for people to find what they want.  The links on this page are intended to help while also remaining current.  As such they will not generally point to specific extension but rather where to look for them.  To look at links by category [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/ this page] is a good start.  Additionally the headings below provide a link to mozilla.org pointing to the specific category - this means that the information will always be up to date.

A good place to start looking for extensions is [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/recommended/ here] for recommended extensions.

The most popular extensions are to be found [https://addons.mozilla.org/search.php?app=firefox&amp;appfilter=firefox&amp;type=E&amp;sort=downloads here].

There are many themes available at Mozilla Update which make Firefox more attractive. The most popular ones are [https://addons.mozilla.org/search.php?app=firefox&amp;appfilter=firefox&amp;type=T&amp;sort=downloads here].

In addition, Mozilla has recently launched [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fashionyourfirefox Fashion Your Firefox], a service for users who don't want to go through the entire library of addons to choose just a few good ones based on what they use Firefox for.

==What is a Plugin?==
Firefox requires ''plugins'' in order to read or display special content from the websites. Plugins are programs that are integrated into Firefox that allows websites to provide content to you. Such content includes flash videos, java games and streaming video from the Internet. Examples of plugins are [[#Macromedia Flash Player|Flash]], [[#RealPlayer|RealPlayer]], and [[#Java|Java]]. Plugins are a necessary component to truly access the Internet's interactive stuff.

A much more comprehensive list of plugins, with detailed installation instructions, is available at [http://pfs.mozilla.org/plugins/ Mozilla Update]. Another valuable resource is [http://plugindoc.mozdev.org Mozdev Plugins].

==Before You Install==

===Close Firefox before installing plugins===
Firefox should be closed before running any plugin installation programs, as existing files may be overwritten during the installation process.

===Using XPInstall to install plugins===
Some plugins are available as XPInstall packages (XPIs), the same format as that for extensions. Where XPIs are available, it is recommended you use them as they often install the plugin automatically without you having to restart Firefox. After the XPI has finished installing, you should restart your browser.

===Checking which plugins you have installed===
To check what plugins you have installed, simply type ''about:plugins'' in the Location bar. This page will show which plugins are installed, what file types they are associated with and if the plugin is enabled or disabled.

==Available Plugins==

===Adobe PDF Reader===
In order to read .pdf files, you need to install a pdf reader. Adobe Reader, one of the more popular software, can do this. Simply go to Adobe's official [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html site] and download Adobe Reader. With Firefox closed, install Adobe Reader and it will also install the plugin necessary for Firefox to view PDF files. No other steps are necessary. Firefox will now open all PDFs from within a Firefox tab.

If you install Adobe Reader after Firefox, Adobe Reader will automatically select the right plugin. If you already have the latest version of Adobe Reader installed then Firefox will automatically use the plugin. Some people have problems with the Adobe Reader plugin in Firefox. The explanation and solution is [http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.phtml?title=Adobe_Reader here].

===Java===
The Java Plugin is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE, for short). The JRE installer will install the Java Plugin for Netscape 7.2 and Mozilla automatically.

To get the it simply go to [http://java.com/ java.com] and click the &quot;Download Now!&quot; button to download and install the latest JRE.

===Macromedia Flash Player===
When you encounter a site that makes use of Flash graphics, a yellow bar will appear at the top of the page telling you that there is a missing plugin preventing you from viewing all the content on the current page. Click on ''Install Missing Plugins'' button and the Mozilla Plugin Finder Service will appear automatically. After accepting the User Agreement from Macromedia, the necessary components to view Flash will be installed.

Alternately, you may install Macromedia Flash Player (without having to go to a site) by installing the plugin manually. Simply go [http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/windows.html#Flash here] and click on the Macromedia Flash Player 8.0 link.
&lt;!-- Image here of Plugin Finder! --&gt;

===Macromedia Shockwave Player===
Simply go to the Macromedia Shockwave [http://sdc.shockwave.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi? site] and download the plugin. When you are installing it, Firefox will appear in the list of browsers that you can install the plugin for. (Remember, Firefox should be closed when installing).

===Quicktime Player (Windows &amp;amp; Mac)===
Simply go to Apple's (the developer of Quicktime) website and download [http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/ Quicktime]. Installing Quicktime will install the appropriate plugin in order for Firefox to view .mov files. 

===RealPlayer===
Simply go to Real's (the developer of RealPlayer) website and download the [http://www.real.com/freeplayer/?rppr=rnwk program]. The RealPlayer installer will automatically detect your browser's plugins folder and install the plugin.

==Uninstalling Plugins==
A list of your installed plugins can be obtained from about:plugins. As a general rule, to remove a plugin, you remove the file listed in about:plugins for it. Typically a .dll file.

On a XP machine this can typically be found at c:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\plugins

&lt;!--this is just a start there is more to come--&gt;
Type about:config into your address bar and you will be brought to the about:config settings. This is a powerful way to tweak your settings in ways that are not normally accessible through the Options menu. By simply double clicking one of the available options (after copying and pasting them into the filter bar to find them easily), changes can be made, including the following:

* browser.block.target_new_window &amp;mdash; if set to true, links that normally force a new window to open will open in the current window instead.

* browser.xul.error_pages.enabled &amp;mdash; if set to true, Firefox displays an error page similar to IE instead of a message box if loading a page fails.

* layout.frames.force_resizability &amp;mdash; if set to true, allows the user to resize frames on any web site that uses them.

The following changes can be made to speed up browsing. Normally the browser will make one request to a web page at a time. When you enable pipelining it will make several at once, which usually speeds up page loading. Make these changes to enable pipelining:

Set &quot;network.http.pipelining&quot; to &quot;true&quot;

Set &quot;network.http.proxy.pipelining&quot; to &quot;true&quot;

[Tip: If have your browser set to connect to an optional http proxy, you can leave &quot;network.http.pipelining&quot; setp to &quot;false&quot;, then add the domains of websites that don't work with pipelining (like images.google.com) to the proxy exclude list.]

Set &quot;network.http.pipelining.maxrequests&quot; to 8. This means it will make up to 8 requests at once rather than the default of 4. This is only an advantage if you have a reliable internet connection that isn't particularly slow.

Finally, right-click anywhere and select New-&gt; Integer. Name it &quot;nglayout.initialpaint.delay&quot; and set its value to &quot;0&quot;. This value is the amount of time the browser waits before it acts on information it receives, but it will increase the total time taken to render the page. This option is more suitable for a faster computer (&quot;250&quot; is the default). Try a value of &quot;100&quot; if &quot;0&quot; causes problems.

For broadband users:

Set &quot;network.http.max-connections-per-server&quot; to 14. Many guides recommend setting this figure to 100, but this can have undesirable effects upon webservers.

Set &quot;network.http.max-connections&quot; to 48


A much more complete list can be found [http://preferential.mozdev.org/preferences.html here], with descriptions and which values the preference will take (where applicable)

==Editing the userChrome.css File==

userChrome.css is a file that allows you to change the appearance of Firefox with CSS rules. The actual browser window (i.e., not the webpage, but everything else) is called the &quot;chrome&quot;. The file userChrome.css overrides default settings to allow for more customization.

userChrome.css is not created by default. It should be created in your profile folder, which can be found in the following places:

 '''Windows''':
  %appdata%\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\&lt;Profile name&gt;\
 '''Linux''':
  ~/.mozilla/firefox/&lt;Profile name&gt;/
 '''Mac OS X''':
  ~/Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/&lt;Profile name&gt;/
 or
  ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/&lt;Profile name&gt;/

In all cases, the profile is randomly named, with 8 characters followed by ''.default''. Inside that folder is another named &quot;chrome&quot;. Inside the chrome folder is where userChrome.css needs to be created.

==Editing the userContent.css File==


==Tips==

* Allowing extension downloads from mozilla.org instead of www.mozilla.org will match all subdomains of mozilla.org, just as blocking cookies from doubleclick.net instead of www.doubleclick.net will allow blocking of all doubleclick.net subdomains. Allowing &quot;www.mozilla.org&quot; would not allow &quot;addons.mozilla.org&quot;. However, as a security measure, when whitelisting sites for extensions, the most specific domain available should be used (i.e., addons.mozilla.org instead of mozilla.org) to prevent potentially malicious installs from other subdomains on a site.

* To get Firefox on a computer without an internet connection or where internet downloads are blocked you can download the file as normal form another computer (usually you can do this at a public library) then put the *.exe file on some removable media and transfer it to the first computer.

&quot;pivot table&quot; or a &quot;crosstab report&quot;

(Note: this page needs to be wikified)

SQL Characteristic Functions: Do it without &quot;if&quot;, &quot;case&quot;, or &quot;GROUP_CONCAT&quot;.
Yes, there is use for this...&quot;if&quot; statements sometimes cause problems when used in combination.
 
The simple secret, and it's also why they work in almost all databases, is the following functions:
 
* sign (x) returns -1,0, +1 for values x &lt; 0, x = 0, x &gt; 0 respectively
* abs( sign( x) )  returns 0 if x = 0  else, 1 if  x &gt; 0 or x &lt; 0
* 1-abs( sign( x) ) complement of the above, since this returns 1 only if x = 0
 
    Quick example:   sign(-1) = -1,  abs( sign(-1) ) = 1,  1-abs( sign(-1) ) = 0
 
Data for full example:
 
       CREATE TABLE exams (
         pkey int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
         name varchar(15),
         exam int,
         score int,
         PRIMARY KEY  (pkey)
       );
 
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Bob',1,75);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Bob',2,77);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Bob',3,78);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Bob',4,80);
 
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Sue',1,90);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Sue',2,97);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Sue',3,98);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Sue',4,99);
 
 mysql&gt; select * from exams;
 +------+------+------+-------+
 | pkey | name | exam | score |
 +------+------+------+-------+
 |    1 | Bob  |    1 |    75 |
 |    2 | Bob  |    2 |    77 |
 |    3 | Bob  |    3 |    78 |
 |    4 | Bob  |    4 |    80 |
 |    5 | Sue  |    1 |    90 |
 |    6 | Sue  |    2 |    97 |
 |    7 | Sue  |    3 |    98 |
 |    8 | Sue  |    4 |    99 |
 +------+------+------+-------+
 8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
 mysql&gt; select name,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-1)))) as exam1,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-2)))) as exam2,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-3)))) as exam3,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-4)))) as exam4
 from exams group by name;
 
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | name | exam1 | exam2 | exam3 | exam4 |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | Bob  |    75 |    77 |    78 |    80 |
 | Sue  |    90 |    97 |    98 |    99 |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
Note, the above pivot table was created with one select statement.
 
Let's decompose to make the trick clearer, for the second exam:
 mysql&gt; select name, score, exam, exam-2, sign(exam-2), abs(sign(exam-2)), 1-abs(sign(exam-2)),
        score*(1-abs(sign(exam-2))) as exam2 from exams;
 +------+-------+------+--------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------+-------+
 | name | score | exam | exam-2 | sign(exam-2) | abs(sign(exam-2)) | 1-abs(sign(exam-2)) | exam2 |
 +------+-------+------+--------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------+-------+
 | Bob  |    75 |    1 |     -1 |           -1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Bob  |    77 |    2 |      0 |            0 |                 0 |                   1 |    77 |
 | Bob  |    78 |    3 |      1 |            1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Bob  |    80 |    4 |      2 |            1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Sue  |    90 |    1 |     -1 |           -1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Sue  |    97 |    2 |      0 |            0 |                 0 |                   1 |    97 |
 | Sue  |    98 |    3 |      1 |            1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Sue  |    99 |    4 |      2 |            1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 +------+-------+------+--------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------+-------+
 8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
You may think IF's would be clean but WATCH OUT!
Look what the following gives (INCORRECT !!):
 
 mysql&gt; select name,
 if(exam=1,score,null) as exam1,
 if(exam=2,score,null) as exam2,
 if(exam=3,score,null) as exam3,
 if(exam=4,score,null) as exam4
 from exams group by name;
 
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | name | exam1 | exam2 | exam3 | exam4 |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | Bob  |    75 |  NULL |  NULL |  NULL |
 | Sue  |    90 |  NULL |  NULL |  NULL |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
Note: the following does work - is all the maths necessary after all?
 mysql&gt; SELECT name,
        SUM(IF(exam=1,score,NULL)) AS exam1,
        SUM(IF(exam=2,score,NULL)) AS exam2,
        SUM(IF(exam=3,score,NULL)) AS exam3,
        SUM(IF(exam=4,score,0)) AS exam4

 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
 
 mysql&gt; select name,
        sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-1)))) as exam1,
        sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-2)))) as exam2,
        sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-3)))) as exam3,
        sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-4)))) as exam4,
          sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 2)))) -   sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 1)))) as delta_1_2,
          sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 3)))) -   sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 2)))) as delta_2_3,
          sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 4)))) -   sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 3)))) as delta_3_4

 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
Above delta_1_2 shows the difference between the first and second exams, with the numbers
being positive because both Bob and Sue improved their score with each exam.  Calculating
the deltas here shows it's possible to compare two rows, not columns which is easily done
with the standard  SQL statements but  rows in the original table.
 
 mysql&gt;select name,

It's possible to combine Total Increasing Point TotalIncPoints with AVG.  In fact, it's possible to combine
all of the example cuts of the data into one SQL statement, which provides additional options for displaying

== Why not mention commercial software!?? ==
In the article, it says: &quot;''Given that WikiBooks is a publicly-available 'open' book, it would be inappropriate to include information about or links to any commercial SMIL tools.''&quot; - I don't see why this wikiBook should not mention commercial software! There are other books on wikibooks.org dedicated to commercial software such as the wikibook on [[Oracle]] or [[Microsoft_SQL_Server_2005]]

== Why Netbeans only ? ==

There are a lot of XML editors, but in this book Netbeans is a special case, letting the reader think that Netbeans would be better than any other XML Editor available. I guess this is wrong, any XML Editor, given that it provides comprehensive functionnality, would be equal to Netbeans in this regard.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You are already familiar with expressions such as &lt;math&gt;3x+5&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; and perhaps &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 2x - 2&lt;/math&gt;. The general word for an expression that can be written in this form is a '''polynomial'''. Excluding the constant term, every power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a polynomial is a positive integer. Expressions that have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to a non-integer or negative power are not polynomials.

==Basics of polynomials==

All polynomials can be written in the form:

&lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + a_4x^4\dots a_nx^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The numbers &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4\dots&lt;/math&gt; are known as the '''co-efficients''', and will often already be known. For example in &lt;math&gt;4x^2 + 3x + 9&lt;/math&gt; the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is 4. The co-efficients may be 1 or even 0, for example &lt;math&gt;x^3 + x&lt;/math&gt; is still a polynomial.

===Degrees of polynomials===

The number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the highest power in the polynomial is known as the degree, or sometimes the order, of the polynomial. For example, &lt;math&gt;x^4 + 4x^2 + 9&lt;/math&gt; is a degree 4 polynomial. Certain degrees have names, and are often written using certain letters for the coefficients when they are unknown:

* Degree 0 - Constant - &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;
* Degree 1 - Linear - &lt;math&gt;ax + b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;mx + c&lt;/math&gt;
* Degree 2 - Quadratic - &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
* Degree 3 - Cubic - &lt;math&gt;ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d&lt;/math&gt;
* Degree 4 - Quartic &lt;math&gt;ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx +e&lt;/math&gt;

===Notation===

Most of the polynomials on this page are written in terms of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, for example, &lt;math&gt;4x^2 + 2x - 9&lt;/math&gt;, although polynomials can be written with other letters. &lt;math&gt;3z^2 + z - 2&lt;/math&gt;, for example, is called a '''polynomial in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;'''.

It is conventional to write polynomials in descending powers for clarity, although a polynomial may have the powers in any order. By writing polynomials in descending powers it is possible to see what the degree of the polynomial is simply by looking at the first term. Performing operations with two or more polynomials are also much simpler when the powers are in order, since like powers are usually grouped during calculations.

Indeed, you may lose marks in your exam if you don't simplify things like &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 5x - 3x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2x&lt;/math&gt;.

==Operations with polynomials==

===Addition===

To add polynomials you simply add the co-efficients of each term. If that sounds confusing don't worry as you will probably already know how to do this, it is basically the same as collecting like terms. You add the co-efficients of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; together, the co-efficients of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; together, and so on. For example:

&lt;math&gt;\left(4x^2 + 2x + 9\right) + \left(6x^2 - 2\right) = 10x^2 + 2x + 7&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that &lt;math&gt;4+6=10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;9-2=7&lt;/math&gt;. Some find it helpful to write this out like numerical addition:
{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;4x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 9&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| +
| &lt;math&gt;6x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;- 2&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot; 
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px;&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;10x^2&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;+ 7&lt;/math&gt;
|}
When using this method it is essential that terms with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the same power are lined up, leaving spaces if necessary as in the example above.

===Subtraction===

For subtraction of polynomials, it is possible to use the same method as above, except subtracting instead of adding. It may get confusing when there are negative terms involved, so it is preferred to reverse the signs in the second row and then add the two polynomials together.

This:

{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;10x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 7&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| -
| &lt;math&gt;6x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;- 2&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot; 
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px;&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;4x^2&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;+ 9&lt;/math&gt;
|}


Would become this:

{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;10x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 7&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| +
| &lt;math&gt;-6x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;+ 2&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot; 
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px;&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;4x^2&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;+ 9&lt;/math&gt;
|}

This method is desirable in the exam because subtracting negative numbers may cause confusion, and mistakes may be overlooked in the pressure of the exam.

===Multiplication===

To multiply polynomials you simply multiply all the terms in one by all the terms in the other and then sum the results. This method is known as the FOIL Method. It stands for First Outer Inner Last. For example:

&lt;math&gt;\left(3x^2+2x\right) \times \left(2x^2 - 5\right)&lt;/math&gt; can be broken down into:&lt;p&gt;
Multiply the First terms together.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x^2 \times 2x^2 = 6x^4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then multiply the Outer terms together.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x^2 \times -5 = -15x^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then multiply the Inner terms together.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2x \times 2x^2 = 4x^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then multiply the Last terms together.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2x \times -5 = -10x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Then we add the results together to give us &lt;math&gt;6x^4  + 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 10x&lt;/math&gt;, written in descending powers.

As you become confident with the process, you'll be able to do the entire multiplication in one go without splitting it up, like this:

&lt;math&gt;\left(3x^2+2x\right) \times \left(2x^2 - 5\right) = 6x^4  + 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 10x&lt;/math&gt;

====Multiplication table====

Some people find it helpful to show this in a table, with one polynomial as rows and the other as columns:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| '''&lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;'''
| '''&lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;'''
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| '''&lt;math&gt;2x^2&lt;/math&gt;'''
| 
| 
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| '''&lt;math&gt;-5&lt;/math&gt;'''
| 
| 
|}
The headings are then multiplied to produce:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| '''&lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;'''
| '''&lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| '''&lt;math&gt;2x^2&lt;/math&gt;'''
| &lt;math&gt;6x^4&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;4x^3&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| '''&lt;math&gt;-5&lt;/math&gt;'''
| &lt;math&gt;-15x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;-10x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The answer is the sum of all the cells:

&lt;math&gt;6x^4  + 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 10x&lt;/math&gt;, as before. This method is particularly useful for multiplying longer polynomials where the answer might not fit on a single line and cause mistakes.

====Long multiplication====

The polynomials to be multiplied can also be laid out like regular long multiplication, like this:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
|
| 
|
| &lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;
|
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
|
| &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;2x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;-5&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| This is the 1st row multiplied by &lt;math&gt;-5&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;| &lt;math&gt;-15x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;| &lt;math&gt;-10x&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
|-valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| This is the 1st row multiplied by &lt;math&gt;2x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;| &lt;math&gt;6x^4&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;| &lt;math&gt;4x^3&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; ←solid #000000;&quot;|
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
|-valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| This is the sum of the two answers
!| &lt;math&gt;6x^4&lt;/math&gt;
!| &lt;math&gt;4x^3&lt;/math&gt;
!| &lt;math&gt;-15x^2&lt;/math&gt;
!| &lt;math&gt;-10x&lt;/math&gt;
|
|}

===Division===

Division of polynomials can be done just like regular long division. However, you will need to be quite adept at addition, subtraction and multiplication of polynomials to divide.

For example, to divide &lt;math&gt;x^3 - 12x^2 - 42&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x-3&lt;/math&gt; you write it like this:


:&lt;math&gt;x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
1. Divide the first term of the dividend by the highest term of the divisor. Place the result above the bar (''x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;divide; x = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'').	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
x^2\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
2. Multiply the divisor by the result you just obtained (the first term of the eventual quotient). Write the result under the first two terms of the dividend (''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; * (x-3) = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; - 3x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'').	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
x^2\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}\\	 
\qquad\;\; x^3 - 3x^2	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
3. Subtract the product you just obtained from the appropriate terms of the original dividend, and write the result underneath. This can be tricky at times, because of the sign. ((''x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-12x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) - (x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-3x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = -12x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -9x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'') Then, &quot;pull down&quot; the next term from the dividend.	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
x^2\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}\\	 
\qquad\;\; \underline{x^3 - \quad3x^2}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\; -9x^2 + 0x	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
4. Repeat the last three steps, except this time use the two terms that you have just written as the dividend.	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
\; x^2 - 9x\\	 
\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}\\	 
\;\; \underline{\;\;x^3 - \;\;3x^2}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad\; -9x^2 + 0x\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad\; \underline{-9x^2 + 27x}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad -27x - 42	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
5. Repeat step 4. This time, there is nothing to &quot;pull down&quot;.	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
\qquad\quad\;\, x^2 \; - 9x \quad - 27\\	 
\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}\\	 
\;\; \underline{\;\;x^3 - \;\;3x^2}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad\; -9x^2 + 0x\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad\; \underline{-9x^2 + 27x}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad -27x - 42\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \underline{-27x + 81}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\;\; -123	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
The polynomial above the bar is your answer, and the number left over ''(-123)'' is the remainder.	 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^3 - 12x^2 - 42}{x-3} = x^2 - 9x - 27&lt;/math&gt; remainder &lt;math&gt;-123&lt;/math&gt;

==Curves of polynomials==

It is possible to look at a polynomial and get an idea to the general shape of its curve. The most important factors are the degree of the polynomial, and the sign of the co-efficient of the highest power. For a more accurate sketch of the graph, you will need to know where the curve has '''turning points''' and where it intersects the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis. A sketch with this information will often be sufficiently detailed, and is usually much quicker and easier than plotting the curve point by point.

===Turning points===

A turning point is where a curve that is decreasing changes to increasing, or vice versa. On a graph, the curve simply changes direction, hence the name turning point. In &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, the turning point is at (0,0), the trough of the &quot;bucket&quot;. The turning point in &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; is a '''minimum''' (plural '''minima'''), and a '''maximum''' (plural '''maxima''') is the same bucket shape, but upside down. For a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, its curve will have '''at most''' &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; turning points.

===Behaviour with extreme values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;===

What happens to a polynomial at large positive and negative values for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;?

If we say &lt;math&gt;1000&lt;/math&gt; is our large number, we can put it into &lt;math&gt;6x^4 + 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 10x&lt;/math&gt;, we can take a look at what happens:

First for &lt;math&gt;x=1000&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;6000000000000 + 4000000000 - 15000000 - 10000 = 6003970000000&lt;/math&gt;

Now for &lt;math&gt;x=-1000&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;6000000000000 - 4000000000 - 15000000 + 10000 = 5995985010000&lt;/math&gt;

The most change in the final answer is made by the &lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; term. This is the '''dominant term'''. For a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; is the dominant term as &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Once you have investigated the behaviour of polynomials with extreme values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, you may notice that if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even, it will share the same general shape as &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd it will share the same general shape as &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;.

If the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; is positive, curves with an even value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will have a bucket shape, and curves with an odd value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will generally be negative when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is negative, and positive when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is positive (like &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;).

If the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; is negative, curves with an even value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will have an upside down bucket shape, and curves with an odd value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will generally be positive when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is negative, and negative when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is positive (similar to &lt;math&gt;y = -x&lt;/math&gt;).

===Intersections with axes===

To find where the curve crosses the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis, you can simply look at the constant term. &lt;math&gt;y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 9x - 18&lt;/math&gt;, for example, would cross the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis at &lt;math&gt;-18&lt;/math&gt;. If there is no constant term, the curve will go through the origin, (0,0), and would therefore cross the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

In factorised form, you can find the points at which the curve crosses the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis. &lt;math&gt;y = (x+3)(x+2)(x-3)&lt;/math&gt; would cross the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis at &lt;math&gt;-3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;, because by making one of the brackets equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, it makes the whole polynomial equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt; is of course the line of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis. Each instance of the curve crossing the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis is a '''root''' of the equation. A polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will have '''at most''' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; roots.

To '''solve''' an equation means to find every root. Polynomials of degree 2 can be solved using the [[#The quadratic formula|quadratic formula]]. For higher degree polynomials you may need to factorise the equation like above, plot the graph point by point and look at where the curve crosses the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis, or use a [[../../C3/Numerical Methods|numerical method]]. You can check your answers by substituting them into the original equation and seeing if the result is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quadratic expressions==

[[Image:Quadratic01.png|right]]
A quadratic is a polynomial of degree 2, in the form &lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt;.

===Graph===
A quadratic graph is one that can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt;. The graph of &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; is shown on the right, and as you can see it has the same characteristic &quot;bucket&quot; shape that all quadratics have, called a '''parabola'''. The '''vertex''' is the maximum or minimum point. The line of symmetry is the line that divides the graph into two mirror halves. It can be found by the formula &lt;math&gt;\frac{-b}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, these properties can be more easily deduced from its '''completed square form''' ( &lt;math&gt;a(x + d)^2 + e&lt;/math&gt; ). In this form we know that, ''- d'' is the axis of symmetry, and that ''e'' is maximum or minimum point. If a is greater 0 then the vertex (-d,e) will be a minimum point. If a is less than 0 the vertex (-d,e) will be a maximum point.

===Completing the square===

Completing the square is the process of changing a quadratic from the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx +c&lt;/math&gt; to the equivalent form &lt;math&gt;a(x+d)^2 + e&lt;/math&gt;, where a, d and e are constants. For example, the quadratic &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x +2&lt;/math&gt; would become &lt;math&gt;2(x+2)^2 - 6&lt;/math&gt;.

Changing a quadratic to completed square form makes it easy to find several things, such as the roots of the quadratic and the vertex of the quadratic, without even requiring a sketch.

Here are the steps for completing the square. Don't worry, it's easier than it looks.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
! Step
! Action
! Example
! General case
|-
! 1.
| Ensure the quadratic is in the conventional form: &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;.
| &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 2.
| Unless &lt;math&gt;a=1&lt;/math&gt;, &quot;pull/factor out a&quot;, that is, divide the entire quadratic by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and put it outside a bracket.
''Note: If the quadratic is part of an equation you can divide each side by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, for example &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x + 2=0&lt;/math&gt; simply becomes &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x + 1=0&lt;/math&gt;.''
| &lt;math&gt;2\left(x^2 + 4x + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 3.
| Replace the &lt;math&gt;x^2 + kx&lt;/math&gt; part with &lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;.
It is important to realise that &lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)^2=x^2 + kx + \frac{k^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; which is close to what it was there before but not equal. This will be corrected in the next step. To prevent writing something that isn't actually equal it is a good idea to do both these steps at once in your working once you have got used to the method.
| &lt;math&gt;2\left((x+2)^2 + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 4.
| Correct the error introduced in the previous step by inserting the subtraction of a suitable number. This suitable number can be found in two ways:
# By expanding the term inserted in the previous step and comparing it to the original; ''or''
# By remembering that the error is always &lt;math&gt;\frac{k^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.
''This step is known as &quot;completing the square&quot; and gives the method its name.''
| 
# &lt;math&gt;(x+2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4&lt;/math&gt; which is 3 greater than &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x + 1&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; -3&lt;/math&gt; is inserted: &lt;math&gt;2\left((x+2)^2 - 3\right)&lt;/math&gt;; ''or''
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{4^2}{4} = 4&lt;/math&gt; so the error is 4: &lt;math&gt;2\left((x+2)^2 -4 +1\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 2\left((x+2)^2 -3\right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a^2} + \frac{c}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 5.
| If step 2 was necessary then simplify the result a bit by expanding the outer bracket. Then you are finished.
|&lt;math&gt;2(x+2)^2 -6&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 6.
| Check that what you have obtained expands back to what you started with.
''Note: You may feel confident enough to skip this step.''
|&lt;math&gt;2\left(x^2 + 4x + 4\right) -6&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=2x^2 + 8x + 8 - 6&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right)  -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=ax^2 + bx + \frac{b^2}{4a}  -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So the completed square form of &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2(x+2)^2 -6&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;-6&lt;/math&gt; tells us that the lowest point of the curve is at &lt;math&gt;y=-6&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;x+2&lt;/math&gt; tells us that the line of symmetry is at &lt;math&gt;x+2=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x = -2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the vertex is at &lt;math&gt;(-2,-6)&lt;/math&gt;, and if you look at the graph, you can see that is the case.

===The quadratic formula===
The quadratic formula is derived from the general case of completing the square:

&lt;math&gt;x =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be used to find the roots of a quadratic by putting numbers directly into it. For example, for &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;x =\frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64-16}}{4} = -2 \pm \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt; x = -2 + \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = -2 - \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;. The factors of the equation are &lt;math&gt; x + 2 - \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x + 2 + \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here is the way that the quadratic formula is derived from the completing the square formula.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
! Step
! Action
! Example
! General case
|-
! 1.
| To solve an equation in the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c=0&lt;/math&gt; first complete the square using the method above.
| &lt;math&gt;2(x + 2)^2 - 6=0&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 2.
| Isolate the &lt;math&gt;(x + k)^2&lt;/math&gt; term.
| &lt;math&gt;2(x + 2)^2=6&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x + 2)^2=3&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 =\frac{b^2}{4a} - c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 =\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 3.
| Square root each side, including a &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; as the bit inside the bracket might be negative or positive.
| &lt;math&gt;x + 2=\pm\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;
|  &lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

''Then some simplification:''

&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{4ac}{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{\sqrt{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 4.
| Isolate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
| &lt;math&gt;x = \pm\sqrt{3} - 2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{3}-2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\sqrt{3}-2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x \approx -0.268&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-3.73&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x =\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} - \frac{b}{2a} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
====The discriminant====

Notice that the quadratic equation contains &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&lt;/math&gt; inside a square root sign. This part is called '''the discriminant''' and can be considered on its own to determine the number of roots of the equation.

* If &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; then you will be unable to find the square roots as you don't know how to square root a negative number. The type of numbers you have encountered so far are known as real numbers and so it is said that the quadratic has '''no real roots'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac=0&lt;/math&gt; then changing the &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; sign in front of the square root won't make any difference, because it is zero either way. You will therefore get the same root twice, so it is said the quadratic has '''one repeated root'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then the &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; will mean you get two answers, and so you can say the quadratic has '''two distinct''' (i.e. different) '''roots'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''When in Rome, do as American tourists do everywhere''' – American proverb

Sometimes etiquette is easily explained to the non-native in a clear set of rules that any decent member of the culture follows. For example, in Japan it is considered impolite to show the soles of one’s shoes toward another person. However, sometimes the rules are not clear, and the polite person has to improvise to figure out the most polite thing to do. An example of this might be when the elder President Bush ducked below the table before vomiting at a state dinner. No book about culture or etiquette would have prepared him for that one, although now all American presidents place a strategically sited bowl beneath their chair at official events.

That said, the following is a simple explanation of the basic points of American Business Etiquette. This is a tool aimed at helping you do as Americans do when working with them on their own soil, over the telephone or even by email. 


== Work comes first ==
Americans and businessmen and women in particular are very task-oriented. They get a goal in mind and work until achieving it. An American is likely to avoid chit-chat as idle chatter and in a business meeting want to talk about business and little else. “Let’s get our focus on the bottom line” is an Americanism that reflects this tendency. Therefore be careful to not distract the conversation from the business at hand. Direct your comments towards identifying, and especially, solving problems. The people will feel more confidence in you when they feel that you are putting your heart behind the project at hand, whatever it may be. A big part of Americans’ lives revolve closely around their work, and although they may politely complain about it, the truth is that they like it like that. Americans do love to have fun, but it has its place, and that place should not interfere with work or a man (or woman) earning his (or her) livelihood.

== Be very clear in what you say ==
Something that will madden your American partners is if they think that you beat around the bush in what you say. US culture values a person who says what he means and means what he says. &quot;Get to the point!&quot;, angry teammates may demand. Americans value clarity many times over what other cultures view as tact. It is better to lay everything out on the table, and not leave key points unmentioned for politeness’ sake. Not following this policy could be interpreted as rudeness or as gravely as dishonesty by your peers.

== Honesty is the best policy ==
Related to the previous point, you will do well to avoid any kind of dishonesty in word or deed with your American partners. Do not suggest bribes, kickbacks, any other kind of illegal or unlawful payoffs, or anything else that goes against the law of the US or wherever it is that you are. Play by the rules. In the US, people get ahead while respecting the rules of the game. It has been said many times that, unlike other places, in the US it is easier to make money following the law than by breaking it, although this does not necessarily apply to US corporations operating abroad. Americans realize that if you are dishonest with the government or with anyone else, you are a dishonest person and will probably be dishonest with everyone or anyone that you work with, and are not to be trusted. That is, unless you are in a completely powerless situation where your every move can be controlled and all risk can be eliminated. But you don’t want to be in that situation, do you?

== Logic rules over emotion ==
One of the worst things that you can do is appear emotional, or unable to make a cold, hard decision. It’s OK to get angry, and show it, about certain things, especially things that affect the bottom line. Don’t change your mind a lot of times if you don’t want to exasperate your coworkers.

== Respect the old guys ==
First off, don’t call them old guys. At least not to their faces. The senior partners at the firm have worked a long time to get there and although American entertainment may make fun of older citizens as worn-out or useless, the business world certainly does not treat them that way. They are to be respected as the wisest and most seasoned individuals on the team, which they likely are. When dealing with them, speak to them and otherwise treat them with respect. Depending on the culture of the corporation, this may mean not to speak with them at all. Allow them to speak to you if they want something, otherwise it may be a good idea to not speak to them at all. A special note: if the executive is concerned about his advancing age and wants to be seen as younger than he really is, it may be better to speak to him more casually. In most cases, avoid using slang because it magnifies the difference between the generations and it may make the exec feel old or out of place, or worse yet, he may not even understand you.   


== New values: women are equal players ==
In US law, women are granted equal rights with men.  Business women expect to be treated with the same respect as their male counterparts. They are considered to be equal to men in character and ability. Their gender is considered to be irrelevant in business settings.  

It is absolutely inappropriate to make any sexual advances, make suggestive comments, or try to get them to go out for personal time not related to work. Do not treat them like secretaries unless, in fact, they are a secretary.  Treat them with the same consideration as you would treat any co-worker. 

Unfortunately, gender equality has not yet been fulfilled in the workplace.  On average, women earn about twenty percent less than men for the same work, and are many are still held down in pay and position by an unofficial upper limit called the glass ceiling.  Women have been gradually breaking through this glass ceiling, and are increasingly holding senior management and board positions within corporations.

== Businessmen and sports ==
A lot of business persons were athletes in high school and college. There are many things that are similar between team sports and business activities, and both attract many of the same people. It is a good idea to become familiar with the basics of baseball, football, and basketball at least in order to make semi-intelligent sports-related small talk. Beyond small talk, business talk is filled with sports-related idioms. These are used so comfortably in American speech that the speaker probably will not even realize that he is using them. 


== Taboos: don’t go there ==
The two main subjects that Americans agree not to discuss much in polite conversation are 1: politics and 2: religion. That is because they are areas where people have deep-rooted beliefs that are not easily changed, and there is a great potential for misunderstanding or hurt feelings, besides the fact that outside of church or a political rally, many people view them as unrelated to the whatever task you have on your plate at the time. 

Besides this, avoid criticizing the US, US culture, Americans in general or US policy, unless they have recently invaded your country. Americans for the most part deeply love their country and may be offended and confused by comments that do not reflect a similar love and respect, and may take the comments personally. However, there is also a great diversity in their view of themselves; therefore do not expect them all to respond in the same way.

== Topics to talk about ==
There are certain topics that are common to talk about in casual business situations. Feel free to talk about the rich, sports, entertainment like movies, music, celebrities and books, and current events or business trends. Try to keep things general and not too personal. Nobody wants to know about your grandmother or problems with your spouse. When in doubt, talk business.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lesson==
Schoolchildren, also called school kids, do homework. They do not like it. At least, they say that they do not like it. Homework is assignments that children do outside of class. However, sometimes students have time in class to do their homework. When a teacher gives an assignment to do during class it is called class work. Both homework and class work are types of schoolwork. 

Sometimes students answer questions in a textbook. 

: Teacher: Class, please turn your books to page seventy-one and do questions one through ten. If you don’t finish it is homework due tomorrow.
: Teacher: Open your books to chapter three and do every other question on page forty-five. Turn them in on my desk at the end of class. 

Other times, homework is doing research and writing a report about something.

: Teacher: Your assignment will be a report about the causes of the US Civil War. It should be ten pages long, typed and double-spaced. Please include a bibliography of at least ten cited works. You may use the Internet. Please look up information in at least three books from the school library. Do not make more than three references to encyclopedias. 

Students sometimes do homework together in groups. They call these groups study groups. This is part of the student’s sense of humor. This is because many American students prefer to socialize, or talk to their friends, than to do any work. Boys may tend to joke around while girls prefer to gossip about other girls. 

Students in all levels of school may have to do homework. However, younger students usually have to do less homework than older students. In high school, some students may have to do several hours of homework a night. 
Students may do their homework at home or in a library. Another place where kids can work on their homework is in study hall. Study hall is an open period of the day. Students can use study hall to read, do homework, maybe talk with their friends, or make trouble. 

Students sometimes complain that homework is boring. Other assignments are more interesting. Homework is hard if it makes you think a lot, and easy if it doesn’t make you think much. Americans call things that are easy “a piece of cake”. When a student finishes his or her homework he or she might like to relax for a while, go outside or watch some TV. 
	
Other homework assignments may be a reading, math problems, an art project, or filling in answers in a worksheet.

As SamSam said about his categorization and filtering suggestion, I have concerns about the cookbook's scalability. From my experience using public recipe sites, I have found that the more recipes they accumulate, the less useful they become. Even with a robust categorization system, the duplicate recipes make it very hard to research what you want to make. Although it may be some work, I suggest that we implement a rating and feedback system as I find this greatly increases a site's usefulness. This idea was inspired by VegWeb (http://vegweb.com), which is a public recipe site that is a pleasure to peruse as compared with other sites such as cooks.com that (http://www.cooks.com) seem sterile due to the lack of public feedback. An open feedback forum on the recipe page is vital for the testing of the recipes and for the opening of dialogue that is so much a part of the creative process of cooking. Variations of recipes can be posted here and a rating system can be implemented for the feedback entries to prioritize entries that people found most useful/informative and to highlight variations on recipes that are most popular. This system should be on the front end and easily accessible to the public, thus not in any way restricted to active builders of the book's content. This would be an excellent way of dealing with the philosophical issue raised by Snowspinner (above) about open-ended vs fixed recipes. I am an advocate for the open-ended approach, but a recipe can get too overwhelming with too much information at once. The original author of a recipe should still be allowed to put in as much extra information as they would like such as variations, cooking techniques, ingredient information, etc. However, a feedback system would be an indispensable way of building this extra information that everyone can learn from.

I've been navigating around Cookbook and I find it is not scalable.
Recipe lists will get (I expect) too long to display on a single page and navigating just by one category or alphabetically just wont do it. Mantaining these lists is just not a requisite and recipes could just be hanging there.

As a [http://sourceforge.net Sourceforge] and [http://freshmeat.net Freshmeat] user, I found their way of browsing much more easy.
A project has specific attributes and you can browse/filter by them. You don't have to add it to the different indexes, it is just there.

A recipe could have specific attributes like ingredients, time to cook, region, type of food, calories, etc.
With an automatic indexing system, it would be automatically linked on every category under the attribute specified.
This would avoid mantainance time of index pages and maximize search capabilities.

Searching would by as easy as browsing by region (for example, Asian --&gt; Chinese --&gt; Cantonese) and filtering by ingredient (for example, all that have the ingredient Rice and doesn't have Tuna) and by time to cook (for example, less than 30 minutes).

I don't know if wikimedia can do it, but it would be really cool.

: Its being worked on in the form of Metadata for not just the cookbook but for Mediawiki sites in general.  It was discussed at Wikimania 2005 but I'm not sure how far it has come.  For now, try to follow a standard way of identifing these attributes, as it will make the eventual conversion easier.

== About this Book ==

This wiki is in no way endorsed or a stem from the International Baccalaureate Organisation, it is, however, the result of particular lack of a solid textbook for the new 2014 course. These pages are, furthermore, derived from notes and knowledge of a student taking the course. This wiki will, hopefully, act as a course companion. You may find the [[/Definitions|Definitions]] page useful for revision.

=== Syllabus ===

The [http://www.eastiron.org/eistaff/Uploads/110/Computer_Science_-_1st_exams_2014.pdf syllabus] is an ideal document that should be referred to on a regular basis, whilst reading this wiki or not. It provides extensive details regarding what should be learnt rather than the content itself, as this wiki hopes to provide the end to that need. Therefore, each objective has been specified above the content that it is associated with. For example:

{{IB/Criterion|X.Y.Z|Assessment statement that the candidate must fulfil}}

The example aforementioned is self explanatory, however, the '''X.Y.Z''' refers to the topic, sub-topic and objective, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book discusses logic as a tool for computer science; a field that uses logic at all levels. It provides a survey of mathematical logic and its various applications. Some areas where it is particularly important include:                                                                                                                                                              
:    Digital circuit design
:    Complexity theory (NP equivalent to Existential second-order logic)
:    Database Systems (SQL; roughly predicate/first-order logic)
:    Computer-aided verification (Temporal logic &amp; model checking)
:    Programming languages (lambda calculus)
:    AI, expert systems, inference engines
:    Distributed Systems
:    Logic Programming
:    Computer Security
                                                                                                                                                           
After covering basic material of '''propositional logic''' and '''first-order logic''', the course presents the foundations of '''finite model theory''' and '''descriptive complexity'''. Other topics, including '''logic programming''', '''non-monotonic reasoning''', '''temporal logic''', and '''reasoning about knowledge and belief''', are surveyed as time allows. These notes were taken by student scribes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Propositional Logic==
Propositional logic is a good vehicle to introduce basic properties of logic. It does not provide means to determine the validity (truth or false) of atomic statements. Instead, it allows you to evaluate the validity of compound statements given the validity of its atomic components.

For example, consider the following:
:I like Pat or I like Joe.
:If I like Pat then I like Joe.
:Do I like Joe?
Accept as facts the first two statements, noting that the use of &quot;or&quot; here is not exclusive and thus could really be thought of as saying &quot;I like Pat, or I like Joe, or I like them both&quot;. Do these statements imply that &quot;I like Joe&quot; is true? Try to convince yourself that &quot;I like Joe&quot; is true, and consider another line of reasoning:
:Pigs can fly or fish can sing.
:If pigs can fly then fish can sing.
:Can fish sing?
We can see that the answer is ''yes'' in both cases. The above two sets of statements can be both abstracted as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;P \vee Q &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q &lt;/math&gt;?
Here, we are concerned about the logical reasoning itself, and not the statements. Thus, instead of working with pigs or Pats, we simply write &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;s or &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;s. We begin our study first with the syntax of propositional logic: that is, we describe the elements in our language of logic and how they are written. We then describe the semantics of these symbols: that is, what the symbols mean.

===Syntax===
The syntax of propositional logic is composed of propositional symbols, logical connectives, and parenthesis. Rules govern how these elements can be written together. First, we treat propositional symbols merely as a set of some symbols, for our purposes we'll use letters of the Roman and Greek alphabets, and refer to the set of all symbols as &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Prop}&lt;/math&gt;:
:'''Propositional symbols''': A set &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Prop}&lt;/math&gt; of some symbols. For example &lt;math&gt;p, q, r, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
Second, we have the logical connectives:
:'''Logical connectives''': &lt;math&gt;\wedge, \vee, \neg, \to&lt;/math&gt;
Note that these are not the minimal required set; they can be equivalently represented only using the single connective NOR (not-or) or NAND (not-and) as is used at the lowest level in computer hardware.
Finally, we use parenthesis to denote expressions (later on we make parenthesis optional):
:'''Parentheses''': &lt;math&gt;(, )&lt;/math&gt;
An '''expression''' is a string of propositional symbols, parenthesis, and logical connectives.

The expressions we consider are called '''formulas'''. The set &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt; of formulas is the smallest set of expressions such that:
#&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Prop}\subseteq\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;
#If &lt;math&gt;\phi, \psi \in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt; then
##&lt;math&gt;(\phi \wedge \psi)\in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;,
##&lt;math&gt;(\phi \vee \psi)\in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;,
##&lt;math&gt;(\phi \to \psi)\in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;, and
##&lt;math&gt;(\neg \phi)\in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another way to define formulas is as the language defined by the
following context-free grammar (with start symbol &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow \textrm{Prop}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Prop}&lt;/math&gt; stands for any propositional symbol
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow (\textrm{Form}\wedge \textrm{Form})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow (\textrm{Form}\vee \textrm{Form})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow (\textrm{Form}\to \textrm{Form})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow (\neg \textrm{Form})&lt;/math&gt;

'''Fact 1 (Unique Readability)''': The above context free grammar is unambiguous.

===Semantics===
The function of a formula is to create meanings of statements given meanings of atomic statements. The semantics of a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with propositional symbols &lt;math&gt;p_1,\ldots, p_n&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping associating to each truth assignment &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p_1,\ldots, p_n&lt;/math&gt; a truth value (0 or 1) for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. (The truth values ''true'' and ''false'' can be used instead of 1 or 0, respectively, as well as the abbreviations ''T'' and ''F''.)

The semantics are well defined due to Fact 1.

One way to specify semantics of a logical connective is via a truth table:
:{| border=&quot;1&quot;
!&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;p \wedge q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|0 || 0 || 0
|- 
|0 || 1 || 0
|-
|1 || 0 || 0
|-
|1 || 1 || 1
|}

Can one always find a formula that implements any given semantics? Yes, any truth table is realized by a formula. The formula can be found as follows. &quot;Represent&quot; the rows where &lt;math&gt;\phi=1&lt;/math&gt; with conjunctions of the true proposition symbols and negations of the false ones. Finally write the disjunction of the results.

For example,
:{| border=&quot;1&quot;
!&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; !! Conjunctions (true values only)
|-
|0 || 0 || 1 || &lt;math&gt;\neg p \wedge \neg q&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|0 || 1 || 0 ||
|- 
|1 || 0 || 1 || &lt;math&gt;p \wedge \neg q&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|1 || 1 || 0 ||
|}

&lt;math&gt;\phi: (p \wedge \neg q)\vee (\neg p \wedge \neg q)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Corollary''': Every formula is equivalent to a disjunction of conjunctions of propositional symbols or negation of propositional symbols (DNF).

Dual of DNF is CNF. To get &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in CNF:
#Describe cases when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is false. \ex &lt;math&gt;(p\wedge q)\vee(\neg p \wedge  q)&lt;/math&gt; - DNF &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;
#Note that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is true when &lt;math&gt;\neg \psi&lt;/math&gt; is false. Hence, negate &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; using DeMorgan's laws.
\ex &lt;math&gt;(\neg p \vee \neg q)\wedge (p \vee \neg q)&lt;/math&gt;. 

There are cases when DNF (resp. CNF) is exponentially larger than the original formula. For example, for &lt;math&gt;(x_1\vee y_1)\wedge (x_2\vee y_2)\wedge ...\wedge (x_n\vee y_n)&lt;/math&gt; the equivalent DNF is exponential in size.

Does each truth table have a polynomial size formula implementing it? More precisely, does there exist &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that every truth table with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; propositional symbols has a form &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;\leq n^k&lt;/math&gt;? Answer: no.

'''Proof''': Assume there exists such &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The number of truth tables for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; propositional symbols is &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;.
The number of formulas of size &lt;math&gt;\leq n^k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(n+6)^{n^k}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; propositional symbols, 4 connectives and parentheses.) 
Clearly, &lt;math&gt;(n+6)^{n^k} &lt; 2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, for sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

[TODO: exposition to explain what these definitions are and provide their context]

* '''Satisfaction''': Satisfaction of a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; by a truth assignment &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Notation: &lt;math&gt;\tau \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is true for &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;).
* '''Implication''': A set of formulas &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Notation: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every truth assignment that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

===Formula Classes of Special Interest===
*&lt;math&gt;\textrm{VALID}&lt;/math&gt; - the set of formulas that are always true (also known as '''tautologies'''). For example, &lt;math&gt;(p \vee \neg p),(p \to p),(((p \vee q) \wedge (p \to q)) \to q) &lt;/math&gt; are valid formulas.
*&lt;math&gt;\textrm{UNSAT}&lt;/math&gt; - the set of formulas that are never true (unsatisfiable).
*In between: &lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT}&lt;/math&gt; - the set of formulas for which there exists a satisfying assignment (not unsatisfiable).

Note. &lt;math&gt;\phi\in \textrm{VALID} \iff \neg \phi \in \textrm{UNSAT}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Claim''': &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi \iff (\Sigma \cup \{\neg \phi\}) \in \textrm{UNSAT}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Claim''': &lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT}&lt;/math&gt; is NP-complete.

'''Proof''':
*&lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT} \in \textrm{NP}&lt;/math&gt;: guess a satisfying assignment, then verify that the formula is true (a satisfying assignment is a certificate).
*Hardness.  graph 3-coloring &lt;math&gt;\in\textrm{NP}&lt;/math&gt; (there also exists a direct proof). We reduce 3-coloring to &lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; be a graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;. We use propositional variables &lt;math&gt;p_{i,g}, p_{i,r}, p_{i,b}&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is colored with green, red, or blue. Construct &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \mathop{\bigwedge}_{i=1}^n ((p_{i,g} \wedge \neg p_{i,r} \wedge \neg p_{i,b})\vee (p_{i,r} \wedge \neg p_{i,g} \wedge \neg p_{i,b})\vee (p_{i,b} \wedge \neg p_{i,r} \wedge \neg p_{i,g}))&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\wedge\mathop{\bigwedge}_{(i,j\in E)} \neg (p_{i,g} \wedge p_{j,g})\wedge \neg (p_{i,r} \wedge p_{j,r})\wedge \neg (p_{i,b} \wedge p_{j,b})&lt;/math&gt;

'''Claim''': &lt;math&gt;G\in \textrm{3-Coloring} \iff  \phi \in \textrm{SAT}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also possible to prove that &lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT} \in \textrm{NP}&lt;/math&gt; directly 

'''Claim''': &lt;math&gt;\textrm{VALID} \in \textrm{coNP}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Horn Clauses====
Special case for which SAT is in polynomial time. Example:

:&lt;math&gt;(p \vee \neg q \vee r) \wedge (\neg p \vee q \vee \neg r)&lt;/math&gt;

A '''Horn clause''' is a disjunction of literals of which at most one is positive. There are two kinds of possible Horn clauses:
#clause has 1 positive literal
##&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, or
##&lt;math&gt;p \vee \neg x_1 \vee\ldots \vee \neg x_k : x_1 \wedge ... \wedge x_k \rightarrow p&lt;/math&gt;
#no positive literal
##&lt;math&gt;\neg x_1 \vee ... \vee \neg x_k : \neg (x_1 \wedge ... \wedge x_k)&lt;/math&gt;
##&lt;math&gt;x_1 \wedge ... \wedge x_k \rightarrow false&lt;/math&gt;

'''Claim''': For every set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of Horn formulas, checking whether &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable is in &lt;math&gt;\textrm{P}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof Idea''': Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; be the subset of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; containing only clauses of type 1, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; the subset of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; containing clauses of type 2. Note first that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable. To obtain a minimum satisfying assignment &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, start with literals from single-literal clauses and crank the rules. It now remains to check consistency of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; with the clauses in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, it is enough to check that for each clause &lt;math&gt;x_1 \wedge ... \wedge x_k \rightarrow false&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is not true for all of &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_k&lt;/math&gt;.  

'''Example''': Consider the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of Horn clauses:
:&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg p \vee \neg q \vee s&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg s \vee \neg r \vee t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg t&lt;/math&gt;
The set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; of clauses of type 1 consists of the first 5 clauses, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; consists of  the last clause. Note that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; can also be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p \wedge  q \rightarrow s&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s \wedge r \rightarrow t&lt;/math&gt;
The minimum satisfying assignment for &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; is obtained as follows:
# start with &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r\}&lt;/math&gt;
# use the first implication to infer &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;
# use the second implication to infer &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the minimum satisfying assignment makes &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r,s,t\}&lt;/math&gt; true. This contradicts &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;, which states that &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; must be false. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is not satisfiable.

===Deductive Systems===
A '''deductive''' system is a mechanism for proving new statements from given statements.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; be a set of known valid statements (propositional formulas). In a deductive system, there are two components: inference rules and proofs.

;Inference rules
:An inference rule indicates that if certain set of statements (formulas) &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_k&lt;/math&gt; is true, then a given statement &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; must be true.  An inference rule &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;H: \frac{\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_k}{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;.
:Example (modus ponens): &lt;math&gt;\frac{p,~~ p \rightarrow q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;
;Proofs : A proof of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is sequence of formulas &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1, ..., \varphi_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_n=\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;
:* Each formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, or
:* There are a subset of formulas &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{i_1}, ..., \varphi_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;i_1,\ldots,i_k&lt;i&lt;/math&gt;, such that, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi_{i_1},\ldots, \varphi_{i_k}}{\varphi_i}&lt;/math&gt; is an inference rule.
If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has a proof from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; using inference rule &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; we write &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash_H \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Properties'':
* '''Soundness''': If &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash_H \varphi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., all provable sentences are true). This property is fundamental for the correctness of the deductive system.
* '''Completeness''': If &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash_H \varphi&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., all true sentences are provable). This is a desirable property in deductive systems.

===Natural Deduction===
Natural deduction is a collection of inference rules. Let &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; denote contradiction, falsity. The following are the inference rules of natural deduction:

# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi,\psi}{\varphi \wedge \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi \wedge \psi}{\varphi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi \wedge \psi}{\psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi,\varphi\rightarrow \psi}{\psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi,\neg \varphi}{\perp}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\neg \neg \varphi}{\varphi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\perp}{\varphi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi\rightarrow \psi,\psi\rightarrow \varphi}{\varphi\leftrightarrow \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi\leftrightarrow \psi}{\varphi\rightarrow \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi\leftrightarrow \psi}{\psi\rightarrow \varphi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi}{\varphi\vee \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\psi}{\varphi\vee \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\begin{matrix} \varphi \\ \vdots \\\psi\end{matrix}}{\varphi\rightarrow \psi} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\begin{matrix} \varphi \\ \vdots \\ \perp\end{matrix}}{\neg\varphi} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\begin{matrix} \neg\varphi \\ \vdots \\ \perp\end{matrix}}{\varphi} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\begin{matrix} \varphi \vee \psi  &amp; \varphi &amp; \psi \\ &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\ &amp; \rho &amp; \rho\end{matrix}}{\rho} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

Rule (13) allows us to prove valid statements of the form &quot;If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&quot; even if we don't know the truth value of the &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; statement (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is not in the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of known valid statements). Indeed, for this rule, we start assuming &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is valid. If we can conclude &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is valid in a world where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\cup\varphi&lt;/math&gt; are valid, then we conclude that the relation &lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt; is true, and we &quot;release&quot; the assumption &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is valid.

We now show how to apply the above inference rules.

Example: De Morgan's Law for negated or-expressions says:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi) \leftrightarrow (\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof''': By rule &lt;math&gt;(8)&lt;/math&gt; if we can prove &lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi) \rightarrow (\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi) \rightarrow \neg (\varphi \vee \psi)&lt;/math&gt; we can infer the desired result.

To prove the first direction, we use rule 13 and assume the hypothesis &lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi)&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi) &lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi &lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi \vee \psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 11)''
::&lt;math&gt;\perp  &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \varphi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 14)''
::&lt;math&gt;\psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi \vee \psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 11)''
::&lt;math&gt;\perp &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 14)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 1)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi) \rightarrow (\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi)&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 13)''

We now prove the second direction. 
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \varphi&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 2)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \psi&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 3)''
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi \vee \psi&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:::&lt;math&gt;\varphi \psi&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:::&lt;math&gt;\perp \perp&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
::&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;''(by rule 16)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi)&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 14)''
:&lt;math&gt;(\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi) \rightarrow \neg (\varphi \vee \psi)&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 13)''

Proof of Pierce's Law:
:&lt;math&gt;((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;(A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed) (1*)''
::&lt;math&gt;\neg A&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:::&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:::&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
:::&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 7)''
::&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 13)''
::&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''(by assumption (1*) and rule 4)''
::&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 14)''
:&lt;math&gt;( ( A \rightarrow B ) \rightarrow A ) \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 13)''

'''Fact 2''': Natural deduction is sound.

To show that natural deduction is also complete we need to introduce propositional resolution.

===Propositional Resolution===
Resolution is another procedure for checking validity of statements. It involves '''clauses''', '''formulas''' and a single '''resolution''' rule.

Some terminology:
;Clause 
:A clause is a propositional formula composed by disjunction of literals. For example &lt;math&gt;p \lor q \lor \lnot r&lt;/math&gt;. It is usually denoted as the set of literals, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,\lnot r\}&lt;/math&gt;.
:The empty clause, denoted as an open box &quot;&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, is the disjunction of no literals. It is always false.
;Formula 
:A set of clauses, each of them satisfiable. For example, &lt;math&gt;\{\{p,\lnot q\},\{r\},\{\lnot r, s\}\}&lt;/math&gt; represents the CNF formula &lt;math&gt;(p \lor\lnot q)\land (r)\land (\lnot r \lor s)&lt;/math&gt;.
:The empty formula, denoted as &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, is the set that contains no clauses. It is always true.
;Resolution Rule 
:It is a rule that, given two clauses &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; (containing some literal &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; (containing some literal &lt;math&gt;\lnot y&lt;/math&gt;), allows to infer a new clause, called the '''resolvent''' of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; (with respect to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;).

A proof system for resolution contains a single resolution rule, where the resolvent is defined as follows. Assume &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; are clauses such that &lt;math&gt;y\in C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot y\in C'&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;res_{y}(C,C') = (C-\{y\})\cup (C'-\{\lnot y\})&lt;/math&gt;.

The smallest set of clauses containing &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and closed under resolution is denoted &lt;math&gt;Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example''': If &lt;math&gt;C=\{p,y\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'=\{q,\lnot y\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;res_y(C,C') = \{p,q\}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is possible to show that the resolution rule, as defined, computes a clause that can be inferred using natural deduction.

'''Claim''': Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; be any two clauses such that &lt;math&gt;y\in C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot y\in C'&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;C\land C' \implies res_y(C,C')&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to prove the validity of a statement &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, we will prove the ''negated'' statement &lt;math&gt;\lnot \psi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. To prove unsatisfiability of a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, we need to define the '''resolution refutation''' of the formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;:

The resolution refutation tree of the formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a tree rooted at the empty clause, where every leaf is a clause in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and each internal node is computed as the resolvent of the two corresponding children. 

Notice that clauses of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can appear repeated as leaves. From above claim we can conclude that:

'''Claim''': If there exists a resolution refutation tree for formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi \implies \Box&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

'''Example''': The formula
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = (p\lor q)\land (\lnot q\lor r)\land (\lnot r)\land (\lnot p \lor \lnot s)\land (s\lor \lnot t) \land (t)&lt;/math&gt;
has the following resolution refutation tree:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:CompSciLogicRefTree1.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

The order in which clauses are selected to compute the resolvent matters when computing the resolution refutation tree, as the following example shows: Consider the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\psi = (p\lor q)\land (\lnot q\lor r)\land (\lnot p)\land (\lnot q)&lt;/math&gt;.
Even though a resolution refutation tree may exist for &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, order is important when trying to build the tree. Below are two different resolution refutation trees, but only one is successful:

[[Image:CompSciLogicUnsuccessfulTre.png|frame|none|Unsuccessful attempt of resolution refutation tree for &amp;psi;.]]
[[Image:CompSciLogicSuccessfulTree.png|frame|none|A successful resolution refutation tree for &amp;psi;.]]

===Properties of Propositional Resolution===
'''Soundness''': Propositional resolution is sound, that is, if there exists a resolution refutation tree for a given formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; must be unsatisfiable.

'''Theorem''': For any formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\Box \in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi \implies \Box&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Completeness''': Propositional resolution is complete, that is, if a given formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has a resolution refutation tree.

'''Theorem''': For any formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\varphi \implies \Box&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Box \in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': By induction on the number of variables in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Basis'': We have one variable, say &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. All possible clauses of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable then both clauses occur, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\Box \in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Induction step'': Suppose the hypothesis is true for formulas with less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables. Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; be a formula with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\Box \notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;; we will show &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable. Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be a variable of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. Then either &lt;math&gt;\{p\}\notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\}\notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; (if both hold then &lt;math&gt;\Box\in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; immediately).

Assume &lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\}\notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. We define the formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi^p&lt;/math&gt; as containing all clauses that do not contain &lt;math&gt;\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; and where the literal &lt;math&gt;\lnot p&lt;/math&gt; has been removed from each clause (in other words, &lt;math&gt;\varphi^p&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the formula resulting from setting &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; true).

Formally,
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^p = \{C-\{\lnot p\} : C\in \varphi,\,p\notin C\}&lt;/math&gt;.
First, notice that
:&lt;math&gt;Res(\varphi^p) = \{C-\{\lnot p\} : C\in Res(\varphi),\,p\notin C\}&lt;/math&gt;
and thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\}\notin Res(\varphi^p)&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, since &lt;math&gt;\Box\notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;\Box\notin Res(\varphi^p)&lt;/math&gt;. By the induction hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;\varphi^p&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable. Then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable by an extension of the satisfying assignment of &lt;math&gt;\varphi^p&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; equal true. The case &lt;math&gt;\{p\}\in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is analogous.

===Completeness of Natural Deduction===
'''Theorem''': Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be the set of inference rules of Natural Deduction. If &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash_H \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

The idea behind the proof of completeness of natural deduction is as follows. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is valid (then &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable). We then show there exists a resolution refutation for &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and then by applying the contradiction rule (rule 15):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\begin{matrix}\neg \varphi\\\vdots\\\perp\end{matrix}}{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
we conclude &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can be inferred.

'''Proof''': (Sketch) Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; valid under &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, we perform the following steps:
#Prove that &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to some &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is in CNF.
#Prove that &lt;math&gt;\psi \implies Res(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.
#By completeness of resolution, if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable then &lt;math&gt;\Box \in Res(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\} \in Res(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; for some literal &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. This implies &lt;math&gt;Res(\psi)\implies \bot&lt;/math&gt;.
#Conclude that &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi \implies \bot&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is valid.
  
Step (1) can be easily done by repeated application of De Morgan's laws. Step (2) can be proven using natural deduction. Finally, step (3) can be proven by induction on the number of steps to obtain &lt;math&gt;Res(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, each step can be simulated using natural deduction.
 
It is very likely that any algorithm for propositional resolution will take very long on the worst case (recall that checking validity of a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is co-NP complete).

===Linear Resolution and PROLOG===
Linear resolution is a particular resolution strategy that always resolves the most recent resolvent with a clause. The resolution refutation tree so obtained is therefore linear. It is possible to prove that, if the set of clauses are Horn clauses, there exists a linear resolution strategy for any formula. That is, linear resolution is complete for the set of Horn clauses.

The language PROLOG uses resolution on a set of Horn clauses. Each clause is called a '''program clause'''. Moreover, clauses composed by a single literal are called '''facts'''. 
A clause with a single negated literal is called a '''query'''. The table below shows a comparison of the different notations. In PROLOG, to query a statement &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the idea is to negate the statement (&lt;math&gt;\lnot t&lt;/math&gt;) and to perform resolution with the set of known true statements. If a resolution refutation tree is found, the statement &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is implied by the program.

'''Example''': An example of linear resolution for the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = (p)\land (q)\land (r)\land (t\lor \lnot s \lor \lnot r)\land (s \lor \lnot p \lor \lnot q)\land (\lnot t)&lt;/math&gt;

Outdoor cooking takes many forms; from basic cooking over a simple camp-fire to gourmet meals prepared on equipment that rivals that found in modern kitchens.  Wood, charcoal, propane gas or piped in natural gas may fuel the cooking devices.  This is clearly a type of cooking with many variations.

*[[Cookbook:Camp Cooking|Camp Cooking]]
*[[Cookbook:Backyard Smoking|Backyard Smoking]]
*[[Cookbook:Backyard Grilling|Backyard Grilling]]
*[[Cookbook:Backyard Deep-Fry|Backyard Deep-Fry]] (think deep-fried turkey.)
*[[Cookbook:Outdoor Cooking - Misc|Outdoor Cooking - Misc]] (Boiled Clams, Crabs, etc.)

==General Rules for Outdoor Food Safety==

Plan ahead: decide what you are going to eat and how you are going to cook it; then plan what equipment you will need.

* Pack safely: use a cooler if car-camping or boating, or pack foods in the frozen state with a cold source if hiking or backpacking. Keep raw foods separate from other foods. Never bring meat or poultry products without a cold source to keep them safe.
* Bring disposable wipes or biodegradable soap for hand- and dishwashing.
* Plan on carrying bottled water for drinking. Otherwise, boil water or use water purification tablets.
* Do not leave trash in the wild or throw it off your boat.
* If using a cooler, leftover food is safe only if the cooler still has ice in it. Otherwise, discard leftover food.
* Whether in the wild or on the high seas, protect yourself and your family by washing your hands before and after handling food.</text>

      <comment>/* Pitch classification */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Japanese uses '''pitch accent''', where every mora can either be pronounced with a high or low pitch. Not all dictionaries will indicate this, but pitch accent is certainly important, because it can make the difference between different words. 

For example, using '''bold''' for high pitches:

'''い'''ま (今) - &quot;now&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
い'''ま''' (居間) - &quot;living room&quot;

Pitch is, however, to some extent a characteristic of regional accents, so a Kanto speaker may be using the opposite pitches to a Kansai speaker. Where pitch is taught, it will be standard Japanese (essentially the Tokyo dialect). Pitchless Japanese is easily understood by native speakers and incorrect pitch will at most sound somewhat odd. Studying pitch, therefore, isn't essential to the learning Japanese and is perhaps best picked up by conversing with native speakers.

Linguists, however, tend to classify Japanese as having a falling pitch following what is considered the stressed vowel.

== Pitch classification ==
When dictionaries give pitch accent, they'll usually indicate it with a number. The number tells you the mora where the '''last high pitch''' is. To figure out the pitch pattern, put a low onto the first mora (unless the last high pitch is on that mora), put high pitches onto all the mora that follows, until you hit the last high pitch. After that, put low pitches.

Even more helpful dictionaries will do all of this work for you, by telling you exactly where all the pitches rise or fall.

So, to give some examples.

__NOTOC__

{{Book Search}}

This is a guide to the '''LaTeX''' markup language. It is intended to form a useful resource for everybody from new users who wish to learn, to old hands who need a quick reference.

'''TeX and LaTeX'''

TeX is a computer program for typesetting documents, created by [[w:Donald Knuth|Donald Knuth]]. It takes a suitably prepared computer file and converts it to a form which may be printed on many kinds of printers, including dot-matrix printers, laser printers and high-resolution typesetting machines. LaTeX is a set of macros for TeX that aims at reducing the user's task to the sole role of writing the content, LaTeX taking care of all the formatting process. A number of well-established publishers now use TeX or LaTeX to typeset books and mathematical journals. It is also well appreciated by users caring about typography, consistent formatting, efficient collaborative writing and open formats.

The book is organized in different parts.

* ''Getting Started'' will provide you with the very first steps to print your first document: general  concepts (very important!), software installation, and basic syntax.

* ''Common Elements'' groups all common features you would expect from a document processor, covering fonts, layout, colors, lists, figures and others.

* ''Mechanics''  are some topics that are not really necessary to write a basic document, but could help you understand how some parts of the machinery work. These topics are required for fine tuning documents. Use them as support for various chapters, as they are often being referred to.

* ''Technical Texts'' focuses on different specialized matters, mostly for scientific work.

* ''Special Pages'' is for the structured pages usually put in appendices.

* ''Special Documents'': this part tackles other kind of documents different from the classic article style.

* ''Creating Graphics'' is for the process of ''writing'' graphics from a LaTeX document.

* ''Programming'' or how to create your own macros and packages.

* ''Miscellaneous'' contains everything that does not fit in the previous parts, like project management and other subjects related to LaTeX but not inherent to LaTeX itself.

* ''Help and Recommendations'' : the FAQ encompasses very common pitfalls and important recommendations for everyone, ''we urge you to read it''; the Tips and Tricks are much more specific matters.

* ''Appendices''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== My comments about this page and this project ==
This was a total mess.  After being on here for over 14 months, it was riddled with problems, many of which remain.
*Unit symbols not italicized.
*The units Joule and Newton were improperly capitalized, in situations where they should not be capitalized.
*It incorrectly claimed, not just once but at least twice, that the spring constant ''k'' is &quot;unitless&quot;.
*It included a conversion factor from joules to calories; I don't think there's any crying need to include calories at all, but if you do, give the conversion factor from calories to joules, not the other way.
*Of course, that's what you had--you just had the units screwed up and flipped around.  Actually, a calorie is about 4.18 to 4.19 joules, not a joule equal to 4.18 calories.
*I'm sure there were other things I fixed too, and others yet unfixed even on this short page, but I've vented all I need to now.  [[User:66.97.235.123|66.97.235.123]] 12:42, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Work and Energy merging ==

I think we should merge two articles substantially rewriting the content.&lt;br /&gt;
When '''work''' is defined with '''energy''' while '''energy''' defined by '''work''', it will be better to compose a common  article where to introduce them somehow simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pneumatic and hydraulic systems are actuators which provide linear movement. Hydraulic systems, especially, can produce extremely high forces.

==Pneumatic systems==
The Pneumatic Actuator is sometimes called a Pneumatic Ram. The basic Pnuematic Ram consists of 3 main parts. These 3 parts are the ''Cylinder'', ''Piston'' and ''Rod''.

[[Image:Cylinder.jpg|thumb|400px|Dual acting cylinder extending.]]

The ''Cylinder'', which is black in the diagram, is where the process takes place. Most of the cylinders in use for hobby robotics are constructed of stainless steel and depending on the type of ram it will either feature one or two ports for compressed air.

The ''Piston'', marked in green, is similar to one that you would find in a car engine. It essentially provides a surface for the compressed gas to act upon.

The ''Ram'' , marked in blue, is connected to the piston and transfers the force from the piston to the mechanism that needs moving. 

There are several different types of cylinders:
*Single acting cylinder: This cylinder has one input and has a spring. If the pressure is released from the cylinder the spring pushes the piston rod back to its starting position.
*Double acting cylinder. This type of cylinder is moved by pressurizing one side at a time of the piston. (see images below).

===Applications===

Pneumatics are useful for generating linear motion. 
* Movement of a lever in a walker robot design.
* Closing a gripper

===Design Considerations=== 

The use of Pnuematics requires a supply of compressed gas. For a stationary robot on a production line a compressor could be set up nearby to supply it however this isn't possible for a robot that is on the move. The solution is to have a container that holds compressed air. If lots of compressed air is required the addition of a compressor into the design may be required however bear in mind that a compressor will consume a large amount of power.

===Calculating Output Force===
[[Image:Cylinder_extending.jpg|thumb|300px|Dual acting cylinder extending.]]
[[Image:Cylinder_contracting.jpg|thumb|300px|Dual acting cylinder contracting.]]

The force a cylinder can be expressed as 

:&lt;math&gt; F = \ {p A_{Piston}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

*''F'': Force in Newtons
*''p'': Air pressure in cylinder in Pascals. Pressure can be obtained through use of a Pressure Gauge in the air circuit before the Ram. 
*''A'': Surface area of the piston in square meters.{{ref|Sam1}} This can be obtained from the manufacturers specifications.

====Notes====
# {{note|Sam1}} Note: the surface area of the rod side of the piston is smaller than the other side.

      <comment>Notification regarding [[:Image:Tanklike.png]]. using [[User:Mike.lifeguard/Twinkle Speedy documentation|TW]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I've adding some graphics to the robotics book. These are done with Inventor and (most of them) touched up with paintshop pro. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;

==placing graphics on wikipages:==

Since the help page of wikibooks isn't much help yet, here's how I placed those pictures: 

&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
[[Image:Robotics Logo.png|none|thumb|100px|&lt;center&gt;Robotics&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Robotics Logo.png|none|thumb|100px|&lt;center&gt;Robotics&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;


The center tags place the picture in the center of the page and prevent from text being placed next to them as this looks wrong.

&quot;robotics logo.png&quot; is the name of the drawing uploaded to wikibooks.

&quot;none&quot; is the orientation. Could be left or right. 

&quot;thumb&quot; I have no idea. I assume this means thumbnail?

&quot;288px&quot; how width the drawing has to be. height is automaticaly calculated to keep the aspected ratio correct.

The rest of the line is the text below the drawing, but still in the picturebox.

Another way is the gallery tag:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;
Image:Scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Flat Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;
Image:Raised scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Raised Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Flat Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Raised scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Raised Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Watchlist acting unfair. ==

Watchlists seem to act a little unfair lately. Someone wrote a nice part on IDC connectors which showed up in my watchlist. However when I made a small change to it (changed 2 symbols ('?') that weren't drawn properly in '°' symbols, only my minor edit was left in the watchlist. I wonder if this is normal.

: Noticed this too, I think it's a Wiki mechanism to avoid flooding the watchlist with hundreds of minor edits (if wiki documents each minor edits). I know for one I sometimes had to go back to re-edit my work when I spotted a typo/ format issue, and the watchlist just takes the latest edit as a summary of all the edits in the time span.

== spell checking. ==

I admit I'm not always spell check what I contribute. The main cause is that I write a lot on other peoples computers (this I'm writing on my gf's) and those don't have a spell checker installed in mozilla. &lt;BR&gt;

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: interchangable → interchangeable using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter focuses on creating and designing a web site using Adobe GoLive


==GoLive Site Wizard==
The GoLive Site Wizard can be used to create anything from empty to template structured to imported web sites.

===How it Works===
The Site Wizard creates a project folder, a project file and three organizational folders to contain the elements of the site.  These folders are the ''web-content'' folder, the ''web-data'' folder and the ''web-settings'' folder.  While these various parts are used to organize and create the site, only the web-content folder is uploaded onto the server when publishing.
:*''project file'' shares the name of your site and uses the .site file extension.  This file is used to manage your site's makeup.
:*''web-content folder'' contains pages, css, images and everything else needed for the published version of the site.
:*''web-data folder'' templates, components and other reusable elements.
:*''web-settings folder'' stores changes made in the Site Settings dialog box.

===Creating a Site=== 
The site creation process for the Mac or PC is identical and the resulting files are interchangeable across operating systems. 

:# File &gt; New Site  
:# Select Single User
:# Select
:#* Blank Site
:#* Import from Folder
:#* Import from Server
:#* Copy from Template
:# Name the site (if applicable)
:# Choose a location for the site files to reside
:# Click Finish

==Organizing a Site== 
Once your site has been created and populated with pages (see next chapter) you must link these pages and their elements together and to their sources to make a coherent and maintainable Web site.

===Linking Pages, Objects and Their Sources===
Once linked, objects will maintain their links even when their sources are moved or renamed so long as these changes occur within the site window.
There are three types of links which can be applied to objects, images, etc.

:* resource links (links in the HTML which locate the objects appearing on the page) 
:* navigational links (links that take a viewer from one page to another or between locations on a page)
:* external links (still technically navigational links, external links refer to any link which opens another page or email)

====resource links====
Do one of the following:
:* Drag the file from the site window and let GoLive create the resource link automatically
:* Manually specify the resource location:
:# Select an object
:# Navigate to the Inspector
:# Change the source file

====navigational links====
:# Select item to house the link
:# If linking an image or object, click the Link tab and then the Create Link button (looks like a chain)
:# Type the destination file in the URL text box.
:# Use the Target menu to select a location for the link to open if you wish it to open in a frame or another window.
:# Enter a title for the link.  The title will appear when the cursor is held over the link.  (This only works in some browsers.)
:# Use the Name/ID menu to select Name &amp; ID.
:# Type a link name on the Name/ID line.


====external links====
Follow steps 1 and 2 in the navigational links section.  When entering the destination file in part 3 include &quot;http://&quot; or &quot;mailto:&quot; before the destination to link to an external location.  Finish as a navigational link.

[[File:Mycomputer.jpg|150px|right]]
Building a computer can be a very rewarding experience. Since you’re reading this, you’re probably thinking about building your next computer instead of buying one pre-built. This is a very viable option these days and can bring many benefits; you can learn a lot about computer hardware by building one, you get a totally personalized computer, you can choose better components and you may be able to save some money and have fun.
   
Additionally, if you are the sort of person who wants to understand how things work, if you take broken stuff apart just to see how it all fits together, if you have a drawer somewhere full of “parts” you think may come in handy someday, then you just may be in the right place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Introduction - Welcome to the Japanese Wikibook===

Development of this Wikibook began in August 11, 2003. It is an ongoing project that will evolve as users contribute to the content and layout of pages. The end goal of this project is to create an online resource for those wishing to learn Japanese. We will attempt to encompass all aspects of the Japanese language, including pronunciation, reading, writing, and grammar. 

Many textbooks and travel guides make  use of 'rōmaji' (Romanisation of Japanese characters) to bypass the need for learning the Japanese characters. This Wikibook, however, aims to develop a well rounded student, and as such, will make minimal use of 'rōmaji' except in introducing pronunciation.

=== Current work ===

In the first five years, this Wikibook went through several rewrites. Seeing all too few contributors keen on picking up the torch where past editors left off, the book had amassed several layers of rewritten material that did little to provide a clear path through the material. Waking to that reality after [[Talk:Japanese#Wow._This_is_a_mess|considerable discussion]], we came up with the [[Talk:Japanese#Categorisation|categorisation]] scheme now present on the main page. The [[Japanese/Contents]] page does not conform with that scheme as it is more an inventory for editors looking for existing material to work with (be it merging, re-factoring, deleting, or rewriting), rather than an index for learners.

Since June 2008, a good deal of merges and rewrites have been done. As a result we've managed to delete over a hundred pages of unnecessary or duplicate material, navbars, printable versions, and templates. See [[Talk:Japanese#Removal Suggestions|Removal Suggestions]] for deletion proposals and discussions. For pages to be merged, see the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Books_to_be_merged&amp;from=Japanese Books to be merged] category for a list of pages in this book that have been suggested be merged and [[:Category:Japanese todo]] for pages with specific work to be done.

There hasn't been much discussion lately on the actual content since active editors (currently [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] and [[User:Swift|Swift]]) have been working on somewhat separate aspects of this book. We have a section on pages on [[Japanese/Contents#Structure/Lesson Plans/Syllabus|structure, lesson plans and syllabus]]. ''[[Talk:Japanese#How much to teach (was: what a mess...)|How much to teach]]'' and ''[[Talk:Japanese#Levels|Levels]]'' might also be of interest for those so inclined. For development of a consistent curriculum see [[User:Retropunk/Japanese Curriculum]] and [[Sugu ni Hajimemashō]].

Finally; every contributor seems to have a different take on the purpose of this book. In your work, remember that learners have vastly different learning styles and diverse approaches to lesson plans will benefit readers and contributors alike. Until we have fully functioning learning paths, the categorisation scheme on the front page will make the existing material accessible to readers while allowing users to contribute without having to conform to a predefined form.

That said; pick your path and be bold.

Hey Andreas, I think you've been doing great work. I just want to &quot;get to know you&quot; for a little bit longer before I cast my &quot;support&quot; vote. In the mean time, you can suggest changes for the main on the talk page; or we can try unprotecting it again. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 06:21, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks! This sounds promising. If adminship can not be granted so quickly, I'd be perfectly happy, if the main page was unprotected again (for doing small changes). Anyway, for the &quot;big&quot; change (I want to reserve at least a quarter of the page for the &quot;book of the month&quot;) I should design this locally first, and if you guys like it, it could also be moved to the main page by one of you... Doesn't have to be me! In the meantime, increase the quality of the vote by [[Wikibooks:Book of the month voting for February 2005|voting]] by yourself! Thanks, --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 07:57, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Main Page ==

Oops, I guess I should have announce the main page isn't protected anymore.  I think the vandal we had has gone.  Hopefully, I'm right. :) [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:25, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: No problem, I already made the changes (see the &quot;Book of the month&quot;). If you like, please vote for your favorite book too. I guess you have far more experience and overview over the books around here than me... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 00:28, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== he to they ==

Hey mate, great spotting. I should have been more careful with my edits. I guess we could move it to wikisource if you really wanted, but we shouldnt take it off wikibooks, cause the plan is that it will grow and become more the the out-of-copyright book that it is now. Large parts of wikipedia had thier base in a 1908 (?) version of britanica which is now out of copyright. The point was not to put the text of britanica online, but to have it as a starting point to create something bigger and better. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 06:50, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Message ==

I left a message on the [[Wikibooks_talk:Top_active/Listing_January_2005]] for you.
: And I just answered there --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 13:33, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Categories ==

How would I go about creating OR requesting categories? [[The Golden Bough]] has some, but those categories do not have any page associated with them. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 21:36, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Your categories exist, all you had to do, was purge the cache of the Mediawiki software (so that the red links turn blue). I did this by manually entering: http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=The_Golden_Bough&amp;action=purge . By the way, it is not a good idea, to have all sub-pages in the Category as well. It is recommended, only to put the main page of the book into categories.

:: Only the main page will be there. Thanks [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 12:46, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
::: OK, I wrote the above before checking. I only added Categories to the main page [[The GOlden Bough]] yet, all sub-pages appear in those categories. Did I miss something? [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 12:48, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:::: No no, look at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Religion, all pages that are listed here, have the Category link at the bottom of their page. (it is not on all subpages of your book, just on some!) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 16:03, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:::: Was not your fault, EuropracBHIT had added all those Categories, I wrote a note to his talk page. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 16:43, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Spaces in wikipage names ==

I had no idea that wikimedia supported spaces in the names, is there any way that I can add the spaces into the names without losing content or having to copy/paste the whole book? --[[User:Mrnoj|Mrnoj]] 17:25, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Hi Mrnoj. Yes, if you are logged in, you have a &quot;move&quot; command on top of each page. With this you can &quot;move&quot; the page to a new name and insert spaces. All history is automatically moved as well, and the old page will become a redirect to the new page. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:47, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)


== Book (of the month) change ==
:That's all right, Andreas. I can imagine you were very busy or didn't have much time, and you didn't do it yourself for that reason.
:Regarding the April award. So pleased that '''US History''' has got it, as of 0:00 UTC yesterday. When are we going to announce it, and who is going to draw/find a picture?
:It's really been close and competitive this month (with an element of tactical voting, if I do say so myself, but no nasty factions!). Imagine, the next three books got 4 each. The Unicyclopedia, How to Build a Computer and the Physics Study Guide, if I recall.
--[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 05:48, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Dichotomous Key Glossary==
Hey, I'm unsure about glossary formatting, so I thought I'd ask for a second opinion.  Take a look at [[Dichotomous Key:Mammalia]].  Do you think the glossary is better like that (i.e. next to the terms it applies to) or altogether in a box somewhere on the page? [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:50, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
: I like the glossary right next to the terms, that is very useful! I added two formatting commands, to put all glossary to the right on a stack:
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; width:310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{egg}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{birth}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;*Birth&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;**Eggs - [[Dichotomous Key:Monotremata|Monotremata]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;**Live birth - [[#2|2]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
: The last &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br...&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is needed so that the right floats won`t overlap with the next section. I hope it is not too ugly, some of it might be put into a template...
: Speaking of template, you might think of one template, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{dichotomous glossary|Egg|A zygote, resulting from fertilization of the ovum}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, so that the glossary terms are also easily editable on the page (otherwise you have to create really a lot of templates, and the likelihood of overlap with other projects on Wikibooks increases..). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 03:43, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::Thanks, I'm terrible with wikisyntax!  Can you make the three boxes at the top of the page line-up neatly.  I tried randomly sticking stacks around and got it looking nicer on my monitor, but the righthand box (&quot;adjacent keys&quot;) is still lower than the others and way off to the right.  Regarding combining the glossary into one template, there are definite advantages, but using an individual template (e.g. [[Template:Egg]]) lets you use the same definition on multiple pages (and change it on all pages with only one edit).  It's probably possible to use templates within templates to get the best of both worlds, but that could get messy... [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 06:56, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::: For now, I inserted a break before the &quot;1&quot; section. About the layout of the three boxes... It looks a little bit disorganized with so many boxes floating around. What about having 1 large box on top that is subdivided into the necessary parts? Something along the lines as sketched below: --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 07:43, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::Looks good with combined boxes! [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]]


==World History==
I finally got around to changing (what I hope is) ''every single link and page''.  I used the Book:Chaptertitle hierchy because of a specialized chapter page top which would look funny with the automatic used by Book/Chaptertitle.  Besides, the latter confuses new users anyway.  Hope it helps!--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 00:25, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)
: Well done! Thanks a lot. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 12:56, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== SimCity ==

I've expanded the page on [[SimCity]] quite dramatically, and given that you have contributed to it in the past, I'm wondering if you have any comments, suggestions, or anything else to contribute to it? [[User:AmishThrasher|AmishThrasher]] 15:46, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

== De-Adminship vote ==

A vote is being held to remove your sysop privileges.  The basis for this vote is lack of use of these privileges.  You may want to participate at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#Andreas_Ipp_.28_talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.29]].  See also the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Removing_Sysop_Status]]. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:39, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Your De-Adminship ==

Hello. I would like to inform you that you will have your sysop rights removed here on 1 Nov 2006 due to inactivity. If you would like to discuss the matter, please see [[WB:RFA]]. You can re-apply for adminship at a later date if you wish.

      <comment>/* What is TeX? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==What is TeX?==

'''[[TeX]]''' is a low-level markup and programming language created by [[w:Donald Knuth|Donald Knuth]] to typeset documents attractively and consistently. Knuth started writing the TeX typesetting engine in 1977 to explore the potential of the digital printing equipment that was beginning to infiltrate the publishing industry at that time, especially in the hope that he could reverse the trend of deteriorating typographical quality that he saw affecting his own books and articles. With the release of 8-bit 
character support in 1989, TeX development has been essentially frozen with only bug fixes released periodically. TeX is a programming language in the sense that it supports the if-else construct: you can make calculations with it (that are performed while compiling the document), etc., but you would find it very hard to do anything else but typesetting with it. The fine control TeX offers over document structure and formatting makes it a powerful—and formidable—tool. TeX is renowned for being extremely stable, for running on many different kinds of computers, and for being virtually bug free. The version numbers of TeX are converging toward &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, with a current version number of 3.1415926.  

The name TeX is intended by its developer to be {{IPA|/'tɛx/}}, with the final consonant of ''loch'' or ''Bach''. (Donald E. Knuth, ''The TeXbook'') The letters of the name are meant to represent the capital Greek letters tau, epsilon, and chi, as TeX is an abbreviation of ''τέχνη'' (ΤΕΧΝΗ – technē), Greek for both &quot;art&quot; and &quot;craft&quot;, which is also the root word of ''technical''. English speakers often pronounce it {{IPA|/'tɛk/}}, like the first syllable of ''technical''.

Programming in TeX generally progresses along a very gradual learning curve, requiring a significant investment of time to build custom macros for text formatting. Fortunately, document preparation systems based on TeX, consisting of collections of pre-built macros, do exist. These pre-built macros are time saving, and automate certain repetitive tasks and help reduce user introduced errors; however, this convenience comes at the cost of complete design flexibility. One of the most popular macro packages is called '''LaTeX'''.

==What is LaTeX?==

'''LaTeX''' (pronounced either &quot;Lah-tech&quot; or &quot;Lay-tech&quot;) is a macro package based on TeX created by [[w:Leslie Lamport|Leslie Lamport]]. Its purpose is to simplify TeX typesetting, especially for documents containing mathematical formulae. Within the typesetting system, its name is formatted as {{LaTeX}}.

Many later authors have contributed extensions, called ''packages'' or ''styles'', to LaTeX. Some of these are bundled with most TeX/LaTeX software distributions; more can be found in the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network ([http://www.ctan.org CTAN]).

Since LaTeX comprises a group of [[TeX]] commands, LaTeX document processing is essentially programming. You create a text file in LaTeX markup, which LaTeX reads to produce the final document.

This approach has some disadvantages in comparison with a [[w:WYSIWYG|WYSIWYG]] (What You See Is What You Get) program such as [[w:Openoffice.org|Openoffice.org]] Writer or [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]].

In LaTeX:

* You don't (usually) see the final version of the document when editing it.
* You generally need to know the necessary commands for LaTeX markup.
* It can sometimes be difficult to obtain a certain look for the document.

On the other hand, there are certain advantages to the LaTeX approach:

* Document sources can be read with any text editor and understood, unlike the complex binary and [[w:XML|XML]] formats used with WYSIWYG programs.
* You can concentrate purely on the structure and contents of the document, not get caught up with superficial layout issues.
* You don't need to manually adjust fonts, text sizes, line heights, or text flow for readability, as LaTeX takes care of them automatically.
* In LaTeX the document structure is visible to the user, and can be easily copied to another document. In WYSIWYG applications it is often not obvious how a certain formatting was produced, and it might be impossible to copy it directly for use in another document.
* The layout, fonts, tables and so on are consistent throughout the document.
* Mathematical formulae can be easily typeset.
* Indexes, footnotes, citations and references are generated easily.
* Since the document source is plain text, tables, figures, equations, etc. can be generated programmatically with any language.
* You are forced to structure your documents correctly.

The LaTeX-like approach can be called [[w:WYSIWYM|WYSIWYM]], i.e. What You See Is What You Mean: you can't see what the final version will look like while typing. Instead you see the logical structure of the document. LaTeX takes care of the formatting for you.

The LaTeX document is a plain text file containing the content of the document, with additional markup.  When the source file is processed by the macro package, it can produce documents in several formats. LaTeX natively supports [[w:DVI file format|DVI]] and PDF, but by using other software you can easily create PostScript, PNG, JPEG, etc.

==Philosophy of use==
===Flexibility and modularity===

One of the most frustrating things beginners and even advanced users might encounter using LaTeX is the lack of flexibility regarding the document design and layout. If you want to design your document in a very specific way, you may have trouble accomplishing this. Keep in mind that LaTeX ''does'' the formatting for you, and mostly the right way. If it is not exactly what you desired, then the LaTeX way is at least not worse, if not better. One way to look at it is that LaTeX is a bundle of macros for TeX that aims to carry out everything regarding document formatting, so that the writer only needs to care about content. If you really want flexibility, use plain TeX instead.

One solution to this dilemma is to make use of the modular possibilities of LaTeX. You can build your own macros, or use macros developed by others. You are likely not the first person to face some particular formatting problem, and someone who encountered a similar problem before may have published their solution as a package.

[http://www.ctan.org/ CTAN] is a good place to find many resources regarding TeX and derivative packages. It is the first place where you should begin searching.

===Questions and documentation===

Besides internet resources being plentiful, the best documentation source remains the official manual for
every specific package, and the reference documentation, i.e. the ''TeXbook'' by D.&amp;nbsp;Knuth and ''LaTeX: A document preparation system'' by L.&amp;nbsp;Lamport.

Therefore before rushing on your favorite web search engine, we really urge you to have a look at the package documentation that causes troubles. This official documentation is most commonly installed along your TeX distribution, or may be found on [http://www.ctan.org/ CTAN].

==Terms regarding TeX==

;Document preparation systems:
LaTeX is a document preparation system based on TeX. So the system is the combination of the language and the macros.

;Distributions:
TeX distributions are collections of packages and programs (compilers, fonts, and macro packages) that enable you to typeset without having to manually fetch files and configure things. 

;Engines:
An engine is an executable that can turn your source code into a printable output format. The engine by itself only handles the syntax, it also needs to load fonts and macros to fully understand the source code and generate output properly. The engine will determine what kind of source code it can read, and what format it can output (usually DVI or PDF).

All in all, distributions are an easy way to install what you need to use the engines and the systems you want. Distributions usually target specific operating systems. You can use different systems on different engines, but sometimes there are restrictions.
Code written for TeX, LaTeX or ConTeXt are (mostly) not compatible.
Additionally, engine-specific code (like font for XeTeX) may not be compiled by every engine.

When searching for information on LaTeX, you might also stumble upon [[w:XeTeX|XeTeX]], [[w:ConTeXt|ConTeXt]], [[w:LuaTeX|LuaTeX]] or other names with a -TeX suffix.
Let's recap most of the terms in this table.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Systems
! Descriptions
|-
| ConTeXt || A TeX-based document preparation system (as LaTeX is) with a very consistent and easy syntax and support for pdfTeX, XeTeX and LuaTeX engines.
It does not have the same objective as LaTeX however.
|-
| LaTeX || A TeX-based document preparation system designed by Leslie Lamport. It is actually a set of macros for TeX. It aims at taking care of the formatting process.
|-
| MetaFont || A high-quality font system designed by Donald Knuth along TeX.
|-
| MetaPost || A descriptive vector graphics language based on MetaFont.
|-
| TeX || The original language designed by Donald Knuth.

!Engines
!Descriptions
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;luatex&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;lualatex&lt;/tt&gt; || A TeX engine with Lua scripting engine embedded aiming at making TeX internals more flexible.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;pdftex&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; || The engines (PDF compilers).
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;tex&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; || The engines (DVI compilers).
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;xetex&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;xelatex&lt;/tt&gt; || a TeX engine which uses Unicode and supports widely popular &lt;tt&gt;.ttf&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.otf&lt;/tt&gt; fonts. See [[LaTeX/Fonts|Fonts]].

|-
| MacTeX || A TeX Live based distribution targetting Mac OS X.
|-
| MiKTeX || A TeX distribution for Windows.
|-
| TeX Live || A cross-platform TeX distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Does anyone know which Guenther book this comes from: (my copy is flawed)

&quot;Kun-tu bzang-po, without ever having done the slightest good, has realized Buddhahood by recognizing the three facets of Being for what they are.  The sentient beings in the three realms, without ever having done any evil, roam about in Samsara by not having recognized the three facets for what they are.  They roam about in Samsara because they have failed to recognize reality to be open-dimensional, experience to be radiant, and responsiveness to be the unity of presence and openness.&quot;   MKha-gro snkying -thig    Translated by Herbert Guenther.

== Merger disccussion ==

Oppose. In Buddhism, particularly, practice and philosophy are distinguished. If someone wants to write a practice manual that is a great idea and we could bear several based upon different schools of thought in Buddhism. The same could be said for philosophy. We should not ever delude ourselves into thinking that any given topic can only support one single comprehensive wikibook when several would better match the variety of approaches and perspectives on a given topic. Let a thousand flowers bloom.[[User:Geofferybard|Geofferybard]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 23:43, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

== Small font makes this book unreadable ==

I can't read the font, I don't have glasses available and am not inclined to fiddle with my computer settings. Can we not have small font in any books on wikibooks? It is sure to drive our readers, and editors, away. IMO.

== Recent deletion. ==

Comparing revered spiritual figure to despised disease carrying pests? This should not be a controversial deletion. Imagine similar application to Abrahamic faiths....Would result in riots, etc. It is very POV to suggest that Buddhas are comparable in this manner I find it appalling that anyone would open the topic with that kind of rubbish. And it does not change things if one drums up some quote from some suitably &quot;foreign&quot; source...[[User:Policyharmonization|Policyharmonization]] ([[User talk:Policyharmonization|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Policyharmonization|contribs]]) 18:07, 6 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Procedures and functions|Preprocessor}}

C does not provide direct support for error handling (also known as exception handling).  By convention, the programmer is expected to prevent errors from occurring in the first place, and test return values from functions.  For example, -1 and NULL are used in several functions such as socket() (Unix socket programming) or malloc() respectively to indicate problems that the programmer should be aware about.  In a worst case scenario where there is an unavoidable error and no way to recover from it, a C programmer usually tries to log the error and &quot;gracefully&quot; terminate the program. 

There is an external variable called &quot;errno&quot;, accessible by the programs after including &lt;errno.h&gt; - that file comes from the definition of the possible errors that can occur in some Operating Systems (e.g. Linux - in this case, the definition is in include/asm-generic/errno.h) when programs ask for resources. Such variable indexes error descriptions accessible by the function 'strerror( errno )'. 

The following code tests the return value from the library function malloc to see if dynamic memory allocation completed properly:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;        /* fprintf */
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;        /* errno */
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;       /* malloc, free, exit */
#include &lt;string.h&gt;       /* strerror */

extern int errno;

int main( void )
{

    /* pointer to char, requesting dynamic allocation of 2,000,000,000
     * storage elements (declared as an integer constant of type
     * unsigned long int). (If your system has less than 2GB of memory
     * available, then this call to malloc will fail)
     */
    char *ptr = malloc( 2000000000UL );

    if ( ptr == NULL ){
        puts(&quot;malloc failed&quot;);
        puts(strerror(errno));
    }
    else
    {
        /* the rest of the code hereafter can assume that 2,000,000,000
         * chars were successfully allocated... 
         */
        free( ptr );
    }

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); /* exiting program */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The code snippet above shows the use of the return value of the library function malloc to check for errors.  Many library functions have return values that flag errors, and thus should be checked by the astute programmer.  In the snippet above, a NULL pointer returned from malloc signals an error in allocation, so the program exits.  In more complicated implementations, the program might try to handle the error and try to recover from the failed memory allocation.

== Preventing divide by zero errors ==

A common pitfall made by C programmers is not checking if a divisor is zero before a division command. The following code will produce a runtime error and in most cases, exit.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int dividend = 50;
int divisor = 0;
int quotient;

quotient = (dividend/divisor); /* This will produce a runtime error! */
&lt;/source&gt;

For reasons beyond the scope of this document, you must check or make sure that a divisor is never zero. Alternatively, for *nix processes, you can stop the OS from terminating your process by blocking the SIGFPE signal. 

The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* for fprintf and stderr */
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; /* for exit */
int main( void )
{
    int dividend = 50;
    int divisor = 0;
    int quotient;

    if (divisor == 0) {
        /* Example handling of this error. Writing a message to stderr, and
         * exiting with failure.
         */
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Division by zero! Aborting...\n&quot;);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE); /* indicate failure.*/
    }

    quotient = dividend / divisor;
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); /* indicate success.*/
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Signals ==

In some cases, the environment may respond to a programming error in C by raising a signal. Signals are events raised by the host environment or operating system to indicate that a specific error or critical event has occurred (e.g. a division by zero, interrupt, and so on.) However, these signals are not meant to be used as a means of error catching; they usually indicate a critical event that will interfere with normal program flow.  

To handle signals, a program needs to use the &lt;tt&gt;signal.h&lt;/tt&gt; header file.  A signal handler will need to be defined, and  the signal() function is then called to allow the given signal to be handled.  Some signals that are raised to an exception within your code (e.g. a division by zero) are unlikely to allow your program to recover.  These signal handlers will be required to instead ensure that some resources are properly cleaned up before the program terminates.

This example creates a signal handler and raises the signal:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

static void catch_function(int signal) {
    puts(&quot;Interactive attention signal caught.&quot;);
}

int main(void) {
    if (signal(SIGINT, catch_function) == SIG_ERR) {
        fputs(&quot;An error occurred while setting a signal handler.\n&quot;, stderr);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    puts(&quot;Raising the interactive attention signal.&quot;);
    if (raise(SIGINT) != 0) {
        fputs(&quot;Error raising the signal.\n&quot;, stderr);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    puts(&quot;Exiting.&quot;);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== setjmp ==
The [[C Programming/Coroutines#setjmp|setjmp]] function can be used to emulate the exception handling feature of other programming languages.  The first call to setjmp provides a reference point to returning to a given function, and is valid as long as the function containing setjmp() doesn't return or exit.  A call to longjmp causes the execution to return to the point of the associated setjmp call.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;

jmp_buf test1;

void tryjump()
{
    longjmp(test1, 3);
}

int main (void)
{
    if (setjmp(test1)==0) {
        printf (&quot;setjmp() returned 0.&quot;);
        tryjump();
    } else {
        printf (&quot;setjmp returned from a longjmp function call.&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The values of non-volatile variables may be corrupted when setjmp returns from a longjmp call. 

While setjmp() and longjmp() may be used for error handling, it is generally preferred to use the return value of a function to indicate an error, if possible.

      <comment>/* Topics for Mini-Research Papers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Both reading and writing are important skills for anyone who wants to do business in English. Here is a list of suggested writing topics.

== Topics for Mini-Research Papers ==
*MBTI / Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator 
*The Campbell-Stone Restoration Movement [http://www.worldconvention.org/nationalprofiles.php World Convention National Profile Pages]
*Peter Drucker
*The de Vinci Code
*Stephen Covey and the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
*Moore’s Law
*Different styles of leadership and leaders
*Rasputin
*Wal-Mart
*Nonverbal communication
*The origins of English
*Today’s weather in (you choose the location)
*Choose your own topic! 


Use the Internet or traditional printed materials to find information about your chosen topic. Write like a reporter or historiographer and remember the six w’s: who, what, when, where, why, and how. The length of the paper should reflect the complexity of the issue, your English fluency, and your time available. One to two typewritten pages is typically an appropriate length.

Include a bibliography citing the Internet pages that you used as reference. 

Use ONLY your own words, except for short, cited quotations. It is usually better to read about the subject, but the material aside, and write from your own memory. That is, don’t read your source material and write your essay at the same time.

== English Language and Grammar Topics ==
*Correct use of adjectives
*Present simple vs. present progressive (continuous) tense
*Using articles (a, an, the, …)
*When to use “what” and when to use “that”

The directions are the same as above. Include examples whenever possible.

I saw an article in a newspaper of yesterday requesting for readers to put comments on the passage.

The whole group was against my sister for not turning up to a meeting which was very important to her.

We had an accident on our way to Zomba.

What happened to your sister who is now in prison?

When is the next meeting taking place?

That place is not good for your health.

== Suggested writing topics ==
* Describe your line of work and your responsibilities.
* Write a history of your family.
* Tell about a favorite memory, perhaps a childhood memory.
* Describe the office or facilities where you work.
* Describe a system or process that you are familiar with in your work.
* Write a plan and analysis describing your goals in studying English.
* Write up a business plan for a business that you might think about starting.
* Write about something that you are passionate about.
* Describe a visit to an English-speaking area.
* Choose a topic and write about it for this [[Business English]] book. 
* Write about your favorite music, group, or artist.
* What important things have you accomplished in your life?
* What would you like to do when you retire?
* What do you regret doing or not doing?
* Read an article from the [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]] or other source and write a summary of it.

== Reading ==
You can get practice reading at many places. Some websites that you might like to visit are the [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]], [http://www.nytimes.com/ New York Times] (free and painless registration required, really, it's worth it), [http://www.economist.com/ The Economist], (a British newsmagazine), and various English magazines that may be available where you live.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So what is a template, in the first place? For our purpose, a template is an HTML-like document that defines the ''presentation'' of a web page, while a PHP script supplies the ''content''. The separation of content and presentation is at the heart of any [[w:GUI|GUI]] paradigm. To see why this is desirable, consider the following hypothetical, yet realistic script. It's a script to retrieve a list of books from the database and display it as a table with alternate colours for each row, or &quot;No books found&quot; if the list is empty.
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;
       &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;List of Books&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;

&lt;?php
$books = new Array();
$i = 0;

$database = open_database();
if (is_null($database)) {?&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Error opening database&lt;/h1&gt;
    Please contact the system administrator at alice@wonderland.com and report the problem.
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

&lt;?php
    exit();
}

$result = $database-&gt;query(&quot;SELECT ISBN, title, author FROM book&quot;);
while ($row = $result-&gt;retrieveAssoc()) {
    $books[] = $row;
}?&gt; 

    &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;?php
        if (count($books) == 0) {
            echo &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;No books found&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;;
        }
        else {
            foreach ($books as $book) {
                if ($i % 2 == 0) {
                    echo &quot;&lt;tr bgcolor='#EEEEEE'&gt;&quot;;
                } else {
                    echo &quot;&lt;tr bgcolor='#FFFFFF'&gt;&quot;;
                }
                $i++; ?&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $book['ISBN']; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $book['title']; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $book['author']; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;?php
            }
        }?&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You will find yourself writing this kind of script very soon. The problems with this script are obvious:

* This PHP page really is two pages, one for the error message and one for the normal display. Confusing.
* Even for the normal display part, the PHP script does two things: prepare the data and format it, e.g. alternate colour for each row.
* Look at how entangled the PHP and HTML codes are. Good indentation becomes practically impossible and that makes the code difficult to read.
* What if your boss now wants not a table, but a list instead? You will need to alter your PHP code for that.
* And now your boss wants a fancier error page that needs at least 300 lines of HTML, can you still tell where your first &quot;page&quot; ends and the second starts?
* You probably need to teach your graphics designer PHP if he wants to do any aesthetic make up to your page.

The list goes on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter focuses on creating and formatting web pages using Adobe GoLive


==Adding and Formatting Pages==
Pages can be created from within GoLive or added from without.  Any time you choose to add a page, image or other object to your site, do so by dragging these files into the site window.  This allows you to use the file in your site without effecting the original files and allows GoLive to keep track of and maintain your files/links.

===Creating a New Page===
While it is possible to create a page by selecting New Page (Ctrl +N) from the File menu, it is often more efficient to create each page as part of the site.  There are several ways to do this.

:# Make sure that the site window is open and the Files or Extras tab is selected.
:# Site &gt; New &gt; Page

:# Select a page from the Files tab in the site window.
:# Edit &gt; Duplicate

:* Drag a page onto the Files or Extras tab from the Objects palette.
:* In navigational view, follow the instructions above dragging the page next to any other page.

===Formatting Pages===
Aspects like backgrounds, margins and keywords (used for searches) can be added before or after the creation of the rest of the page.

====Page Titles====
The page title appears at the top of most browsers.
:* Select the page in the site window, then open the Page tab in the inspector.  Enter a new title in the Title text box.

:* Open the document window and click on the &quot;Title&quot; label at the top of the window.  Enter a new title.

====Page Margins==== 
Page margins determine how close the contents of a Web page come to the browser window.
:# Special &gt; Page Properties
:# Click Page tab.
:# Change Margin Width and Height.

:* To quickly remove page margins right click on page.  Select Document &gt; Set Page Margins to Zero.

====Window Size==== 
You can choose to set the page layout to a certain size to help design your page to that size.  The following will not actually effect the size of the browser window.  Use [[Java Script]] to change the size of the browser window.
:* In document view select a size from the Layout Dimensions menu in the bottom right hand corner of the window.

:* To change the size for all document windows, follow the instructions above and then open the Settings window from the Layout and Dimensions menu.  Check the box labeled Markup Document Windows.

==A==
'''ADD,ADHD or ADD/h'''
Most of the 10 symptoms of ADHD are similar to the symptoms of lack of omega-3 fatty acids or your body's ability to process it.
*Take Omega-3 fatty acids fish body oils (GNC has a a Brown Bottle of 360 pills for $20)  
*Second option is Flaxseed (it comes as a seed, or oil or a pill).
*Ginko Biloba
*Boron
*Caffeine, a stimulant, will work for many cases of ADHD in the same way Ritalin does. Many people with mild ADHD symptoms self-medicate with coffee, soft   drinks, tea, and other caffeinated drinks.

'''Alzheimers Prevention'''
#Increase your intake of Niacin from food sources as this may reduce the risk of getting Alzheimers according to a report in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. Good food sources are tomates, carrots, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, milk, chicken, broccoli, tuna and salmon. The recommended daily allowance is 14 mg a day for women and 16 mg a day for men.

==B==

'''Bad Breath'''

Some studies have shown eating yogurt, drinking green tea, or chewing cinnamon or sugarless cinnamon gum can also reduce bad breath.


Maintain water levels in the body by drinking several glasses of water a day. Adding lemon juice to your water is refreshing and also beneficial. Parsley is a natural breath freshener when chewed slowly, and is easy to grow at home.


Since a dry mouth can increase bacterial buildup and cause or worsen bad breath, chewing sugarless gum can help with the production of saliva, and thereby help to reduce bad breath.

Use Hydrogen Peroxide as your mouthwash. Use twice a day. Baking soda(gargle)and water with lemon juice(gargle)before bed.

==C==


'''Cough'''
#For a persistant cough use Hydrogen Peroxide as a mouthwash twice a day until symptom improves. Mix with equal amount of water, swish around in mouth for at least 1 minute, gargle and spit out. Use for up to 7 days. 

==D==

==E==

==F==

==G==

==H==

'''Hayfever'''
#Regularly eating ''local'' [[honey]] may reduce the symptoms of hayfever.
#Wear [[dark glasses]] outdoors.

'''Headaches'''
#Believe it or not, drinking a couple of cups (one big glass) of [[Gatorade]] helps cure headaches. Also, a cup of strong coffee with lemon juice added to it will expand your blood vessels. Drinking a large amount of water often helps, since it thins the blood and helps it pass through your body faster. Or, you could try crushing fresh thyme and inhaling the vapors.

'''Hiccups'''
#Take a teaspoon of white sugar.  Pour on lemon juice to soak it.  Eat it off the spoon.
#Take 3 deep breaths and on the last breath exhale until nothing at all comes out and at that time drink as much water as you can to the point where you feel like you are going to drown then keep going just a bit longer, its the drowning feeling the will rid you of the hiccups.
#Place a little bit of sugar on the back of your tongue. Hiccups.. gone. This works very well on kids and babies!

'''Headaches'''
#Peppermint-oil : drip one to 5 drops on the forehead while lying on your back, then run your fingers through your hair, starting from the place you dripped the oil and going up towards the top of the head, in a sort of gentle massage of the scalp. Doing this while closing your eyes and concentrating on the cold-warm effect of the oil on your skin will slowly &quot;evaporate&quot; the pain.

#Pressure: Place one thumb on your forehead between your eyes, place your other thumb on the indented spot at the back of your head, at the top your spine. Simultaniously apply pressure to both spots, holding for three seconds. Repeat this three times consecutively. This should activate pressure points to relieve the headache soon after.

===Stomach ache===
Many home remedy websites list remedies based on acid (such as lemon juice vinegar), but many stomach pain, especially when your stomach is empty, are caused by acid (http://www.mothernature.com/Library/Bookshelf/Books/48/193.cfm). Instead, taking bases such as calcium and baking soda will neutralize the acid.

Over-the-counter pain medication will dull the sensation of pain, but for stomachaches it is often faster, easier, and healthier to fix the cause of the problem.
===Sunburn===
quick relief from the symptoms of sunburn can be obtained through the application of shaving cream to the affected area.  in addition to a cooling sensation (best if the product used is methnolated) this remady also helps rehydrate the skin and promotes healing.

A good cure for sun burn is bio yogurt applied to the afflicted area. If the yogurt is taken straight from the fridge it also provides a cooling sensation.

Hydrogen Peroxide will take the sting out of the skin.

Add 1/4 spoon of freshly ground [[/pepper]], a pinch of [[/turmeric]] powder and 1 spoon of [[/sugar]] to a glass of [[/milk]]. Boil it well. Drink it when it is warm. This helps to subside cold, sore throat and heavy head.

==B==
Keep a [[peppermint]] [[toffee]] in mouth and ask your partner to have intercourse with you and let your partner be active. You will have immediate relief.

==C==
Drinking lots of [[water]] in the morning and then a [[green tea]] will subside the cold.

Chinese medicine has been relying on chicken soup to boost the immune system for a long time. Be sure to cook a soup from real chicken, though (not instant), because certain proteins from the chicken are only released into the soup if the chicken is really being boiled. Also, onions have an antibacterial effect, as well as garlic, so throw it in. Add carrots for taste and potatoes, noodles or rice for the more satisfying, stew-like thing. If you have digestive problems and suffering mild dehydration, drink slightly salty liquids like broth to rebalance your minerals.

==D==
Eat Every day a small leaf of [[Thulasi]] and you will be saying a Good bye for cold to run away from your life. It gives a permanent cure, try and enjoy the benefits.

==E==

==F==
FEVER
To reduce fever mix one part white vinegar with one part cool (not cold) water. Soak white cotton socks in solution, wring out and put on feet. Resoak when the socks warm up. Cools the blood at the point fartherest away from brain and heart.

Middle-Ear Infection

Chop a fresh onion, wrap the pieces in a piece of cloth and place the &quot;onion bag&quot; on the hurting ear. Maybe secure with a hat. It will give pain relief and the onion fumes will help drain the ear of mucus. Still, this is just a supplementary treatment to a doctor's attention, so please go see a doctor anyway. Untreated ear infections can cause severe scarring of the eardrums and lead to increasing deafness over time!

==N==

==O==
Four drops of Oil of Oregano under your tongue twice day will keep your cold away.  Great immune booster as well.

==P==

==Q==

==R==

==S==

==T==
Sore throat / tonsil infection

Suck on ice cubes or popsicles, preferably with low sugar so that you don't give the bacteria anything to really feast on. Avoid milk products (no ice cream!) and chocolate with nuts, the combination seems to make staphillococcus bacteria expand their population extremely fast. Do not smoke, as it will further irritate the tissue and dry it out, which might cause tiny tissue tears. Again, a visit to the doctor is not negotiable, you might need antibiotics.

==U==

==V==

Shot of Vodka with red or black pepper, or with honey, then into bed and under the blankets to sweat the sickness out throught the night.

'''Bug bites and other skin irritations''':  
Go out an gather a good amount of plantain, which is a weed on most peoples' lawns.  Put it in a crockpot and set the pot on low.  Cover with a good quality oil--coconut oil is best. Leave the lid off, and cook for about 24 hours.  Strain out the plantain and add enough beeswax to make it &quot;set up&quot;.  You will need to experiment with this, because everyone I know likes it a bit different.  You're aiming for a sloppy lip balm consistency.  This heals all my bug bites better than prescription $150 stuff, and has worked on skin infections and brown recluse spider bites and bouts of exzema.


'''Banana skin''' - fleshy side down - taped to the wart overnight.   If you have more than one wart the first wart to appear is usually the largest and the most uncomfortable - this is the one to treat. Within four days all warts disappear - you won't even notice them go!!

==C==

==D==
Covering a '''wart''' with [[duct tape]] is a very effective treatment. After a shower, scrub the wart well to remove dead skin. Cover it with duct tape as soon as the skin is dry enough for the tape to stick. Leave the tape on until your next shower. Duct tape is thought to work by causing irritation, which get the immune system to pay attention. Also, the adhesive pulls off some of the wart each time you change the tape (though it must be left on for a longish time to have this effect). After two weeks to a month of ''persistent'' taping, the wart should be gone.

The duct tape also helps by suffocating the tissues. The skin in the ares can't &quot;breathe&quot; so it starts to turn white and die, helping rid you of the wart.

You can also get rid of a wart by painting it with clear nailpolish. You may have to re-apply a couple times during the day if it flakes off, but it suffocates it. It has the same effect as the duct tape but a lot quicker resolution.

==E==
To remove warts, rub Castor Oil on the wart a minimum of 2x/day. My great grandmother taught me this as a child and it worked for me several times. After about 2-3 weeks of daily applications, the wart is gone. No pain, and a good solution.

==F==

==G==

==H==

To '''fight infection in a bite, scratch, cut or wound''' (especially if it has already become infected), peel a layer off a raw [[Plant Families/Onion|onion]], lay it directly on the wound and wrap it or tape it securely so it stays in place. You can cut and shape the onion to fit the size and shape of wound if you like and just hold it in place with a bandaid or masking tape. If it is in an awkward place like your foot or ankle, you can place a piece of plastic wrap over it to prevent odor, then wrap securely with strips of cloth or an elastic bandage so that it stays securely in place. Or you can just use the plastic wrap to do the wrapping. Put it on at bedtime and go to sleep. By morning the infection will be gone. I've raise five children and this was my number one home remedy. It never failed.

==J==

==K==

==L==

==M==
To help clear up '''acne''' or outbreaks of '''herpes''' or '''cold sores''', use plants of the [[menthe]] family, those being [[mint]]s and [[lemon balm]]. Drinking them (lemon balm is best) as tea improves the immune system and weakens the virus's ability to infect cells. Topical application of the same tea (you could just put the cooling tea bag onto the skin) is also effective. While no medicine will ever truly remove herpes, the symptoms can be controlled. 

'''A few warnings''', mint is a volatile herb. While most people will not have a problem, drinking too much of the tea can cause problems.  If you start to become windy (it also has a &quot;positive&quot; impact on digestion) then mint may be to blame. However, mint will only cause this if your diet is causing colonic sluggishness already.

==N==

==P==
Both as a remedy and prophylactic, use homeopathic ''[[Rhus Tox]].''

Tobacco is good for wasp stings.  Just wet it and find a way to keep it on the spot on which you were stung.  It takes the stinging away and some of the swelling. Or, cut a piece off a fresh onion and hold it to the spot of the sting. Works with bee stings as well.

Plantain leaf, which comes from a common lawn weed, can be of help in removing poisons. This plant has oval shaped leaves with veins running the length of the leaf. It has spiked flowers.
To use, simply chew the leaf and use the resulting mush as a poultice for bee stings, spider bites and even snake bites. You may want to put a bandage over the poultice to hold it in place. Change it twice daily or more often as needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Concept + Medium''' ==


The notion of artistic or creative process has been the subject of much debate and research [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity] as that of the nature of art itself. Some insist that creativity is by nature spontaneous, while others argue that undirected spontaneity is a random mess and that creativity consists of the original use of accomplished technique. This article will suggest an approach to process which can yield practical results in a context of self-evaluation.

All art consists of a concept embedded in a medium. The concept is what the artist wants to show to the audience. It may be an emotion, information, or (most often) some combination of the two. Representational art, which alludes to some real phenomenon - that is, something which is identifiable by a majority of people - may be said to have a subject. Abstract art may have a subject in the mind of the artist, but if this subject is not readily apprehensible by most viewers, either from the artwork itself or its title, then any imputation of subject is in the mind of the audience and will vary between individuals.

The medium is the mode of expression or communication used by the artist to convey the concept at hand. It may be concrete, as in the case of a painting or sculpture, or ephemeral, as in the case of a sound recording, motion picture, or book. Although copies of these latter works exist in physical form, they are not meant to be appreciated for their physical manifestation. Such ephemeral artworks are meant to be appreciated in the dimension of time rather than all at once in space. Motion pictures are the medium that currently come closest to presenting art in a spatial and temporal context simultaneously. 

Regardless of the medium employed, the creative process is essentially the same. Gross differences between artists in their methods of realizing an art work can generally be ascribed to the differing technical requirements of the medium. Thus the sculptor must shape clay or use a hammer and chisel to hit a lump of rock, while a photographer arranges a camera in a certain relationship to the subject of the photograph. These differences are superficial. We will now examine the unifying factors which are common to all works of art and the process of creating art.

First is a technical understanding of the medium. This consists of knowledge of the materials that the artist is working with and knowledge of how it may be manipulated to fit the conception of the artist. In the case of painting, this might include a knowledge of the behavior of different types of paint and the degree to which they can be intermixed, an appreciation of how paint transfers from a bush or other applicator to a canvas or other surface, a knowledge of how to blend different colors of paint together to obtain a new color, and so forth. Understanding of the medium is measured by the degree to which an artist can produce an arbitrary result on demand - for example, an understanding of color in oil painting would allow an expert to match the color of any given object by blending others.

Complete understanding of a medium is not necessary for the creation of art. Indeed, a full understanding of a medium does not equate to a capacity for creation. Such a full understanding may be available to the scientist or critic, but this only allows them to define the bounds of possibility for expression within the medium. It should be noted that such bounds can only be defined negatively: we cannot say what is the full range of shapes and textures available to the sculptor, but we can assert with confidence that the techniques of sculpture are not applicable to choreography. 

Some understanding of a medium is necessary for the production of art. In the simplest case, we can say that no drawing is possible until the would-be artist has grasped the idea of using an object to make a mark upon a surface. At the other extreme is the understanding of how to render any given effect on demand, as noted above. Staying with drawing, such a skill allows the artist to produce accurate renditions of arbitrarily complex subjects - for example, it takes great mastery of technique to make a drawing of a hand which is indistinguishable from a photograph.

In general, technique can be highly admired. However, it is regarded as being of less importance since the invention of machines which embody nothing but technique, such as cameras or automated musical software. Art which relies heavily on expression at the expense of technique is called 'naive'. Naiveté may be the result of a lack of training (such as Outsider Art [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art]), however the contemporary artist may deliberately make a statement about the unimportance of technique or choose to mimic the style and characteristics of the untrained (often imitating the work of children). At the opposite extreme, and quite rare, are those individuals known as ''idiots savants'', who can produce highly accurate reproductions of things seen or heard, but are quite unable to produce anything original from their imagination.

While understanding of a medium gives the artist the knowledge of how to produce something, expression is the ability to decide ''what'' to produce, and make choices about the manner of production. We can say that expression consists of having something to say to the audience; this may be a declaration of beauty, a declaration of affinity between two apparently dissimilar objects or phenomena, or a desire to give form to an abstraction and make a commentary thereon. 

Communication is equally important as expression. While many of the traditional arts (drawing, painting, sculpture) are expressive and emotional, contemporary society a multimedia visual culture. Many artists such as graphic designers, storytellers, and illustrators use the elements and principles of visual design to effectively convey the intended information. 

The elements and principles of visual art have been studied for many years, resulting in rules or standards for composition. These rules can be strictly applied, used as loose guides, or intentionally broken. Their goal is often to achieve balance, optimize impact, or more thoroughly communicate or express the concept. 

Thus, we can summarize the creative process as the application of an individual's concept to a medium which they have some skill in manipulating. For the ambitious artist, the task is to first find a medium in which they want to represent something, develop some level of skill in shaping that medium to represent simple things, and finally to choose something for representation which can be realized without too many distracting refinements of technique. The surer one is about ''how'' to do something, the more concentration can be applied towards the question of ''what'' to do, and the more natural and unobtrusive the medium will be in conveying the intended impression.

==Ingredients==

*10 oz - Plain white flour;
*6 oz - Wholemeal flour;
*1 3/4 level tsp - Bread soda;
*2 heaped dessert spoons - Wheat germ;
*1 level tsp - Salt;
*7/8 pint - Buttermilk.

==Procedure==

# Grease and flour an 8 inch round baking tin.
# Sift the white flour into a large mixing bowl.
# Add the other dry ingredients and mix thoroughly.
''A simple tip: Sift the flour and baking soda five times through a sieve. This ensures even mixing of the ingredients and gives a better result.''
# Make a well in the centre of the bowl, pour in some of the buttermilk and, with a wooden spoon, gradually mix the flour into the buttermilk. Alternatively, make a volcano shape on a marble slab with the dry ingredients, add the buttermilk and mix with a knife.
# Add more buttermilk and mix in more flour.  Continue until the flour is completely absorbed into the mix.  The mix should not be over saturated, but have a slightly stretchy look.
''Handle it as little as possible. You can also ball it up into one or two balls, place them on a flat baking tray, and cut a cross in the top.''
# Turn the mix into the baking tin and place in a medium hot oven (180 degrees Centigrade, 350 degrees F) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown.  
# Leave to cool on a wire tray.

Mayonnaise is a smooth savoury [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] made from [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] and the yolk of [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]. It is an emulsion in which the oil is dispersed in tiny droplets.
Egg yolk contains lecithin which prevents the oil and water from separating out. [[Cookbook:Mustard|Mustard]] is also a good emulsifier and is frequently added. [[Cookbook:Vinegar|Vinegar]], usually wine vinegar, or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] juice are added for flavour and because acidity is necessary for the emulsion to properly form. [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] is a frequent addition.
The [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] used is normally a flavourless type such as [[Cookbook:Sunflower Oil|sunflower oil]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn oil]], but you can substitute some for a stronger tasting oil such as [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. 

Mayonnaise is notoriously difficult for the beginner, as it often curdles, but easy once you have the knack. 

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolk]]
*2 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] (12.5 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and/or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1/2 teaspoons (2.5 mL) Dijon [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*1/4 teaspoons (1 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (180mL) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

==Procedure==
# In a large bowl, beat the egg yolk with a wire [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] for about a minute. 
# Then add the mustard, salt, and half the lemon juice. Whisk for another minute - the mixture should thicken very slightly.
# Then, very slowly, add half the oil with one hand whilst whisking with the other. 
# Start drop by drop, incorporating each drop before adding the next, and build up to a trickle.
# Keep going until the oil is whisked in.
# Add the rest of the lemon juice, whisk to combine.
# Add the rest of the oil in the same manner as before.
# Keep going until all the oil is whisked in. 

You can now stir flavourings such as crushed garlic into the finished mayonnaise, or use the mayonnaise as a base for other sauces.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* One can make the whisking process easier by using a kitchen towel.  Wet a kitchen towel, or any small towel, until it is very wet and heavy, but not dripping.  Coil the towel on top of a flat surface, such as the kitchen countertop or a table. Place the bowl onto the circle.  This will provide a steady base for the bowl and allow you to whisk with one hand while adding ingredients with the other.

* If the mayonnaise should curdle, it can be recovered by slowly dripping the curdled mayonnaise into another egg yolk while whisking vigorously all the time.

* ½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]] can be added for those with a sweet tooth.  Add with the salt at the beginning.

* It's easier to just use an immersion blender for the whisking. In case the mix curdles, you can put the curdled mix away, start with a new attempt and once you get the emulsion going, add the curdled mix just as you were adding oil.

* For special occasion, you can spice up this recipe by making Juanz mayonnaise. Just add about a handfull of finely chopped Cilantro and about half a tooth of crushed garlic. This is also known as Banana's Mayonnaise.

In the Motion Picture industry, screenplays are usually presented in a standardized format. This format has been developed over the years in the Hollywood studio system in order to approximate a rule of thumb of one script page equaling one minute of movie screen time. This &quot;Hollywood Standard&quot; format has become widely adapted and accepted worldwide due to the proliferation of screenwriting software such as Final Draft and Movie Magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
The main characteristics of this standard are:
* 3 holed Letter size 8.5&quot;x11&quot; paper (US and Canada) or [[w:A4 paper size|A4 paper format]] (rest of the world)
* Character names and Dialogue should be formatted to appear centered (see below)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Writers submitting their work to US based production companies are strongly advised to follow this standard as any deviation from it is often regarded as a sign of an amateur screenwriter. Many in the industry say they refuse to accept non-standard scripts but stories abound of writers with &quot;stunt submissions&quot; such as the one in 2004 at Cannes. Supposedly someone took a chance and printed their screenplay up like a paperback novel (bound with a fancy cover and everything) and even though the screenplay was no good the size was very popular (being less bulky than a conventional screenplay) and lots of people took copies and read them.  So some may conclude that sometimes breaking the rules works. However, as it was pointed out, the screenplay in this case was no good, so it once again reinforced the commonly held preconception that fancy stunt submissions are usually done by amateurs, whereas professionals follow the standard format.


== Formats ==
=== Screenplay ===

Although some writers utilize their own modifications on the standard screenplay format, there is a basis upon which all feature film screenplays are formated. 

The standard screenplay format is devised for simplicity of reading by many different departments in addition to roughly timing out to one minute of screen time for one page of script. 

Screenplays should be written in &lt;u&gt;'''twelve point Courier font'''&lt;/u&gt;. Twelve point Courier is an important component of the standard format for two reasons.  One is nostalgic (Courier font resembles the look of a page written on a mechanical typewriter), but the other reason is highly practical: Courier is a monospaced font meaning every glyph is the same width (as opposed to variable-width fonts, where the &quot;w&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are wider than most letters, and the &quot;i&quot; is narrower). With a monospaced font only a certain number of letters will fit on each row and each page, assuring uniformity of the format and achieving the one page per minute of screen time formula.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Final Draft, the popular screenwriting software has developed their own Courier font, Courier Final Draft. This font was designed to mimic a PC Courier font on Mac computers to achieve further uniformity between the platforms.  There are no differences between the glyphs of Courier and Courier Final Draft and the two fonts are interchangeable on those platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Utilizing any font other than twelve point Courier or Courier Final Draft will result in a screenplay that does not adhere to the standard format, does not approximate the one page per minute of screentime formula and therefore regarded as highly undesirable by producers. NOTE: The Courier New font alters the pitch of the typeface, taking up more space on the page and therefore altering the overall page count of a script document.  Courier New font is not recommended for screenwriters. 

Margins are generally set as such (spaces are assuming 12 point font at 72 spaces per line):
*Scene Number (if used) is 1.25 inches from the left edge or 13 &quot;spaces&quot; in
*Scene Heading 1.75 inches from the left edge or 19 spaces in 
*Action 1.75 inches from the left edge or 19 spaces in (cut off at 55 characters (including spaces) per line)
*Dialogue 2.75 inches from the left edge or 29 spaces in (cut off at 35 characters (including spaces) per line)
*Character name is centered on the page (about 43 spaces in)
*Parenthetical direction is 3.5 inches from the left or 36 spaces in (cut off at 16 characters (including spaces) per line)

Screenplays traditionally start with FADE IN in the upper left hand corner of the first page, immediately followed by the scene heading for the first location. 

'''SCENE HEADING (SLUG)'''
A scene heading always starts with a distinction whether the location of the scene is indoors or outdoors. INT. signifies an interior location whereas EXT. signifies an exterior location. These are always abbreviated and followed by a period and one blank space and then the name of the location where that scene takes place. Scene headings, also called slugs, are placed for each and every location in the screenplay, including all the various elements of a location. For example INT. OLD HOUSE LIVING ROOM might be followed by INT. OLD HOUSE KITCHEN if the characters or action moves to the kitchen.  It is not correct to have INT. OLD HOUSE and move characters from one room to the next within the same scene. Each room is treated as a separate location in the script because when the film is actually shot these sequences will most likely be shot out of order (all scenes in the kitchen will be shot together and all scenes in the living room will be shot together, possibly on different days) and, possibly, in completely different physical locations (the kitchen may be a practical location in an Old House, the living room might be built on a soundstage). Some writers like to put a hyphen between the main location and the sub location, IE: INT. OLD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM and INT. OLD HOUSE - KITCHEN, but this is not required. Following the location name is one or two hyphens (depending on writer's taste) and the time of day the scene takes place; DAY, NIGHT, DAWN, DUSK, EVENING or MOMENTS LATER, CONTINUOUS (if the scene is immediately after the following as in the characters walking from the living room to the kitchen in one conversation). After the Scene heading, there are two carriage returns (one blank space) and the ACTION begins. Scene headings are always in all capital letters.

'''ACTION'''
Action is the description of what is happening in the scene, IE: Mark walks into the living room from the kitchen and picks up his books. Action is always written in present tense (Mark walks, not Mark walked). Action is in non-indented paragraph/prose form and is the longest element on the page (spanning from the far left to the far right hand margins of the page). It is generally accepted that action should not be longer than 10 lines without a break. Action also describes the locations, as much as necessary. Action is always in traditional English upper/lowercase. There are two line breaks between the end of action and the name of a character speaking (one blank line between action and character name) or the beginning of a new scene (one blank line between the end of action and the scene heading for the next scene).

'''CHARACTER NAME'''
When dialogue is spoken, it is preceded by the name of the character speaking the dialogue. The Character Name is placed on its own line and centered on the page. It is always in capital letters. There are some modifiers that can be placed after the character name in parenthesis (separated by a single space). Voice Over (V.O.) IE: JOHN (V.O.) is dialogue that is presented on the film's audio track, but is not spoken by the character on screen. Voice Over can be a voice on a telephone or the sound of the character's own thoughts. Off Screen (O.S.) IE: JOHN (O.S.) is dialogue that is spoken by a character in or immediately near the physical location of the scene, but who is not visible on the screen in that shot or scene. This could be a character speaking from another room. There is only one line break after the character name before dialogue (no blank space).

'''DIALOGUE'''
Dialogue is the actual spoken words by the character. It is placed immediately under the centered character's name and indented considerably from the left hand side and slightly from the right to stand out on the page. Dialogue is presented in standard upper/lowercase text (ALL CAPS can signify extreme emphasis or SHOUTING). Underline and italics can be used for emphasis, but should be used sparingly. 

'''PARENTHETICAL DIRECTION'''
This is very brief (usually one or two words) of direction or clarification that is placed within a character's spoken dialogue. It is placed, indented from the dialogue, on a separate line and enclosed in parenthesis. Parenthetical direction is only specific to the speaking character (not to other characters in the scene) and should be extremely brief. It can indicate a parawr use, a direction of conversation to a different character in the scene, a notation on a specific emotion or intent in the following dialogue. Parentheticals are always in the middle of dialogue - dialogue never ends with a parenthetical direction. Parenthetical direction is usually written in all lowercase letters IE: (beat). After the dialogue ends, there are two line breaks (one blank space) between the next character name or action or a new scene heading.


Some standard format notes:
*The first time a character is introduced in action, their name is presented in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS to point out their introduction.
*Sound effects such as a phone RINGS or an alarm BEEPS are placed in all capital letters to point them out.
*Scene transitions such as DISSOLVE TO:, CUT TO:, FADE TO BLACK: are placed flush right, on their own line. They are placed at the end of a scene with one blank space before a new scene heading. Generally speaking, they should be used sparingly.

== Process ==
=== Draft Script ===
=== Locking the Script ===
As part of the pre-production process, the script is going to be accepted and locked. This provides the basis for keeping everyone on the same page. A locked script means that the page numbers do not change. Every copy of the script will have the same page 10 because it will never change. As new material is added, sub pages (&quot;a&quot; pages) are added (10a, 10b, 10c and so forth). If significant deletions are made as to eliminate all the material on a page, it remains in the script as a blank page merely with the word &quot;OMITTED&quot; on it. In addition to page numbers, scene numbers are also locked and treated the same. If a scene is cut from the script, its number remains and the slug reads &quot;OMITTED&quot;; added scenes are sometimes identified with capital letters 101A, 101B, 101C and so forth. Sometimes additional scenes are numbered as in 101-1, 101-2 or 101.1, 101.2. Numbering is somewhat preferred as the traditional system for identifying coverage on slates while shooting a movie is to designate each new shot with a letter. Scene 101 may be one page in the script, but the final scene may be made up of 15 different camera angles. On the set, these will be designated on the slate and in continuity notes as 101a, 101b, 101c and so forth, so it can be confusing to see scene 101Aa, 101Ab. Each assistant director or unit production manager has their own system for locking the script and each script supervisor has their own system for designating shots on set. It's up to that team to coordinate how these numbers will be implemented.

=== Rewrites ===
Throughout the production process the script may need to be modified or re-written. Scenes are added, moved, deleted, or changed. 

The location supervisor reports that the restaurant location will not be available. The director confers with the writers and decides that the scene can take place in a park instead. 

This means the casting director doesn't need to cast a waiter for the scene, but a hot dog vendor and a street entertainer will be required.

The scene has moved from indoors to outdoors, different lights/film may be required. The DoP will need to know this.

The costume designer no longer needs to dress 40 extras in evening dinner attire.

It's very important for everyone to be on the same page; changes are usually printed on different color pages. For example, if everyone else is carrying light-blue scripts, if you've got a pink script, then you've got a problem.

'''AWS''' is a complete framework to develop [[w:Web application|Web based applications]]. The main part of the framework is the embedded [[w:Web server|web server]]. This small yet powerful Web server can be embedded into your application so your application will be able to talk with a standard Web browser like [[w:Internet Explorer|Microsoft Internet Explorer]] or [[w:Firefox|Firefox]] for example. Around this Web server a lot of services have been developed.

AWS supports '''SOAP''' [[w:Web service|Web Services]].

'''Ligers''' and '''tigons''' are hybrids, the offspring of the pairing of a lion and a tiger.  '''Ligers''' have [[Wikijunior Big Cats/Lion|lion]] fathers and [[Wikijunior Big Cats/Tiger|tiger]] mothers.  They usually grow much larger than their parents, and female ligers (sometimes called ''ligresses'') can sometimes have babies.  '''Tigons''' (also called '''tiglons''') all have tiger fathers and lion mothers.  They are usually smaller than their parents. Lions are very social animals while tigers tend to be lonely and to live by themselves.  The offspring of a lion-tiger share the conflicting instincts of both parents.  Sometimes they seek out interaction with other big cats, but other times they will attack them.  So, they can be a danger if they are raised with other big cats.  In general, however, ligers are gentle, even-tempered and tolerant.

==Wild Ligers and Tigons have recently been found==
Breeding offspring of a lion and tiger requires human intervention, since the two species do not live near each other in the wild.  In the past, some zoos experimented with breeding lions and tigers with one another.  Due to conservation efforts, hybridization on purpose is not allowed in most zoos.  However, it happens regularly by accident, and some private breeders try to breed ligers for the purposes of creating something new and unusual.

Recently a wild Liger has allegedly been found in the far south of the Sahara Desert. Ligers were also allegedly found in the wild sometime between 1930's and the 1950s.  However, tigers have never evolved in Africa, and if true would have had to been the result of released captive tigresses.  Claims have been made for wild liger sightings in or near the Gir Forest in India in the past; today, there are no reliable reports of tigers within a hundred miles of the Gir Forest, making such a meeting extremely unlikely.

==Fascinating!==
[[Image:Tigon4.jpg|thumb|left]]Ligers are the largest of the Big Cats. They can weigh up to about 1500 pounds (680kg), and stand up to 13 feet (4 m) tall on their hind legs. Tigons are sometimes called dwarfs, tions and tilons; while they do not exhibit many signs of dwarfism, fully grown tigons of both sexes usually weigh less than 350 pounds (160 kg), which is small for male lions or tigers.

Both hybrids have a combination of lion and tiger physical characteristics.  However, the Ligers look more like their lion fathers with a hint of light striping on their backs and faces.  Tigons have more defined striping like their tiger fathers.  Like tigers, the striping pattern is unique to each individual animal.  Tigons can also have small manes or spots.

==Can they have offspring?==
It was originally assumed that ligers couldn't have babies, which is true for most hybrid species, such as the mule (a cross between a horse and a donkey).  However, females can have babies.  There are such things as li-ligers and li-tigons along with ti-ligers and ti-tigons &amp;mdash; these are mixes of ligers and tigons with lions and tigers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Back to [[Gambas]]

==What is Gambas ?==

'''Gambas''' is a programming language for Linux which attempts to mimic the ease of use of Visual Basic while improving on its functionality. Although Gambas is not source code compatible with Visual Basic, it is a BASIC  Interpreter with object-oriented extensions. 
This makes Gambas a good choice for Linux users who want to use their VB knowledge on a GNU basis. 

Gambas makes it very easy to build Linux GUI programs (the Gambas IDE is written in Gambas itself.) using the Qt toolkit. There is a Windows version of Gambas which barely runs under the Cygwin environment. Graphical applications do not yet work under the Windows version.

Developed in Paris by Benoît Minisini since 1999, Gambas is released under the GNU General Public Licence, the current version (July 29th 2009) being 2.15.2  Gambas is included in the Linux Professional Distribution from Novell.

'Gambas' is a backronym for '''GAMBAS Almost Means BASic''' (''Gambas'' is also the Spanish word for shrimp.)

==Why Gambas ?==

With Gambas you can easily:

*Build solutions for any environment using &quot;graphical application&quot; when you start a new project. This mode takes care of which Desktop environment the end user is going to use, and the program will automatically adapt to Gnome, KDE, etc. depending on the '''Current running Desktop environment'''.
*Build KDE applications with DCOP
*Translate your programs into other languages
*Offer Visual Basic programs under Linux
*Build network solutions
*Quickly design your program GUI with QT or GTK+ 
*Use databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird, ODBC and SQLite
*Create network applications easily
*Make 3D OpenGL applications
*Make CGI web applications, and so on...

==Citations==
*&quot;This project aims at making a graphical development environment based on a Basic interpreter, so that we have a language like Visual Basic under Linux.&quot;
*&quot;If you pass the responsibilty for the pc operating system only to one company , then this is just the same, as if you would sell the abc or the integers to this company.&quot;
*&quot;Still, this Qt-based software is one of the most advanced open source RAD tools available. It is nearly complete and very usable and stable. Benoit's goal is to avoid the development failures of Microsoft Visual Basic. The modern concept of Gambas is available as a graphic at the Web site http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html. Gambas is translated into many languages. To run Gambas applications you need the Gambas interpreter component installed on the user machine.&quot;
*Slashdot: Gambas 1.0 Release Candidate Available raindog2 writes &quot;After two and a half years of development, Gambas has become the first Visual Basic-style environment for Linux to enter release candidate status. Anyone who has been frustrated by a lack of production-quality free RAD environments should give it a try.&quot;

      <comment>/* The Cross Sum Program */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Back to [[Gambas]]

==The Cross Sum Program ==

This miniprogram calculates the cross sum of an integer. 
You need 2 textboxes and 1 commandbutton to get the program going. 

Please beware of the signs / and \ . In this program the sign \ is used for a division without a remainder. 

The Code 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
     DIM z AS Integer
     DIM crosssum AS Integer
     z = Val(TextBox1.Text)
     DO WHILE z &lt;&gt; 0 
       crosssum = crosssum + z MOD 10
       z= z \ 10 
     LOOP 
     TextBox2.Text = Str$(crosssum)
 END

==Addy The Sum Program ==

This miniprogram calculates the sum of a row of integers. 
You need 1 textarea, 1 textbox and 1 commandbutton to get the program going. 
You can also add negative integers. 
Very helpful is the Split command and the String array String[] 

'''The Code''' 
 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM text AS String
 DIM summe AS Float
 DIM Elt AS String[]
 DIM Sb AS String
 text = textarea1.Text
 Elt = Split(text,Chr(10))
 FOR EACH Sb IN Elt
  summe = summe + Val(sb)
 NEXT
 textbox1.Text = summe
 END

==The Average Program ==

This miniprogram calculates the average of a row of integers. 
You need 1.textarea, 2 textboxes and 1 commandbutton to get the program going. 

The Code 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM text AS String
 DIM summe AS Float
 DIM mw AS Float
 DIM varianz AS Float
 DIM sigma AS Float
 DIM Liste AS String[]
 DIM Einzelwert AS String
 text = textarea1.Text
 Liste = Split(text,Chr(10))
 FOR EACH Einzelwert IN Liste
  summe = summe + Val(Einzelwert)
 NEXT
 mw = summe / Liste.Length
 textbox1.Text = mw
 varianz = 0
 FOR EACH Einzelwert IN Liste
  varianz = varianz + ((Val(Einzelwert) - mw)^2)
  PRINT Einzelwert,mw,((Val(Einzelwert) - mw)^2)
  PRINT varianz
 NEXT
 varianz = varianz / (Liste.Length - 1)
 PRINT varianz
 sigma = Sqr(varianz)
 textbox2.Text = sigma
 END

==The Median ==

The Median of a list of values lies between two equal parts of the list. 50 % of the values ar greater or equal to the median. 50 % are smaler or equal to the median. In contrary to the average the median is not influenced that much by extreme values. 

If you want to program the median, you have to 
*1.sort your list of values
*2.check if the list has an even or an odd number of values.
*3.chooes the right formula for the median.
**for an odd number of values 
 xmedian = x[(n+1)/2]
**for an even number of values 
 xmedian = 1/2*(x[n/2] + x[n/2+1])

example 1: 

sorted list of values:
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15    
The number of values is odd. n = 5 
 (n+1)/2 =  6/2 = 3 
xmedian = x[3] = 13

example 2.

sorted list of values:
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
The number of values is even , n = 6 
 n/2 =  6/2 = 3 
 x[3] = 13
 x[4] = 14
 xmedian = 1/2*(13+14) = 13,5

You can take the list from above and copy it into the Gambas median program. Use the clipboard of your computer for that.  Ctrl+C = Copy , Ctrl + V = Paste 

example program

You need 2 textareas , 3 commandbuttons and 1 textbox, to get the program going:

 ' Gambas CLASS file
 liste AS String[]
 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
   ME.Text = &quot;Computate the Median &quot;
 END

      liste[j] = liste[j + 1]

   'the array starts with the element 0 not with the element 1 !
   ELSE
   'PRINT liste.Length MOD 2 &amp; &quot; even&quot;
   median = (Val(liste[liste.length/2 - 1]) + Val(liste[liste.length/2]))/2
   ENDIF

      <comment>/* The Spiral Program */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Back to [[Gambas]]

If you want to produce some graphics in gambas you should get used to the drawingarea control.

==Draw a Line==
This little program will draw a line.
You have to start a new graphics project. You take a form as your start form. 
You need a drawingarea and a commandbutton on the form to get it going.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Line(1, 130, 500, 400)
 Draw.End
 END

When you want to draw some more lines, then try this example:

 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
 DIM B AS Integer 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 FOR B = 1 TO 200 STEP 10 
  Draw.Line(1, B, 500, B)
 NEXT 
 Draw.End
 END

Some other lines are drawn here:

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM B AS Integer 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 ' Draws a line horizontally across the centre of the form
 Draw.Line (0, ME.Height / 2, ME.Width, ME.Height / 2)
 ' Draws a line vertically down the centre of the form
 Draw.Line (ME.Width / 2, 0,ME.Width / 2, ME.Height)
 ' Draws a line from the top left, to the bottom right
 Draw.Line (0, 0,ME.Width, ME.Height)
 ' Draws a line from the top right, to the bottom left
 Draw.Line (ME.Width, 0,0, ME.Height)
 Draw.End
 END

When you want to manipulate the '''width of your line''' , then try this example:

 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
 DIM B AS Integer 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Line(10,100, 20, 100)
      FOR B = 1 TO 100 STEP 10 
       Draw.LineWidth=B 
       Draw.Line(10+B,100, 20+B, 100)
      NEXT 
 Draw.End
 END

If you want to change '''the color of your line''' to white, then try this example:

 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.ForeColor = &amp;HFFFFFF
 Draw.Line(1, 130, 500, 400)
 Draw.End

The next small example will draw a box and '''fill it''' with white color.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
  Draw.FillColor = &amp;HFFFFFF
  draw.FillStyle = 1
  'draw.ForeColor = &amp;HFFFFFF the outline will be white also
  Draw.Rect (100, 100,200,200)
 Draw.End
 END

==The Spiral Program== 

This program shows you a nice spiral. 
There is no scale command in Gambas (at least, not yet). Therefore the x and y coordinates are transformed in the program. The coordinate system ranges from xmin = - 2 to xmax = 2 and ymin = - 2 to ymax = 2. 

You need a Drawingarea and a Commandbutton to get the example going. 

How does this look ? See [http://www.madeasy.de/7/prgspir.htm] 

The code: 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM dymax AS Integer
 DIM dymin AS Integer 
 DIM ymax AS Integer
 DIM ymin AS Integer
 DIM y AS Float
 DIM dy AS Float
 DIM dyi AS Integer
 DIM dxmax AS Integer
 DIM dxmin AS Integer 
 DIM xmax AS Integer
 DIM xmin AS Integer
 DIM x AS Float
 DIM dx AS Float
 DIM dxi AS Integer
 DIM k AS Float 
 DIM a AS Float 
 DIM w AS Float
 dymax = DrawingArea1.Height
 dymin = 0 
 ymax = 2
 ymin = -2
 dxmax = DrawingArea1.Width
 dxmin = 0 
 xmax = 2
 xmin = -2 
 'x-axis is drawn 
 FOR x = xmin TO xmax STEP 0.005
 y = 0 
 dy = CFloat(y - ymin) / (ymax - ymin ) * (dymax - dymin) + dymin 
 dx = CFloat(x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin ) * (dxmax - dxmin) + dxmin 
 dyi = Fix(dy)
 dxi = Fix(dx) 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Point(dxi,DrawingArea1.Height- dyi)
 Draw.End
 NEXT 
 'y - Axis is drawn
 FOR y = ymin TO ymax STEP 0.005
 x = 0 
 dy = CFloat(y - ymin) / (ymax - ymin ) * (dymax - dymin) + dymin 
 dx = CFloat(x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin ) * (dxmax - dxmin) + dxmin 
 dyi = Fix(dy)
 dxi = Fix(dx) 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Point(dxi,DrawingArea1.Height- dyi)
 Draw.End
 NEXT 
 'Here the spiral starts
 FOR k = -100 TO 150 STEP 0.5
 a = 0.97
 'Distance from 0,0 to the point 
 w = 0.15
 'Angle under whiche the point is seen from the origin
 a = a ^k 
 w = w * k 
 x = a * Cos(w)
 'x coordinate of each point
 y = a * Sin(w)
 'y coordinate of each point
 dy = CFloat(y - ymin) / (ymax - ymin ) * (dymax - dymin) + dymin 
 dx = CFloat(x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin ) * (dxmax - dxmin) + dxmin 
 dyi = Fix(dy)
 dxi = Fix(dx) 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Point(dxi,DrawingArea1.Height- dyi)
 Draw.End
 NEXT
 END

When I first started to program on a computer I used the Basic interpreter on the C64. Then I moved to MS Dos and GWBasic/Qbasic. The next step was Visual Basic 3. At the same time the Internet came into use. So I put all my mini VB programs on the Internet. This was very helpful for me and others.
After lots of bluescreens the divorce from MS was done in 2002. Linux and KDE were my new favourites and they still are.

But what I always missed was VB for Linux and KDE. My old brain could not get used to C++ or Java. 
At Christmas time in 2003 I discovered Gambas built by Mr. Minisini and friends. It was a hit from the beginning. 
So I started converting all my mini VB programs to Gambas. ( So called Minisinis) 

I think Gambas will be very successful. To promote it, I will put all my mini programs here under GNU as a wikibook.

Everyone is invited to improve my bad English and to improve this Wikibook.

==The Key Code Program ==

With this simple miniprogram you can check out the keycode of a button you have pressed. 
You only need a Form to get the program going. 
Once you started the program and you use a button on your keyboard, the keycode is printed in the terminal window. 

The Code 

 PUBLIC SUB Form_KeyRelease()
 PRINT key.code
 END 

==The Key Release Program ==

With this miniprogram you can check the arrow keys. When they are used and released a new information is shown. 

You need a textbox to get the program going. 

Once you started the program and you use an arrow key in the textbox, the content of the textbox will change. 

The Code 

 PUBLIC SUB TextBox1_KeyRelease()
 SELECT Key.code
  CASE Key.left
   Textbox1.Text =&quot;Left&quot;
  CASE Key.right
   Textbox1.Text =&quot;Right&quot;
  CASE Key.up
   Textbox1.Text =&quot;Up&quot;
  CASE Key.down
   Textbox1.Text =&quot;Down&quot;
 END SELECT
 END

==Input Restrictions==

If you want a textbox to accept  only digits you should use the command '''STOP EVENT'''.

Example 

You need a textbox on your form to get it going. 

 PUBLIC SUB MyTextBox_KeyPress()
   IF Instr(&quot;0123456789&quot;, Key.Text) = 0 THEN
    STOP EVENT
  ENDIF
 END SUB

Example2 

You can reach nearly  the same with the following code:

 PUBLIC SUB TextBox1_KeyPress()
    IF key.Code &gt;= 48 AND key.Code &lt;= 57 THEN 
    ELSE IF key.Code = key.BackSpace THEN 
    ELSE IF key.Code = key.Delete THEN 
    ELSE 
      STOP EVENT 
  ENDIF 
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
  ME.Text = &quot;Only digits accepted !&quot;
 END

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Mouse Coordinate Program ==

This program will show the coordinates of the mousepointer continuously in two textboxes, when the left mousebutton is pressed. 
You need a form with a drawingarea and two textboxes to get the program going. 
See how it looks like here: 
http://www.madeasy.de/7/prgmausxy1.htm

The upper left corner of the drawing area has the coordinates (0,0). The right lower corner has the coordinates (drawingArea1.width, drawingarea1.height ) 

The Code 

 PUBLIC SUB DrawingArea1_MouseMove()
 Textbox1.text = Mouse.X 
 Textbox2.text = Mouse.Y 
 END

You can simplify the program, when you work without the drawingarea. The code should look like this. 

 PUBLIC SUB Form1_MouseMove()
 Textbox1.text = Mouse.X 
 Textbox2.text = Mouse.Y 
 END

Try it out !

We can even get rid of the textboxes using the print command instead. Then the coordinates appear in the terminal window. 

The code should look like this. 

 PUBLIC SUB Form1_MouseMove()
 PRINT mouse.X 
 PRINT Mouse.Y 
 END

Try it out !

Be aware that the DrawingArea is the only control in Gambas ( at current version 2.n) that tracks mouse movement.
Other controls will only provide Mouse coordenates on the Mouse down event.
Additionally they have ENTER and LEAVE functions which provide the 'Mouse Over' functionality.

This program shows you the use of the clipboard in Gambas. 
You need 2 commandbuttons and 2 textareas to get the program going. 

The Code: 

 ' Gambas class file
 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 Clipboard.Copy (Textarea1.Text)
 'Copy Text into the Clipboard 
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Button2_Click()
 Textarea2.Text  = Clipboard.Paste ()
 'get the text out of the clipboard
 END

==Ingredients==
* 1 pint shucked large [[Cookbook:Oyster|oysters]], cleaned and dried
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* &amp;frac14; cup [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
* 2 cups fine [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]] or [[Cookbook:Cracker|cracker]] crumbs
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|Black pepper]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|Cayenne pepper]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|Vegetable oil]], to fry
Serves 4 as an entrée, or 8 as an appetizer

==Procedure==
# Take the cleaned oysters and place them on a clean towel and dry.
# Beat the eggs and cream together, and place in a shallow bowl. 
# Combine the bread or cracker crumbs with the salt, pepper, and cayenne. Place in a shallow bowl or on a plate
# With a fork dip each oyster individually in the egg and lay them on the cracker, and with the back of a spoon pat the cracker close to the oyster; lay them an a dish, and so continue until are done. 
# Heat the oil in a frying-pan, the amount of oil will vary with the cooking method used. [[Cookbook:Deep frying|Deep fry]], [[Cookbook:Pan frying|pan fry]], or [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] the oysters in the pan, but do not crowd them; cook in batches if needed. Fry quickly a light brown on both sides; a 1 or 2 minutes a side should be enough.  Serve hot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== C89 vs C99 ==

It's reasonable to mention single-line comments, which are supported by the C99 standard, but there isn't, as far as I know, a single compiler around that fully supports C99 yet. The majority of compilers in use are C89 and the C++ one-line comment is not part of that standard. Compilers that allow single-line comments through without warning usually do so as a courtesy, and if strict ANSI is enforced they will not be allowed (e.g. my gcc compiler will not allow them with the &lt;code&gt;-ansi&lt;/code&gt; flag). I would prefer the tutorial to adhere to one standard or another, say which one it is, and stick to it. If it's going to be C89 then I'd outlaw single-line comments in an effort ot encourage good practice. I would also not use &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; to indicate no arguments to main. C89 mandates the use of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; for that. -- [[User:Mickraus|Mickraus]] 23:29, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

::As of 2013 the majority of compiler implements C99, and virtually all of them implement single-line comments. Maybe that should be mentioned in the article, since C99 is not a &quot;very recent addition&quot; any more. Moreover I was quite surprised to see that for loop initial declarations are not used in this page, which is also a C99 feature available on many compilers and is in my opinion a lot better than the C89 style. (even Visual Studio 2013 will implement that). Is it okay if I modify the page with 
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
1  for(int i=0; i&lt;12; i++)
&lt;/code&gt;

instead of
 
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
1  int i;&lt;br /&gt;
2  for(i=0; i&lt;12; i++)
&lt;/code&gt;

? Or do you want to let it in a C89 style (but then why mention C99 comments?)? --[[User:Asteba|Asteba]] ([[User talk:Asteba|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Asteba|contribs]]) 22:11, 4 November 2013 (UTC)

== Indentation Wars ==

To indent with spaces or with tabs seems to be one of those issues that cause programmers to go to war with one another - much like the emacs vs vi battles or the OS battles.  I don't want to fan that fire, but having been a programmer for some 25 years now, I have adopted an indentation style that I believe strikes a fair compromise.  

The reason people support tabs is because then they can change the indentation from 4 to 2, or from 2 to 3, or to whatever they like.  The problem with tabs is that in a ''lot'' of cases, unless they have the same setting that the original programmer used, things go all whacky and nothing lines up.

The reason people support spaces over tabs is because it doesn't matter what the tab stops are set to, the code always looks the same.  I was in this camp for a long time.  The problem with spaces is that the person reading the code cannot easily change it to the way he likes it, and it makes for bigger files (though the latter argument is pretty weak in these days of terabyte hard drives).

Here's what I do.  I use tabs to indent to the level that the code needs to be indented, and then I use spaces to line things up.  Start with tabs, followed by lining up with spaces.  An example would be this chunk-o-code:
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;

  1  void foo(void)
  2  {
  3    int i;
  4
  5    for(i=0; i&lt;12; i++)
  6    {
  7      printf(&quot;This is a very long line of stuff to print out, because I'm printing a variable: 0x%x\n&quot;,
  8             some_struct[i].with.sub_elements;    
  9    }
 10  }
&lt;/code&gt;
Here, lines 3, 5, 6, and 9 would have a single leading tab, because they are indented one level.  Lines 7 and 8 would have two leading tabs, but line 8 would have 7 spaces following the two leading tabs.  The spaces are there to line up the second argument to the printf with the opening parenthesis of the printf.  If tabs were used for this, then the alignment would be dependent on the tab settings.  Here's the same code again, but I'm representing tabs with \t and spaces with @ signs:
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;

  1  void foo(void)
  2  {
  3  \tint i;
  4
  5  \tfor(i=0; i&lt;12; i++)
  6  \t{
  7  \t\tprintf(&quot;This is a very long line of stuff to print out, because I'm printing a variable: 0x%x\n&quot;,
  8  \t\t@@@@@@@some_struct[i].with.sub_elements;    
  9  \t}
 10  }
&lt;/code&gt;
No matter what the tabs stops are set to, line 8 will always align the arguments of the printf as desired.  In case anyone cares.  The problem with adding any indentation approach (including this one) ito a book like this is that it tends to excite religious pogroms.  Pogroms from programs so to speak. So I don't necessarily think this should be added to the chapter.  I just like to put it out there.

:: I'm not sure that the inability for a programmer to change the code indentation to the way he (or she) likes it is a reason to mix tabs and spaces. In-house styles are usually adopted so that code is easy to read and maintain. If a coder wants to change that to a personal preference that really is an issue s/he has to address. Tabs do not work. Try printing out code for review and prefixing each line with a line number, and see what happens to your tabbed code. Remember that editors that insert line numbers can separate the number from the code with a tab. Our company has forbidden the use of tabs ''unless'' the IDE is set to 4 spaces and 'insert spaces instead of tabs' is activated. This is not a whim. Far too much code was affected by tabs and experience has shown all coders abide by the rule because it works. [[User:Mickraus|Mickraus]] ([[User talk:Mickraus|talk]]) 18:15, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
::: Mixing tabs and spaces are acceptable within that context.  The main issue is that IDEs form their own context on whether or not a tab should exist, and make it difficult to switch between the two; if you want to see an example where incorrect tabbing can prevent compilation or proper execution, see either [[Python]] or Whitespace.  Also, if prefixing lines with line numbers messed up printing, then there's a problem with how you are adding line numbers.  These line numbers should be located within the margin, and should not disrupt the tabbing within the program.  --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 21:38, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
:::: The notion of a margin does not exist when printing source code as plain text. My coders simply tick a box 'Display line numbers' then print out the file. I'm not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;within that context&quot;. Within which context? [[User:Mickraus|Mickraus]] ([[User talk:Mickraus|talk]]) 22:49, 3 October 2009 (UTC)
::::: If you're printing as plaintext, then you're using default margins as decided by the printer, print driver or operating system. If the editor you are using prepends line numbers without manually managing either margins or tabs, you code will experience indentation issues. My IDE handles it perfectly, regardless of tab size and inclusion of line numbers; there may still be a setting that needs to be applies before printing (or a filter you could use that auto-converts tabs into the correct number of spaces.)  
::::: The context I was referring to was the example that showed mixing tabs and spaces for a person's in-house style to align parameters within a multi-line function call. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 23:35, 3 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] | [[Cookbook:Cake|Cake]]

This low-fat cake recipe is very common with unique variations.  The cake is simple to make and does not require you to start from scratch.  All the ingredients can be found at your local grocery stores.  

==Cake==
*  One box of yellow cake mix (approximately 1 lb. &amp; 2.25 ounces or 500 grams)
*  One 11 ounce (312 grams) can of mandarin oranges
*  Three medium size eggs

Preheat oven to 350 degree Fahrenheit (180°C).  If using non-stick baking pans, still need to grease sides and bottom with shortening and cover surface lightly with flour.  Pour yellow cake mix into mixing bowl.  Add eggs and mandarin oranges (including its juice).  Do not need to add oil, margarine, or butter.  Blend until moistened and beat for approximately 2 minutes at medium speed.  Pour mix evenly into baking pans.  Bake approximately 30 minutes or per cake mix instruction (inserted toothpick into center comes out clean).  Remove from oven and let the cakes cool.

==Icing==
*  One box of '''instant''' vanilla pudding mix (5.1 ounces or 144 grams)
*  One 20 ounce (567 grams) can of crushed pineapples
*  One 12 ounce (340 grams) container of CoolWhip, found in the frozen section

Scoop CoolWhip into a clean mixing bowl.  Add the instant vanilla pudding mix.  Drain all the pineapple juice from the can of crushed pineapples and fold into CoolWhip.  Mix all the ingredients evenly, do not use a blender.  For better results, chill icing for about 30 minutes.

After the cake cools, frost each layer with your icing.  Each serving is approximately 275 calories with about 4 to 5 grams of fat.  Like everything else, moderation is always best.

Manufactured by Microchip, the PIC (&quot;Programmable Intelligent Computer&quot; or &quot;Peripheral Interface Controller&quot; ) microcontroller is popular among engineers and hobbyists alike. PIC microcontrollers come in a variety of &quot;flavors&quot;, each with different components and capabilities.

Many types of electronic projects can be constructed easily with the PIC family of microprocessors, among them clocks, very simple video games, robots, servo controllers, and many more. The PIC is a very general purpose microcontroller that can come with many different options, for very reasonable prices.

Other microprocessors in this family include the [[w:Parallax SX|Parallax SX]], the [http://www.holtek.com/ Holtek HT48FxxE Series], and some &quot;PIC-on-a-FPGA&quot; implementations.

== History ==

General Instruments produced a chip called the PIC1650, described as a Programmable Intelligent Computer. This chip is the mother of all PIC chips&lt;s&gt;, functionally close to the current 16C54&lt;/s&gt;. It was intended as a peripheral for their CP1600 microprocessor. Maybe that is why most people think PIC stands for Peripheral Interface Controller. Microchip has never used PIC as an abbreviation, just as PIC. And recently Microchip has started calling its PICs microcontrollers PICmicro MCU's.

== Which PIC to Use==

How do you find a PIC that is right for you out of nearly 2000 different models of PIC microcontrollers?

The Microchip website has an excellent [http://www.microchip.com/productselector/MCUProductSelector.html Product Selector Tool].  You simply enter your minimum requirements and optionally desired requirements, and the resulting part numbers are displayed with the basic features listed.

You can buy your PIC processors directly from [http://www.microchipdirect.com/ Microchip Direct], Microchip's online store.  Pricing is the same or sometimes better than many distributors.

Rule Number 1: only pick a microprocessor you can actually obtain. PICs are all similar, and therefore you don't need to be too picky about which model to use.

If there is only 1 kind of PIC available in your school storeroom, use it.
If you order from a company such as [http://www.newark.com Newark] or [http://digikey.com DigiKey] , ignore any part that is &quot;out of stock&quot; -- only order parts that are &quot;in stock&quot;. This will save you lots of time in creating your project.

=== Recommended &quot;first PIC&quot; ===

At one time, the PIC16F84 was far and away the best PIC for hobbyists.
But Microchip, Parallax, and Holtek are now manufacturing many chips that are even better and often even cheaper, because of the higher level of production.


#''I'd like a list of the top 4 or so PIC recommendations, and *why* they were recommended, so that when better/cheaper chips become available, it's easy to confirm and add them to the list.''



(Summarizing [http://techref.massmind.org/techref/piclist/begin.htm  PICList Beginners checklist for PIC Microcontrollers], [http://amqrp.org/elmer160/lessons/index.html PIC Elmer 160: Appendix &quot;A&quot;:  &quot;Other PICs&quot; 2003], and [http://www.voti.nl/swp/n_index.html Wouter van Ooijen] :)

PIC: Select a chip and [http://techref.massmind.org/techref/supplies.htm buy one].

Many people recommend the following PICs as a good choice for the &quot;first PIC&quot; for a hobbyist, take in count the revision numbers (like the A in 16F628A):

* '''PIC18F4620''': it has 13 analog inputs -- Wouter van Ooijen recommends that hobbyists use the largest and most capable chip available[http://www.voti.nl/swp/n_index.html], and this is it (as of 2006-01). ~$9
* &lt;s&gt;'''PIC16F877A''' -- the largest chip of the 16F87x family; has 8 analog inputs -- recommended by Wouter (#2); AmQRP; PICList. ~$8&lt;/s&gt;
*'''PIC16F877A''' , this is probably the most popular PIC used by the hobbyist community that is still under production. This is the best PIC of its family and used to be &quot;the PIC&quot; for bigger hobbyist projects, along with the PIC16F84 for smaller ones. Features 14KB of program memory, 368 bytes of RAM, a 40 pin package, 2 CPP modules, 8 ADC channels capable of 10-bit each. It also counts with the UART and MSSP, which is a SSP capable of being  ''master'', controlling any devices connected to the I2c and SPI busses. The lack of internal oscillator, as opposed to the other PICs mentioned until now, is something to be aware of. Also, this PIC is relatively expensive for the features included. This may be caused by Microchip to force the migration to better chips. --recommended by Ivaneduardo747; Wouter (#2); AmQRP --[http://www.sparkfun.com/products/226]. ~$9
* &lt;s&gt;'''PIC16F88''' -- has 7 analog inputs -- recommended by AmQRP; [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/present.php?p=PIC%20Boot%20Loader SparkFun]. ~$5&lt;/s&gt;
*'''PIC16F88''', this is enhanced version of the PIC16F628A. It has all the features of the 16F628, plus twice the program memory, 7KB; seven 10-bit ADCs, a SSP (Synchronous Serial Port), capable of receiving messages sent over I2C and SPI busses. It also supports self-programming, a feature used by some development boards to avoid the need of using a programmer, saving the cost of buying a programmer.  --recommended by Ivaneduardo747; AmQRP -- [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/present.php?p=PIC%20Boot%20Loader SparkFun]. ~$5
* &lt;s&gt;'''PIC16F628''' -- Cheaper than the PIC16F84A, with a built-in 4MHz clock and a UART, but lacks any analog inputs -- recommended by Wouter (#3); AmQRP  --  ~$4&lt;/s&gt;
*'''PIC16F628A''', this is a good starter PIC because of its compatibility with what used to be one of the hobbyist's favorite PICs: the PIC16F84. This way, the beginner can select from a vast catalog of projects and programs, specially when created in low level languages like the PIC Assembler. It features a 18 pin package, 3.5KB of Flash Memory, can execute up to 5 million instructions per second (MIPS) using a 20MHZ crystal. The lack of an Analog-Digital Converter (ADC) is something to point out. As opposed to the PIC16F84A it has an UART, which is capable of generating and receiving RS-232 signals, which is very useful for debugging. Some people use to find ironic that this chip is cheaper than the less-featured PIC16F84A. -- recommended by Ivaneduardo747; Wouter (#3) AmQRP -- ~$5
* '''PIC16F1936''', a powerful mid-range PIC, comes with an 11 channel, 10-bit ADC; two indirect pointer registers; XLP (extreme low power) for low power consumption on battery powered devices. -- recommended by some people on the PIClist as a faster, better, cheaper replacement for the 16F877. -- ~$3
*'''PIC12F683''', a small 8-pin microcontroller. It is a good microcontroller for small applications due to its small size and relatively high power and diverse features, like 4 ADC channels and internal 4MHZ oscillator. --recommended by Ivaneduardo747; [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/215]. ~$2.50

''Of the many new parts Microchip has introduced since 2003, are any of them significantly better for hobbyists in some way than these chips ?''
''Todo: Does [http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/442/starting-out-pic-programming &quot;Starting out PIC Programming: What would be a good PIC chip to start out with?&quot;] have any useful recommendations to add to the above?''

There are several different &quot;families&quot;:

=== More selection tips ===

* The &quot;F&quot; Suffix implies that the chip has reprogrammable Flash memory.
  PIC10F -- in super-tiny 6 pin packages
  PIC12F -- in tiny 8-pin packages
  PIC14F
  PIC16F 
  PIC18F
  PIC24F
  PIC24E
  PIC24H
  dsPIC30F
  dsPIC33F
  dsPIC33E
 
* The &quot;C&quot; suffix implies that the chip uses EPROM memory. A few of these chips used to be erased with a very expensive Ultra-Violet eraser. This method was primarily used by companies. But most of these chips are specifically made so that once you write it you can't change it: it's OTP (one-time programmable). People used to check their programs minutely before programming them into such chips.   Recently, this chips are becoming less used as the cost of Flash memory decreases, but some of them are still used because of their reliability or reduced costs.
  PIC12C
  PIC16C
  PIC17C
  PIC18C

Each family has one &quot;full&quot; member with all the goodies and a subset of variant members that lack one thing or another. For example, on the 16F84 family, the 16F84 was the fully featured PIC, with Flash memory and twice the program space of the 16F83. The family was also composed by the 16C84 and 16C83, one of the few reprogrammable C suffix PICs.
For prototyping, we generally use the &quot;full&quot; version to make sure we can get the prototype working ''at all''.
During prototyping we want to tweak code, reprogram, and test, over and over until it works. So we use one of the above &quot;Flash&quot; families, not the &quot;OTP&quot; families, unless required. For short production, the C parts are recommended. For very long production lines some PICs with mask-programmed ROMs where used. Now in-factory preprogramming is available from Microchip.

Each member of each family generally comes in several different packages. Hobbyists generally use the plastic dual inline package (often called DIP or PDIP) because it's the easiest to stick in a [[Practical Electronics/Breadboard | solderless breadboard]] and tinker with. (The &quot;wide-DIP&quot; works just as well). They avoid using ceramic dual inline package (CDIP), not because ceramic is bad (it's just as easy to plug into a solderless breadboard), but because the plastic parts work just as well and are much cheaper.

(Later, for mass production, we may figure out which is the cheapest cut-down version that just barely has enough goodies to work, and comes in the cheapest package that has just barely enough pins for this particular application &lt;s&gt;... perhaps even a OTP chip&lt;/s&gt;).

And then each different package, for each member of each family, comes in both a &quot;commercial temperature range&quot; and a &quot;industrial temperature range&quot;.

=== PIC 16x ===

The PIC 16 family is considered to be a good, general purpose family of PICs. PIC 16s generally have 3 output ports to work with. Here are some models in this family that were once common:
&lt;s&gt;
#PIC 16C54 - The original PIC model, the 'C54 is available in an 18 pin DIP, with 12 I/O pins.
#PIC 16C55 - available in a 28-pin DIP package, with 20 available I/O pins
#PIC 16C56 - Same form-factor as the 'C54, but more features
#PIC 16C57 - same form-factor as the 'C55, but more features
#PIC 16C71 - has 4 available ADC, which are mapped to the same pins as Port A (dual-use pins).
#PIC 16C84 - has the ability to erase and reprogram in-circuit EEPROMs
&lt;/s&gt;
Many programs written for the PIC16x family are available for free on the Internet.

Flash-based chips such as the PIC16F88 are far more convenient to develop on, and can run code written for the above chips with little or no changes.

=== PIC 12x ===

The PIC12x series is the smallest series with 8 pins and up to 6 available I/O pins. These are used when space and/or cost is a factor.

=== PIC 18x ===

The PIC 18x series are available in a 28 and 40-pin DIP package. They have more ports, more ADC, etc... PIC 18s are generally considered to be very high-end microcontrollers, and are even sometimes called full-fledged CPUs.

Microchip is currently (as of 2007) producing 6 Flash microcontrollers with a USB interface. All are in the PIC18Fx family. (The 28 pin PIC18F2450, PIC18F2455, PIC18F2550; and the 40/44 pin PIC18F4450, PIC18F4455, PIC18F4550 ).

== The PIC Stack ==

The PIC stack is a dedicated bank of registers (separate from programmer-accessible registers) that can only be used to store return addresses during a function call (or interrupt).

* 12 bit: A PIC microcontroller with a 12 bit core (the first generation of PIC microcontrollers) ( including most PIC10, some PIC12, a few PIC16 ) only has 2 registers in its hardware stack. Subroutines in a 12-bit PIC program may only be nested ''2 deep'', before the stack overflows, and data is lost. People who program 12 bit PICs spend a lot of effort working around this limitation. (These people are forced to rely heavily on techniques that avoid using the hardware stack. For example, macros, state machines, and software stacks).

* 14 bit: A PIC microcontroller with a 14 bit core (most PIC16) has 8 registers in the hardware stack. This makes function calls much easier to use, even though people who program them should be aware of some remaining gotchas [http://massmind.org/techref/microchip/pages.htm].

* 16 bit: A PIC microcontroller with a 16 bit core (all PIC18) has a &quot;31-level deep&quot; hardware stack depth. This is more than deep enough for most programs people write.

Many algorithms involving pushing data to, then later pulling data from, some sort of stack.
People who program such algorithms on the PIC must use a separate software stack for data (reminiscent of [[Forth]]). (People who use other microprocessors often share a single stack for both subroutine return addresses and this &quot;stack data&quot;).

Call-tree analysis can be used to find the deepest possible subroutine nesting used by a program. (Unless the program uses [[w:recursion]]).
As long as the deepest possible nesting of the &quot;main&quot; program, plus the deepest possible nesting of the interrupt routines, give a total sum less than the size of the stack of the microcontroller it runs on, then everything works fine.
Some compilers automatically do such call-tree analysis, and if the hardware stack is insufficient, the compiler automatically switches over to using a &quot;software stack&quot;.
Assembly-language programmers are forced to do such analysis by hand.

== What else do you need ==

=== Compilers, Assemblers ===

Versions of BASIC, C, Forth, and a few other programming languages are available for PICmicros.
See [[Embedded Systems/PIC Programming]].

=== downloaders ===

You need a device called a &quot;downloader&quot; to transfer compiled programs from your PC and burn them into the microcontroller.
(Unfortunately &quot;programming&quot; has 2 meanings -- see [[Embedded_Systems/Terminology#programming]]).)

There are 2 styles of downloaders.
If you have your PIC in your system and you want to change the software,
* with a &quot;IC programmer&quot; style device, you must pull out the PIC, plug it into the &quot;IC programmer&quot;, reprogram, then put the PIC back in your system.
* with a &quot;in circuit programmer&quot; style device (ICSP), you don't touch the PIC itself -- you plug a cable from the programmer directly into a header that you have (hopefully) placed next to the PIC, reprogram, then unplug the cable.

An (incomplete) list of programmers includes:

* [http://www.bobtech.ro/proiecte/microcontrolere/2-bobprog-programator-icsp-pentru-microcontrolere-pic BobProg] - Simple ICSP programmer with external power supply [http://www.bobtech.ro/proiecte/microcontrolere/2-bobprog-programator-icsp-pentru-microcontrolere-pic]
* [http://www.bobtech.ro/proiecte/microcontrolere/2-bobprog-programator-icsp-pentru-microcontrolere-pic JDM Programmer] modified for LVP micrcontrollers [http://www.bobtech.ro/proiecte/microcontrolere/42-jdm-programator-pentru-microcontrolere-pic]
* In Circuit Programmer for PIC16F84 [http://www.ubasics.com/adam/pic/icp84.html PIC16F84 Programmer]
* IC Programmer [http://www.ic-prog.com/ ICProg] Programs : 12Cxx, 16Cxxx, 16Fxx, 16F87x, 18Fxxx, 16F7x, 24Cxx, 93Cxx, 90Sxxx, 59Cxx, 89Cx051, 89S53, 250x0, PIC, AVR , 80C51 etc.
* Many other programmers are listed at [http://massmind.org/techref/microchip/devprogs.htm MassMind].

Many people prefer to use a &quot;bootloader&quot; for programming whenever possible.
Bootloaders are covered in detail in chapter
[[../Bootloaders and Bootsectors/]]
.

=== Power Supply ===

The most important part of any electronic circuit is the power supply. The PIC programmer requires a +5 volt and a +13 volt regulated power supply. The need for two power supplies is due to the different programming algorithms:
* High Power Programming Mode - In this mode, we enter the programming mode of the PIC by driving the RB7(Data) and RB6(CLOCK) pins of the PIC low while driving the MCLR pin from 0 to VCC(+13v).
* Low Power Programming Mode - This alogrithm requires only +5v for the programming operation. In this algorithm, we drive RB3(PGM) from VDD to GND to enter the programming mode and then set MCLR to VDD(+5v).

This is already taken care of inside the PIC burner hardware.
If you are curious as to how this is done, you might want to look at the various PIC burner hardware schematics online.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pin Diagrams ===

=== Oscillator Circuits ===

The PIC microcontrollers all have built-in RC oscillator circuits available, although they are slow, and have high granularity. External oscillator circuits may be applied as well, up to a maximum frequency of 20MHz. PIC instructions require 4 clock cycles for each machine instruction cycle, and therefore can run at a maximum effective rate of 5MHz.
However, certain PICs have a PLL (phase locked loop) multiplier built in. The user can enable the Times 4 multiplier, thus yielding a virtual oscillator frequency of 4 X External Oscillator. For example, with a maximum allowable oscillator of 16MHz, the virtual oscillator runs at 64MHz. Thus, the PIC will perform 64 / 4 = 16 MIPS (million instructions per second).
Certain pics also have built-in oscillators, usually 4Mhz for precisely 1MIPS, or a low-power imprecise 48kHz.  This frees up to two I/O pins for other purposes.  The pins can also be used to produce a frequency if you want to synchronize other hardware to the same clock as one PIC's internal one.

      <comment>/* Fatty Acids */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Lipids are a structuraly diverse class of biological molecules whose defining properties are hydrophobicity and solubility in organic solvents. Lipids have several roles including energy storage and cell signalling and are the major constituent of cell membranes.


===Fatty Acids===
A fatty acid is simple a linear carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group at one end.

Fatty acids usually have between 10 and 24 carbon atoms and may have one or more double bonds. These double bonds are almost always in the cis configuration. 

Fatty acids have both common names and systematic names. The systematic name is based on the alkane or alkene with the same number of carbon atoms, with the final ''e'' of the hydrocarbon replaced with ''oic acid''.  For example Laurate (Figure x) [[Image:Laurate.png]] is a fatty acid with 12 carbon atoms and no double bonds, so the systematic name is dodecanoic acid, and the ionized form is dodecanoate. 
(saturated fatty acid table)
If there are double bonds, the location is marked with the symbol &amp;Delta; with a superscript number indicating the location of the double bond and preceded by ''cis'' or ''trans'' to indicate configuration (but almost invariably ''cis''). Carbon atoms are counted from the carboxyl end, as in Figure x, so a dodecenoate acid with a cis double bond between carbon atoms 9 and 10 would be: ''cis''-&amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-dodecenoate.

The number 2, 3 and last carbon atom are called the &amp;alpha;, &amp;beta; and &amp;omega; atoms, respectively.

===Phosphoglycerides And Sphingolipids===
Fatty acids can be linked to glycerol to form monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerides and triacylglycerides.

One class of phospholipids are the phosphoglycerides, which are made from diacylglycerides linked to a phosphate group. Phosphoglycerides usually have the following arrangement:
* Hydroxyl #1 of glycerol is usually esterified to a saturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #2 of glycerol is usually esterified to an unsaturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #3 of glycerol is esterified to a phosphate group
[[Image:Phospholipid.svg]] 
There are four common phosphate groups. Serine, ethanolamine and choline are structuraly similar, while inositol is different:
[[Image:Cholinemet.png]]
[[File:Inositol monochrome.svg]]

'''Sphingolipids''', have the same overall shape as phosphoglycerides but have different chemistry, using sphingosine in place of glycerol. Sphingosine has a long hydrocarbon tail similar to fatty acids attached to a structure that is similar to the amino acid serine. A fatty acid can attach to the amine group, and a &quot;head&quot; group can attach to a hydroxyl (see Figure x). Sphingolipids are named according to this head group:
* If there is no head group it is called a ceramide
* If the head group is phosphate and choline, it is called sphingomyelin
* If the head group is a sugar, it is called a glycosphingolipid (or a glycolipid)

The majority of sphingolipids are of the third type, glycosphingolipids. It is thought they have functions in cell recognition and protection in addition to there structural role in the membrane.

When mixed in water, phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids will form two chararistics structures. '''Micelles''' are spheres constructed from these lipids, with the hydrophobic tails interacting with one another inside the sphere and the polar head groups interacting with water at the surface of the sphere. These lipids will also for whats known as a '''lipid bilayers''. These are sheets composed of two layers of lipids where the hydrophobic tails stick into the center and the polar head groups are on the surface interacting with water. Cell membranes are composed of lipid bilayers.

      <comment>re-categorization for Subject: pages</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I recommend developing this book as a high school (American ages 14-18) geometry text. To aid in doing so, I have developed an outline of topics reflecting the [http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ California curriculum content standards], as the [[Wikibooks:Textbook_Standards|wikibooks &quot;standards&quot; link]] suggests. I have placed that outline in the &quot;outline&quot; link below. I hope to start developing this table of contents to reflect that outline. The remainder of the table of contents (starting with &quot;Part I- Euclidean Geometry:&quot;) is a year old or more (though some of its content is newer). I think it will be difficult to develop that table of contents into a textbook, first because it covers topics from elementary school to graduate school and beyond, second because it seems to lack the logical structure necessary to produce a systematic development of the subject (but perhaps I'm simply too ignorant of geometry to see the structure the previous editor had in mind). Of course part of the point of wiki is that you can do whatever you like with these suggestions, so feel free to ignore me.

[[User:271828|271828]] 20:46, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I've put in a short list of chapters (1-5) below following the scheme of the outline in the outline link below and divided from the earlier chapter/subject markings. I hope to begin filling in those chapters soon.

[[User:271828|271828]] 18:43, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I've expanded the introduction below to reflect the content of the outline. If you are kind enough to consider contributing to this text, I hope you will glance at the introduction to see the scheme I have laid out for this book. Of course you do not have to honor it, but every book needs an organizational principle; and I think mine is at least plausible, if not nearly perfect.

Also I suggest a modification of the standard wiki naming convention for the internal links in this text. I propose the hierarchy be literally as follows:

*Geometry:
*Geometry: Chapter 1
*Geometry: Chapter 1: Section 1
*Geometry: Chapter 1: Section 2
*...
*Geometry: Chapter 2
*Geometry: Chapter 2: Section 1
*etc.

The point is that this makes it easy to link each section to the next and each chapter to the next. You can write a link &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Geometry: Chapter 1: Section 2]],&lt;/nowiki&gt; without having to worry that the link name will change, even though the content may change dramatically. At the very least, please remember that every page must start with Geometry: so that pages in this text don't replace pages in other texts.

[[Image:Teaspoon.jpg|right|thumb|120px|A teaspoon for eating]]

A '''teaspoon''' is a unit of volume measure equal to 1/3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]]. It is exactly equal to 5 mL. In the USA there are 16 teaspoons in 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]], and there are 6 teaspoons in 1 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounce]].

&quot;'''Teaspoon'''&quot; may be abbreviated as '''t''' (note: lowercase letter t) or '''tsp'''.

A small spoon, as might be used for eating yogurt from a small container or adding sugar to tea, is about 1 teaspoon in size.

A '''tablespoon''' is a unit of measure equal to 1/16 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]], 3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]], or 1/2 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounce]] in the USA. It is either approximately or (in some countries) exactly equal to 15 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]].

&quot;'''Tablespoon'''&quot; may be abbreviated as '''T''' (note: uppercase letter), '''tbl''', '''tbs''' or '''tbsp'''.

A typical large dinner spoon is about 1 tablespoon in size. It is not often the case, but some might consider the dinner spoon as the one used towards a normal bowl of soup or cereal. At any rate, it is not to be confused with a regular spoon for the amount of 1 tablespoon is a bit larger than a regular one.

The seldom-used imperial (post-1824 British) tablespoon is defined to be 18 mL, which is 20% larger than the Queen Anne tablespoon used in the USA. Thus, the Queen Anne (USA) tablespoon is 5/6 the size of the British one. The Australian (metric) tablespoon is even bigger, at 20 mL, while the teaspoon remains at 5 mL to give 4 teaspoons per tablespoon instead of the 3 teaspoons used elsewhere.

[[Image:Simple Measuring Cup.jpg|thumb|A simple measuring cup]]
A '''cup''' is a unit of volume measurement of volume equal to 16 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]], ½ [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]], ¼ [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]], or 8 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounces]].

A US cup is about 237 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]. Rougher equivalents are 240 mL and 250 mL, where the latter fits nicely with a US pint of 500 mL and a pound of 500 g.

A '''metric cup''' is 250 mL in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada|Canada]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|UK]]. These countries previously used the imperial system, in which a cup would be 284 mL or 6/5 US cups.

A [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] rice cup is 180 ml. A measuring cup of this size is sometimes included with rice cookers.

A '''teacup''', often seen as a unit of measurement in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] recipes, is about 190 mL, or ⅔ of an imperial (UK) cup.

==Membranes And Lipids==
All cells, from simple prokaryotic bacteria to complex multicellular organisms are surrounded by a '''membrane'''. The membrane acts as a selective barrier, letting some substances into the cell and preventing other substances from entering. The membrane also actively transports substances between the inside and outside of the cell, using cellular energy to do so. This is important in regulating the concentration of many substances which must be maintained within strict limits. The cell also contains membrane bound compartments, where the membrane acts as a barrier for the separation of different environments, like lysosomes which have a high pH that would be toxic to the rest of the cell. This chapter is about the chemical composition of the membrane and how this creates the functionality of the membrane.

==The Lipid Bilayer==
The first person to link lipids with the cell membrane may have been Charles Ernest Overton, who was studying heredity in plants. Part of his studies involved studying which substances absorbed into plant cells most quickly. After characterizing a large number of substances, he came up with the idea that cell membranes were composed of something similar to the lipids found in vegetable oils, and that substances are absorbed into the cells by dissolving through the membrane.

The next big step came when Gorter and Grendel extracted the lipids from red blood cells and compared the surface area of the lipids spread out on water compared to the surface area of the red blood cells. They found the lipid surface area was twice that of the red blood cells, and concluded that the lipids must be arranged in a layer two lipid molecules thick. This is what biologists now call the '''lipid bilayer''', and to understand the construction of the bilayer, we need to understand the lipids themselves.



===Fatty Acids===
A fatty acid is simply a linear carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group at one end.

Fatty acids usually have between 14 and 24 carbon atoms and may have one or more double bonds. These double bonds are almost always in the cis configuration. 
[[Image:Arachidonate.png]]
Fatty acids have both common names and systematic names. The systematic name is based on the alkane or alkene with the same number of carbon atoms, with the final ''e'' of the hydrocarbon replaced with ''oic acid''.  For example Laurate (Figure x) [[Image:Laurate.png]] is a fatty acid with 12 carbon atoms and no double bonds, so the systematic name is dodecanoic acid, and the ionized form is dodecanoate. 
(saturated fatty acid table)
If there are double bonds, the location is marked with the symbol &amp;Delta; with a superscript number indicating the location of the double bond and preceded by ''cis'' or ''trans'' to indicate configuration (but almost invariably ''cis'' in natural fatty acids). Carbon atoms are counted from the carboxyl end, as in Figure x, so a dodecenoate acid with a cis double bond between carbon atoms 9 and 10 would be: ''cis''-&amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-dodecenoate.

The number 2, 3 and last carbon atom are called the &amp;alpha;, &amp;beta; and &amp;omega; atoms, respectively. 


One common shorthand for describing fatty acids is based on the fact that multiple double bonds are placed three bonds apart. This allows the acid to be described by the length of its carbon chain, number of double bonds, and location of the final double bond, relative to the &amp;omega; carbon.
Under this system, for instance, Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA),a very important constituent of membranes in the brain and eyes, can by listed as 22:6 &amp;omega;-3.
This corresponds to:
22 carbons and 6 double bonds,of which the final double bond is at &amp;omega;-3.
This is equivalent to 22:6 &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19&lt;/sup&gt;, or, in its full IUPAC form, cis-docosa - 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 - hexaenoic acid.

===Phosphoglycerides===
Phosphoglycerides are composed of a glycerol back bone with substituents in the following arrangements:
* Hydroxyl #1 of glycerol is usually esterified to a saturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #2 of glycerol is usually esterified to an unsaturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #3 of glycerol is esterified to a phosphate group
[[Image:Phospholipid.svg]] 
The simplest phosphoglyceride is phosphatidate (picture). Other phosphoglycerides can be made when a group with a hydroxyl is esterified to the phosphate group of phosphatidate. There are four common substituents for phosphatidate. Serine, ethanolamine and choline are structurally similar, while inositol is different:
[[Image:Cholinemet.png]]
[[File:Inositol monochrome.svg]]

When the fatty acid esterified to hydroxyl #2 is a cis- configured polyunsaturated fatty acid (i.e. one with more than one double bond), it tends to curl, and thus prevents the molecules from packing so closely together in a membrane. This makes the membrane more flexible.

===Sphingolipids===
''Sphingolipids''', have the same overall shape as phosphoglycerides but have different chemistry, using sphingosine in place of glycerol. Sphingosine has a long hydrocarbon tail similar to fatty acids attached to a structure that is similar to the amino acid serine. A fatty acid can attach to the amine group, and a &quot;head&quot; group can attach to a hydroxyl (see Figure x). Sphingolipids are named according to this head group:
* If there is no head group it is called a ceramide
* If the head group is phosphate and choline, it is called sphingomyelin
* If the head group is a sugar, it is called a glycosphingolipid (or a glycolipid)

The majority of sphingolipids are of the third type, glycosphingolipids. It is thought they have functions in cell recognition and protection in addition to their structural role in the membrane.


Sphingolipids are known to regulate activity in cells, such as immune responses, production of cells, and development of specialized cells. Although these are under the spatial and temporal control, it was recently discovered that sphingosine kinases will be focused on therapeutic effects on enzymes for people with cancer and other conditions.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Sphingolipids general structures.png|General structures of sphingolipids
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Formation Of The Bilayer===
If we compare the structures of phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids, we see that they are very similar compounds. Each lipid has two long hydrophobic hydrocarbon &quot;tails&quot; and a single polar &quot;head&quot;. Since the molecule has both polar and nonpolar moieties, it is said to be '''amphipathic'''.  It is the amphipathic nature of these molecules that causes them to form bilayers, mediated by four forces:
* The hydrophobic effect- this causes the hydrophobic tails to come together. This is the strongest force driving the formation of the bilayer. It is a consequence of the increased entropy in water molecules when non polar substances are aggregated in water.
* Van der Walls forces between the hydrophobic tails.
* Electrostatic forces of the head groups. 
* Hydrogen bonds between the head groups.

One possible structure that satisfies the above forces is called a '''micelle''' (pictures). This is common with free fatty acids, but not with most phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids because these groups have twice as many acyl chains per head than the fatty acid (picture), and it is difficult to pack them all into the center of the micelle. Phospholipids and sphingolipids more often form a bilayer in a sheet or a sphere (picture). This is the so called lipid bilayer.

===Lipid Motion===
====Studying Motion====
NMR, ESR, X-Ray, Differential scanning calorimetry

FRAP is a good way to measure diffusion of receptors through a lipid membrane after tagging the protein of interest with a GFP construct

====Intramolecular Motion====
There are three basic kinds of motion within the lipid molecules: stretching between bonds, rotating between bonds, and wagging between bonds (?). [picture] 99% of motion within liquid crystal is due to rotation about carbon-carbon bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids rotate more often. This is because of the packed arrangement of the lipid bilayer. When there is rotation about one bond, an adjacent bond rotates to compensate for steric clashes [pictures]. Since double bonds in fatty acids are nearly always cis, they introduce kinks in the fatty acid. When a bond adjacent to a double bond rotates, the other bond adjacent to the double bond also rotates, and the whole thing moves like an old fashioned bit and brace [pictures]. It takes more energy to rotate the double bonds closer to the head groups due to [angle thing picture]. Double bonds react with O2 readily and create poisons [more] bacteria have [cyclopropane picture].

====Types of Membrane Protein Diffusion====
Rotational

Lateral

Liquid crystal

Flip Flop

==Plasma Membrane Function==
===Barrier===
Interior of cell is separated from surrounding environment.
to keep undesirable substances out
keep desirable substances in 
intracellulat membranes:act to compartmentalize functions within eukaryotic cells(ex:mitochondria,chloroplast)

===Transport Regulation===
The lipid membrane is impermeable to many essential nutrients to the cell, such as glucose. In order to get the proper nutrients into the cell protein transporters are constantly moving through the membrane. For the example of glucose, there are several isoforms of the glucose transporter, some of which are specific for only certain types of cells. One of the more interesting transporter is the water transporter: aquaporins. Even though water can get through the membrane, at times the cells needs more water then can be provided through diffusion.

===Cell Communication===
Gap junctions are channels found between cells that allow for the cytoplasm to exchange between the cells. This is how very fast signalling can occur by cells close together.

=== Cell Adhesion===
Several classes of proteins are responsible for cells sticking together: Cadherins

      <text xml:space="preserve">== how many types ==

Regarding types, how complete do we want these tables to be?  There are a few dozen types defined in the standard library, as well as the new boolean and complex types.  If no one objects, I'll add _Bool and the _Complexes, but none of the rest. --[[User:Jcl|jcl]] 19:03, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== size in bits ==

This page is dreadful for teaching C. Beginning programmers can and will make awful assumptions if they are not told which assumptions are reasonable. While a C compiler with a 42-bit char could be standards conforming, such a compiler would be a very sick joke. Instead of leaving newbies to make awful assumptions like &quot;long is always 32 bits&quot;, we can say that &quot;long is 32 bits or 64 bits, equal in size to a pointer on non-Windows systems, and always 32 bits on Windows systems&quot;. We need not mention anything related to ones-complement or sign-magnitude integers. We need not mention that signed integer wrap-around can cause program termination. (but unsigned won't!) No beginner is going to give a damn about a system that doesn't have a 16-bit short, 32-bit int, and 64-bit long long. Long before even considering the topic of largely theoretical screwball systems, one should discuss the concepts of endianness and natural alignment. This is required for sharing data structures between different systems. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:17, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

: I agree that this page is dreadful and needs many improvements.
: However, I don't think telling newbies or anyone else that &quot;long&quot; is &quot;equal in size to a pointer&quot; is ever a good idea.
: It's not true for Windows -- see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384242(VS.85).aspx Microsoft Developer Network: &quot;Rules for Using Pointers&quot;].
: It's also not true for many non-Windows system -- see [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/V/vaxocentrism.html vaxocentrism]; [[Wikipedia:Intel 8086#Segmentation]] mentions various &quot;memory models&quot; with different size pointers -- some of them even have two different size pointers -- which implies that at least one of them was different in size than a long int; &quot;[In Linux] In particular, on the Itanium, a function pointer is 128 bits, a data pointer is 64 bits, a long is 64 bits and an int is 32 bits.&quot;-- Peter Chubb[http://kerneltrap.org/node/242]; and &quot;wherever pointers are cast to integral types. This practice, which has been condemned for years as inimical to portability&quot; -- [http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/porting-to-64-bit-intel-architecture/ &quot;Porting to 64-Bit Intel® Architecture&quot;]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 18:34, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

== increment and decrement ==

Regarding (pre|post)(inc|dec)rement, (++ and --), are they really on the same level whether pre or post?  K&amp;R1 (1=1st ed.) shows ++ and -- in its
operator precedence chart on the same level, but does not state whether they are pre or post.  But what makes most sense to me is that post++ would
be RIGHT-TO-LEFT associativity and --pre would be LEFT-TO-RIGHT associativity.  I wonder if there was a change between K&amp;R1, or if K&amp;R1 is in error,
and what effect ANSI-C had.  I don't have K&amp;R2 (why buy the same book twice?), so I don't know whether there was a change to the precedence chart.
K&amp;R1 also didn't have unary minus, but most compilers nowadays do it anyway--another ANSIism? --[[User:Snt|Snt]] ([[User talk:Snt|talk]]) 01:52, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

: I don't understand. Could you give an example line of code where changing the associativity of predecrement would make any difference? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 18:41, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

==GB Components==

Components are Gambas plug-ins that add new functionality to your applications (by adding new classes to the interpreter).

A Gambas project has a list of components to be loaded at startup; you can find and modify this list by selecting Project &gt; Properties from the Project window, and clicking the Components tab.

A Gambas project without any components is a simple text-only application. To become a true graphical application, a project must use at least the gb.qt component. To access a database, use the gb.db component. And so forth... 

*gb - Gambas internal native classes 
*gb.compress - Compression library 
*gb.db - Database access component 
*gb.debug - Gambas application debugger helper 
*gb.eval - Gambas expression evaluator 
*gb.gtk - Graphical GTK+ toolkit component 
*gb.net - Networking component 
*gb.net.curl - Network high-level protocols management 
*gb.pcre - Perl-compatible Regular Expression Matching 
*gb.qt - Graphical QT toolkit component 
*gb.qt.editor - Gambas editor with syntax highlighting 
*gb.qt.ext - Graphical QT toolkit extension component 
*gb.qt.kde - KDE integration and scripting

*gb.xml.libxml.rpc - XML-RPC client based on libxml and libcurl 
*gb.xml.libxml.xslt - XSLT tools based on libxslt 

===Add some new components===
You can load new components using by going to the main Project window and selecting Project &gt; Properties.

Now, choosing the Components tab, you'll find a selectable list of the Gambas components. 
Tick the ones you want, untick the ones you don't.

You'll also be shown a hint with the name of the additional controls e.g.: QT when you load gb.qt.ext.

==Introduction==

A grid has rows and columns. They have width and height. 
You can fill a grid with text, numbers or even a picture.

==Example 1==

You need a new form to get the program going. On this form you place a gridview , which you can find in your toolbox.
There should be a picture x.png in your directory. Otherwise it wont be shown. There wont be an error message, when it is not found.

 STATIC PUBLIC SUB Main()
  hForm AS Fmain
  hForm = NEW Fmain
  hForm.show
 END
 PUBLIC SUB _new()
  GridView1.Columns.Count = 4
  GridView1.Rows.Count = 3
  GridView1.Columns.Width = 52
  GridView1.Rows[1].Height = 52
  GridView1[0,0].Text = &quot;0,0&quot;
  GridView1[0,0].Alignment = 4
  GridView1[1,1].Text = &quot;1,1&quot;
  GridView1[0,1].Text = &quot;0,1&quot;
  GridView1[1,0].Picture = Picture[&quot;x.png&quot;]
 END

==Create a Grid without the Toolbox ==

The grid ist creatable. How it is done shows the little example.

 g AS Gridview 
 PUBLIC SUB _New()
 g = NEW Gridview(ME) AS &quot;Gridview1&quot;
 g.show
 g.Columns.Count = 4
 g.Rows.Count = 3
 g.Columns.Width = 52
 g.Rows[1].Height = 52
 END

You just need a empty form to get the program going.

==Fill the grid with some values==

You have a list of values and you want to have them in a grid.
The example shows you a solution. Still not very nice and with some German words in it.

You need the following controls:
*1 Textarea
*1 Gridview
*2 Commandbuttons

The code 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 textarea1.Text = &quot;114&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;135&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;104&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;118&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;125&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;121&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;122&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;96&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;118&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;120&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;112&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;127&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;122&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;128&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;120&quot;
 END
 PUBLIC SUB _new()
  GridView1.Columns.Count = 2
  GridView1.Rows.Count = 15
  GridView1.Columns.Width = 72
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Button2_Click()
 DIM text AS String
 DIM Liste AS String[]
 DIM Einzelwert AS String
 DIM x AS Integer
 x = 0
 text = textarea1.Text
 Liste = Split(text,Chr(10))
 FOR EACH Einzelwert IN Liste
  GridView1[x,1].Text = Einzelwert
  GridView1[x,0].Text = x
  x = x + 1
 NEXT
 PRINT liste.Length
 END

When you push button1, then the textarea is filled with values.
When you push button2, they will be placed in the grid.

You can improve this program if you want. It looks a little newbee like.

==Standard Dialogs==

They make your coding easier.

In the following example you will use standard dialogues choosing  Standarddialoge für die Wahl 
*the font
*the colour 
*the file name 
*the file path

You need 1 textarea and 3 commandbuttons, to get the program going.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
  IF Dialog.SelectFont() THEN RETURN
  Textarea1.Font = Dialog.Font
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Button2_Click()
  IF Dialog.SelectColor() THEN RETURN
  Textarea1.BackColor = Dialog.Color
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Button3_Click()
 Dialog.SaveFile() 
 File.Save(Dialog.Path, TextArea1.Text)
 CATCH 
 IF ERROR THEN RETURN
 END

# Add water and simmer till meat is tender. Stir occasionally to prevent meat from sticking to pot. Add more water if gravy is too thick and season accordingly. 
# Add carrots and cook for 5 minutes.
# Add potatoes and cook till soft. 
# Add tomato and biscuit crumbs. If you like, you may add a tin of Spam luncheon meat, cut into thick slices or chicken franks at this step. 
# Garnish with coriander leaves.

== Overclocking AND UNDERCLOCKING? ==
I noticed that there was nothing about Underclocking in the Overclocking section - not everybody wants to overclock, as some of you should know. I think it would be appropiate to add some stuff about underclocking (which, if I'm correct, is basically overclocking with a few different steps in - nevertheless, someone might get confused, etc.) 

Also, if we do decide to put more information about underclocking a CPU in the same section as Overclocking, should we change the title of that section to &quot;Overclocking/Underclocking&quot;? --[[User:Aurora98|Aurora98]] ([[User talk:Aurora98|talk]]) 03:00, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

== About the merge ==

Ok, but why the book main page threatens with merge suggestion message? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

: The [[Computer Hardware]] book may have a bit more to offer than the [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]] for computer harware but How To Assemble A Desktop PC is better overall.  The merger is to move Computer Hardware into this book and not the other way round. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 19:05, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
:: It makes no sense to merge this article with computer hardware. The two subjects are completely different. Building a desktop computer deals with only internal hardware, not external hardware. It would cause confusion to put a subject completely about internal hardware and assembly into an article that deals with both internal and external hardware.
::: I don't think that they should put computer hardware into this because it is not really about learning all about hardware, it is about learning how to build a computer and it might get you off track and thinking about something else. &lt;u&gt;Studyfreak101&lt;/u&gt;
:::: The merge proposal is from August 2006, nearly coming on 3 years ago now. If hasn't happened yet I think its safe to say it isn't going to happen now. Besides it makes zero sense, there scopes and audiences are entirely different. I'm going to remove the merger tags now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:23, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

== Image copyrights ==
Should we ask Mark Headrick for permission to copy his pictures and instructions ?
Mark Headrick
http://www.abbeyclock.com/computer.html

:I'm not sure what contry he is in, but in America, anything is copyrighted once it is made. So we must ask him if we want to use it.

:Those pictures would make a nice addition to this guide, so I don't see why it would hurt to ask him. Howerver, when I make a computer this summer, I plan on talking plenty of pictures. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 06:28, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

This is almost featured book!--[[User:Kozuch|Kozuch]] ([[User talk:Kozuch|talk]]) 23:24, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

:Only if you want to hold it up as an example of bad writing and bad editing. I examined a few sections on component selection and made some edits.  The style, syntax, punctuation and grammar are just plain awful.  There are serious errors in terminology and unexplained use of jargon and acronyms.  Some topics are poorly covered, if at all.  One only sees publications of this low quality in the self-published genre, not from reputable publishing houses.&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;[[User:Hydrargyrum|Quicksilver]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Hydrargyrum|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum|@]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:26, 20 January 2012 (UTC)

== ESD ==

should add more detail &lt;sup&gt;(and be more specific)&lt;/sup&gt; about what components can be damaged &lt;sup&gt;(MB, CPU, RAM, GPU, etc...)&lt;/sup&gt; and the ones that can't be damaged &lt;sup&gt;(ODD, HDD, PSU, LCD, etc...)&lt;/sup&gt;

should also add info about Static &quot;Prone&quot; Clothing and what &quot;Discrete Electronic Components&quot; are - normal people &lt;sup&gt;(like me)&lt;/sup&gt; don't know this kind of stuff &lt;sup&gt;(the reason why I am writing all of this)&lt;/sup&gt; AND DON'T LEAVE OPEN-ENDED ANSWERS! you aren't liable for the information as long as you provide references &lt;sup&gt;(yeah, I hate talking to techies because they ALWAYS do that - just because they don't actually ''know'' anything)&lt;/sup&gt;

the one thing I hate about this WikiBook, is that it's way too ''&quot;hollow&quot;'' - need some ''&quot;solid&quot;'' information here

'''PCBs &amp; ICs''' &lt;sup&gt;(MB, CPU, RAM, GPU, etc...)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
about how if they are enclosed &lt;sup&gt;(Electro Static Discharge safe)&lt;/sup&gt;, they are protected - and if they are exposed &lt;sup&gt;(Electrostatic Sensitive Device)&lt;/sup&gt;, they are not protected

and that the correct method/technique for handling PCBs and ICs is to hold them by the edges/sides

:also how, many manufacturers of RAM are now making them encased in what appears &lt;sup&gt;(atleast to me)&lt;/sup&gt; to be some kind of ESD protection - it's actually a heatsink/cooling-system

:Graphics Cards &lt;sup&gt;(GPU)&lt;/sup&gt; are also sold with their own cooling system - this provides ESD protection to one side of it &lt;sup&gt;(lower side to bring cool air up - hot air rises)&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Monocots''' and '''dicots''' are the two broad groups of flowering plants ('''Division Magnoliophyta'''). While it is generally easy to distinguish most dicots and monocots from one another, the basis for the split in classification is a characteristic of the developing embryo, a feature that is no longer observable on the adult plant unless one can access the internal structure of a seed. Therefore, the following characteristics can be applied in the absence of knowledge about the '''''cotyledon'''''. However, be mindful that no 'single' characteristic will absolutely distinguish a dicot from a monocot, other than by definition monocots have one ''cotyledon'' and dicots have two. In general, monocots are simpler in structure than dicots, although monocots evolved from dicots. 

== Stem ==
In monocot stems, the vascular tissues &amp;mdash; the phloem and xylem &amp;mdash; are in bundles scattered throughout the stem, and they typically lack a vascular cambium. In dicot stems, the phloem and xylem are in rings around each other. They nearly always have cambium. Despite a pine's stem structure resemblance to dicots, it is neither a dicot nor a monocot. A pine is a conifer, which is not a flowering plant at all. 

Partly as a consequence of the arrangement of the vascular tissue, in monocots, there is very little new phloem and xylem added to the stem. Thus, monocot stems do not grow significantly thicker each year. Any change in thickness is due to the cells getting slightly larger. For this reason there are very few monocot trees (palms being an important exception). On the other hand, dicot stems can add new vascular tissue and thus grow thicker with time. Most flowering trees are dicots.

== Root ==
In monocot roots, the phloem and xylem alternate like the spokes of a wheel. In dicot roots, there is a single, X-shaped mass of xylem at the centre, with phloem between the arms of the X. Throughout the whole plant, monocots have more vascular tissue than dicots of similar size. Monocot roots grow from nodules on the stem, forming prop roots if close to the surface. 
In dicots, root growth is from the apical meristem, and often centered around a '''tap root'''.

== Leaf ==
The veins in monocot leaves are usually parallel, although palmate (arising from a common point at the base of the leaf) vein patterns are common. Dicot leaves have a branching pinnate vein network, rather like a feather, but can also be palmate.

== Flower ==
Monocot flowers have flower parts in multiples of three. Dicot flower parts are in multiples of four or five. Monocot pollen has a single pore on the outer layer. This means it is '''''monosulcate'''''. Dicot pollen is '''''triporate'''''. In other words, it has three pores on the stem..</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the late 19th century, when Cantor proved his theorem and mathematicians' understanding of infinity developed, set theory was not the rigorously axiomatised subject it is today. It relied upon woolly intuitions about what sets were and their relationship with their members. This lack of rigour led to several paradoxes.

In Naive Set Theory, something is a ''set'' if and only if it is a well-defined collection of objects. Sets count as objects. A ''member'' is anything contained in a set. Any two sets containing precisely the same members are the same set (''Principle of Extensionality'').

== Russell's Paradox ==

One of the most celebrated paradoxes is Russell's. Bertrand Russell, the English philosopher and logician, discovered this paradox in 1901. It centres on the set containing all and only those sets that do not contain themselves. It is impossible to answer the question 'does this set contain itself?' without running into a contradiction. If it contains itself, it is by definition a set that does not contain itself - contradiction. If it does not contain itself, it is a set that does not contain itself and so should contain itself - contradiction. A parallel semantic paradox is the Barber's paradox. The Barber shaves everyone in town who does not shave himself and only those people. Does the Barber shave himself? If so, he is not someone who does not shave himself. If he does not, he should. In this case, the Barber's contract is inconsistent and so, by analogy, is the Naive Set Theory upon which Russell's paradox is constructed.


== Cantor's Paradox ==

The explanation of this paradox is somewhat technical but brief and some readers may therefore prefer to return to it later.

A set A is a ''subset'' of another set B if all the members of A are members of B. Hence, all sets are subsets of themselves. Also, the ''empty set'', Ø or {},  the set containing no members, is a subset of any set, since all of its members are also members of any other set (since it has no members). A ''proper subset'' of a set is a subset that is not the set itself. The ''Powerset'' of a set is the set of all the subsets of that set. For example, the Powerset of the empty set is the set containing the empty set, {Ø}. Note that this set is different from the empty set: {Ø} has a member (Ø); Ø has none.

In 1873, Cantor proved that the Powerset of any set is larger than that set (Cantor's Theorem). This may seem obvious for finite sets, but the matter is less perspicuous when infinite sets are considered. For the time being, an infinite set will be said to be a set that has the same size as one of its proper subsets, and two sets are said to be the same size or ''equinumerous'' if and only if there exists a bijection between them (there is a unique member of the first for every member of the second and a unique member of the second for every member of the first). The set of natural numbers {1,2,3,...}, for example, is infinite. It has a proper subset {2,4,6,...}, the even numbers, but ''for every member of the set of natural numbers (i.e. for every natural number) there is a member of the set of even numbers and vice versa''. This is because every natural number can be doubled, resulting in an even number (i.e. every natural number can be assigned some unique member of the set of even numbers) and every even number can be halved, assigning to it a unique member of the set of natural numbers. If two sets are equinumerous, there is a means of pairing each member of the first with the second such that every member of the first set appears in the first position of precisely one pair and every member of the second set appears in the second position of precisely one pair (''ordered pairs'' are not subject to the principle of extensionality: &lt;a,b&gt; does not equal &lt;c,d&gt; if a does not equal c). So, for {1,2,3...} and {2,4,6...} there are the pairs &lt;1,2&gt;, &lt;2,4&gt;, &lt;3,6&gt;, etc. The set of all such pairs is a ''function'' (and a ''bijection'').

Proof of Cantor's Theorem rests upon the notions thus described. The proof described here is ''reductio ad absurdum'', i.e. the negation of what is to be proved is assumed true; the proof shows that such an assumption is inconsistent.

Suppose that a set A is equinumerous with its Powerset PA. Hence there is a bijection g ''from A to PA''. Let g(x) be the member of PA (i.e. a subset of A) associated with a member x of A. Since A is assumed to be equinumerous with PA, for every member y of PA there is a member x of A such that y = g(x). Let B be the subset of A such that any member x of B is not a member of g(x) (remember g(x) will be some subset of A). Hence there is no x that is a member of A and g(x) = B. If there was, either it would be a member of B or not. If x was a member of B, it would be a member of g(x) and so would not be a member of B - contradiction. If it was not, it would not be a member of g(x) and so would be a member of B - contradiction (note the similarity with Russell's paradox used to show this contradiction). However, B is a member of PA (since B is a subset of A) and so there should be some x such that g(x) = B. This contradiction completes the proof. For any set, there is always some subset that cannot be assigned uniquely one of the members of that set.

The paradox follows as an extension of the theorem. Consider the set containing everything, all sets, trees, people, planets, stalagmites, numbers, calculators and so on. According to the theorem, the Powerset of this set is larger than it. However, if this is so, the set of everything must have missed something out, since there is a set which is larger than it and so contains something else besides.

== Richard's and Berry's Paradoxes ==

Consider the set containing all natural numbers that are definable in English in fewer than twenty syllables. It will contain twenty-six (only three syllables), the two-millionth prime number (only seven syllables) and ten raised to the ten raised to the ten raised to the ten raised to the ten plus fourteen (nineteen syllables). Since there are only a finite number of syllables and a definition must be finite in length, this set must be finite in size. It will be a proper subset of the set containing all arrangements of nineteen or fewer syllables; in particular, it is the set containing those arrangements that define a natural number. Since this set has only a finite number of members, it must have a largest member (but observe that ''infinite'' sets need not, e.g. the set of natural numbers). 

Consider the number defined by: the least number not definable in English in twenty syllables. This number is the smallest number not in the set; yet it is definable in fewer than twenty syllables, for it has just been defined in eighteen! This is Berry's paradox, proposed by Berry in 1906 as a simplified version of Richard's paradox, which is as below.

Consider all the numbers between 0 and 1 that can be designated in a finite number of words. For example, 0.33333333... is designated by 'a third'. 'The ratio between the lengths of the side and the diagonal of a square', is another example. Arranging all such numbers lexicographically shows that it comprises a ''denumerable'' set. Listing all such numbers in some order is hence possible. However, there is a number p that differs in its kth place to every kth number in the listing. Hence it appears nowhere in the listing, yet it should, for it has just been described in a finite number of words.

Richard's and Berry's paradoxes arise through sloppy use of terms such as definability and designatability and the inclusion of self-reference. No such carelessness is possible in Axiomatic Set Theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[How-tos bookshelf]] | [[Sword construction]]
----
The [[w:Sword#Parts_of_the_Western_sword|parts of the sword]] must be made to match and enhance the function of the type of sword.  

All parts of a sword have a style; whether intentional decoration, traditional forms, or unintended artifacts of the production process.

If the target will be chopped or slashed, the mass of the sword will be more forward.  As the weight increases, it becomes more difficult and time consuming to change the direction the sword is traveling. Only one edge can be readily used, so only one edge is sharpened. Chopping and slashing are enhanced by a curved blade; so the style of swordsmanship will determine how much of the blade is curved and to what degree. If the target is on the ground with the sword wielder on horseback, or the other way around, then the blade or handle (or both) will be longer. If the weight or length of the sword becomes unwieldy, then two hands are needed.

A blade must be flexible and tough enough to absorb the shocks of use.  At the same time it must be hard enough to retain a sharp edge through many cuts.  Historically, several methods were developed to enhance these attributes. The &quot;simplest&quot; of these consisted in heat treating the steel blade to create an acceptable compromise between hardness and toughness. Some consisted of inserting or layering harder alloys within or between softer alloys ([[w:damascus steel|damascus steel]]), and [[w:differential hardening|differential hardening]] of the edge and body of the blade. The latter is a type of heat treatment made legendary among sword fans by the Japanese [[Wikipedia:katana|katana]]. However, the edge-hardened katana was predated by edge-hardened Chinese [[w:jian|jian]] and [[w:dao (sword)|dao]], Nepalese [[w:khukuri|khukuri]], and others.

The [[w:sword making#Sharpening|sharpened edge]] will be configured differently depending on:

#The [[w:heat treatment|hardness and toughness]] of the metal,
#What degree of chopping, slashing, slicing, and thrusting is expected,
#Character of the expected target.

==Handle construction==
The handle ([[w:hilt|hilt]]) of a single-edged chopping sword is usually angled to enhance the chopping action and to give the user tactile feedback of the orientation of the sharpened edge. The handles of double-edged straight swords are in-line with the blade and point for thrusting, and again designed to give tactile feedback of orientation; in this case, of both sharpened edges by the flattened or oval shape of the grip.

*The grip must be the appropriate size for the hand holding it. And the material on the surface of the grip must enhance the hand's grip upon it.
*It must also be durable to withstand the stresses of its mounting.
*The grip must be attached to the sword in a dependable, durable manner. 

A guard between the grip and blade might serve several purposes:  

#Prevent hand from sliding forward,
#Registering the hand on the grip,
#Prevent opposing blade from reaching the hand,
#Trapping the opposing blade,
#Covering the mouth of the scabbard to prevent water and dirt from entering.

The pommel serves three principal purposes.

#Add weight to counter-balance the blade at the appropriate point,
#A fastening point for the tang of the blade,
#A weapon in and of itself, usually for smashing an opponent in the face, neck, etc.

==Fastening the handle to the sword==
In straight swords, the pommel can also serve as a secondary weapon — a knob-like protrusion used for striking when the blade points in the wrong direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Note on Style ==
I think the current module is too low-level. First, templates (or typing the structures) isn't really important in telling the story. (When implementing the code, it's obvious that in, say, C you need to specialize the structure to suit only one data type (or use preprocessor hacks), while it's obvious in C++ that you can use templates, and finally it's obvious in a language like Scheme you don't even need to type anything.) The approach should follow the Introduction chapter, which ignores these issues: [[Data_Structures/Introduction#The_Node]].

Instead of code that messes with pointers, it should be using the Node ADT functions. Instead of trying to make the Data-Structures OO, it should be more functional/procedural: when done properly, it will be obvious how the code can be made OO. That is, we should follow an OO style, but not actually use a pseudocode language that is itself OO. We are using abstraction heavily, but we aren't concerned with say polymorphism or inheritence, which has very little relevance to introductory data structures. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:15, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

[[Media:[[Media:[[Media:[[Media:[[Media:{{}}]]]]]]]]]]==get-size==
If we have a '''get-size''' function we might as well keep a counter in the main stack/queue structure that holds the integer field along with head and tail node references. Any objections if I do that? Also, are there any objections if I deCamelCase the function names to use the hyphen instead? (The Algorithms book uses this policy.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:20, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)
: I've deCamelCased the function names. I generally think that keeping track of the size belongs in the list if anywhere. Really, there are very few stack or queue algorithms that ever need to get the size of the structure, so my feeling is that it shouldn't even be in the interface. --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 17:50, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Content clarity ==
There seems to be a mixing up of data structure and data type concepts, or at least a lack of distinction that should be addressed.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:46, 8 November 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Angocentric time line ==

The proposed timeline is typically anglocentric and fails utterly to capture the global perspective of the second world war.

The Pacific War did not begin in 1941. That was only when whitey got involved ( and I say that as a white guy). The timeline on wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Two) should be used.</text>

#Add the broken-up corned beef and stir in gently.
#Bring almost to the boil.
#Switch off the heat and let it sit for 15 minutes.

Heat again or serve as it is.

==Alternative method (pressure cooker)==
It's easy to make hash in a pressure cooker, just follow the pressure cooker instructions to cook the potatoes &amp; onions on the hob.

#Put all the ingredients ''apart from the corned beef'' into the pressure cooker. You do not need much water, perhaps 1 or 2 cm of cold water.
#Bring the pressure cooker up to pressure and cook for approx 4 minutes.
#Meanwhile chop up the corned beef. When the other ingredients are cooked, open the pressure cooker and mix the corned beef in. Then serve.

'''Oil-dumpling''' (in Dutch: Oliebol, oliebollen)

Oliebollen are often called Dutch apple fritters, and are served at Dutch festivals in the United States, such as Oak Harbor, Washington's Holland Happening Festival.

Makes: 50 doughnuts, or 1 roaster pan full

== Ingredients ==
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 pkg [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Scalding|scalded]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], softened
* 10 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1½ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3 diced Granny Smith [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|ground cinnamon]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]] for frying

== Procedure ==
# Dissolve 2 tbsp sugar in 1 cup warm water. Sprinkle yeast on top. Let stand while preparing dough.
# In a LARGE mixing bowl, beat eggs until mixed. Add scalded milk, 1½ cups warm water, yeast mixture and margarine and beat well. Add flour, 1 cup sugar and salt, mix well. Add diced apple.
# Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size. (I use a lobster pot for this)
# In a separate bowl, mix 3 C. sugar and cinnamon to taste. (I like a LOT)
# Fill a fryer pot 4 inches with canola oil or melted Crisco. Heat to 375°F (190°C) and scoop large spoonfuls of dough into the pot, turning them to ensure even browning. (Golden brown is the goal) Play the shape game while you're at it.  Dipping the spoons in the hot oil before scooping the dough keeps the spoons from getting too sticky.
# Drain on paper towels on paper bags, roll in cinnamon sugar mixture and serve warm.

I made this recipe tonight and I'm fairly certain it could use either more sugar or more butter. I'm going to consult with some people about proportions and probably update the recipe later this month. --[[User:MarkTraceur|MarkTraceur]] ([[User talk:MarkTraceur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MarkTraceur|contribs]]) 08:29, 19 October 2013 (UTC)

'''Couscous''' (from [[w:Maghreb Arabic|Maghreb Arabic]] ''kuskusu'', which is from [[w:Tamazight|Tamazight]] ''seksu'') is a [[w:food|food]] which consists of grains made from [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]] which are about 1mm or 1/16th inch in diameter (after cooking).  In the [[w:United States|United States]] couscous is known as a [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], however in most other countries it is treated more like a [[Cookbook:grain|grain]] in its own right.

Couscous is traditionally served under a meat or vegetable [[Cookbook:stew|stew]].  The dish is the primary staple food throughout the [[w:Maghreb|Maghreb]]; in much of Algeria and eastern [[w:Morocco|Morocco]] it is simply known as ''ta`aam'' &amp;#1591;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1605;, &quot;food&quot;.  It is popular in the Maghreb the West African [[w:Sahel|Sahel]], in [[w:France|France]], and parts of the [[w:Middle East|Middle East]], it's also very popular among [[w:Jew|Jew]]s of [[w:North African|North African]] descent. But this speciality is from a [[w:Berber|Berber]] origin.

==Cooking==

When cooked couscous has a texture somewhere between American [[Cookbook:Grits|grits]] and [[w:Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]].  Couscous has to be steamed rather than boiled to prevent the grains sticking together; the couscous available to buy in most western supermarkets has been pre-steamed and dried. It is quick and easy to prepare by pouring the couscous grains into boiling water or stock, adding some vegetable oil and stirring.  The couscous swells and within a few minutes is ready to serve.  Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than dried pasta or grains such as [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

The traditional North African method is to use a steamer called a ''couscoussière'' in [[w:French language|French]].  The base is a tall metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked in a stew.  On top of the base a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew.  The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so that steam can escape.

In [[w:Morocco|Morocco]], [[w:Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[w:Algeria|Algeria]], couscous is generally served with vegetables (carrots, turnips, etc.) cooked in a spicy broth, and some meat (generally, [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]]). Such a dish is now popular in former [[w:colony|colonial]] power France, where this particular preparation is generally implied by the word &quot;couscous&quot;. Packaged sets containing a box of quick-preparation couscous and a can of vegetables and, generally, meat are sold in French grocery stores and supermarkets.

There are recipes from [[w:Brazil|Brazil]] that use boiled couscous molded into [[w:timbale (food)|timbale]] with other ingredients.  Couscous can also be combined with meat or vegetables during cooking, and is often highly flavoured with aromatic spices.

==Manufacturing==

The couscous grains are made from semolina (coarsely ground [[Cookbook:Durum wheat|durum wheat]]) or, in some regions, from coarsely ground [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]] or [[Cookbook:millet|millet]].  The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry semolina to keep the pellets separate, and then sieved.  The pellets which are small enough to be finished grains of couscous fall through the sieve, the rest are again sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into smaller pellets.  This process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny grains of couscous.

This process is very labour-intensive.  Traditionally, groups of women would come together and make a large batch of couscous grains over several days.  These would then be dried in the sun and used for several months.  Nowadays couscous is normally produced in factories, and is sold pre-made in markets around the world.

[[Cookbook:Berkoukes|Berkoukes]] are pasta bullets made by the same process, but are larger than the grains of couscous.</text>

== SPM8 ==

SPM8 is not officially supported on Mac PowerPC, as this platform is about to be phased out (see [http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/roadmap.html MATLAB Platform Roadmap]). This means that precompiled MEX files (*.mexmac) are not included in the SPM distribution. It should however be relatively straightforward to compile them by yourself.

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm8.zip] and its updates [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm8_updates/ spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login
unzip spm8.zip
unzip -o spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /Users/login/spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation === 

You need to have Apple's development environment [http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/ Xcode] installed. It should be available on your Mac OS X installation DVD.

You also need to have the ''mex'' executable in your system path. To do so, type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/MATLAB/bin
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
with the appropriate path where MATLAB is installed.

In a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM8 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login/spm8/src
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
make toolbox-distclean
make toolbox &amp;&amp; make toolbox-install
make external-distclean
make external &amp;&amp; make external-install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM5 ==

Precompiled MEX files for Mac PowerPC (*.mexmac) are available in the latest update.

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm5.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login
unzip spm5.zip
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /Users/login/spm5
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation === 

If you want to compile SPM5 MEX files by yourself, you need to have Xcode installed and ''mex'' in your system path (see SPM8 for details).

Then, in a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM5 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login/spm5/src
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM2 ==

Precompiled MEX files for Mac PowerPC (*.mexmac) are available in the latest update.

=== Compilation ===

NB. Some of the following commands require that you log in as root or use the &quot;sudo&quot; mode.

Assuming that your Matlab and SPM2 folders (say, &quot;MATLAB&quot; and &quot;spm2&quot;) are in your Applications folder: 

(1) make sure you use a version of gcc earlier than 3.3 (compiling spm2 with gcc3.3 fails when mex is invoked; there apparently is a conflict of library):

    (sudo) gcc_select 3

(2) put a symbolic link to the &quot;mex&quot; file found in MATLAB/bin into /usr/sbin/ (!!! not in usr/local/bin):

    (sudo) ln -s /.../Applications/MATLAB/bin/mex   /usr/sbin/mex

(3) recompile SPM2:

    cd /.../Applications/spm2
    make MAC

You should see something like the following lines:

    make all SUF=mexmac RANLIB=&quot;ranlib spm_vol_utils.mexmac.a&quot;
    _________________________________________________
    Unix compile for MacOS X
    _________________________________________________

      <text xml:space="preserve">Robotics spans multiple scientific and engineering disciplines, so when you want to design a better robot you should get some basic knowledge in these fields. How much you should learn depends on how complex you want to make your robot. To give an example: A small tethered tabletop robot would only require some basic knowledge in electronics and programming, a shoe box sized robot would require some additional knowledge on mechanics (mostly about balance) and a large robot might even require some knowledge on solid mechanics.

This page covers the fields that are very much used in robotics. You don't need to know everything about all of these subjects, however knowing the basics of each of these fields can help in building better robots and prevent you from making (some of the) beginner's mistakes.

==Mechanics==
Mechanics is about:
*how forces are transferred between the different parts of a construction.
*where the center of gravity lies.
*friction
*position, speed, acceleration
*Newtons laws
*inertia
*material properties

Mechanics helps keeping a robot in balance. Although you could build a robot without knowing anything about mechanics, it'll help in preventing that your robot tips over when turning, or when picking up something.

Another point where mechanics pays off are axles. On small robots you can attach the wheels directly to the output shaft of the motor. However this doesn't work well for larger robots as this puts a lot of stress on the internals of the motor. A better way is to attach the wheel to an axle, and use gears to connect the motor to the axle. Knowledge of mechanics allows you to build such constructs.

If your robot is a small line follower almost any building material will work. However if your robot weighs a few kilos, something sturdier than cardboard and soda sippers is appropriate. And if your robot is human size you should consider metal and/or composite construction.

See [[Theoretical Mechanics]] for an introduction in this field.

''the &quot;Theoretical Mechanics&quot; is just started, so there isn't much to read just yet.''

==Electronics==
Electronics is about:
*electronic components
*Analog circuits
*digital logic
*microcontrollers

Electronics is something you can't go without (unless you want to build a complete mechanical robot or use pneumatics for control). Today there are plenty of books covering basic electronics (See [[Electronics]]).

==Programming==
Computer programming is about:
*Control structures (sequence, selection, iteration)
*Data types (constants, variables, integer, real, string,...)
*Algorithms
*Hardware control (setting and reading registers, interrupts,...)

Anyone who has had an introductory course on programming (as they are given in American high schools) would be familiar with the first three points. The fourth point is rarely addressed in introductory courses, but is essential when programming microcontrollers. Although it might sound difficult, it can be very easy in practice (for most purposes). Much of this comes down to setting bits in a byte using simple Boolean logic, and writing this value into some register or memory location. Higher level languages like Bascom provide hardware addressing as special variables, which can be treated just like any other variable.

Microcontrollers (and processor boards) are one of the areas where using Assembly is still very valid. Memory (both RAM and program space) is very limited in these, although each new generation of microcontroller has more memory for about the same price. Many microcontrollers provide between 2K and 30K, and processor boards tend to have up to 256K.  These numbers vary wildly, but are still significantly less than PCs have. However if you don't know an assembly language, most microcontroller and processor boards have high level language compilers available in many flavors (C, C++, Basic, Pascal, Fortran, etc.)

Robot programming is also about:
*The Event Loop.  Most microcontrollers do not have the resources for threading. You will need to look at your robot's task a fraction of a second at a time, and choose which small action to take.  What can the program do in that moment to get a little bit closer to its goal?
*Interpreting sensor data. Sensors have many ways of providing noisy or misleading information; how many types of error can you accept? Dirt in a rheostat, a broken switch, and a venetian blind flickering on a photodiode are obvious faults. How about temperature drift, non-linear response curves, or your robot seeing its own shadow?  
*Decision making, or '''Artificial Intelligence''' is the art of making the right decision given the constraints of the current system.
* Motors and motion.  Making motion on a robot often involves moving several motors at once, often with feedback from sensors.

==Solid Mechanics==
Solid mechanics is about how forces distribute inside solid materials. Knowledge about this subject is useful because it explains how materials respond to loads. This helps to prevent using too thick or too thin materials. This isn't required for small or medium robots, but it allows to be more efficient with building materials and gives insight to why and how materials fail (break and/or deform). See [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Solid_Mechanics this wikibook]] for a start on solid mechanics. Be warned: heavy math ahead.

Even if you have a mortal fear of math, bite through this as it gives valuable insights on how materials break and deform. No need to memorize the math, as long as you get the idea behind it.

==A.I.==
Artificial Intelligence (in Robotics) is about:
*Finding the shortest way between 2,3 (or more) points
*Dealing with obstacles
*Handling new situations (machine learning)

There are many [[Artificial Intelligence| books]] available on AI on many different levels. This area has had a short but already fruitful history, but still has a very long way to go. AI isn't just about getting a computer to think and reason. It's more about ordering, sorting and organizing knowledge in a machine and constructing algorithms for extracting real world conclusions from these databases. A search engine like [http://www.google.com Google] or [http://www.yahoo.com Yahoo] are examples of real uses of AI.

Other than pure AI books, books on how the brain works and such can provide interesting angles to AI on robots. Concepts like attention and concentration can have interesting uses in some form for integrating sensor data.

==Math==
Although math is generally seen as the ultimate theoretical science, it can be one of the most important skills in many of the more advanced domains of robotics. e.g. Mechanics uses a lot of math. For simple constructs you won't need much more than high school level math, for more complicated shapes it becomes necessary to use more complex math tools like integrals. But since robotics is a very practical craft many things can be done with approximations. Math however can be very helpful in making the right approximation.

If you're a fanatic about building computers and want to know what types of parts to get, this page is for you. I'm sure that you will find this page interesting and you may just want to go out, get the parts from a store, or salvage them from the junkyard. Feel free to add information on new products (especially CPUs), and don't be biased towards one brand unless you have actual evidence or personal experience, and if you have that, please mention it.

Note to the reader: this book supplements one other Wikibook titled &quot;[[How To Build A Computer]]&quot;.

== Building a computer ==

This supplement is designed to help readers understand the methods on what is needed in order to build a computer. I will break down each part definition and then talk about ways to pick each part that all relate to the target of what the machine is being built for.

=== Why build? ===

Why build vs. buy?

*Unique
*Cost

What do you want to use it for?

*Extreme Gaming
*Business / Office / Technical use
*Video / Photo / Music Editing
*Multimedia / Home Theater / DVR
*Server

=== Background and planning ===

When building a computer there are many things to consider. Budget, quality, brand warranty and support, value, needs VS wants, performance, expandability, types of software that will run on the computer and many other things. When designing a system it is important to look at each part of the decision making process as noted above. Let us look at each area of focus:

=== Budget ===

When determining the budget of what is needed, when picking computer parts, it is very important to set the expectation upfront. Costs can exceed planned budgets very quickly so I would suggest being careful and realistic on what you plan to spend. Good references to understanding costs would be to use resources such as computer shopper magazine or visit a local computer parts store website to get a general idea. Even visit a local store to window shop. What might be easier is assume that an already assembled machine would be about 2/3 the cost starting, on a system that you build yourself. This is assuming that you are able to find an off the shelf product that has your requirements, but want to take it further by building one from scratch.

=== Quality ===

The subject of quality is very difficult since everything more or less is made outside the USA, usually at factories in China. What it comes down to is the track record overall of the company. Then follows the purpose of the product and product features. A big issue that occurs with trying to define quality electronics is having no knowledge of what a quality part is supposed to look like. People tend to rely on stuff they read on forums, but what is difficult is forums are anonymous so anyone who likes to talk whether accurate or not will post their comments and make it sound like they are an expert. The other side of the coin is you can review the Manufacturer’s website, but the problem you generally run into is the bias perspective of a company who is marketing its own products. The other issue is you cannot necessarily look at the parts and know, since most of you might be unaware of what you are looking at. Your best bet is to take in as many resources as possible. Try using the power of the web and see if you can get a broad overview of reviews and perspectives from consumers and hopefully experts. It is not always easy to do. Sometimes you have to take a shot at a company that seems to be very popular for the type of equipment you are buying, and hope that the quality standards are there. Consumer reports are options as well since they are right to the point on trying to find good products. Overall, quality has too different levels: consumer and business. Parts that are rated for business needs are generally more expensive and in some cases higher quality since they require a better record of accomplishment on life expectancy and reliability. 

Overall, you need to educate yourself on brands as much as possible before you start picking parts. No brand is a perfect match, but generally, you have a handful of various brands within a given part.  Many products will be very similar in design and quality as mentioned before. It will really come down to support, warranty, product features, and so on, which I will talk about in later sections.

=== Brand warranty and support ===

This topic is a big part of making choices on certain parts and brands that go hand and hand with quality. What you will notice real fast is parts might have all the features you need and the quality is good, but when you go to obtain service via phone, the web or email, you find out real quick how difficult it is. 
What is important is being able to access a website, not hosted in China, which allows you to download software drivers and bios support as well as manuals and other important information without any hassle.  If you have a question, can you easily make a phone call and talk to someone who can assist you with quality customer service. Especially if a problem arises like the part is not working correctly or the part fails. A difference in purchasing one brand VS another is mostly premised on the service quality. It does not matter how great something is, if there is no service to back it up. For example; waiting a month for a replacement part as well as paying shipping both ways. Can you download drivers on the website easily or do you have to register a product and create a user account just to get support or answers to questions. Again, how easy is it to get service? Do I have good software support for current technology and Operating System versions?

=== Limited support ===

One short statement that everyone needs to be conscious of; When building your own computer you are not getting total system support for the first year, that normally a new off the shelve system would come with. Each part has it owns warranty for different durations with separate support guidelines. Please save all paperwork and packaging. DO NOT DISPOSE OF ANYTHING. If there is ever a problem, you can easily exchange the part with the store you purchased it at or send it in to the MFR for replacement. You have limited troubleshooting support since when you call a Manufacturer; they always point the finger at the other brand as being the problem. If they do determine that the part might be bad, since again they are not 100% sure, you have to send them the part first so they can review it and then mail you out a replacement. You seem to go around in circles when troubleshooting issues with your newly built machine. Certain companies might allow a part to be sent out first, but you will have to pay for the part first and when the old part is returned, you will get a credit. What is frustrating about this process is that you may be wrong on the bad part or there might be more than one part that is bad.

You have to be ready to support the machine yourself, and troubleshoot yourself with the assistance of the manufacturers, but they can only do so much since all they really care about is their specific brand and there is not much that can be done over the phone. What needs to be done in certain cases if you decide to build on your own then you are responsible for what you build. In other cases, you can buy the parts from a retailer and in most cases, they offer build services. Going out to third party building companies can sometimes be very costly so use care. If you do use a company to build your machine, I recommend adding additional service and support so that if something does come up you are not left hanging. This is very important if your computer is used for business, so use care when acquiring additional service. Make sure you are clear on the terms and that it is conducive to your needs.

=== Value, features, and performance ===

The next topic we move onto is the question of value. Am I getting my money’s worth for the features and Performance I want? A big factor in making a decision is determining if you are getting value for your money and making sure you do not become caught up in the marketing and pretty cosmetics. Many parts available will suit your needs. What you need to understand is does the part have the performance and features needed, in combination of other part choices, that suits the goal I am building the system for? Performance is a very inflated term since almost anything you try to shop for in computers refers to performance everything. You have to focus more on the design and the specifications rather than the inflated use of big marketing words. Words such as ultra, super, high performance, heavy duty, etc.  You will tend to notice most of the designs are similar since many concepts are duplicated from one manufacturer to another. The best way to determine which option is best is review the main specifications and compare. At least you will have an “apples to apples” comparison. Specifications are printed either on the packaging or on the product website.

=== Expandability ===

Another important factor is expansion over time. Can I upgrade to newer equipment or add additional components as time goes on. The biggest problem with all technology is the fast changing industry that is constantly updating. After 3 months, your computer technology is dated, since new products are already hitting the shelves. Realistically there is no way you can keep up. What you buy today might be dated tomorrow. All you can do is purchase the best bang for your buck now, and allow for expansion over time. Some suggestions I can make are choose a bigger case with more standardized setups so that installing newer parts later down the line does not become an issue.  Regardless, of what you choose there is a general rule of thumb, which is think one-step above what your current needs are. Look for ways to add later.

=== Operating systems and other software ===
 
Software plays a mission critical part in which components you choose for the computer. Options are limited based on the software that is installed on the new machine. For example: Linux, UNIX, and other open source flavors have strong support in the hardware world, but not everything is supported. You must use care when picking parts if you plan to choose an open source route to operating systems. The driver support and technical support is usually on the assumption you are using a Microsoft Operating system. The other options for operating systems include Microsoft Windows as well as Microsoft Windows Server. There are also options such as Novell and Sun, but those Operating Systems are out of the scope of a build your own system. There are big differences in part selection when choosing a product, which truly depends on its support with the software you are using.

To explain the differences, we must understand the fact that companies pay money for hardware support through operating system companies. Everything has a cost, and the hardware company has the choice whether or not they want to pay for it. Open source options, since open source are generally free, takes a longer time to provide support for new hardware. Unless there is mention of the support on the packaging or product literature then do not assume. I would call the company to be sure. If you are looking at building a server, be aware that many manufacturers do not offer windows server support from a driver and tech support standpoint. Various consumer brands only have either Linux/Unix or Desktop Windows support. Windows Server versions are supported on parts that are classified for use in a server environment. The design and features will vary completely from the consumer features with specifications focused on high heat and heavy user traffic with long powered on durations VS consumer systems that tend to be turned off regularly and the average user is not stressing the machine to extreme unless it is a gamer, but again it is only one user. My suggestion is look closely on the product specifications when making part selections to make sure you do not run into a snag with an unsupported part.

== Buying the right parts ==

The next topic of discussion is about part choices. Here we will describe each part and how it works with a computer system. A person cannot shop for parts if they do not know what parts they need or how the parts work. Every part has a purpose and each part works together with other parts to satisfy an ultimate goal.

You can buy virtually everything listed below online, if you are patient enough to wait for a good deal. You can use [http://www.pricewatch.com price watch] to look up prices on parts through various vendors. Double-check the advertisements to ensure that the item you have found is what you really want. A search for a &quot;DVD burner&quot; may find results such as &quot;external enclosure for DVD burner&quot; or &quot;DVD burner software.&quot;

=== Core components ===

==== CPU and sockets ====

The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is the brain that is responsible for processing information from any piece of hardware. It runs the programs and commands that the system attempts execute. It is important to check with the Motherboard manufacturer for CPU compatibility before purchasing a supporting board and additional components. Rather than go into a strong opinionated discussion on what processor will work best, my suggestion is review the manufacturers suggestions on processor selection as noted on the below websites. Realistically three big factors are how many applications are you running at one time, the types of applications you are running, and how many users are accessing the system. The system that is built based on these three topics. My suggestion is reading up on recommendations from the software companies for best overall performance and consistency to assist in your decision making process. There is never a perfect option, but you always want to shoot for something right in the middle rather than over or under estimate the need. Once you have found the middle ground as mentioned before, go when step higher so at least you have some cushion for possible changes in the future.

“The Central Processing Unit (CPU) or the processor is the portion of a computer system that carries out the instructions of a computer program, and is the primary element carrying out the computer's functions. This term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s [1]. The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed dramatically since the earliest examples, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.”

There are various processors to choose. My suggestion is to understand what type of processor is needed to support the applications you will be running. Any processor above will support all the various Operating Systems available. Some will obviously perform better than others will, but what it comes down to are the applications within the operating system you will be running, how many applications will be running at one time, and how many users will be accessing the machine at any given time. That is what will place you in a certain class of processor choices. 

Also take note that some of the new processors have integrated video processing right on the CPU, so certain processors that you purchase might require a video card rather than using on board video that some motherboards might have. Again, it is important to check the manual.

===== Sockets =====

Sockets are very important when deciding which boards to choose to support your system. Once you pick the processor you want you build the system around it. Sockets are located on the motherboard of every computer. It is the interface between the CPU and the rest of the system. The CPU is locked in place into the socket and then a heat sink is placed over the CPU for cooling. When choosing a processor the socket choice must match and in turn this limits your choices for other supporting parts. That is why I recommend choosing the processor to start with and build the system around it.

Tom's Hardware Guide has many CPU reviews that will usually compare the CPU to others.

==== Motherboards ====

“A motherboard is the central printed circuit board (PCB) in many modern computers and holds many of the crucial components of the system, while providing connectors for other peripherals. The motherboard is sometimes alternatively known as the main board, system board, or, on Apple computers, the logic board.[1] It is also sometimes casually shortened to mobo.”

Most motherboards today are over engineered to some extent and there are various choices ranging from 30 dollars all the way up to 500 plus dollars. Everything is linked to the features and additional component support. How much do you want to spend before you realize you may not need all the bells and whistles?
The real important thing is that everything must be compatible with the motherboard. Buy an expansion card for each function that is not included with the motherboard. Be sure to check compatibility and the number of expansion card slots on the motherboard. If you want to be able to adjust clock settings or have more control over your partnering electronics, make sure the motherboard can support it. 

Be sure to compare features and specifications of boards you have selected. Keep in mind that it must support the socket and processor you have chosen. If you are like some people and choose the board first, the board you choose dictates the processor. Regardless either one limits the other. Review the product manuals, which in most cases are downloadable online by visiting the manufacturer’s website. If you are very new to computer hardware, my suggestion is be patient and understand what features you are looking for that are important. 

Some features that you need to look at are the following:

*CPU support and socket – What processor are you looking to use and does the board have the socket and the actual support to run the processor.

*Integrated Peripherals – Depending on use of the motherboard, the question you need to ask is what does the board have built onto it and what is necessary to purchase extra? Most boards come with onboard sound, video, network card as well as various USB ports and in certain cases PS2.

*Peripheral Card Slots – Depending on the use of the computer and future expansion determines how many and what type of card slots you actually need. Common slots to see are PCI-E and PCI. PCI-E comes in slot sizes from 1x to 16x depending on the type of interface card you are plugging into the motherboard.

*Ports and Channels – Ports can include USB, SATA, FireWire, IDE/EIDE, IRDA, or Floppy. SCSI is not common to see on a consumer system. You would normally see SCSI on some server based boards.

For more information on the differences: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing) BUS]

*Temperature, Reliability, and cooling system – “Motherboards are generally air cooled with heat sinks often mounted on larger chips, such as the Northbridge, in modern motherboards. If the motherboard is not cooled properly, it can cause the computer to crash. Passive cooling, or a single fan mounted on the power supply, was sufficient for many desktop computer CPUs until the late 1990s; since then, most have required CPU fans mounted on their heat sinks, due to rising clock speeds and power consumption. Most motherboards have connectors for additional case fans as well. Newer motherboards have integrated temperature sensors to detect motherboard and CPU temperatures, and controllable fan connectors, which the BIOS or operating system can use to regulate fan speed. Some computers (which typically have high-performance microprocessors, large amounts of RAM, and high-performance video cards) use a water-cooling system instead of many fans.”

*Form Factor (size of the board relative to the case size) – “Motherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes called computer form factor, some of which are specific to individual computer manufacturers. However, the motherboards used in IBM-compatible commodity computers were standardized to fit various case sizes. As of 2007, most desktop computer motherboards use one of these standard form factors—even those found in Macintosh and Sun computers, which have not traditionally been built from commodity components. The current desktop PC form factor of choice is ATX. A case's, motherboard and PSU form factor must all match, though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same family will fit larger cases. For example, an ATX case will usually accommodate a microATX motherboard.”

Note: More and more motherboards are coming with Non Legacy technology meaning that support for older interfaces have become obsolete. Such things like PS2, IDE, Floppy, and PCI are being seen less and less. Keep this in mind when buying parts so that your system does not become obsolete faster than expected.

==== RAM (Random Access Memory) ====

“Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage. Today, it takes the form of integrated circuits that allow stored data to be accessed in any order (i.e., at random). &quot;Random&quot; refers to the idea that any piece of data can be returned in a constant time, regardless of its physical location and whether or not it is related to the previous piece of data.”

It is very tempting to buy generic brands of memory. Generally, the savings are incredible, and large amounts of fast memory will improve your performance. However, cheaper memory tends to be less reliable than higher-end memory, since the quality control measures for generic brands is often less stringent. When RAM is unreliable, it can contribute to crashes. On the other side of the coin, all memory is made overseas and there are only a small handful of actual manufacturers. My suggestion is to focus on a company who is well known for quality memory at a reasonable price. 

Performance is the next factor when choosing, but at that point, all you need to do is review the basic specifications. Latency and Frequency as does the ram have any heat sinks or are the chips exposed freely. Everything is relative to the type of memory you are purchasing. Again, check your motherboard manual for compatibility. Regardless of what anyone says that ram is universal, is not an accurate statement. Various brands are usually compatible with most motherboards, but it is important to review the compatibility list on the website or in the manual. If for whatever reason you ram is not compatible it may only partially work as well as cause numerous intermittent problems. Do not assume; check and be certain.

Your processor can calculate all it wants, but how quickly it is given the information and how quickly it is retrieved will be controlled by the memory. You have to balance the need for performance and your budget. If you are buying for performance, you want low CAS latency and the fastest speed your motherboard can take. (PC2100 memory is greater than PC1600, for example.) Be aware that if your motherboard supports dual channel you should try to buy the ram in a pair of two. The technology allows the computer to access memory at a much higher speed than if you had just bought one module (if your motherboard and the two modules support it when working together). Check the voltage of the memory as well and match it to what your motherboard supports. Adjusting voltages are sometimes required as well as frequency when installing memory into a new machine. The motherboard does not always adjust to the correct frequency and voltage. It will usually adjust to the minimum in order to post the system, but once you push the memory under normal and extreme conditions you might have an issue. Usually these specifications are printed on a label on the side of the memory. If all else fails, check the website.

==== Graphics card ====

Graphic cards have always been a tough choice as one of the final pieces of hardware that is most crucial to the overall system performance. Choosing a video card is very difficult since so many manufacturers make video cards, but what you will find is the chipsets and GPU’s (similar to CPU for video cards) only have a few chipsets available. Realistically, the quality of the card is what your final decision becomes after you know what chipset and GPU brand you want. My best recommendation is understanding what the purpose of the machine is. If the machine is for video editing or graphic design, you will tend to use more of a professional series card rather than a gaming card. If you are doing gaming, you will choose the highest performing one you can find. My recommendation is pick one with a proven record of accomplishment. Stay away from new releases since in most cases bugs, stability, heat issues and various other problems have not all been worked out yet. Let others be the beta testers so that you can enjoy a solid, consistent performing machine.

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PC_hardware_manufacturers#Graphics_processing_units_.28GPUs.29 LIST OF ALL HARDWARE MANUFACTURES]


Application: Multimedia / Video Editing / Gaming / Extreme Gaming / Technical (Engineering / CAD)

Chipset Brand: 

Graphics processing units (GPUs)

*Advanced Micro Devices|AMD (ATI Technologies|ATI division)
*Matrox Graphics
*Nvidia
*VIA Technologies|Via (S3 Graphics division)
*Intel
*Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS
*PowerVR


The two biggest giants here are ATI and nVidia. Intel is also commonly found, but not competitive on the video aspect since the other companies focus on just video. Intel still does make a reliable chipset, but in the professional and gaming realm, they are not commonly found. Each company will tend to release &quot;families&quot; with similar new technology that usually consist of cheap and lower quality, moderate, and expensive with higher quality. Check your motherboard to see what expansion slots it has for these cards. The video included on the motherboard is usually sufficient for most tasks except gaming and video-related work. PCI Express runs at 16x. Whatever you are doing with your computer will determine how much video memory you need. Try to go a bit heavy on that. Reviews are available at http://www.tomshardware.com about graphics cards as well. Some families of cards from either company are better than others. Video cards not from a well-known company may or may not be easy to research as far as how well they function, and are more likely to lack features like a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit, which takes some load off of the CPU and only does graphics). This product should be heavily researched for information and reviews. If someone gives you a recommendation whether online or in person, I suggest having support facts to derive the same conclusion. 

Note to reader: We have recommended ATI and nVidia, because the lack of speed and performance of an Intel based Graphics Card (ex. Extreme Graphics, Extreme Graphics 2 etc.) I still recommend reading reviews and specifications of card choices and deriving your own decision based on available material. Bottom line, know your need and buy the card that supports the need. Keep in mind that if your focus is a data server then video card performance is not mission critical, but if you are doing video editing on the machine, then the video card in combination with the processor and board all have a strong bearing on system performance.

Side note is video cards that process a numerous amount of information at any given time can generally become hot, so a recommendation is a good cooling system on the card and the main case to allow the card to perform correctly. An overheating card will crash the system in a heartbeat.

=== Additional components ===

==== Sound card and speakers ====

There are a small handful of brands to choose from when deciding if you need a separate sound card. Most motherboards come with integrated sound. Basic boards have analog only all the way up to digital, optical and pure surround sound outputs built on. Most of the time these integrated sound devices are plenty for the average or even the above average user that is looking for quality sound without adding additional expense. If you determine the need is there for a higher quality card or a card that has more inputs and outputs then you can look at options to add one to your system.  Necessary needs would be higher gaming quality or for example sound recording and editing. Even instances with using your computer as a media center and you might be looking for the best quality output for your High Definition TV or Home Sound System. Everything is relative to the quality of the speakers you are outputting too with the type of cabling. If you are using 10-dollar speakers, you will get 10-dollar sound quality.

For speakers I am going to leave it simple with saying that until you hear the quality, there is nothing written that can make your decision. My suggestion is read up on reviews and perspectives of what others have used for the type of sound you are outputting and go to a local store and listen to some speakers. It is the only way to make a true decision. Be aware that sound is better as you get better equipment, but the sound card, the wires and the speakers all play a part. Sometimes sound capabilities included on your motherboard are more than adequate, but I would listen to it before determining you need more.

Some common brands to look at:
*AdLib
*C-Media
*Creative Labs (A3D)
*Realtek
*Sensaura
*Turtle Beach
*USB
*VIA Envy

==== Dialup modems ====

“A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information, and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used over any means of transmitting analog signals, from driven diodes to radio.”

If you are using a broadband Internet connection, and have no interest in using your computer for voicemail, faxing, or dial-up communications (like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system BBSing]), then you do not need a modem. Some servers still use dialup for updates and maintenance, but you very rarely see one installed on a new machine.

Today, almost all modem users are using them for dial-up Internet access. Most modems are 56k speed modems. It is advisable to get a 56k card to experience the fastest connection speeds your ISP (Internet Service Provider) can provide using dialup. Two predominant standards exist: v.90 and v.92. The difference is that v.92 has some extra features that allow you to stop your Internet connection temporarily and receive a call. However, you need call waiting and an ISP that supports this. 

Motherboards do not have an integrated modem built-in. Most already built machines do not come with a modem installed anymore. Again, unless you have a specific need for a modem, there is no reason to purchase one.

=== Drives ===

==== Hard drive ====

“A hard disk drive[2] (hard disk,[3] hard drive,[4] HDD) is a non-volatile storage device for digital data. It features one or more rotating rigid platters on a motor-driven spindle within a metal case. Data is encoded magnetically by read/write heads that float on a cushion of air above the platters, with modern storage capacity measured in gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB).
Hard disk manufacturers quote disk capacity in SI-standard powers of 1000, wherein a terabyte is 1000 gigabytes and a gigabyte is 1000 megabytes. With file systems that measure capacity in powers of 1024, available space appears somewhat less than advertised capacity.”

“The technological resources and know-how required for modern drive development and production mean that as of 2010, virtually all of the world's HDDs are manufactured by just five large companies: Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung, and Toshiba.”

There are few main types of hard drives, which include IDE hard drives, SATA drives, and SCSI drives. The drives can either be in the form of Solid State or Motor Driven. Currently SATA is the standard type of drive sold on the market in the form of motor driven operating between 5900 to 10000 RPMs. Depending on the need and budget common drives are usually motor driven 7200 RPM SATA drives. The larger the size of the drive, the speed drops down. Solid-state drives, meaning no moving parts, have become very popular, but the cost is still extremely high relative to the cost of standard drives. The capacity is small in comparison to standard motor driven drives. Solid state will give you the fastest read and write speeds with an assumed long-term life expectancy, but at the same time, it will cost you 3 times as much. 

Everything is based on need, and it would make sense to determine which option works best for the price you are willing to pay, and have the storage amount you need.  The main purpose of this drive is too store data on a permanent medium to be accessed any time. The data can be erased and re-written endless amount of times, but a hard drive is a place to park data.  My suggestion would be to determine what will be stored on the drive and how sensitive your access speed is to the software you are running, and determine what drive or drives would work best.

==== CD/DVD drives ====

“An optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves near the light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from discs, but recent drives are commonly both readers and recorders. Recorders are sometimes called burners or writers. Compact discs, DVDs, HD DVDs and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives.”

It is possible to get an inexpensive drive of good quality rather easily. As far as speed goes, 1x is the speed of the first-generation CD devices. It is generally agreed upon at around 150kBps.  A 48x CD-ROM drive would then be 7200kbps. DVD-ROM drives use the same measure, except that a 1x DVD-ROM can read around 1,250kBps. The media for each of the drives usually contain different amount of space.

*CD/R: 700 MB
*CD/RW:650 MB
*Formatted Audio CD/R: Approx. 48 Minutes
*DVD: 4.3 GB
*DVD/RW: 4.4 GB (And Sometimes Less)

If you want a burner, be aware of the types of media it can write. CD-R's are usually only recordable once. Using multi-session technology, you can write to a CD-R multiple times, but you cannot erase data already on a disc. CD-RWs can be erased and rewritten. DVD-Rs and DVD+Rs are two different standards, but neither can be erased. DVD-RWs and DVD+RW's are also two different standards but can be erased. Some DVD players may only support DVD+R/RW or DVD-R/RW, or maybe neither. Dual-layer discs follow DVD-R/RW or DVD+R/RW standards, but require special burners to be used. They can store about twice as much because it literally has two writable layers. If the drive says it works for &quot;RW&quot; discs, it will also work with &quot;R&quot; discs. The software needed to operate the drive normally comes with your operating system, but I strongly recommend obtaining third party software that includes more features.  All drives come with the software necessary to operate the part fully.

You might also see a DVD-RAM drive. DVD-RAM is a very uncommon format, but it is technically superior. They use concentric tracks on the disc, instead of one long spiral, and they usually come in cartridges (which protects the disc.) These discs can be re-written more times than a DVD+RW or DVD-RW, and can operate similar to a hard disk drive.


For more information, see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-RAM Wikipedia article on DVD-RAM].

==== Floppy drives ====

These days, a floppy drive is not entirely necessary. Many new computers are manufactured without a floppy drive. However, being able to boot off a floppy disk for diagnostic purposes can be more convenient in some ways than booting off a CD. Also certain bios flash utilities as well certain OS installations sometimes require a floppy drive for certain parts of the software installation. Floppy Drives are legacy and only certain boards still come with the controller to interface with this kind of drive. If you need to purchase a floppy drive, my suggestion is make sure the motherboard supports it as well as mounting in the case for it.

“A floppy disk is a data storage medium that is composed of a disk of thin, flexible (&quot;floppy&quot;) magnetic storage medium encased in a square or rectangular plastic shell. Originally announced as the &quot;Type 1 Diskette&quot; by IBM in 1973, the industry then adopted the terms &quot;floppy disk&quot; or &quot;floppy.&quot;

=== Chassis (case), power supply and cooling ===

The case and power supply are selected based on your other component choices being made prior. The final touch is the case or shell the holds everything now and future upgrades. Choose wisely.

==== Power supply ====

A cheap power supply will work fine for many purposes, but it may not be as reliable as a more expensive one. A good power supply means that your components receive steady, even power, and a good cooling system means your components do not overheat. This tends to prolong the life of your system.  If you want to buy your power supply separately, you may want to visit an actual storefront. Your power supply must be compatible with the motherboard you are purchasing. Generally, your motherboard and power supply will conform to the ATX standard, unless it is a MICRO. A prime consideration for your power supply is the wattage output. A 500 watt power supply can provide electricity to more components, (and more power-hungry components) than a 250 watt power supply. 

Keep in mind that your power supply must have a connector for each device you intend to connect, including the motherboard! Review the amperage since Watts is only one part of the power equation. It is important to have good available amperage on all your power rails so that as power consumption increases, the power flow stays consistent and steady, in addition to the wattage draw. Make sure that the wiring is long enough to reach your parts in the case and that you have more connectors then you have components. Do not get stuck buying adapters or extensions.

Factor in going one notch up above your requirements just in case you might have a future need as well as a higher output power supply will work less to supply the needed power and in turn last longer. Whatever your total required power consumption need is plus the connectors needed to power everything, you choose the unit that will work best. Depending on the case you have chosen, will also determine the length of the wiring that extends from the power supply. Always make sure that you have enough slack to reach your components.

==== Cases and cooling ====

NOTE: When you buy a chassis, it might come with a Power Supply, but in most situations, you are purchasing just the case. All cases have some basic to complex cooling system depending on the case you choose. You can always add more cooling or a bigger power supply.

Decide whether you want your case to look attractive. Vendors now sell a variety of cases in aesthetically pleasing designs and colors. Aside from appearance, there is no benefit from a silver case with an acrylic window compared to a plain beige case.  Keep in mind that cases for higher-end gaming systems tend to have the more advanced cooling system. Retail stores whether online or brick and mortar will generally have many cases to choose from, which can range in price from $30 to $1000 dollars. Keep in mind that cooling is one of the most important factors when building a computer. Cooling in most situations is not the number one concern of the manufacturer designing the case, more over then the way it looks. Looks sell.  I would shop in person if possible for a case that looks good, but with the cooling system portion top notch.

If you feel compelled to buy a case on-line, make sure you are 100% clear on the design, size and look. You do not want to be stuck with a poor case that looked great in a picture. In some cases, you may not need to upgrade the cooling system for the case itself, but only for the computer's CPU. Still, anything that lowers the total heat will probably help the lifetime of the components. Know that you may regret your case if it has sharp edges or if it makes it difficult to get to a part you plan on frequently upgrading. The best option is to see it in person, even if you are going to buy it online, try to see it up close.

The expandability of future upgrades is important. Always choose a case one size larger with the assumption of future expansion. If the cooling system is poor then upgrade it. Fans are cheap. Just add a few more. It would be different with liquid cooled since the case realistically should cool well on air and liquid, just in case the liquid fails as well as it is good to have fresh air circulation around parts regardless how good the cooling system is. It is difference between a computer lasting two years rather than six or more. 

The main thing that you want to see is good air intake in the front with exhaust out the back of the case and top if possible. The goal is to pull air in and out quickly so that hot air is replaced with cool air. The air moving across the motherboard, video card, and hard drives becomes very important. If there is no air moving over these crucial parts then short-term failures occur. Another part you need to look at is quality. Is the mounting hardware and assembly solid? Are features such as tool-less mounting brackets sturdy and lock into place correctly? You need to make sure that everything is spaced well, and the parts are made well and there is plenty of breathing room in the case.

Lastly, I always greatly recommend upgrading the heat sink for the CPU. In normal situations, the stock heat sink is fine, but having additional cooling always helps. Especially, in stressful operating conditions such as gaming and video editing a good solid cooling system is crucial. Look for a copper sink that sits on the processor with aluminum fins with plenty of cooling surface and a good fan. The more surface that heat can disperse over at a faster rate and then cool quickly is a better system overall.

=== External output devices ===

==== Monitor ====

A good LCD screen will be crisp and clear, and may be easier on your eyes. CRT’s have become obsolete and not commonly found as far as a new purchase. LCD’s have significantly dropped in price. You have to buy according to your needs. If you have a small amount of space, choose a smaller flat panel and decide on a reason screen size. Screens are measured by a diagonal viewing area, similar to how TV’s are measured. Average sizes range from 17 to 24.  Anything larger than that becomes costly and unless you have a specific need for a large screen, such as graphic design work then I would stay with something in-between. 

Flat panel displays are not always visible from certain angles, or look odd from others. Realize that flat panel and flat screen are different things. Flat-screen only means the surface of the viewing area is flat, as opposed to flat panel screens, which are only an inch or so thick. LCD’s would be flat panel screens, not flat-screen. 

One of the big factors will be cost. The choice of screens can be mat or gloss finish. Depending on the quality of the picture you need would determine which screen is best. Mat finish does not create a glair, but the colors are not as bright and flowing as a gloss screen. The big issue with gloss is a richer color, but you need to be in an environment that will not create glare or a bad reflection. Again, regardless of the quality of the video card you have the final output is the screen. Same thing applies if you obtain a high quality monitor, but purchase a poor graphics card, all you will receive is poor quality graphics. You need to find a middle ground for both quality and price. 

“A monitor or display (sometimes called a visual display unit) is an electronic visual display for computers. The monitor comprises the display device, circuitry, and an enclosure. The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD), while older monitors use a cathode ray tube (CRT).”

=== Peripherals ===

==== Keyboard and mouse ====

If you are building an inexpensive computer for general office use or basic home computing, a generic mouse and keyboard may be fine. Optical mice, trackball, and ball mice are your options. Optical mice do not need to be cleaned VS a ball mouse, which accumulates lint on the inside of the housing. Be aware that laser-based optical mice are available, and are generally more accurate.  Always build the computer to the purpose. When shopping for a mouse mainly what you are looking for is comfort and resolution. Resolution refers to how precise the movement of the mouse is.

Keyboards come in many sizes and shapes. My suggestion is various keyboards will suit your needs, but what it comes down to is comfort, style, and how many additional functions it might have. For example would be a keyboard with audio controls built on. My suggestion is visit a local store and experience the feel and comfort of different models. It is not something I would recommend to purchase online. Regardless of how nice it looks and how many functions it has, it comes down to comfort.  Especially for something that you will be using for long durations, comfort is important.

“In computing, a mouse is a pointing device that functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. Physically, a mouse consists of an object held under one of the user's hands, with one or more buttons. (Although traditionally a button is typically round or square, modern mice have spring-loaded regions of their top surface that operate switches when pressed down lightly.) It sometimes features other elements, such as &quot;wheels&quot;, which allow the user to perform various system-dependent operations, or extra buttons or features that can add more control or dimensional input. The mouse's motion typically translates into the motion of a cursor on a display, which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface.”

“In computing, a keyboard is an input device, partially modeled after the typewriter keyboard, which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys, to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.”

==== Operating systems ====

Since the focus of this page is to talk about choosing the parts needed to build a system there is some strong weight on the type of operating system you choose. I have already mentioned details about how relevant the OS is when picking parts in the beginning of the page, so I will recommend visiting the following links for more information:

== Safety and precaution ==

=== ESD precautions ===

*ESD: Electro Static Discharge
*Have a reliable ground point available near the work site
*Connect your body to the ground point with a wrist strap
*Keep all components in anti-static containers until required
*Handle PC components only on a grounded anti-static work surface
*Do not wear clothing or handle objects which generate ESD


=== ACPI power ===

*In an ACPI enabled motherboard, the system is never really “off”  unless unplugged, or the master power switch is turned off  
*There is the risk of damaging not only the component being installed/removed, but the motherboard as well, if power is not completely off
*Many motherboard manufacturers have installed an LED on the board itself to remind the user of the power state

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic MUMPS Syntax - Lines, Spaces, WhiteSpace, Comments ==

MUMPS syntax was designed to be concise in a time of scarce memory. This serves a purpose now in that programs are cognitively concise: a lot more fits in view on a screen or on a page of paper.

*The basic language structure is &lt;font color=red&gt;command&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;command-separator&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=orange&gt;argument&lt;/font&gt;. 
** The &lt;font color=red&gt;command&lt;/font&gt; may be one of the MUMPS commands, like &quot;SET&quot; or &quot;WRITE&quot;
** The &lt;font color=blue&gt;command-separator&lt;/font&gt; is written as a single space (or blank) between command (SET) and the arguments.
** The &lt;font color=orange&gt;argument&lt;/font&gt; depends on the command.
*** The &lt;font color=orange&gt;argument&lt;/font&gt; can be a list of &lt;font color=green&gt;single-arguments&lt;/font&gt; (separated by commas) or a &lt;font color=green&gt;single-argument&lt;/font&gt;.
*** Each &lt;font color=green&gt;single-argument&lt;/font&gt; usually is in the form of an &lt;font color=pink&gt;expression&lt;/font&gt; or group of &lt;font color=pink&gt;expression&lt;/font&gt;, separated by colons. 
*separating each command may be multiple spaces for readability. 
*Another command may follow a space on the same line.
         SET X=1    SET Y=2
*Whitespace - eol is NOT treated as equivalent to space. Each has different role in MUMPS. 
*Tabs are also NOT equivalent to a space, but are sometimes treated like space to delineate a label. Traditional MUMPS editors (IDEs) sometimes treat tabs specially, but do not put the tab character into the MUMPS routine.
*Lines are significant to the syntax as each line starts with a tag(line label) and a space or a space when there is no label.
*Comments start with semicolon (;) and go to the end of the line. A line may start with ; and is all comment.
*There is no command termination character (like ; in java or Perl) other than the eol or a space following the argument.
*Assignment requires the explicit command SET or S
         SET X=1,Y=2  ;   either form full or [[MUMPS Programming/OneLetterCommands|abbreviated command]] S
         S X=1,Y=2    ;  
*There is no syntactic role for braces {}
*Expressions are grouped by parenthesis

*Programs ('routines' in traditional MUMPS terminology) have a unique name and consist of a linear sequence of lines.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Logical operator ==

=== Boolean operator ===

 X : Boolean := A &lt; 10 {{Ada/kw|or}} A &gt; 20;

=== Boolean shortcut operator ===

In the below example the function &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; is only called when &lt;tt&gt;F(X)&lt;/tt&gt; returns the value ''False''.

 {{Ada/kw|if}} F(X) {{Ada/kw|or}} {{Ada/kw|else}} G(Y) {{Ada/kw|then}}
 
     Walk_The_Dog;
  
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};

This shortcut operator is sometimes used to speed up the evaluation of boolean expressions, but the Ada Style Guide recommends to compare the performance of both forms before switching one to the other. In general, it is good idea to use {{Ada/kw|or}} {{Ada/kw|else}}  in sake of performance only when the second expression involves a function call.

The {{Ada/kw|or}} {{Ada/kw|else}} form is also used when the second expression is known to raise an exception unless the first expression is ''False''.

Unlike C/C++, Ada short-cut operators are not the standard way to evaluate boolean expressions. This is because Ada is designed to do by default what is generally safer, but lets the programmer request a different behaviour.

=== Boolean operator on arrays ===

The or operator is applied to each pair of boolean elements from the left and right arrays. The result has the same bounds as the left operand.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Month_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean;
 
 X : Month_Array := Function_1;
 Y : Month_Array := Function_2;
 Z : Month_Array := X {{Ada/kw|or}} Y;

=== Bitwise operator ===

The operator '''or''' could be used with [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|modular types]] to perform bitwise operations.

== Select statement ==

=== delay ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think this page should focus on the Sequence ADT, of which vector, linked list, and [http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/nautilus/cut-n-paste-code/gsequence/ GSequence] are instances.
:GSequence has been put in the Advanced book.
Then Vector and Linked List can be presented with their efficiency tradeoffs. I'm thinking of Vector as distinct from [[Data_Structures/Arrays|Array]] because Vector supports resizing and the full Sequence interface. Thoughts? --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 20:11, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:I think the chapter should introduce first an abstract ADT that represents ordered collections of objects, i.e. &quot;list&quot; in the most general sense. Then, the array and linked-list representations can implement that ADT, both of which include a very, very simple iterator data type (with '''has-next''' and '''get-next''' for example, and nothing else). The array implementation of the abstract list ADT can then include the extra resizing (i.e., array copying) operations to ''be'' a vector. A final section could then show the tradeoffs and how, for example, inserting an item in the middle of a large vector is impractical, and how indexing the ''n''th element of a long linked-list is impractical.
:Note that the introduction has already covered chains of nodes, so conceptually introducing a linked-list won't be hard: it's just a wrapper, really, around node chains: in a node chain, an empty list is represented by a null pointer, and thus you cannot send messages to it. In a linked-list (if it implements the list ADT), you can always send messages, like get-size, even when there are no elements. (I think people get too caught up with &quot;linked-lists&quot; and miss the point that abstraction can insulate you from these details.) Overall, I'd rather the point about abstraction be the key message of the chapter (and the critical role that iterators play in isolating us from array or chains of nodes representations) than about the nifty but not as insightful point about efficiency. (It of course should be mentioned, but need not consume more than a couple of paragraphs.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:38, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::The page goes in this general direction now. Unless you have some further comments/change suggestions, I'll refactor this discussion in a few days to something like the following, except more coherent because I'll do it when I'm awake:
:::This page should focus on the benefits of abstraction. The tradeoffs involved in choosing between linked lists and vectors are an important side note, but should remain a side note and not distract from the main message, that when you do things through an ADT, it's easier to write your code generally and not have to change it later. --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 07:06, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Side note: the array chapter needs to be simplified as well.
::I think the arrays chapter covers the information it needs to, even if it's not in the best form. I'm going to treat its simplification as low priority until the rest of the chapters at least have an overview. --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 07:06, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== WikiBook pseudocode ==

When writing  [[Data_Structures/Introduction]] I noticed that in [[Data_Structures/Introduction]] you use &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; ... &lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt; and here  &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; ...  &lt;code&gt;end while &lt;/code&gt; - Would be nice if you could make your mind up and which should I use for above article?

*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
*6 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]] 
*5 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 tablespoon dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] tomato juice or V8
*3 beef bouillon cubes
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]] to taste

*Garnish - [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] wedges and [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]

Makes 6 cups of chili.

==Procedure==
#Cut chuck roast into bite-size pieces or form ground beef into small meatballs (1 inch - 25mm in size).
#[[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] beef in cooking oil until outside is browned.
#Add minced garlic and cook for two minutes.
#Combine chili powder, flour, oregano and cumin in bowl and mix well. Sprinkle mixture over cooking beef and stir until beef is well coated with spice mixture. Cook for 1 minute.
#Add tomato juice and bullion cubes. Stir for about 15 seconds.
#[[Cookbook:Simmering|Simmer]] for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
#Remove from heat and add salt and black pepper to taste.

==Notes, tips and variations==

#Cool and refrigerate overnight to develop flavors (if you can wait; if not, enjoy).
#Heat and serve in bowls with 1 tablespoon of lime juice and 1 tablespoon of sour cream added to top.
#Serve with [[Cookbook:Corn Bread|cornbread]] or [[Cookbook:Sourdough Bread|sourdough bread]].
#For a cool treat, spoon a tablespoon of Ranch Dressing on top of your chili, along with some cheese!

==Warnings==

The term Design Patterns can confuse you at first, or it can seem like something incredibly difficult. In fact it is nothing more than convenient ways of identifying, labelling and coding general solutions to recurring design problems.

So design patterns are nothing more than commonly occurring patterns in design that are repeatable and generalist enough to be written down and named as software design constructs that all can commonly identify and apply. Note however that a design pattern refers to the logical structure of the code, what it does and how it addresses the issues, not on direct code portability across projects, but in the portability of the way design issues can be addressed.

Imagine yourself working in a project team and someone just wrote a class and is trying to explain to you that only one instance is allowed. Instead the person could simply say &quot;The class I just wrote is a Singleton&quot;.

Patterns can be classified in different categories, of which the main categories are: Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns and Behavioral Patterns.

      <comment>Minor upgrade due to Ada 2012 is the current Ada standard.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Ada/Navigation|2005}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This is an overview of the major features that are available in '''Ada 2005''', the version of the Ada standard that was accepted by ISO in January 2007 (to differentiate it from its predecessors [[Ada Programming/Ada 83|Ada 83]] and [[Ada Programming/Ada 95|Ada 95]], the informal name Ada 2005 is generally agreed on). For the rationale and a more detailed (and very technical) description, see the [http://www.ada-auth.org/AI-XREF.HTML#Amend_Doc Amendment] to the Ada Reference Manual following the links to the last version of every Ada Issue document (AI).

Although the standard is now published, not all compilers will be able to handle it. Many of these additions are already implemented by the following [[w:Free Software|Free Software]] compilers:
* [http://libre.adacore.com/ GNAT GPL Edition]
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC 4.1]
* [http://www.adacore.com/home/gnatpro/ GNAT Pro 6.0.2] (the AdaCore supported version) is a complete implementation.
After downloading and installing any of them, remember to use the &lt;code&gt;-gnat05&lt;/code&gt; switch when compiling Ada 2005 code. Note that Ada 2005 is the default mode in GNAT GPL 2007 Edition.

== Language features ==

=== Character set ===

Not only does Ada 2005 now support a new 32-bit character type &amp;mdash; called &lt;tt&gt;Wide_Wide_Character&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; but the source code itself may be of this extended character set as well. Thus Russians and Indians, for example, will be able to use their native language in identifiers and comments. And mathematicians will rejoice: The whole Greek and fractur character sets are available for identifiers. For example, [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Ada.Numerics|Ada.Numerics]] will be extended with a new constant:

 &amp;pi; : {{Ada/kw|constant}} := Pi;

This is not a new idea &amp;mdash; [[w:GNAT|GNAT]] always had the &lt;tt&gt;-gnati''c''&lt;/tt&gt; compiler option to specify the character set [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_ugn_unw/Character-Set-Control.html]. But now this idea has become standard, so all Ada compilers will need to support [[w:Unicode|Unicode 4.0]] for identifiers &amp;mdash; as the new standard requires.

See also:

* {{Ada/95/AI|285|Support for 16-bit and 32-bit characters}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|388|Add Greek pi to Ada.Numerics}}

=== Interfaces ===

Interfaces allow for a limited form of multiple inheritance similar to Java and C#.

You find a full description here: [[Ada Programming/Object Orientation#Interfaces|Ada Programming/OO]].

See also:
* {{Ada/95/AI|251|Abstract Interfaces to provide multiple inheritance}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|345|Protected and task interfaces}}

=== Union ===

In addition to Ada's safe variant record an unchecked C style union is now available.

You can find a full description here: [[Ada Programming/Types/record#Union]].

See also: 

* {{Ada/95/AI|216|Unchecked unions -- variant records with no run-time discriminant}}
* {{Ada/2005/RMA3|B|3|3|Pragma Unchecked_Union}}

=== With ===

The with statement got a massive upgrade. First there is the new [[Ada Programming/Packages#Limited_with|limited with]] which allows two packages to ''with'' each other. Then there is [[Ada Programming/Packages#Private_with|private with]] to make a package only visible inside the private part of the specification.

See also: 
* {{Ada/95/AI|217|Limited With Clauses|alt=6}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|262|Access to private units in the private part}}

=== Access types ===

==== Not null access ====

An access type definition can specify that the access type can never be null.

See [[Ada Programming/Types/access#Not null access]].

See also: {{Ada/95/AI|231|Access-to-constant parameters and null-excluding access subtypes}}

==== Anonymous access ====

The possible uses of anonymous access types are extended. They are allowed virtually in every type or object definition, including access to subprogram parameters. Anonymous access types may point to constant objects as well. Also, they could be declared to be not null.

With the addition of the following operations in package {{Ada/package|Standard}}, it is possible to test the equality of anonymous access types.

    {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;=&quot; (Left, Right : ''universal_access'') {{Ada/kw|return}} Boolean;
    {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;/=&quot;(Left, Right : ''universal_access'') {{Ada/kw|return}} Boolean;

See [[Ada Programming/Types/access#Anonymous access]].

See also:
* {{Ada/95/AI|230|Generalized use of anonymous access types}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|385|Stand-alone objects of anonymous access types}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|318|Limited and anonymous access return types|alt=2}}

== Language library ==

=== Containers ===

A major addition to the language library is the generic packages for containers. If you are familiar with the C++ STL,
you will likely feel very much at home using {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers}}.
One thing, though: Ada is a block structured language. Many ideas of how to use the STL 
employ this feature of the language. For example, local subprograms can be supplied to iteration schemes.

The original Ada Issue text {{Ada/95/AI|302| Container library|alt=3}} has now been transformed into
{{Ada/2005/RM2|A|18|Containers}}.

If you know how to write Ada programs, and have a need for vectors, lists, sets, or maps (tables), please have a look
at the {{Ada/95/AI|302|AI Text|alt=3}} mentioned above. There is an ''!example'' section in the text explaining the
use of the containers in some detail.
Matthew Heaney provides a number of demonstration programs
with his reference implementation of AI-302
({{Ada/package|Ada|Containers}}) which you can find at
[http://charles.tigris.org tigris].

In [[Ada Programming/Containers]] you will find a demo using containers.

'''Historical side note''': The C++ STL draws upon the work of
David R. Musser
and
Alexander A. Stepanov.
For some of their studies of generic programming, they had been using Ada 83.
The [http://www.stepanovpapers.com/ Stepanov Papers Collection] has a few publications available.

=== Scan Filesystem Directories and Environment Variables ===

See also: 
* {{Ada/95/AI|248|Directory Operations}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|370|Environment variables}}

=== Numerics ===

Besides the new constant of package {{Ada/package|Ada.Numerics}} (see [[Ada Programming/Ada 2005#Character Set|Character Set]] above), the most important addition are the packages to operate with vectors and matrices.

See also:
* {{Ada/95/AI|388|Add Greek pi (π) to Ada.Numerics}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|296|Vector and matrix operations}}

(Related note on Ada programming tools:
AI-388 contains an interesting assessment of how compiler writers are bound
to perpetuate the lack of handling of international characters in programming support tools for now.
As an author of Ada programs, be aware that your tools provider or Ada consultant
could recommend that the program text be 7bit ASCII only.)

== Real-Time and High Integrity Systems==

* {{Ada/95/AI|297|Timing events}}

* {{Ada/95/AI|266|Task termination procedure|alt=2}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|386|Further functions returning Time_Span values}}

* {{Ada/95/AI|305|New pragma and additional restriction identifiers for real-time systems}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|347|Title of Annex H}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|265|Partition Elaboration Policy for High-Integrity Systems}}

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.59}}

In this module, you will create a new material called &quot;green ooze&quot;.  Along the way, you will learn how to alter the diffuse, specular, and mirror colors of a material.

== Your First Material ==
[[Image:Blender-2.5_materials.png|thumb|180px|'''Figure 1:''' The Materials context in the Properties window.]]

The cube in the default scene (which you get from ''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings'') has a simple grey color. Now click on the Materials context [[File:materials_button.png]] in the Properties [[File:Blender269PropertiesIcon.png]] window.

The materials context contains various menus, but for now you only need diffuse, specular and mirror.
The material is named and linked in the panel above the preview window.  ({{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Linking}} is a feature that allows materials to be shared between multiple objects (or datablocks).  Changing a material affects the appearance of everything it is linked to.)

The first row of the window above the preview window indicates that:               
* there is one material assigned to this object and its name is &quot;Material&quot;.

The second row of controls indicates that:                                        
* The current selected material's name is &quot;Material&quot;.
* This material will only be saved if it's in use.
* It is not a &quot;Nodes&quot; material.
* Instead of being linked directly to an object, the current material is linked to a datablock.

To rename the material, click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the name and enter the name you want.

To unlink the material, click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the '''X''' button to the right of the material name (&quot;Material&quot;).  This deletes the link to the datablock, removing the material from the mesh.  As a side-effect, most of the panels in the Material context disappear. You will see in a moment, however, that the material still exists. It hasn't been deleted; it is simply no longer in use.


At this point, you could click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the &quot;New&quot; button to create a new material, but instead we are going to reapply the old material:
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the [[File:Next new button.png]] button to the left of the &quot;New&quot; button.
# You'll see a nifty drop-down list containing all materials you've created so far.  Choose ''0 Material''.

Materials whose names are preceded by &quot;0&quot; in this list are not in use.  By default, Blender doesn't save such materials when it saves the scene.  Thus, you can delete a material from the list by saving the scene and then reopening it.  You can override this behavior by toggling the &quot;F&quot; button &quot;on&quot; for unused materials you want saved.


Your materials will be much easier to find and manage if you give them brief, descriptive names you can recognize at a glance.  Change this one's name to &quot;Green Ooze&quot;. In addition, naming of your materials and other objects in your scene is useful when such components of your scene will be appended in another scene of a different Blender file. Naming your materials and other stuff in the scene will enable you to choose the right objects and materials you need whenever you wish to append just a portion of a whole bunch of work you did. For instance, you're working on a new Blender project, but felt the material you used in this Blender file is worth it. Instead of going through the pain of creating a new material (of course you guessed in the initial one in getting the right material appearance), you just append the material to your new work. Pretty simple! Make naming a habit, as it's much used in a production environment.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==Specifying Colors==
Since changing the name of the material doesn't change its properties, you still have some work to do.


Simple materials are specified by three colors: diffuse, specular and mirror. Rectangular patches (''swatches'') of the colour in their own panel in the Material context allow you to see and change each of these. Diffuse color is the basic underlying color of the material, rendered by the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|diffuse shader}}. Specular color is for highlights (small bright spots on a shiny surface) as rendered by the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|specular shader}}. Mirror color is for true reflections rendered using ray-tracing.

There are many ways to define colours. Blender supports three:

* RGB: By specifying relative amounts of red, green and blue ''primary colours'', by giving a number from 0.0 to 1.0 for each component. For example, (R, G, B) = (0, 0, 0) specifies black (no colour at all); (0, 1, 0) is full green; (1, 1, 0) (full red + full green) is yellow; (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) is 50% grey, and (1, 1, 1) is full white (maximum intensity of all components). Note that this is ''additive mixing'' of colours, which is what happens when you shine lights of different colours onto a white screen, not the ''subtractive mixing'' that takes place when you mix different-coloured paints or inks on paper or canvas.
* HSV: By specifying a ''hue'' (colour position on the rainbow) together with a ''saturation'' (strength of colour, from garish down to pastel, with zero giving shades of grey) and ''value'' (brightness). This is generally considered to be easier to use than RGB notation when you are trying to create new colours (as opposed to copying a colour spec from somewhere else), since it is easier to predict what the likely result will be. HSV is commonly represented on a ''colour wheel'', where the hue is the angle around the circle, saturation the distance from the centre, and value controlled by a separate brightness slider (as shown below).
* By specifying a 6-digit hexadecimal number. This is just an alternative form of RGB notation, commonly used for colour specifications in Web pages.

[[File:Color wheel numbered.png|framed|Blender’s colour picker popup]] 
If you click on any colour swatch, the colour picker will pop up, allowing you to change the values. This is the most intuitive way. The window that appears will look like this and will include the following (Figure 2):
# A color wheel to change the color as you want. In HSV mode, H corresponds to angle around this wheel, while S corresponds to distance from the centre.
# Three color sliders that will change if you change the color in the colorwheel. You can also change the values with the sliders.
# A slider that controls the intensity of the color. This corresponds to the V in HSV.
# A pipette capable of sampling colors from any Blender window or render window.
# Buttons that can change it to &quot;HSV&quot; or &quot;HEX&quot; mode.

* Alternatively you can specify hue, saturation and value components by clicking  {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}  on the &quot;HSV&quot; button and pushing the sliders around accordingly.

* You can also press the last button and enter the hexadecimal (or HEX) code. This is simply a different representation for RGB, where the hex digits represent ''rrggbb''.

HSV is probably the most easily understandable way of specifying and experimenting with colours. However, as is common with most computer systems, all colours in Blender are represented internally as RGB.

If you want to get rid of the window just click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} anywhere else.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Duplicate intensity sliders?'''
There are two ways to control the intensity of the colour: there is the vertical intensity slider at the right of the colour picker popup, and there are also the intensity fields at the bottom of the Diffuse and Specular panels (above), the final intensity being the combination of both values. Why two different ways?

Partly this is to allow a quick way to moderate or intensify the diffuse or specular components, without having to change the actual colour specification. But more importantly, this is to ensure that ''intensities are never set to 100%''. The reason is that this can cause rendering calculation problems, leading to total light intensities accumulating to infinity instead of converging to a finite value. This is probably not a big issue with the Blender Internal renderer, but can become a problem with [[../Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Rendering|more advanced renderers]].
}}

{{Clear}}

The most used method of creating a color of your own is using the color wheel, but because we want to be sure you will get the exact same color as us we will use the sliders. Use the above methods to set the diffuse color to R=0.149, G=1.000, B=0.446 (or use the HEX code: 6CFFB2). If you look in the &quot;Preview&quot; panel, you will see that the material is now bright green.

Most real-life materials (other than metals) don't alter the color of specular light. For this reason, Specular and Mirror are usually left at their default values (white). For green ooze, however, you'll disregard this rule-of-thumb:

# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the sample rectangle below the Specular window.
# Use the color selection dialog to adjust the specular color and watch the Preview panel to see how this color affects the sample sphere's highlight.
# Set the specular color to R=0.640, G=0.990, B=0.566 (or use the HEX code: D1FEC6). 

With these values for Color and Specular, you should be able to get a good ooze later on. The Preview, Diffuse and Specular panel should now look like this:

[[File:Green ooze.png]]
[[File:Green ooze props.png]]

As you can see, there are many other material buttons.  Many of these will be explained in later modules.  Suggestions for creating specific materials may be found in {{B3D:N2P/Module|Every Material Known to Man}}.

Save this scene before proceeding.  You will need it for {{B3D:N2P/Module|Quickie Texture}}, in which you will perfect your ooze.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Copying/Pasting Colours:''' Quite often, you will want to duplicate or move a colour specified in one place to another. If the two colour swatches are simultaneously visible, you can use the eyedropper button in the colour picker. But if they are not, then the easiest way is to bring up the colour picker for the colour you want to copy, switch to the hex display, select the 6 hex digits, and copy them with {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|C}}. Then go to the colour you want to make the same, bring up its picker in hex mode, select the hex digits, and replace them with what you copied using {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|V}}.}}

==What is a resource book and why a resource book for investigations?==
It may be useful first to start by considering what a resource book is not.
You can't open a resource book and expect to find the answers to every question on
every topic covered in the resource book because it is not an encyclopaedia. You can't
open a resource book and expect to find every definition of every term and concept
because a resource book is not a dictionary. You can't unfold a resource book and find
the exact route between this idea and that one because it is not an atlas. You can't
open a resource book and expect to find an exhaustive list of quick and easy methods
for performing every activity on every topic because a resource book is not a recipe
book. And you can't expect to find a detailed explanation of every important concept
and how to grasp and understand it because a resource book is not a textbook. So if a
resource book is none of these things it begs two questions: what exactly is it? And, if it
is to be of any use at all, what must it do?
Â·
*A resource book might be called a &quot;starter pack&quot;. It could contain elements of each
feature mentioned above and could look like an encyclopaedia, or a dictionary, or an
atlas, or a recipe book, or a textbook. But it won't contain enough of any one
feature to call it that thing alone.
Â·
*What resource books do contain are: ideas that start us on a critical re-think of areas
we may have taken for granted. They also contain:
**hints, suggestions and ideas that start us thinking in new directions;
**leads that start us developing completely new ideas;
**some useful information on specific topics;
**directions to other sources containing yet more useful information;
**examples that illustrate ideas or plans e.g. lesson worksheets;
**suggestions for actions that we can take to achieve certain goals.

'''This resource book is about investigations''', mainly in science, somewhat in
mathematics, to a small degree in technology and occasionally a combination of all
three. Examples show how the investigation of some science topics involve a lot of
good mathematics learning, and vice versa. When we do an investigation we make use
of whatever tools and methods we can to find answers and increase our knowledge on a
topic. We may even invent methods that help us, as Sir Isaac Newton did to help him
develop his theory of gravity, discussed in the next section.

Some resource books are more comprehensive than others, but none is ever complete.
The primary aim of this resource book is to put you on the right road and get you started
on a journey. The journey is one of discovery therefore it cannot be mapped out
perfectly ahead of time It may not give you all the answers to your every question but it
will give you enough support and encouragement to get you going again Â­ in this case
on how to use investigations in your science and mathematics teaching.

===Why a resource book for investigations?===
South Africa and South Africans have performed a social and political miracle over the
past decade. But no society or nation prospers on warm, fuzzy feelings of political self-
satisfaction. To perform the next stage of our miracle, South Africa's economy must
grow. Economies need raw materials like minerals and agricultural products to do so.
But as we say, while raw materials are necessary, they are not sufficient. Real economic
growth only comes about when we have people with the skills to make our natural
resources work for us. It's a simple equation, really:

'''Raw materials  +  well-educated, skilled people = high quality products  +  economic growth.'''

A growing economy means more people with jobs, better prospects and more fulfilling
lives. That is the payoff for anyone backing either of the terms in the left hand side of
our equation! The prospector for raw materials and those who promote good education
in important areas of the curriculum are performing similar services for the country. As
we peel away the layers of the growth equation, we find that certain disciplines are
critically important in growing a modern economy, notably mathematics, language and
science. Close on their heels are technology and entrepreneurship.

This resource book aims, through investigations in science, mathematics and
technology, to teach the following skills critical to economic growth:

*Learning to &lt;u&gt;look&lt;/u&gt; rather than just seeing

*&lt;u&gt;Understanding concepts&lt;/u&gt; in science and mathematics by working with them in
relevant, practical situations, not merely studying them theoretically.

*&lt;u&gt;Collecting evidence&lt;/u&gt; (data) from real-life situations and using mathematical tools to
make sense of it.

*&lt;u&gt;Designing and making devices&lt;/u&gt; and apparatus to help in the collection of data (e.g.
making measurements) during the investigation.

*&lt;u&gt;Developing and using creativity, ingenuity and insight&lt;/u&gt; in investigations.

*&lt;u&gt;Taking initiative&lt;/u&gt; in the solving of problems.

Our hope is that by encouraging learner independence in the new curriculum, we will aid
the development of critical, economic skills. The connection may seem slight but those
skills are absolutely necessary to set South Africa on its economic renaissance.
Although it is a cliche, it really is true that every journey begins with the first step! This
resource book on investigations is intended to be that first step, or at least to help it.

==MESSAGE FROM MARK SHUTTLEWORTH==
It has been an honour to meet educators around South Africa who create, in their pupils, a sense of wonder about the worlds of science, technology and entrepreneurship. South Africa, sitting as it does at the intersection of cultures and economies, is an unexpectedly good place to think about technology and science. We have a track record of achieving remarkable results in science and engineering, much of that thanks to the educators who have inspired children to take an interest in the world in which they live. I hope this resource book helps to spread that sense of wonder while also recognising the work of a few out of the many who make such a difference.

==PREFACE BY SIPHO DLAMINI==
It is a little surprising that only now, after more than a decade of curriculum innovation in South Africa and with increasing emphasis on Curriculum 2005, we are starting to provide resource books for GET and FET mathematics and science teachers. The Shuttleworth Foundation is taking the initiative in producing a series of resource books that encourage teachers and curriculum developers to rethink and re-engineer how we should teach science and mathematics in schools. We cannot forget that teachers must also be curriculum developers for the process of curriculum innovation to prosper. 

Mathematics and science curriculum development has three domains: the cognitive, the so-called conative and the affective. Cognitive development is concerned with knowledge and understanding. In mathematics and science this means key concepts and factual knowledge and these are identified and described in the Revise National Curriculum Statements as Learning Outcomes . Conative development is concerned with the practical and procedural knowledge found in science process skills and mathematical problem solving abilities, also described in the RNCS. Affective development is concerned with emotional, social, cultural and moral development. This is an important, although often forgotten, aspect of learning - and hence teaching. Its importance is recognized by the learning outcomes in various Department of Education policy documents and, importantly, the critical and developmental outcomes that underpin our whole education effort. 

What, in the new curriculum, should be taught and learnt in school mathematics and science? Here are some answers to the question, in one possible direction. The kind of mathematics and science that needs to be taught in schools must give learners a confident grasp of content knowledge and understanding  the procedural skills to know how mathematicians and scientists work  and appropriate attitudes to mathematics and science and their value and use in society and economy. This resource book illustrates the curricular relevance of independent investigation in achieving these teaching and learning goals. 

Peter Glover has been active mainly in the science education world. He has taught, lectured and researched curriculum development. He has been director of an innovative curriculum organization, the Primary Science Programme, and has managed reform projects such as the Thlatloga Project, from which much material in this book emanates. He has developed and written science, technology and mathematics materials for Tlhatloga and elsewhere, including textbooks. Through his work he has always insisted on learner-directed, activity based approaches  on the total immersion of teachers in their professional development activities  and in the creation of communities of professionals, especially through the formation of effective, mutual-support clusters of schools. In this resource book, he gives a sense of the best practice with which educators could enthuse learners to genuinely participate in mathematics and science, even in our many schools which still have the barest minimum of basic resources. It is therefore heart-warming to note that some of the materials in the book have been developed and used by the successful educators who were selected in the Maths and Science Teacher of the Year (MSTotY) competition. They share with us some very useful ideas on assessment practice and implementation. 

I hope that this resource book and the series that will follow will help many educators to develop themselves into innovative mathematics and science educators in ways that are both satisfying to them and stimulating to their learners.

==ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SOURCES OF MATERIALS==
Some of the material in this book is the work of individual winners or runners up in the Maths and Science Teacher of the Year (MSTotY) 2003 competition e.g. materials they developed and presented as part of their portfolios for adjudication in Chapter 7. Individuals whose work is reproduced here are acknowledged in the book. The contents of Chapter 3, The wisdom of the winners: hints and ideas for science and mathematics educators   Chapter 4, Ideas for investigations and Chapter 8, Clusters, support networks and communities of practice is largely the product of a workshop held over three days when the MSTotY 2003 winners came together in Johannesburg in March 2004. The examples in Chapter 6 were written for the Tlhatloga Project, a development project for Intermediate Phase educators by the University of Montana Western from 2000 2003. Chapter 5 is based on material developed by Maryna de Lange, winner of the 2002 MSTotY award. Many of the ideas for investigation topics in Chapter 4 also came from Maryna whose classes at Saldanha Bay Primary are doing regular investigations. Finally, Chapters 1, 2, 9 and 10 were either written or compiled by the editor, sometimes with re-formatting. Other materials written or edited by the editor appear in Chapter 6. The investigation into numbers in Chapter 6 was developed by Professor Otis Thompson, formerly of the University of Montana Western. Three hundred teachers who took part in the Tlhatloga Project know the pleasure of his stimulating mathematical company. 

There are many references in Chapter 10 to material from the web, a rich resource for educators with internet access. One hopes that in the not too distant future all educators will be able to use information from the web to the benefit of their teaching. The Shuttleworth Foundation s efforts should speed this process. 

The names and contact details of the MSTotY 2003 winners and runners up are recorded here. Experienced colleagues are still an educator's best resource and the MSTotY finalists are, almost by definition, more committed to this than most. Every one, in his or her own way, is willing to help with the establishment of science and mathematics support networks and clusters. Most have already done so.

==Introduction to the book and its theme: investigations==
The theme of this resource book is investigations. Investigation is important to science,
mathematics, engineering and technology educators because investigation lies at the
heart of those disciplines. In the natural sciences, we investigate phenomena in our
physical and biological environments, both the seen and unseen and both the very large
and very small. In mathematics we investigate abstract ideas that arise from our chosen
axioms. We look for mathematical relationships between variables that we study and we
seek mathematical models in the quest to find the &quot;best fit&quot; between physical reality or
human activities and the data we collect about them. In technology we investigate
problems arising out of human &quot;needs and wants&quot; and we seek the best or optimal
solutions to those problems. We are homo sapiens not so much because we &lt;u&gt;are wise&lt;/u&gt;
but because we are forever trying to &lt;u&gt;become wiser&lt;/u&gt; and to know and understand more
and better than we did before.

How do we know this? Well, just start by looking at children and the way young, pre-
school children will probe, examine, try out, explore and inquire if they are left to
themselves in an unfamiliar but friendly environment. What children do is natural to the
type of being we are. Unfortunately the way we teach children - more than the actual
content of our teaching - often removes the natural spirit of inquiry more than
encourages it.

We can also look at the lives of any of the great scientists, mathematicians, engineers
and technologists who could also be regarded as inventors. Some of them may have
been motivated by their pride, their competitive nature, a desire to &quot;be the first&quot; or the
desire to claim authorship of an idea and be recognized by their peers and by history.
Others may have been driven by commercial motives and what they stood to make from
their discoveries and inventions. But the deepest and most common motivation of all
scientists, mathematicians, engineers and technologists finds expression in three,
simple, human needs:

1. the need to know more;

2. the need to understand better; and

3. the need to find solutions to problems (and the need to make a device work well).

===Six great mathematical and scientific investigators===

&lt;center&gt;&quot;Science and mathematics are not everything but they are beautiful.&quot;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;(J. Robert Oppenheimer)&lt;/center&gt;

We can speculate about what drives someone to wrestle doggedly with a problem for
years and years, even when no obvious solution is in sight. Take someone like Andrew
Wiles, the young mathematician who found the solution to perhaps the most famous
mathematical problem of the past thousand years: Fermat's Last Theorem. Despite
having got it wrong when he first announced that he had solved the problem (and
despite the scorn of some other mathematicians at the time) he returned to the problem
(with encouragement from his friends, it must be said) and found the correct solution.

Why did he do it? Why did he sit for years in a small study and forego beautiful spring
and summer days, the company of friends, the laughter of children and the excitement
of great world events? What drives humankind to such extraordinary and single-minded
feats of the intellect? [A very readable account of Fermat's Last Theorem and the quest
to prove it can be found at [[http://www.prometheus.demon.co.uk/01/01/fermat.htm/ www.prometheus.demon.co.uk/01/01/fermat.htm]]  .
An interview with Wiles is reproduced at [[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/wiles.html/ www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/wiles.html]].

Johannes Kepler studied data about the planets for over 20 years, (1596 to 1619) before
he was able to formulate his three laws of planetary motion. What Kepler found was a
set mathematical formulae or a mathematical model that could fit the available data.
However, he only explained &lt;u&gt;that&lt;/u&gt; planets moved on the orbits they did and not &lt;u&gt;why&lt;/u&gt;. It
took one of the greatest scientific investigators of all time, Sir Isaac Newton, to give an
&lt;u&gt;explanation&lt;/u&gt; for the planets' elliptical orbits through his invention of the calculus as a
mathematical tool to help him solve the problem.

Newton did not think to publish his results until he was urged to do so by the
astronomer Edmund Halley, after whom the comet was named. Why? Probably, for
Newton, his reward was the thrill of discovery after years of investigation and the simple
satisfaction of knowing that he knew. Newton investigated many things as he fed his
insatiable curiosity about the phenomena in his universe. He is rumoured, during his
investigations of light and sight, to have inserted a probe into his eye socket to discover
how his eye was fixed in it. His eye took several weeks to recover and one hopes that
satisfying his curiosity compensated for his discomfort! He also tasted enough heavy
metal compounds to give himself mercury poisoning, a fact which probably explains his
legendary bad temper, paranoia and erratic behaviour at certain times of his life.

Michael Faraday was a man of little formal schooling and was self-taught in the ways of
scientific investigation. Yet he discovered how to generate electricity using a moving
magnet inside a coil of wire. Magnetic induction, as the effect is known, is still one of
the most important, practical discoveries ever made in physics. &quot;But what's the use of
it?&quot; asked Mr. Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) and later
Prime Minister of England. &quot;Why, sir,&quot; replied Faraday in a flash, &quot;there's every
probability that you'll soon be able to tax it.&quot; But taxes and commercial interests were
furthest from Faraday's mind during his years of investigation which led to his discovery.
He consistently refused the honours and riches that would have been lavished on him
had he chosen to accept them. In 1875, six years after Faraday's death, the German
scientist A.W. Hoffman, wrote


&lt;center&gt;
''&quot;...Faraday belonged, from the universality of the benefits conferred
by his genius on the human race, not merely to the island of his
birth, but to all the civilized countries of the globe ...&quot;''
&lt;/center&gt;


Perhaps the greatest investigator of the modern, western world in the past millennium
was an Italian painter, sculptor, anatomist, engineer and inventor called Leonardo da
Vinci. Some have called him &quot;the Renaissance Man&quot;. (The word &quot;renaissance&quot; means
&quot;rebirth&quot;.) For many centuries in Europe a tight lid had been kept on the spirit of
investigation. It was as though the authorities, both religious and secular, believed that if
people were allowed to investigate and question freely it would result in chaos and
anarchy. The same authorities brutally discouraged people from asking awkward
questions or from investigating the unknown. What was known was known, they
seemed to say, and everyone should be satisfied with that state of affairs. But someone
forgot to tell da Vinci and he studied and investigated everything that caught his interest.
And that was just about everything. He dissected dead animals. He dissected dead
humans. He made such accurate and detailed sketches of the muscles in these bodies
that they have never really been improved on. He drew plans for a winged flying
machine after studying birds in flight, parachutes after watching falling leaves and a type
of helicopter after studying seeds falling from pods. He never built them because the
light, strong materials he would have needed did not exist as they do today. But he
imagined and designed them nonetheless. And Leonardo da Vinci lived from 1452 to
1519!

Albert Einstein's particular genius was to investigate crazy questions in his mind.
&quot;What,&quot; asked Einstein, &quot;would I see if I traveled on a beam of light?&quot; By using his
imagination, he found an answer to his question, which surprised even him. But his
belief in his conclusion, even though it contradicted what every other theoretical
physicist believed at the time, led him to state &quot;imagination is more important than
knowledge.&quot; Another great scientist of his day, Max Planck, explained his observations
of heat radiating from an object by cautiously suggesting that energy might occur as
tiny, separate &quot;packets&quot; rather than a steady, unbroken stream. He was so disturbed by
his own conclusion that he immediately began looking for ways to disprove it. Again,
Einstein used his amazing imagination to prove Planck's theory.

===Investigations in the curriculum===
So how do we justify investigation in the curriculum? Easy. Investigations develop
important skills e.g. identifying interesting questions; systematically seeking answers to
puzzling questions; and solving intellectual and practical problems. Too many of us
spend our lives seeing our environments fleetingly through unquestioning eyes. We &lt;u&gt;see&lt;/u&gt;,
but we don't really &lt;u&gt;look&lt;/u&gt;. Educators have the responsibility to develop learners' spirit of
open-minded and active &lt;u&gt;looking&lt;/u&gt; instead of just passively seeing. Today's learner, who is
tomorrow's citizen, must learn to look at and investigate the world, not as a school
activity, but because it is a life habit. &quot;LOOK at that!&quot; &quot;Wow, that's interesting!&quot; &quot;I
wonder why it does that? I would have expected it to ... .&quot; &quot;Isn't that pattern amazing?
Is it perfectly symmetrical?&quot; &quot;Look how this has changed.&quot; &quot;I wonder when ...?&quot; and
&quot;what if ...?&quot; and &quot;how would ...?&quot; and &quot;why does ...?&quot; and &quot;why can ...?&quot; and &quot;why
should ...?&quot; And ultimately: &quot;Aha! I have found it!&quot;

In our science, mathematics and technology classes we cannot afford seeing without
looking. We must nurture curiosity and we must turn curiosity into investigate-able
questions. Learners must be taught how to ask meaningful questions and educators
must make opportunities for their learners to answer them. Above all, we must
encourage learners to dream. When you make the investigation of meaningful things a
part of your curriculum, you will find it unlocking something powerful in your learners: a
genuine enthusiasm for learning.

==The wisdom of the winners: hints and ideas for science and mathematics educators==
&lt;center&gt;&quot;Wisdom is not about saying things that no-one has ever said before but rather about
saying truths clearly that everyone else says confusedly.&quot;
(Anonymous)


&quot;Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.&quot;
(Alfred Lord Tennyson, the English poet)
&lt;/center&gt;

In the Mathematics and Science Teacher of the Year competitions, finalists are asked to
list classroom management tips, projects they have found successful and general
suggestions for educators that they have found personally useful. Many of these pieces
of teaching wisdom come from finalists in the retired educator category. It is wonderful
to meet older educators who are still enthusiastic about teaching and willing to sift
through their years of experience to pass on good advice to their younger colleagues.

In a workshop attended by all the finalists, a brainstorming session produced still more
ideas. Here are some pearls from the brainstorm and the portfolios of the 2003
Mathematics, Science and Technology Educator of the Year winners and runners up.
They provide ideas, suggestions and food for thought. Bear in mind that the list is not
meant to be exhaustive Â­ it is just a resource to spark better ideas in your own mind. If
you like anything you find here don't copy it blindly. Assess it carefully and think how it
could be adapted for your circumstances, your school and your classes. On the other
hand, don't just dismiss it saying &quot;that could never work for me because my learners are
too poor and my school is too rural and the roof is leaking and I am too overworked ...
.&quot; Good ideas apply everywhere and anywhere if you have a will to make them work.
Development for the professional educator means constantly trying new ideas and
strategies and making them work. The educator who doesn't try new ideas will never
develop and isn't very professional.

One can see from the suggestions and hints that follow why their authors are amongst
the top science and mathematics educators in the country. Most of them, it must be
said, also teach in the most disadvantaged communities in the country. The lists are
categorized alphabetically for easy reference:

'''A.''' Assisting memory

'''B.''' Change and the dynamic classroom environment

'''C.''' Classroom atmosphere

'''D.''' Classroom management

'''E.''' Developing an interest in science, technology and mathematics

'''F.''' Developing a relationship with your learners

'''G.''' Enlivening your presentation style

'''H.''' Games

'''I.''' Groups work; working in groups

'''J.''' Language issues and development

'''K.''' Links and continuity in science and mathematics teaching

'''L.''' Motivating learners

'''M.''' Policies, preparation and planning

'''N.''' Professional relationships amongst colleagues

'''O.''' Projects in and around the school

'''P.''' Respect for others

===A. Assisting memory===

*Mnemonics (eg: &quot;&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;ll &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;tudents &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;ake &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;offee&quot; = In trigonometry &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;ll functions are
positive in first quadrant, only the &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;ine is positive in second, only the &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;osine is
positive in third and only the &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;angent is positive in fourth) help learners to recall and
link content.

*Use music to memorize geometry theorems (and to relieve stress!).

*Compose rhymes and songs; reciting and singing them to memorize lists and orders.

*Dramatize events or ideas.

===B. Change and the dynamic classroom environment===
*Assign seating in the classroom according to the nature of the activity. Balance this
with opportunities for learners to sit where they want to.

*Do block tutorial where all educators co-operate in setting tutorials for learners on
key or difficult concepts. a bit confusing- which educators

*Vary your teaching and use different techniques. Don't become dull, stale and
stereotyped in your approach.

*The element of surprise: surprise your learners; give them information they were not
aware of e.g. did you know that the fuel gauge in a car uses an electric circuit with a
variable resistor to detect the amount of fuel in the tank? This encourages learners
to start asking themselves &quot;how?, stimulating inquiry and hence learning in science.

===C. Classroom atmosphere===
*Make the classroom welcoming and enjoyable to be in.

*Every lesson should be planned with an activity in mind. Lessons without activities
are like movies of actors standing still. Activities stimulate learner interest; improve
understanding; stimulate inquiry; and make learners more aware of their
environment.

*Use photographs and other visuals and maintain a notice board.

*Change the notice board's contents regularly so that it does not become a static
(and boring) display.

*Encourage learners to bring science articles from magazines and newspapers etc.
especially those that relate to problems in their community.

*Collect resource books and keep these handy in your classroom.

===D. Classroom management===
*Be friendly to learners but avoid the familiarity that breeds contempt. (A variation on
this theme is &quot;don't smile before Easter&quot;!)

*Know and take into consideration any problems specific learners may have.

*Allow learners the freedom to discuss ideas amongst themselves. Specify the time
allowed and make sure that learners stay &quot;on task.&quot;

*Keep equipment and apparatus in containers or cabinets in the classroom for
security; have teams of learners act as &quot;lab assistants&quot; to keep things clean, report
breakages and maintain equipment.

*Use waste material available in the community for teaching purposes e.g. volume
bottles made from 2-litre cold drink bottles.

*Allow learners to explain their thoughts or answers to their peers. Do not allow these
occasions to lapse into aimless (and noisy) debates based on untested assumptions
rather than logically set out arguments based on well-founded information or
knowledge.

===E. Developing an interest in science, technology and mathematics===
*Have a positive attitude to science and mathematics because like any other subject,
they can be learned and understood.

*Stress that every learner has the potential to learn and understand mathematics and
science.

*Take part in science and mathematics competitions (Expos and Olympiads). You
learn from others and improve your skills and abilities.

*Make learning mathematics and science fun.

*Let learners enact moving or bonding molecules, the motion of planets or the relative
motion of two moving bodies etc.

*Form a science and a mathematics club at your school.

*Hold regular science awareness weeks (posters, presentations etc.) especially when
they can coincide with major events.

*Hold demonstrations (with appropriate permission) to protest important local issues
(for example as part of environmental education).

*Hold mock conferences to resolve environmental problems.

*Identify patterns formed by numbers and marvel at what numbers can do. Then
start playing around with numbers to make your own patterns. You will love it!

*Make discoveries with numbers.

*Let learners do practical science and mathematics e.g. measure a tile and the whole
classroom's dimensions; now calculate requirements for tiling the whole room. How
many off-cuts etc.?

===F. Developing a relationship with your learners===
*Know your learners and not just the subject.

*Try to find out what learners' own expectations are.

*Encourage learners to set goals and aims and have a vision for where they want to
go / what they want to be.

*Tell learners in advance what your expectations are and set them high.

*Plan a session to explain rights, duties and responsibilities of the learners in the
class. Explain their right to free, quality, public education but also their responsibility
as learners to learn. Explain other rights like privacy, clean water, shelter etc.

*Individual attention to slower learners to make sure they are not left behind but
learning still continues in the rest of the class.

*Don't say outright that an answer is wrong as it might discourage sensitive learners.
Rather ask probing questions so that learners can see for themselves where their
thinking is illogical or incorrect. In other words work with learners towards a correct
answer or understanding.

===G. Enlivening your presentation style===
*Do little demonstrations throughout a lesson. (Bite-sized chunks!)

*Use color to highlight important issues/facts and to make associations.

*Use teaching media e.g. flip charts etc. as it enhances the teaching atmosphere and
makes learning more meaningful.

*Using the media (magazines, newspapers, radio, TV etc.) in class wherever possible.

===H. Games===
*Games play a role in learning even if the learning is not conscious.

*Play games to illustrate principles e.g. Monopoly in EMS.

*Play mathematical and number games to do remedial work and assist with
terminology.

===I. Groups work; working in groups===
*Let class work in groups or pairs and encourage team work. (Make sure they work
as a group and not just as individuals sitting together in a group.)

*Let groups set their own rules to make the group work effectively

*Encourage learner flexibility by assigning tasks within a group and then rotating
these tasks. Make tags with responsibilities written on them.

*Composition of learner groups should be varied.

*Group work (cooperative learning; whole group participation) encourages learners to
share knowledge.

===J. Language issues and development===
*Impact of language on the teaching of science and mathematics; always point out
the differences between the formal, colloquial and mathematical/scientific meanings
of words and phrases e.g. &quot;at least&quot; which, to some learners, means &quot;the least&quot; or
&quot;the minimum.&quot;

*Because of the language we use, some concepts can be misinterpreted.

*Write poetry and short passages on scientific or mathematical ideas to assess what
a learner understands by them and to develop their ability to express themselves.

*Do sessions of reading aloud.

*Use the language of the subject and of the examinations so that learners can
understand terminology and the particular form of language usage from the onset.

===K. Links and continuity in science and mathematics teaching===
*Before you teach something find out what learners already know. (This is the
concept behind constructivist teaching.) Brainstorming can be useful.

*Link work being done currently with work done previously to make links and ensure
continuity.

*Relate subject matter to real life experiences.

*Make science a living subject, relevant to real life situations. Take relevant examples
from learners' experience e.g. applications of gas behaviour in car tires and
combustion engines etc. Science becomes meaningful because it is linked to the
world beyond the classroom walls.

*Use the school's local environment and community as much as possible in your
teaching.

*Rational debate on important scientific and technological issues. (Make sure that
debaters research their topics beforehand. Great outpourings of passion based on
incorrect facts and poor assumptions are counter-productive to science and
technology education.)

*Integrate learning areas through events and/or joint investigations and surveys e.g.
arts, culture and technology through investigation of local technologies (A&amp;C and
Technology) or survey to determine how cell phones have influenced local social and
business practices (SS, EMS &amp; Technology).

*Spend time regularly on keeping up with current events that relate to science,
mathematics, engineering and technology.

*Relate any particular section of the work to its applications in commerce, industry
and further education.

===L. Motivating learners===
*Motivational talks from successful former students.

*Offer small prizes and incentives from time to time for a significant piece of work or
improvement e.g. a pen to a learner who does not have one. (Do not overdo this
kind of incentive otherwise it loses its value and significance.)

*Encourage learners to ask the question &quot;how?&quot; (how does it work?) and encourage
them to read books on &quot;how it works&quot; as many scientific applications are found in
them. In general encourage them to find answers themselves.

*Find or devise activities that involve all learners.

*During class allow time for Independent learning

*Publicly or privately appreciate and acknowledge good work done by learners.

*Point out that science and mathematics underpin the world's technological advance.

*Demonstration of mathematical content by real life examples.

*Do geometry orals where learners solve geometric problems orally. (This is also a
good assessment tool.)

*Focus on study skills by holding short but regular seminars. Start early in the year.

*Encourage inquiry by constantly asking the two critical questions: &quot;why?&quot; and
&quot;how&quot;?

*Look for books in the library on the subject &quot;How it works&quot; and discover a wide
range of scientific applications in almost every item we use in our daily lives.

*Always make an effort to find relevant, practical, everyday applications of every
concept you learn (or teach) in your science class. This way the understanding of
science and the importance of science in your life becomes real.

*Active participation by learners is essential. Ask directed questions to keep
everyone involved and focused.

*Do informal investigations which challenge learners to come up with different
solutions. (You will be surprised at how fulfilling completing even a small project is.)

*Encourage learners to do self assessment after each lesson.

*Let the learners evaluate you.

*Encourage learners to make their own mind maps, especially at the end of a section
of work.

*Provide materials and opportunity for learners to do their own research.

===M. Policies, preparation and planning===
*Draft school homework policy and include parent body to get their &quot;buy-in&quot; and
willingness to control homework.

*Establish a school academic support program based on enrichment and diagnosis.

*Prepare lessons. A well prepared lesson gives an educator direction and helps her
to work towards the outcomes of the lesson. She can spend time figuring out the
best method to use, the materials and teaching aids needed, the type of questions to
ask and generally how to get learners to where she wants them to be by the end of
the lesson.

*Always be prepared for the unforeseen.

*Always select a variety of examples to use and select according to the way a lesson
is going.

*Plan lessons to accommodate for special needs.

*Thorough planning is vital for success.

*Do long term planning (broken into weeks, days, hours).

===N. Professional relationships amongst colleagues===
*Hold educators' phase and grade meetings to discuss what educators have learnt
during their teaching recently. The strategy of class visits by educators to colleagues
also helps in that one sees problems that other educators encounter and how they
remedy them e.g. learners with disabilities and measures for coping.

*Hold phase, grade and subject meetings for strategic- and year planning.

*Team teaching helps all to move at the same pace; all know more or less what every
one is doing.

*Continuous reporting back from workshops and other in-service training helps to
keep all abreast of latest developments.

*Evaluate and reflect on one's successes, failures and ways of improving

===O. Projects in and around the school===
*We organized an HIV/Aids awareness campaign in the community by involving the
Department of Education, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and an
international funding scheme. We exchanged views about getting across the
message of HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. The community was sensitized to
the scourge of HIV/AIDS by children placing cards with their writings on the school
walls and other places where the community usually congregates. People in the
community started talking and advising others on the epidemic. An HIV/AIDS centre
has been established as a result.

*Train learners to collect and obtain equipment and items (often thrown away) that
can be used in the science, mathematics and technology classroom.

*Give your learners projects to work on. They will use scientific principles, at times
even without knowing it. You then have a chance of highlighting the principles when
you assess their projects or when they explain them. A project like building a model
of a house with an electrical light system lets learners discover how, in practice,
bulbs are connected in a house.

*Allow a reasonable time frame to complete a project. Children deduce real-life
situations from doing things themselves and making informed judgments.

*Calculate the cost of materials and labour for paving the school courtyard. Sketch
the area to be paved, choose the tiles, their color and suitable texture/finish of the
material. Do calculations.

===P. Respect for others===
*Encourage punctuality as a mark of respect for educators and others learners.
*Explain the importance of respecting the rights of others, just as every individual
would like their rights to be respected.
*Respect the rights of each other and their property.
*Establish a classroom code of conduct with regard to mutual respect.
*Learners should feel free to participate in lessons in the knowledge that they won't
be ridiculed.
*Respect each other's language.

==Ideas for investigations==
Ideally learners should choose their own questions because a true investigation will
follow a topic that is of interest to and stimulates the imagination of the investigator. In
reality the educator may have to prompt learners or even assign questions. One hopes
that by doing investigations learners will start developing a more critical eye for their
own questions.

At the MSTotY workshop in March 2004, the participants were asked to brainstorm ideas
for investigations and then to classify them according to a classification scheme. The
purpose of the exercise was to gain a better understanding of what one might expect
from investigations on these topics. The process of classifying ideas for investigations
also gave the participants the opportunity to imagine the directions these ideas might
take a learner and the potential pitfalls and complexities hidden in the topics. One can
never determine these exactly because by the very nature of an investigation that we
cannot, nor should not, be precise about the end point. However, if an investigation
activity is to be well managed, educators had better try to gain some insight into the
possibilities presented by a topic for investigation before agreeing to it. Obviously one's
knowledge of particular learners must be taken into account.

===A classification scheme for investigation topics===

===Classifying science and mathematics investigations===
Imagine learners are asked to come up with questions for their own investigations. You
collect the questions in the class and the list looks like the example below. By
classifying the ideas you can determine whether they are appropriate for the age and
phase of the learners. For the purposes of managing the investigation you can
determine what resources the learners will need and what sort of inputs you may have to
make. The final judgment you must make &amp;Acirc &amp;shy  and the analysis should help you make it -
is whether the topic is feasible. To classify an intended investigation accurately you
must discuss it with the learner. A discussion will help you to advise the learner if
his/her intentions seem too ambitious and together you can agree on appropriate
modifications or a complete re-think. This negotiation places you, the educator, in a
much stronger position to monitor the investigation's progress.

As an exercise try to classify some of the topics suggested here. Most of the topics are
appropriate to more than one phase but this will depend on the conceptual level at
which learners attack the problems and analyse their results.

==Managing and assessing investigations==
''This chapter is based on work by Maryna de Lange, a primary school science educator
from Saldanha Bay and the 2002 Maths and Science Educator of the Year. She is
passionate about investigations and was the prime mover behind making &quot;investigations&quot;
the theme of this year's MSTotY workshop.''

===A suggested procedure for managing a scientific or mathematical investigation for school or &quot;Expo&quot; purposes===
In order to get the most out of learner investigations the process must be managed
carefully. It is important to ensure that the learners (and sometimes their parents too) are
well-informed about the process and exactly what is expected of them. The following
points will be useful for planning your investigations.

1. Clearly state: &quot;This investigation will be for ... e.g. final year assessment / regional
competition etc. and will count 50% towards the year mark in science / may,
thereafter, be submitted for the national competition etc. ... .&quot;

2. Clearly state and publicise timelines and deadlines.

3. Within the first week of the announcement, the CRITERIA (see the assessment pro
forma below) must be fully discussed with participants / learners by organizers /
educators.

4. The learner's choice of the topic is the most important part. These must be finalized
within a week of the announcement.

5. Educator reviews possible topics with each learner and tests the topic against the
criteria provided for the investigation. Get clarification of and agreement on the
&quot;focus question.&quot;

6. Learners must start work on the literature review / research immediately and get as
much outside help as possible on this preliminary stage of the investigation.

7. Within one month of the announcement (or less, depending on overall timeline and
deadlines), the educator must review each learner's topic, focus question(s),
hypotheses, plans and &quot;research design&quot; in a one-to-one interview with the learner.

8. The investigation report must be handed in within the agreed period. On the
deadline for the investigation, all reports must be handed in regardless of their state
of readiness. (No extensions can be allowed without seriously disrupting the year
programme, so careful monitoring of progress by the educator is essential.)

Doing independent assignments / projects / investigations develop extremely important
attitudes, life skills and scientific and mathematical skills e.g. time management  self
discipline  perseverance  careful, thoughtful and insightful work  reflection  accuracy etc.
''These skills and attitudes will all be assessed at the end of the senior phase.''

''In order that learners realize the importance of meeting deadlines etc., they can be made to sign a &quot;contract&quot;''

Declaration: I understand and agree to abide by all conditions and

deadlines as explained to me by: __________________________________

Learner's signature: __________________________________

Dated: 			 			 ____/____/200____

Parent's signature:		 __________________________________

Dated:				 		 ____/____/200____

Publication of notice and criteria: Dated: ____/____/200____

Educator's signature: 	 	 __________________________________

Dated: 			 ____/____/200____

Obviously investigations take a lot of time to set up. Therefore the management of the
process must be meticulous and starting on time and keeping to your schedules is
critical. Each learner must be allocated time for discussion and consultation if
investigations are to serve their educational purpose. It is possible to manage up to 35
learners. For classes larger than this it may be advisable to work in pairs. The problem
with doing investigations is that the experience we want the learners to have is really a
private one and it is most powerful when it is a personal learning experience. When
learners are in pairs there is no guarantee that each will get the full benefit of their
experience. It becomes important to choose well-balanced pairs in which both
individuals will contribute equally and communicate well, so that they learn from each
other.

===Tips on assessing investigations.===
When all is said and done, the amount of effort put into an investigation by educators
and learners is considerable and therefore deserves meticulously thought out and
planned assessment. Investigations provide a wonderful platform to assess scientific
and mathematical thinking in action. But it also means that the assessment must be
continuous in order to extract the most value possible from the process.
Assessment can take on different forms, depending on the situation at a particular time.
Here are some ideas.

*'''Self-assessment.''' Learners assess themselves. This method works well when you
discuss class work or homework, especially when moving to the next topic. It helps
you to recap on work done, provides a basis for moving ahead, saves time and
provides immediate feedback. Its drawbacks include not getting to see individual
learners' problems. Learners tend to mark themselves correct even when they are
not. Sometimes they mark an answer correct when the steps leading to the answer
are not.

*'''Peer assessment.''' Like self-assessment but here learners assess each other.
Possibly members of a group assess other members. The method poses the
problem of learners giving in to peer pressure and awarding marks for incorrect
answers. Control is essential when peer assessing and learners' books must be
checked for the accuracy and honesty. It becomes easier when a class gets used to
the method and sees the value of accurate assessment.

*'''Rubrics.''' work well and if well designed they are one of the best tools for assessing
learners. Rubrics are particularly useful when learners present the findings from their
investigations. Key items to be assessed are listed clearly with their rubrics
alongside them and learners' strengths and weaknesses can be &quot;pegged&quot; at a
glance.

*'''Educator assessment.''' is the most common form because it is the most important.
In order to assess individual strengths and weaknesses there is no substitute for the
educator reviewing and marking each learner's work. The purpose must be not only
to allocate a mark but to find the basis for remedial work where it is needed. The
other forms of assessment add value, but only if they add to the educator's own
review of learner's written work. It may be time consuming but it gets you to know
your learners. At least half of a learner's homework and class work must be
assessed by the educator. Formal tests must be marked by the educator and ideally
even informal tests must at least be reviewed.

===Assessing presentations and products===
There are certain standard types of assessment instrument but apart from the general
type, instruments are seldom &quot;one size fits all&quot;. So we usually construct instruments for
specific activities. An instrument like the one below might be used when individual
learners or groups are presenting their &quot;research&quot; findings on a task assigned to them.
This example would be used when they are explaining the idea of &quot;systems&quot; in the
context of the human body. Assigning a &quot;maximum possible&quot; mark for each item
provides the educator with a benchmark or standard by which to judge performance on
that item. An important principle of assessment is to ensure that learners know well
beforehand, exactly what the criteria are against which they are being judged. When
learners know this they begin to develop their own &quot;internal&quot; standards.

A similar instrument might be used to assess a model that has been constructed. In this
case the model is of the lungs inside the thorax. It shows how, by using the diaphragm
to increase the volume of the thorax the lungs can be inflated and deflated. This model
could be made from a two litre cold drink bottle, a balloon, a plastic drinking straw and a
cork with a hole bored in it. In this activity, the learners would have been given clear
instructions to follow.

The score on an instrument like this can be related to an overall, 5-point scale e.g.
excellent (5/5)  good (4/5)  satisfactory (3/5)  unsatisfactory (2/5)  poor (0-1/5).

The words used to describe the different levels are a matter of choice. If, for instance, it
is a 5-point scale, the five words or phrases used must describe a logical sequence of
performance levels, communicate to learners how their educator will judge their
performance and must indicate to learners where they have performed well or poorly on
the task. With the assessment instrument in front of them the educator and learner can
decide how to remedy shortcomings and build on strengths.

===Rubrics===
Rubrics use words to describe successive levels of performance. They are useful
assessment tools but they are of no value unless they are carefully constructed and then
used with fairness, insight and care. It doesn't matter how good a rubric is, if the
educator does not use the rubric consistently appropriately learners will have no
confidence in the method or the instrument. When learners lack confidence in an
educator's judgments (about their performance) they miss the learning opportunity that
good assessment practice can provide. The assessment of an investigation can teach
almost as much about the process of investigation as the activity itself.

Here are some rubrics. In the first example we have a rubric to assess designs in a
technology class. The second the rubric is for assessing actual design drawings. The
third rubric is related to RNCS Learning Outcomes (LOs) and Assessment Standards
(ASs) for the Natural Sciences.

Any good rubric can be adapted or used as a template to produce others. The revised
national curriculum statements (RNCS), scheduled for implementation in 2007, call for
assessment of four level of performance in the GET band. Therefore particular tasks and
activities can be assessed by designing rubrics from the learning outcomes and
assessment standards appropriate to the task.
In these examples (adapted from All Aboard Science 7 by Heinemann Publishers)
various learning tasks are covered. The first example involves an investigation into the
causes of corrosion in metals.

The investigation of sensitive issues can lead to debate that involves prejudices and
emotion. In science it is important to recognize and keep these distractions in check.
That is why scientists try &amp;Acirc &amp;shy  not always successfully &amp;Acirc &amp;shy  to take account of how we
accumulate knowledge and the peculiar role that personal feelings and prevailing ideas
play in attempting to understand the world we live in. The third learning outcome (LO3)
in the Natural Sciences deals with this issue and is notoriously difficult to assess.
Rubrics can help when we discuss issues that bring out emotion and contradiction. But
we should not allow difficulties like this to put us off because dealing with topics that call
for the interpretation of historical evidence and differing points of view are important to
our development as scientifically literate people. The rubrics for the Natural Sciences
LO3 AS1 can be adapted, for instance, to issues of gold mining and processing of gold
ore, the development of dynamite and the effect that refrigeration has had on the
international trade of agricultural products.

===Strategies: your own assessment policy===
Maryna de Lange has set her assessment policy so that several assessable aspects of
her learners' work count towards the final mark for the year. She writes: &quot;I balance five
forms of assessment so that every learner's preference can be accommodated. I use
the assessments to build up learners' portfolios which I keep in my Master file. I
regularly record the outcomes of my observations on a formative record sheet. Learners
are allowed to choose the work they want to keep in their portfolios for promotion
purposes. Assessments consist of educator-, peer- and self- assessments. The forms of
assessment I use are:

(a) Four tests and two examinations. The tests count 30 marks each and the examinations are set for between 100 and 150 marks. The totals for the tests and the examinations are then converted to 60 marks each. [Total 60 + 60]

(b) Eight class- or homework activities count 15 marks each. 120 marks are converted
to 45. [Total 45]

(c) Two projects of 40 and 35 marks respectively. [Total 40 + 35]

(d) Two assignments of 30 mark each. [Total 60]

(e) Two investigations of 30 mark each. [Total 60]

The total mark for Science for the year is 360. The pie-chart below gives us a picture of
this policy. Remember that there is also a portfolio and a formative record that can be
used when the learner's performance for the year is assessed. OBE calls for continuous
assessment to ascertain a learner's development. Does this policy meet these
requirements?

You will agree that this assessment policy gives a very comprehensive picture indeed.
The pie chart also shows that investigations and projects (both involve learners working
independently on problems of their own choice) make up more than a third of the total
mark.
